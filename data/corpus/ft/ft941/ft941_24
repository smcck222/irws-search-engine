FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: The Falstaff of suburbia - The revival of the English
National Opera production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two portraits of Falstaff the man. In Shakespeare he is an old
knave, who has fallen upon hard times and revels in comic rough-and-tumble.
In Verdi he inhabits the same milieu, but the heart has grown warmer, the
comedy has softened; Falstaff has acquired a nobility of spirit.
The production of Falstaff that David Pountney mounted for English National
Opera always had the rumbustious rogue in mind. It even looks vulgar -
intentionally, one assumes. Falstaff has landed in present-day suburbia,
where the middle-class flaunt what wealth they have.
A row of terraced houses frames the set, every front door, every chimney-pot
the same. The fair ladies of Windsor dress in off-the-peg, black-and-white
Cecil Beaton imitations. At the end everybody goes to a party at Herne's
disco.
Although the brashness of this picture will not have been to all tastes, it
was at least all of a piece when the production was new in 1989 and it still
is now. Several of the key players have returned for this revival and there
is also a conductor who has similar ideas about the opera.
Andrew Litton wants Verdi's score to be red-blooded, with rhythmic strings,
forward wind, blazing brass. If that sounds as though it could mean loud, it
does, to the detriment of the words, but his vigour and decisiveness are
welcome.
The tone of the evening is mellowed somewhat by Benjamin Luxon's Falstaff,
who looks beyond the obvious comic opportunities. As he sits rueful and
bedraggled after his ducking in the Thames, he cuts a sadder figure than
usual. His big monologue at that point is not very incisive. It is
surprising how much real singing and voice this role demands - rather more
than Luxon can summon.
The strongest couple are the Fords. Janice Cairns looks a picture of
bourgeois chic and is vocally well in command, with plenty of voice to
spare. Alan Opie cannot claim that, but his jealous husband in striped suit
and shades is well sung and knows better than anybody else on stage how to
deliver English words.
The others include Yvonne Howard's playful Meg and Anne Collins as a
businesslike Quickly. Timothy Robinson sings Fenton nicely with
well-mannered English tone; Sarah Pring's shining soprano is too substantial
for Nannetta's light-as-thistledown music. Alexandre Naoumenko makes a
strong Dr Caius.
As the final fugue drew to a close amid much bustle on stage and uproar from
the brass in the orchestra, I dreamed of a Falstaff that aspired to Verdi's
nobility of spirit, warming the heart like Sir John's glass of mulled wine,
a subtle, wise, detailed, nimble, sparkling Falstaff.
That will have to wait for another day. And, I fear, another production.
Revival sponsored by Woolwich Building Society. Performances continue until
March 29 (with some changes of cast)

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Nijinsky's last work recreated - Clement Crisp reviews
'Tyl Eulenspiegel' as part of the Paris Opera season of tribute to 'a
genius'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vaslav Nijinsky made four ballets for Diaghilev's company. Of these, his
first, L'Apres-midi d'un faune of 1912, has survived through direct
transmission from dancer to dancer. The others - Jeux and Le Sacre du
printemps of 1913, and Tyl Eulenspiegel of 1916 - each lasted a season, and
were then dropped from the Ballet Russe repertory. Nijinsky's break with
Diaghilev, following his marriage in 1913, and his descent into madness in
1918, inhibited revivals.
Nijinsky's genius as a dancer is unquestioned, and speaks to us even through
the thin evidence of roles he created, and photographs which so hold the
gaze and astonish the eye. His choreographic reputation is more vexed. Faune
is a work of rare originality, the first innovative dance-making of our
century, with movement flattened and given a thrilling two-dimensional
power. Jeux, and especially Sacre, were no less bold in theme (the sub-text
of Jeux was homosexual flirtation - and this in 1913) and in choreographic
realisation (Sacre's dance insisting upon a weightiness and rhythmic
virtuosity far beyond contemporary imagining).
Sympathetic observers, when these pieces were new, convey something of the
force of Nijinsky's vision. Marie Rambert, who worked with him on the
preparation of Sacre (the young and inexperienced Nijinsky was dealing with
the most taxing and complex ballet score yet written) told me quite simply
that 'he was a genius'. These three works were made while Nijinsky was still
sheltered by Diaghilev's protective love: in them the impresario saw that
novelty which he so valued and so urged upon his artists.
But in 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky, was summarily dismissed from
the Ballet Russe, and went into the wilderness. After the outbreak of war in
1914, Diaghilev had to re-establish his troupe, and American tours were a
means of survival. His American impresario insisted that Nijinsky be part of
the ensemble. Released from internment, Nijinsky, his wife and child,
arrived in New York, his terms for returning being that he should have
command of the Ballet Russe and would make a new work. Diaghilev went back
to Europe, and Nijinsky - by now showing signs of mental unease - took
charge.
His creation was to be a long-contemplated realisation of Strauss's Tyl
Eulenspiegel. The work's genesis was difficult, as we learn from the
writings of Robert Edmond Jones, a brilliant young American designer who was
entrusted with sets and costumes. After delays (Nijinsky was injured) and
stormy scenes, Tyl was seen at the Manhattan Opera House in October 1916. It
was well received, though Lydia Sokolova, who was in the cast, said that the
final moments were improvised by the dancers during the premiere. (Nijinsky
in his memoirs noted that it was 'taken out of the oven too soon').
Tyl was, nonetheless, a success, a brilliantly grotesque picture of the
mediaeval German prankster and the world he held to anarchic ransome. Robert
Edmond Jones peopled the stage with fantasticated townspeople, and through
the hurly-burly Nijinsky as Tyl raced and capered and caused mayhem. But
after three New York showings, and a further 20 on the Ballet Russe's
American tour, Tyl was never seen again.
Now the Paris Opera ballet has brought a Tyl back to the stage, in a
Nijinsky tribute that includes Petrushka, his greatest role, and that
evocation of his Sacre which was the fruit of years of research by Millicent
Hodson and Kenneth Archer. I have reported on this re-creation previously.
Based upon the notes that Marie Rambert made when working on the original
staging with Nijinsky, it is rather like those period rooms in museum where
all the furniture and artefacts are right, but the place has no sense of
being lived in. Even so, the Hodson/Archer Sacre can be seen as a guide to
what Nijinsky could have created, albeit style, ways of dancing and ways of
teaching, have radically altered performers' skills since 1913, and it looks
quaint rather than convincing.
If Sacre can be seen as something 'like', what can be said of Tyl, which
Hodson and Archer have now evoked through their researches. There are no
real indications of text, save written descriptions and the memory of one
last survivor (aged 95) of the premiere. There are, happily, records of
Robert Edmond Jones' dazzling designs, and these have been given convincing
life at the Opera.
But, summoned from the mists of time, what do we see of Tyl? Nothing of much
consequence. There are crazily leaning buildings; expressionistically
grotesque characters (ladies wearing hennins that double their height); a
mad bustle of townsfolk through which Tyl tears like a whirlwind - and
Patrick Dupond does a great deal to galvanise the role. But the dance is
fuss, unfocussed, curiously blank. The air is heavy with formaldehyde. This
is grave-robbery rather than restoration.
Ironically, the problems of bringing the old ballets to life was highlighted
by the Opera's view of Petrushka. The text is that copy of Fokine's creation
mounted by Bronislava Nijinska (Nijinsky's sister) for the de Cuevas Ballet
in 1950. It looks markedly inferior in many respcts to the versions provided
by Serge Grigoriev (who was Diaghilev's regisseur for 20 years) and detail
is muddled, incident traduced. The central interpretations are, as a result,
less compelling than they should be, and as Diaghilev artists - Markova,
Danilova, Dolin, Massine - marvellously showed them to us after the war.
Like the rest of the programme, it seems more impression than fact.
Musically, the evening was tremendous, with superlative playing by the Opera
orchestra under Myung-Whun Chung. Sonorities, rhythms, were brilliant; tempi
were those of the concert-hall. In Petrushka this made a few heels busy -
reminiscent of Beecham whisking a ballet along and observing 'That kept the
buggers on the hop]'. The programme book for this evening - as always at the
Opera - is exemplary: very handsome, very informative.
The Nijinsky programme can be see at the Opera Garnier on February
14,16,17,19,22,23, 25,26,28.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: British music and Mahler - Orchestras in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Levine's three Festival Hall concerts with the Philharmonia - his
first encounter with a London orchestra for nearly two decades - are proving
a big draw: for the second, Mahler's Third Symphony on Wednesday, the queues
for returns were not much less than Karajan-length.
Any account of this longest of Mahler symphonies is always an event: in no
other did Mahler more ambitiously or more abundantly argue his conviction
that a symphony should amount to a 'whole world'. Levine's credentials as a
Mahlerian, solid enough, are backed up by his substantial experience in
Wagner - a conductor who has found ways of sustaining all of The Ring (as
this conductor has in his New York Met home) is unlikely to suffer
uncertainties in mounting this vast edifice or in tracing its
Wagner-inspired progression from earthly depths to spiritual heights.
Levine's authority was, indeed, never in doubt. He understands how the
work's two mighty outer movements and its four picturesque inner ones hang
together; he commands their individual sound-worlds and dramatic canvas. His
insistence on seating the orchestra traditionally (violins opposite each
other, not all bunched together) immeasurably clarifies the sense and blend
of the scoring; traditional too, although perhaps less justified, was the
interpolation of an interval after the first movement.
Yet in spite of its many strengths, this Mahler Three exposed a gap between
promise and fulfilment that grew ever wider as the evening passed. The
Philharmonia seemed not yet entirely at home with the conductor's beat - the
very slow tempo for the finale found the strings not radiant but somewhat
heavy-footed in movement from note to note. More to the point, I could
detect in the reading little in the way of spiritual energy. The mighty
adventure of a Mahler symphony is dulled when its intensities of emotional
expression - lamentation, yearning, meditative rapture - are left
unfathomed.
There was, however, one vividly emotion-inspiring aspect to the performance:
the singing of its alto soloist, Christa Ludwig. This was her final London
concert, after nearly four decades of regular appearance here; in the
Nietzsche setting her calm, generous, easy flow of tone and her unforced
responsiveness to atmosphere and colour touched Mahlerian depths otherwise
absent from the whole experience.
In the same hall the following evening, a BBC Symphony Orchestra concert of
English music struck a vivid contrast. Under Andrew Davis the BBC orchestra
is now an exciting virtuoso band, and the elements of dash, vivacity and
risk-taking in both Tippett's Piano Concerto (Peter Donohoe the fluent, not
always poetic soloist) and Walton's Belshazzar's Feast unfairly highlighted
the earthbound character of Levine's Mahler.
The London premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage's Momentum (1991), a brilliantly
blues-coloured orchestral showpiece written for the opening of the
Birmingham Symphony Hall, set off the evening's exhilaration.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Gardening: April flowers - in February / How spring can make
an early arrival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among this week's snow drifts, spring seemed to retreat several months. To
bring it forward, you need the advice which I most value in February. Go
into the garden, cut branches off spring-flowering shrubs which are showing
the slightest trace of their buds, and give them five to seven days in water
in a warm house.
By the next weekend, they will be in full flower, an accelerated view of
April. I spent this week looking onto snow over windowsills of yellow
forsythia, cherry blossom and flowering currant two months before their
time.
These familiar shrubs are the best for pre-cutting, but they tend to be
dismissed nowadays by keen gardeners who see them used conventionally
everywhere else. Forsythia is the least popular; its yellow flowers are
regarded too strong and, most often, it is planted by non-gardeners who
cannot think of anything else on the front fence.
I have learned, however, to crave it as a cut flower - the brighter, the
better. The usual spectablis form responds wonderfully to pre-cutting; and
if you strip the branches now, you save them from the birds later. If the
usual yellow of spectablis is too golden for your taste, look for Spring
Glory or the lemon-yellow Densiflora instead. Outdoors, I would only bother
with one other possibility: suspensa atrocaulis.
Indeed, if the strongest forms will open so early indoors, I see little
point in wasting space on less usual varieties just because they will flower
a few weeks earlier than the others if left outdoors.
Cherry blossom is more straightforward. Nobody can have missed the
white-flowered winter cherry because it has been showing such clouds of
flower since November. The white form, Prunus subhirtella autumnalis, is the
essential choice because it flowers earlier and longer than the pink
variety. This winter cherry will open of its own accord outdoors and remains
my first choice as a tree for gardeners. But there are two moderately early
varieties which are just emerging from bud and respond beautifully to early
cutting. Both were bred by the former king of cherry blossom, Collingwood
Ingram, but neither has yet been as popular as its merits deserve.
Prunus Okame is earlier and more widely available in the trade: its pale
pink flowers appear on a slight, easily housed tree but have a tendency to
vanish when the birds first see them. Prunus Kursar is, therefore, my
favourite, although it is a deeper and sharper shade of pink. In March, the
colour is enlivening in the garden, but it is even better if you pick
branches which are in bud and work magic on them now with the help of
central heating.
These two small trees are completely hardy. I would rate them very highly in
any orchard or setting against darker evergreens where they outclass the
later sugar-pink varieties, which upset civilised taste.
Pre-cutting is at its most exciting with the familiar old ribes. Right now,
its stems are almost bare, showing only the slightest green buds of future
growth. Yet, within a week, they will open indoors into hanging currant
flowers of red and white which we associate with mid-April.
Unlike golden forsythia, ribes has not been coarsened by poor placing and
repetition in every boundary hedge. It grows surprisingly well in difficult
shade under tall trees and is almost indestructible. Despite its
familiarity, I would always put it in my personal top 10. The family has a
wider variety than many gardeners realise but the best is still the deep
crimson King Edward VII, which flowers willingly if brought indoors at the
first signs of life.
Like all the coloured forms of ribes Sanguineum, it responds well to hard
pruning of the flowering stems. If you cut them now, before they open, you
are still cutting them correctly.
I never believed that flowering currants could be forced in time for
Valentine's day until I read this advice in a casual piece by Vita
Sackville-West. Spring now comes early in academic Oxfordshire, with a
further bonus for the far-sighted.
When you come to turn the ribes out of its water, you might well find that
some of its stems have sprouted white roots. If you save these branches and
use light soil to grow them on, they will probably root and grow away
freely. Multiply while you accelerate and be thankful that there is a kinder
streak to nature than sudden frosts and snow drifts.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Outdoors: When Shame comes before Death - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WHITEHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a straight choice: there were two ways down, the Wall of Death or the
Chair of Shame. I will just have to learn to live with the shame.
Everyone wants to ski the wall, a treacherously steep black run in the Swiss
section of the Portes du Soleil circuit. And if I had been staying at
Champery for more than a long weekend I might well have given it a go.
But from the comfort of the Chair of Shame you can cultivate a superior air
as you gaze down at the reckless adventurers bouncing gracelessly from mogul
to mogul.
The Portes du Soleil offers skiers a range of challenges - from the wall,
above Les Crosets, to fun skiing in gullies, to cruising for miles from
resort to resort, to flitting unchallenged and passportless across national
borders.
It claims to be the largest international, linked skiing area in Europe,
covering 12 resorts in Switzerland and France, including Morzine, Les Gets,
Chatel, Avoriaz, with its strikingly dark wooden triangular buildings, and
Champery. There are said to be 650kms (more than 400 miles) of piste, 228
ski lifts and 650 ski instructors.
There are also piste maps that defy gravity in their determination to be
comprehensive. The maps include the estimated time of each journey to give
everyone a sporting chance of catching the last lift back to their base
resort. Penalties for becoming stranded can be high - the taxi driver will
make sure of that.
With so much to ski, is it worth going for a long weekend? Desperately keen
skiers who only come down from the mountain as the coach home is about to
leave for the airport might baulk at the idea. Anyone desperate to ski
should consider it.
Champery is close enough to Geneva airport - 1 1/2 hours - to make light of
the travelling and there are small, specialist ski travel companies who will
use scheduled flights to suit your timetable. Leave the office a little
early on Thursday, ski Friday, Saturday and Sunday and be back at work on
Monday. It can be done.
Surprisingly, we didn't spend all three days queuing to get up and down
mountains: there are so many lifts and so much to ski that the only minor
hurdle is the Champery telecabin (it carries 125 people plus a driver, and
takes four minutes to reach the top). But even here the weekend queues only
become serious if you dally over breakfast.
On Saturday and Sunday our guides found us sparsely populated slopes to ski.
Especially worthwhile was a 2 1/2 -hour session with Jimmy Thomson, Canadian
diamond dealer turned ski instructor based at Planachaux, who combined
touring the resorts with some excellent tuition. At SFr140 (Pounds 65) for
up to five people, it was excellent value.
Over the three days, we made the most of an intermediates' paradise around
Planachaux, Les Crosets, Avoriaz, venturing as far Les Lindarets. There are
wide, fast and exciting blue and red runs everywhere, perfect for improving
technique and looking good.
Getting back to the Swiss side has been made tremendously easier with the
addition of the Avoriaz bypass - a long chair lift between Les Brochaux and
Pointe de Mossette, new for 1994.
At 1,055 metres, Champery cannot guarantee permanent snow in the village,
but there is a long run down a winding road when the snow is good, to the
neighbouring village of Grand Paradis.
The old village of Champery itself is far easier to navigate than the slopes
above: it has one main street surrounded by chalets, arranged as if a flock
of cuckoo clocks had alighted randomly in the valley bottom.
The four-star Hotel de Champery, with 70 rooms, is in the centre. The dining
room is very white linen, but informal enough for skiers, while the Le Mazot
restaurant on the ground floor tempted us to sample fondues featuring fish,
horse and ostrich. It also has a piano bar and sauna.
Be sure to find your way to the sports centre offering swimming, ice skating
and curling. And for a healthy evening out, Val d'Illiez is a 10-minute
drive. Here there is an outdoor pool warmed to 30`C by natural means, and
full of minerals to ease you back into work on Monday.
Peter Whitehead travelled with Ski La Vie, 28 Linver Road, London SW6 3RB,
tel: 071-736 5611, staying at the Hotel de Champery, with return flights to
Geneva with Swissair. Ski La Vie also offers accommodation at Hotel National
and three chalets (catered) at Champery, plus holidays in Zermatt and
Meribel, as well as tailor-made flexible breaks.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Fishing: Expert? You must be joking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word has a fine, satisfying resonance to it: 'He's something of an
expert on . . .' or 'She's the leading expert in her field . . .' Yes, it
must be a grand thing to be acknowledged as an expert. But how do you set
about it?
It cannot be done by self-proclamation. To introduce your contribution by
saying: 'Actually, I'm a bit of an expert on . . .' is to invite derision. I
know, because I have tried it. No, it must be done by the acclamation of
others.
You must infiltrate their collective consciousness, blind them with your
science, seize every opportunity to impress upon them that you know
infinitely more than they ever thought possible. You also need unshakable
self-belief and enough arrogance to silence the doubters. A modicum of
expertise helps, too.
When considering my own qualifications to join the vast congregation of
experts on angling, I must be clear-headed. I have never had an original
thought about the techniques of the sport in the 30-odd years I have been at
it. I depend now, and always will, on the efforts of others.
I should like to think that I am quick-witted enough to have developed the
habit of passing off the bright ideas of others as my own, with a fair
chance of getting away with it. But the fatal flaw, for me, is self-belief.
Sooner or later, the would-be expert has to put himself to the test and
expose his expertise to public scrutiny. Having now done this, I have
decided to return to the ranks.
It happened when I was inveigled into joining a panel of experts summoned to
field questions from the Berkshire branch of the Salmon and Trout
Association at their annual meeting in January. With me on the platform were
two undoubted specimens of the true expert breed: Neil Patterson, a
brilliant chalk stream fisher and outstanding fly dresser; and John
Maitland, a member of the British fly fishing team and a renowned extractor
of monster trout from Rutland Water.
The first question concerned barb-less hooks, and I made an ass of myself by
regurgitating some theory I had half-read in an American magazine that
morning. Then, a lady asked if the panel considered the colour of a fly line
to be matter of any importance. 'Tom,' the chairman said to me, 'any
thoughts on that one?'
Well, my own fly line was once white and is now grey and cracked with age.
What concerns me, though, is not its colour but its habit of sinking. I told
the questioner that I used whatever line I had until I could use it no more,
then bought the cheapest replacement. I could tell from her face that this
was not the expert's reply.
Someone else wondered if the panel had a particular tactic for those glaring
summer days when not a fish will rise. I suggested going home. Patterson
proposed using a bluebottle fly. I could tell which answer impressed, and it
was not mine.
So it went on. Did the panel regard a salmon fly tied on a treble hook
superior to a double? The matter had never crossed my mind. Why do so many
right-handed fly fishermen hold their rods in their left hand? I could not
even remember which hand I use. Someone asked if fish could hear. I said
they surely could - but did they dream? At least that got a laugh.
Afterwards everyone, from the chairman down, was most kind. But I know now
that I do not wish to be an expert, anyway. When you think about it, what is
the synonym for expert? Know-all, which isn't half so pleasing. No, let me
be an anonymous, amateurish mediocrity any day.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Property: So you've got Pounds 100,000 to spend on a home .
. . : A modest cottage is your best bet in the home counties. But the same
money can buy you rather more in the provinces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What can you buy for around Pounds 100,000? In the home counties, the answer
is 'not much'. Mid-Wales was equally snappy: 'Half the county,' said agent
Morris Marshall &amp; Poole. A pause. 'That is a slight exaggeration. But it is
the top end of the market here.' Not so in Scotland, but it has to be good
value when a farmhouse in Angus with outbuildings, paddock and 17 acres
awaits offers of more than Pounds 75,000.
For a home of character in southern England at Pounds 100,000 or less,
cottages are the best bet. Tony Mullucks (of Mullucks Wells) says Pounds
70,000-Pounds 80,000 in east Hertfordshire and Essex buys one that is
habitable but needs modernising. Once cottages have been improved and
extended  - as most have  - the price moves to the Pounds 110,000-Pounds
120,000 range. His most intriguing cottage  - 7 Stoney Lane, a cobbled
street in the middle of the medieval town of Thaxted  - costs just Pounds
60,000.
The choice is harder in Sussex and Surrey but Victorian and Edwardian
terrace cottages are a possibility. Fox offers two in Cuckfield, near
Haywards Heath, at Pounds 89,950 or Pounds 110,000. Older cottages are too
pricey, though. An alternative is a detached three-bedroom new or nearly new
home on a housing development, as advertised in all local newspapers. But
outstanding bargains are hard to find and the prices reflect realistically
the worth of what is being offered.
A more unusual choice is a small town house (grade II) of rendered and
painted stone in Midhurst, West Sussex, which Jackson-Stops offers for
Pounds 80,000, plus Pounds 10,000 for a separate garage.
A year ago, demand for cottages in Suffolk barely existed; now, it is
picking up. Bedford, of Bury St Edmunds, offers them for Pounds 60,000
(needing work) or Pounds 80,000-Pounds 90,000 (in good condition) while
Pounds 90,000 is the price of the School House at Troston, a splendid
Victorian mini-extravaganza in polychrome brick between Bury and Thetford.
For Pounds 82,000, Hamptons is selling the three-bedroomed, thatched Ruth
Cottage (grade II) with a kitchen installed only last year. For just Pounds
54,500, Bedford offers Bridge Cottage in Walsham le Willows.
Hamptons' variation on the new or nearly-new home is a semi- detached house
in a development at Bradfield Hall at Bradfield Combust, near Bury.
Residents can use a swimming pool, gymnasium, fishing/boating lake, bowling
green and tennis court, and the grounds of the big house. This new home is
priced at Pounds 84,500 for a 124-year lease (Pounds 50 ground rent), with a
service charge for the facilities (Pounds 142.66 a month in 1993).
Sailors should consider Woodbridge, on the Suffolk coast, where flats in the
converted Granary development on the banks of the river Debden cost Pounds
79,500, and Tide Mill Cottage Pounds 100,000. The agent, Bidwells, is also
selling conversions in the White Lion, an old coaching inn at Eye, for
Pounds 85-95,000.
In the Cotswolds, agent Hurley Lloyd Thorpe reports little under Pounds
100,000. One is Yew Tree Cottage, in the beauty spot village of
Bourton-on-the-Water (where the river Windrush runs through).
It is a basic abode: stone slate roof, leaded lights, gabled dormer window
and beams match a grade II listing. But space is small: living room, kitchen
and bedroom downstairs, and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. What else do you
expect for Pounds 89,500 in the Cotswolds? Meanwhile, for a guide price of
Pounds 90,000, Lane Fox has the three-bedroom Weavers Cottage in Bibury.
Another option is to buy a flat in a converted country house. A two-bedroom,
ground floor flat in Fosseway House at Stow-on-the-Wold costs Pounds 80,000
leasehold from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe. Pay a bit more and the choice widens. A
cottage in Paxford, near Chipping Campden, is selling for Pounds 109,500
while another in Bledington, near Stow-on-the-Wold, has a price tag of
Pounds 129,000 (both from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe).
In Redlynch, on the edge of the New Forest in Wiltshire, I like the smart
diamond patterning in a brick and flint counterpoint on a semi-detached,
19th century cottage called Kestor. The price (from Woolley &amp; Wallis) is
Pounds 89,500.
In 1907, John Courage  - of the brewing family  - built Bransgore House, on
the south-western edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, as a wedding present
for his daughter. In the 1950s, it became flats. The Bell House, with a bell
to call the outside staff to meals, is attached to the main house and is for
sale on a 63-year lease (from Savills in Wimborne) for Pounds 110,000.
Palmer Snell has the semi-detached Bishops Farmhouse at Old Bradpole, near
Bridport, Dorset, for Pounds 100,000; its special feature is a detached,
one-bedroom annexe which also contains a heated swimming pool. At Christow,
on the Dartmoor side of Exeter, Pounds 105,000 buys parking for 10 cars  -
plus a smart, white-painted gate lodge/cottage (grade II) in which to live
(from Constables).
Near Salcombe, south Devon, Pounds 94,950 will get you Swallows Barn,
converted into three flats and ideal for holiday lets; while, for Pounds 500
more, there is a refreshingly unpretentious new home, erected only last year
by a local builder, at Blackawton, near Totnes (both from Stags).
East of Exeter, College House in Ottery St Mary is across the road from the
glorious church and looks a snip at Pounds 75,000 (from Redferns). Built in
1875 as an extension to the vicarage, it is now two flats, one of which is
vacant.
In Yorkshire, The Hollies in Westow, near York, stands opposite the village
post office. Once two cottages, it was converted six years ago to make a
house and now has four bedrooms, two bathrooms and two staircases (price:
Pounds 109,000). The agent is Blenkin &amp; Co, which reports little of interest
at Pounds 100,000 or less.
Keep going north for canny value, though. Savills' Brechin office in
Scotland is selling two small farmhouses which the purchaser of Kilry Farms
in Glenisla, Angus  - a beautiful glen, 24 miles from Dundee and 28 from
Perth  - does not need. Loanhead of Kilry Farmhouse awaits offers over
Pounds 65,000 and Dalwhirr Farmhouse over Pounds 75,000; it has 17 acres and
fishing rights on the river Isla.
On the Newmiln estate, Guildtown, Perthshire, surplus houses and cottages
are for sale in a Pounds 40,000-Pounds 90,000 range. They need work. But
Mill House, with inscriptions on the walls dating from 1652, 1777 and 1883,
and 1.5 acres, looks enticing. Offers of more than Pounds 50,000 are
invited.
Then there is Wales. The Newtown office of Morris Marshall &amp; Poole is
selling a cottage needing work at Llanbrynamir for Pounds 35,000, while the
Llanidloes office has a smart, 19th century (but still Georgian-style) house
in the town for Pounds 79,500.
For Pounds 40,000, the Montgomery office is offering a cottage inside one
half of the imposing arch that once served as the gate to the county jail.
It includes two bedrooms and even a garden. You pays your money and takes
your picks.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Pick up a bottle of 1822 - Jancis Robinson
tastes madeira, the world's longest living wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How very boring we all are. For 99 out of 100 drinkers, wine is either red
or white, occasionally pink, and, if stronger than average, then either
sherry or port.
But what about madeira? Here is yet another wine of world renown invented by
British merchants, and one that is truly thrilling to taste, yet it is all
but ignored by the world's wine-drinkers. In Britain, for example, the UK's
imports of madeira are barely one fortieth of its imports of port.
I was reminded of the thrill of top quality madeira the other day as I
wallowed in a wine made when Emily Bronte was four years old - a Cossart
Gordon Verdelho 1822. It was a light tawny, beautifully creamy, mellow and
probably nearing its prime but still lively enough to show off, being full
and rich without too much sugar or alcohol but with madeira's characteristic
tang. A prancing 171 year old]
They say, and I've said too, that fino sherry's the thing to get the gastric
juices flowing, but madeira does the same thing while offering the richness
of a tawny port.
The great thing about madeira of any age or quality, unlike any other wine,
is that you can open a bottle and sip at the contents for months before it
starts to deteriorate. The bottles from which I recently tasted 18 vintage
madeiras from 1971 back to 1822 had been opened nearly two months previously
and showed not a jot of decay.
Madeira has one more unique attribute in my experience. Compared with port,
brandy or liqueurs - its rivals as what are ludicrously known as 'digestifs'
 -madeira is much less likely to cause a hangover. This is a bold claim, as
madeira is almost half as strong as gin and has to be treated with caution.
But fine madeira does have a certain way of cleaning out the cerebral
rafters before the morning after.
Vintage madeira is the most expensive, and is not even released before it is
20 years old, although it will still be in its infancy then. A bottle of
vintage madeira is unlikely to cost much less than Pounds 60, but it can be
sipped over many an evening and makes a great birthday present if the year
can be matched to recipient.
Madeira has also produced historic wines made by fractional blending, so
called solera madeiras dated with the year in which the blending system or
solera was begun, typically in the 19th century. These can be very fine,
mature wines at much the same price as vintage madeiras.
Madeira was one of the first 'varietal' wines, traditionally made from a
single grape variety in the following styles: Sercial - lightest, most
delicately tangy and slowest-maturing of all; Verdelho - rather nuttier and
fuller but still quite dry; Bual - rich raisin and molasses flavours; and
Malmsey - the Malvasia grape makes the sweetest, darkest madeira.
The island's supply of these noble varieties has been so decimated by pests
and diseases that today's basic three year old madeiras (labelled 'Finest',
with blatant disregard for the English language) are made mainly from the
lesser Tinta Negra Mole vine and are labelled stylistically rather than
varietally, as in 'Dry'.
Five year old 'Reserve' blends are generally about Pounds 10, and should
contain at least 85 per cent of the noble variety specified, but better
value are Special and Extra Reserves, older blends at Pounds 13 to Pounds 20
with more cask ageing and subtlety.
Although vintage and solera madeiras are usually even better value than
these 10 and 15 year old blends, some of the best madeira buys are the
Reserva blends from Henriques &amp; Henriques which have an average age of 88
years. Because they are not dated, they are available from La Vigneronne of
London SW7, Britain's greatest cache of fine madeira, at Pounds 26.95 a
bottle.
Since Portugal joined the EU, and Symington, the port family, took control
of most of the best known madeira names, the madeira wine industry is being
licked into Euro-acceptable shape, but the wines live so long that it could
be at least a century before every bottle of madeira fits in to the neat,
new taxonomy.
Drink these wines before and after meals, or with cheese, and revel in their
durability. The 1964 and 1954 vintages are nowhere near ready.

FT  19 FEB 94 / How to Spend it: Face a clear, wrinkle-free future - Science
has transformed skin-care / A look at the latest products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH STACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a melancholy truth that sags, bags and wrinkles are natural to the
40-something face. The skin becomes thinner as we age and thus more
vulnerable. At the same time, we produce less supportive collagen and
elastin so our skin tends to become slack and droopy.
However, in the last few years extraordinary progress has been made in
understanding ageing skin. Giving in gracefully used to be the only option.
Now, says Dr Tim Cutler, consultant dermatologist at Ipswich Hospital, there
are the means to prevent and sometimes even repair the ravages of time. It
is possible to have clear, bright, healthy-looking skin in middle age.
The fundamental cause of ageing is ultra violet light. Dermatologists say
the key preventive measure is to wear sun block all the time, everywhere.
Ultra violet rays disperse into the shade, pierce through clouds and haze,
and intensify their attack when bounced off snow or water. It is also
intense under fluorescent office lights so even indoors it helps to put on
one of the new moisturisers with built-in filters.
Dermatologists recommend no less than Sun Protection Factor 15 in normal
conditions and SPF 25 or more for high risk activities such as skiing,
sailing and sunbathing. Brands such as Piz Buin and Uvistat offer good
protection. Prescription sunscreen products, available in both SPF 15 and 30
with filters, are excellent moisturisers as well as being oil and fragrance
free.
Sun damage was always thought to be irreversible, but sunscreen can help
undo the damage of the past, according to Vogue Futures, a compendium of
advice and information for the over 30s, 40s, and 50s by Deborah Hutton,
Vogue Health Editor, (Conde Nast Books Pounds 16.99).
When we expose our skin to the sun, surface cells form a protective shield
by clustering together and thus thickening the skin.
A food supplement called Imedeen is claimed to have a similar effect. Called
the 'the first internal cosmetic' by its distributors it is said to thicken
the skin without sun and increase levels of collagen and elastin. US
scientific studies, although on fairly small numbers, have shown significant
improvements in 'thickness, texture, tone and firmness'.
British dermatologists are on the whole unimpressed. They cannot see how a
concoction based on protein from fish bone and gristle, boosted by vitamin
C, calcium and zinc can possibly work on the skin.
When I tried the product there was no visible difference after the
recommended initial 90-day course (expensive at Pounds 24.95 for a month's
supply). However after persevering for another month, I noticed that my thin
dry skin was definitely thicker and less dry.
A new anti-ageing 'miracle' was unleashed recently in the form of
alpha-hydroxy (or fruit) acids, or AHAs. Lower strength AHA creams, which
remove the dead cells from the skin's surface, are available over the
counter and have been a phenomenal success. They are a joy for those who
demand instant gratification. You should see an improvement in your skin
almost immediately. Lancaster's Skin Therapy moisturiser, which doubles as a
night cream, though expensive at Pounds 39, is one of the best of such
products.
Over-the-counter creams act on the surface skin only. However, aesthetic
plastic and cosmetic surgeons use gradually increasing concentrations of
fruit acids as peels which can have a significant effect on lines, wrinkles
and pigmentation.
Beauty therapists also offer facials using lower strength glycolic acid.
However any chemical peel inflicts a wound on the skin. Experts recommend
that treatment should be supervised by a dermatologist or aesthetic plastic
(or cosmetic) surgeon experienced in their use.
The cost varies but is about Pounds 500 to Pounds 700 for a course of six
facial peels, plus day and night creams, cleanser and facial spray. Contact
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (071-405 2254), Gly
Derm Limited (071-528 8268) or MD Formulations (0268-725252).
Beauty therapist Helen Sher believes fair British skins need a daily
skincare regime formulated to combat the effects of pollution. She developed
the Sher System which is increasingly recommended by dermatologists for
different types of problem skins.
The linchpin is warm water. 'It keeps skin really clean, is very detoxifying
and prepares it for other products,' says Sher. Sher provides Normalising
Crystals based on citric acid (another AHA) which transforms hard water into
soft.
Aficionadoes splash their faces 15 times each night and morning as part of a
ritual which consists of four stages.
Individual skincare routines which consist of four or so products, cost
between Pounds 18 and Pounds 35.
Sher says it takes one month (the turnover time for skin cells) to see a
change, but several customers say they have seen improvements within a week.
Sher also offers a small range of individually blended make-up. She is at 50
New Bond Street, London W1Y 9HD, 071-499 4022, fax: 071-629 7021.
A lot of tension is stored in our faces. Facials, as well as deep cleansing
our skin, are one of the most effective ways to disperse it.
In London's Fulham Palace Road there is a small room behind a chiropody
practice, holistic beauty therapist Grania Neagle (071-585 0554) soothes
feet, hands, arms and then the face.
A two-hour facial costs Pounds 45, one hour Pounds 25. For details of
therapists and mail order products, contact Caradoc Ltd, Woodman Lane, Clen,
Nr Stourbridge DY9 9PX, 0562-886858.
If you are daunted by all the bother and expense, take heart from Joan
Collins. In her book My Secrets (Boxtree Pounds 14.99) she says: 'It really
doesn't take much money or time to take care of yourself.' Nivea cream is
her favourite make-up remover.
She recommends Vaseline, olive oil or coconut oil as moisturisers, with milk
as a cleanser and toner for irritated skin. Her last tip, echoed by many
therapists, is to drink as much pure cool water as you can.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The right time for vegetables - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's snow was, in some ways, a happy reminder that February is winter
 -or can be. In recent years, we seem to have had no winters to speak of. No
summers, either.
The fresh produce in our shops seems similarly unseasonal and ever more
uniform. A few years ago, I lamented the sight of brussels sprouts on sale
in time for the August bank holiday, and strawberries the week before
Christmas.
Now, there is hardly a week when strawberries, blueberries, asparagus and
mangetout are not to be found in our shops. On the other hand, winter
vegetables such as parsnips, Savoy cabbage and curly kale are difficult to
find.
If you share my old-fashioned notion that there is a proper time and place
for everything, including winter vegetables in winter, then ask, ask and ask
again. Do not take no for an answer . . .
BRUSSELS WITH FUSILI To serve 2-4 people depending on the rest of the meal
Choose 10oz of the firmest, smallest sprouts you can find. Slice each of
them thinly three or four times from crown to stalk end and steam them over
a pan of fast-boiling, well-salted water in which 7oz dried fusili are
cooking.
Drain both ingredients when ready and toss them together in melted butter
until gleaming. Season with salt, pepper, freshly-grated nutmeg and two or
three spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese. Serve with more Parmesan on the side.
LEEK PUREE . . . Wash and chop enough leeks to yield 1 1/2 lb of edible
vegetable (tender green parts as well as white). Cook them in fast-boiling
salted water until perfectly tender - al dente is inappropriate here. Drain
the leeks none too assiduously and add them to a food processor in which you
have chopped some parsley already. Add salt, pepper, nutmeg and 2oz diced
butter and whizz until smooth.
The lime green colour of this puree might cause alarm, but the taste -
buttery, yet fresh - is delicious, making it a fine partner for a joint of
boiled or baked gammon.
. . . IN CHEESE TARTS For more chi-chi presentation, the freshly-made leek
puree can be spooned into hot, fully-blind, baked cheese pastry cases and
topped with an extra grating of farm-made Cheddar.
To make enough intensely-flavoured cheese pastry to line up to 15 three-inch
muffin tins, you will need 3oz wholewheat flour, 3oz white household flour,
3oz butter, 3oz grated richly-flavoured farm Cheddar, and 1 egg yolk beaten
with 1 tablespoon well-salted water. Chill the pastry before rolling it out
and chill it again in the tins before baking.
SPICED CARROTS For a dish with medieval undertones, first soften a small,
finely-chopped onion in a large lump of butter. Stir in a minimum of half a
dozen cloves, 2-3in of cinnamon stick and a scant 1 sp cumin seeds, all well
bruised. After a couple of minutes, add 1lb thickly-sliced carrots and pour
on enough water to come nearly level with the top of them.
Add the juice and zest of an orange and a good pinch of sugar. Boil without
a lid, stirring often, for about seven minutes until the vegetables are
tender and bathed lightly in syrup. (If the liquid evaporates too fast,
cover the pan and cook very gently until the vegetables are done to your
liking. Or, if the carrots are ready before the liquid is syrupy, lift them
out of the pan and fast-boil the liquor to reduce it.)
Check seasoning, adding pepper, sugar and ground cinnamon or cloves to
taste. Cover the pan and set it aside until the vegetables are tepid before
scattering with split and toasted almonds and serving

There can be few homes among the dinner party classes without an Elizabeth
David cook book. For the generation after 1950 she brought a little
Mediterranean sunshine into the British kitchen.
On Tuesday you can bid for the pots and pans in which Elizabeth David
created her recipes. The contents of the kitchen of the most influential
cookery writer of the century are to be sold at Phillips Bayswater auction
house.
David, who died in 1992, threw little away and stayed faithful to
traditional utensils. The sale consists of almost two hundred lots, ranging
from basic items, such as spoons and rolling pins (estimated at up to Pounds
30 each) to more personal mementoes, such as hand written recipes which
never made the books.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Boulestin's last orders - Nicholas Lander says
farewell to a restaurant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It comes as a shock when you revisit the smart French restaurant where you
first dated your wife 13 years ago and find it has turned into a pizza
joint.
That is why the imminent closure of the Boulestin restaurant in London's
Covent Garden means so much to me. Queens Moat House, the troubled hotel
chain which owns Boulestin, will hand the keys on March 11, to Pizza Hut.
Marcel Boulestin came to London after the first world war and became the
culinary media star of the inter-war years. He signed a book contract with
Heinemann against an advance of Pounds 10 and in 1923 wrote Simple French
Cooking for English Homes which sold for five shillings and was reprinted
five times before 1933. He wrote other books and articles, gave cookery
classes, lectured and became Britain's first television chef.
This was partly to subsidise his restaurant, which opened in Leicester
Square in 1925 and moved to its current site in Covent Garden in 1926. It
was enormously popular thanks to its proximity to the Royal Opera House but
rarely profitable, partly because Boulestin, London's first amateur
restaurateur, wanted to offer a higher quality than London was prepared to
buy.
Boulestin died in 1942 but the spirit of his cooking is kept alive today by
the jovial Kevin Kennedy, chef turned restaurateur, and his hard working
wife, Maggie, who hope to take the Boulestin name to their next restaurant.
What could be my final dinner there recently highlighted Boulestin's
enduring attractions - oysters poached with a mousse of scallop corals and a
gamey saddle of hare - and the hidden gems on its exceptional wine list.
The Kennedys plan to hold gourmet evenings on March 9 and 10 (Pounds 47.50
per person).

<TEXT>
On a Saturday afternoon in Paris there is only one place to go to see the
French strolling around in their very best leisure clothes - the Conran Shop
on rue du Bac.
It is there that you can spot the few Parisian families who have not fled to
spend the weekend in their country homes. The children are a charming sight.
The little girls racing around in Bon Point smocks under brightly-coloured
duffle coats and the boys bundled up in Levi jeans with matching jackets.
Their mother's weekend uniform for this winter is a dark blue pea-coat,
generally tossed over slim black leggings and shiny lace-up boots. The truly
chic will have rummaged around their own mother's attics and the city's
antique couture shops to unearth an original 1960s Yves Saint-Laurent
pea-coat.
The merely fashionable will have settled for a nice new Prada pea-coat,
often enlivened with an expertly twisted Hermes silk scarf. The young and
funky will have trawled the flea markets to find authentic US Navy pea-coats
in chunky wool with blue anchor buttons.
Fathers look as dapper at the weekend as they do on weekdays. Impeccably
faded Levis, with jackets and open-neck shirts are the norm for the bon chic
bon genre crowd in their 30s and 40s. Their groovier counterparts favour
battered black leathers finished off with motorcycle boots.
President Mitterrand and Edouard Balladur, his prime minister, set the tone
for the grandfathers' generation. They favour the traditional style of
tweedy weekend clothes that the French always think look English, but are so
smart they could only come from France.
The only blots on this stylish landscape are the sulky adolescents who may
have been bullied into joining the family shop. Teenagers get a raw deal in
France. The tedium of listening to the Euro-babble that passes for French
pop music, coupled with the trauma of swotting for the baccalaureat, has
produced a pallid, pimply crop of Gallic adolescents, generally lowering the
sartorial tone in their colourless clothes.

Britain may no longer be the nation of shopkeepers Napoleon held in such low
regard but it is certainly a nation of shoppers. It has embraced the
American concept of shopping as recreation, hobby, part-time profession and
all-absorbing topic of conversation.
From department store to car boot sale, from designer boutique to Oxfam
shop, the retail environment is home territory to Britons.
So canny, so well-informed, in fact, are modern British shoppers that they
have learned most of the techniques the marketing men use on them, and use
them back. They do it chiefly through dress, grooming and manner.
The weekly supermarket food shop, for instance, calls for dressing down, no
lipstick and a diffident-aggressive manner. Flat shoes, jeans or a long
skirt, an anorak or a Barbour make up the uniform.
The shopping mall day out, rather like the car boot sale, calls for
something altogether more rugged. It is here that the shell suit and
trainers come into their own as serious shoppers work the halls and
corridors, the fast food joints and the caverns of the car park. Here there
is less respect for others' space, a greater wariness and sense of
competition.
This approach would, however, be useless in Bond Street or Knightsbridge.
The British know that if they are not to be patronised or dismissed by
up-market sales assistants, they must dress up, preferably in smart,
fashionable clothes which excite the sales assistant's label-conscious envy.
Here they cultivate a non-conciliatory manner, becoming demanding and
capricious. Only when the assistant has succumbed and demonstrated the
proper admiration and respect is any charm deployed.
In between these extremes are subtleties: the knowledgeable country tweed
look for antique shops and the dowdy-duchess in ancient Burberry, brogues
and Hermes scarf for the Bond Street jewellers. When they're shopping, the
Brits know what works.

If you want to know what New Yorkers wear when they shop, follow a simple
rule: look where they are shopping.
At Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, New York's wealthier women - Tom
Wolfe's famed 'social X-rays' - wear clothes from the store's collections.
At Barneys, either uptown or downtown, the male shoppers dress the way they
always have - like members of some kind of European cultural mafia. The
women wear black and look grumpy.
A lot depends upon the season. In summer, anything will suffice so long as
it is cool and comfortable. And with most of New York's movers and shakers
out of the city between July and September, it doesn't really matter what
you wear.
Winter, however, is different. This is the season for a show, and the show
is rarely better than at Christmas.
Picture the scene: a very crowded Fifth Avenue on Christmas Eve. Amid the
crush, a tall, elegantly dressed man, arms full of presents, hails a cab. He
is wearing a Della Rovere cashmere sweater, woollen Dries Van Noten pants,
and a flowing, warm green Ronaldus Shamask coat, topped off with a dashing
trilby from Van Dyck Hatters of Greenwich Avenue.
As he departs, there is a glimpse of sensible dark socks from Brooks
Brothers encased in sturdy John Lobb shoes, and the final sounds of the
crunch of snow as he steps off the sidewalk into the cab heading east on
58th Street.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: Spotlight on paper lanterns - Alice Rawsthorn on
the revival of a fashion with its roots in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the least likely beneficiaries of the design world's obsession with
the early 1970s is the paper lantern, the mainstay of so many student
bedsits, which is now back in fashion with a bang.
The soft glow and hand-made air that made the paper lantern seem so out of
place in the stark interiors of the 1980s make it perfect for the artisan
look of the 1990s.
It may be infused with the hippy ethos of the early 1970s, but it traces its
roots to the post-war US design scene and to Isamu Noguchi, the
Japanese-American sculptor and furniture designer who devised the first
modern paper light at his Long Island studio in the early 1950s.
Noguchi was born in Los Angeles in 1904, the son of a Japanese poet who had
emigrated to the United States, and a Californian woman who answered his
advertisement for a translator. Noguchi spent his childhood in Japan and his
teens in the US.
He studied sculpture under Constantin Brancusi in Paris before settling in
New York where he designed furniture for Herman Miller and sets for the
Martha Graham dance company.
In the early 1950s Noguchi was asked by the Japanese town of Gifu to help
revive its industrial base. Gifu had historically been a centre for the
manufacture of candle-lit paper lanterns. Noguchi developed a modern version
of these traditional Mandarin lamps for use as electric lights.
He designed dozens of different lanterns for Gifu in the 1950s and 1960s.
Some are simple adaptations of the Mandarin originals. Others are more
idiosyncratic abstract shapes like his own sculpture. They are still made by
hand in Gifu today using mino-gami paper which comes from the bark of the
mulberry tree.
Noguchi lanterns are exquisite objects. He designed the frames and shades so
cleverly that they fold away into perfectly flat parcels. The mino-gami
paper is so fine that there is a very special, soft quality to the light
itself.
The Conran Shop, which has a limited range of Noguchi lights, sells a small
beehive lamp for Pounds 89 and a larger beehive floor lamp for Pounds 257.
The full selection is available by mail order from the Isamu Noguchi
Foundation at his old studio on Long Island and ranges from Dollars 62 for a
simple paper pendant to Dollars 636 for an elaborate floor lamp.
The Conran Shop also has a less expensive range of rectangular paper pendant
lights from Pounds 9.50 to Pounds 14.50.
An excellent selection of Noguchi-inspired lanterns has been produced by
Habitat. Its designs are not as meticulously finished as the originals, nor
is the quality of the light so fine, but they are much cheaper. Habitat
sells small beehives for Pounds 15, a larger version for Pounds 20 and
classic coolie pendants for Pounds 6.50.
A number of contemporary designers have brought out new versions of the
Noguchi lanterns. Matthias Dietz, a German design historian and curator, has
commissioned a collection of paper lights from 30 Japanese architects and
designers including Toyo Ito and Shigero Uchida. 'There's been so much
interest in Noguchi recently that I thought it would be interesting to see
how modern Japanese designers interpreted his ideas,' he says.
Tom Dixon, one of the most enterprising young London furniture designers and
another Noguchi buff, has also brought out a range of hand-made paper
lights. 'I was getting tired of working on heavy furniture pieces and wanted
to try something lighter,' he says. 'I've always loved Noguchi's work and
decided to see what I could come up with by making a model aircraft
structure.'
He began by making star-shaped lights and moved on to geometric columns. The
small stars start at Pounds 100. The columns cost around Pounds 450
depending on how much work is involved. Dixon is now working on a series of
intricate paper lights to sell in the shop he plans to open this spring in
London's Notting Hill.
He also makes one-off paper lights to order. Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese
fashion designer, ordered a set in black for the Comme des Garcons shop in
New York. 'I didn't think they would work,' says Dixon. 'The black made them
look more like sculpture than lights. But they did give off a strange eerie
glow.'

<TEXT>
Down some alley off Frankfurt's main Zeil shopping drag - precise
whereabouts unknown - there must be a workshop devoted to building Claudia
Schiffer lookalikes.
They dot the Zeil every Saturday: skinny young girls with freshly-ironed
hair and silly pouts. Recognisable by their uniform black flannel shorts,
woolly grey tights and tight black tops, on colder days they trail flimsy
black duster coats. But they never, ever, carry shopping bags. Their
purpose, it seems, is purely decorative.
Which is just as well. Others among the weekend hordes are purposeful to the
point of obsession. Their aim is to go about their business before the
shutters go up at lunchtime in honour of Germany's daft laws governing
shopping hours.
Ladies flit from store to store in crisp red blazers and black pants. Young
men wander aimlessly in dense felty jackets and the obligatory jeans before
wandering off to lunch.
Saturday is the best time of all to see Frankfurters clad in their infinite
variety. A quarter of the permanent population is foreign, and the weekend
mix is enriched by passers-through, buskers and beggars from eastern Europe
and beyond.
What does the Russian song and dance troupe, immaculate in traditional boots
and flounces, make of all those locals in rustling shell suits and
over-sized trainers, videoing their act with such solemnity?
What do the odd German couples in knee-breeches, loden greens and tufty
little hats make of the Andean pan-pipers tootling to audiences of enchanted
children dressed as up-market rag dolls?
It is all too brief. Nothing more than a snapshot. By three, the shoppers
have retreated. The boulevard is once again left to its regular population:
a clutch of drunks tottering around the fountain, and black-clad young men
waiting for the dark and the more sinister retailing business which
characterises the Zeil by night.

Shopping is becoming a less frequent activity for the Japanese, if the
dismal retail sales figures are anything to go by.
Dressing for shopping, as a result, is a concern that preoccupies them less
and less as there is no longer a compelling need to be seen dressed in the
very best at all times.
One popular style among young women is the long skirt over boots, topped by
a short jacket or big shawl and often a hat. This is new for Japan - there
is a definite sense of no-nonsense, practical fashion, a far cry from the
extravagance of the go-go years.
Style among shoppers tends to be different depending on where you shop. The
staid Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya department stores in Nihonbashi, close to
the Tokyo stock market and the main banking district, attract well-heeled
women who prefer a conservative look of suits and twin sets.
Closer to the popular residential neighbourhoods, in Shibuya or Shinjuku,
the department stores tend to attract a more casual clientele while in
fashionable Aoyama, shoppers are keen to be seen in asymmetrical Yohji
Yamamoto or Comme des Garcons outfits.
Most striking, however, is the emptiness of the designers' shops and how
much more accommodating the shop assistants appear to be.
Department stores have also become more like small shopping malls with a
variety of tenants, and are losing customers to supermarkets, downmarket
shopping malls and discount stores where more attention is paid to price
than to what people are wearing.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: TV's ice queens - Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS Television in particular, not to mention US sportswriting in general,
really owes a lot to Tonya Harding. The venerable network, in the dumps
after it was outbid by Rupert Murdoch's Fox for the contract to cover
American football, cannot have had many hopes that the Winter Olympics in
Lillehammer would be its salvation.
America has nothing against Norway and loves skiing. But a two-week diet of
luge and biathlon never looked likely to quicken the pulse of the great
American viewing public.
Tonya, the brat from the wrong side of the tracks, changed all this, because
she is the melodramatic queen of the moment. It matters not a whit if she
wins a skating medal, which she probably will not, nor even if her great
rival Nancy Kerrigan does, which she may, thus warming a few hearts. The
mere fact that Lillehammer brings the two together after all the charges
that Tonya conspired to cripple Nancy is enough: it is soap opera incarnate.
This alone has justified the CBS approach to the Winter Olympics, which is
designed to overcome a particular problem: that, because of the time
difference, the results of almost every event are known even as Americans
eat breakfast. Thus the Games have been treated less as a sporting
spectacle, and more as a melodrama on the hypothesis that behind each
competitor must lie a human interest story.
Now, some human interest stories are more interesting than others. There is
only so much that can be extracted from the nobility of Norwegian
speedskaters, even one as seriously noble as Johann Olav Koss. US
competitors are better material, especially when they win - Tommy Moe,
naturally of Norwegian extraction, and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, in skiing
and, after another tug-at-the-heartstrings failure, Dan Jansen in
speedskating. But Tonya is in a league of her own and the ratings have
soared.
The US writing press has occasionally taken refuge in non-Tonya subjects.
Take Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post on 'the single dumbest Winter
Olympic medal sport,' mogul skiing. 'Each run takes about 30 seconds, a
perfect length of time for the audience they're aiming at - someone with the
attention span of a barn owl.'
Or Dave Barry, the syndicated columnist, on the news that some bobsledders
took dope. 'This is extremely alarming news, because it seems to suggest
that there are bobsled competitors here who are not on dope. Let me just
state that I, personally, would not consider going down a bobsled run unless
huge quantities of narcotics were coursing through my bloodstream.'
But even Barry has to come back to Tonya. 'I want to stress, however, that I
am not putting dangerous substances of any kind into my body, other than
mass quantities of Norwegian beer, because I want to remain alert now that
Tonya Harding is finally here. We in the American news media are so happy
about this we want to hurl our hats in the air, but of course we don't,
because our hair would freeze solid and break off like Number 8 spaghetti.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: What England expects - Derek Wyatt looks forward to a
tactical battle at Twickenham / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England began last year's Five Nations Championship with a one point win
against France 16-15 and then lost by a point to Wales 9-10. If justice has
anything to do with rugby, England would have lost to France and beaten
Wales. The loss to Wales showed that Will Carling could not think on his
feet.
Two weeks ago against Scotland it was the same story. This time it was not
just Carling who failed to read the game but his lieutenant Brian Moore, who
led the pack. Time and again, Neil Back was exposed at the end of the
line-out; time and again the Scots cut off the route from Kyren Bracken, the
scrum half, to Rob Andrew, the fly half, and lured Bracken into unsupported
runs before ambushing him.
In recent years the public has revised its expectations from England always
winning, to England always winning with something in reserve. This afternoon
a one-point win for England over Ireland at Twickenham will count as a
national disaster. The team must not only beat the Irish, but must beat them
comprehensively; for the England management has decided that this is the
side that will beat France, the strongest team in the competition, in Paris
in a fortnight.
England's back play is constipated. I am tired of reading that the new laws
make it more difficult for the three quarters. At the Parc des Prince in
October, in the Second Test between France and Australia, Michael Lynagh
destroyed the French side by running and attacking them whenever he had the
ball in his hands. He hardly kicked at all.
Only Stuart Barnes and Mike Catt, both of Bath, can follow Lynagh's example
for England. Rob Andrew has a fine pedigree but his game has always lacked
vision.
Ireland will follow Scotland's lead and bombard Jon Callard with Garryowens.
Neither of the Underwoods is secure under high balls and Callard, who
remained largely untested against New Zealand, struggled when Scotland used
this ploy. I would have preferred Ian Hunter to play on the right wing to
act as a sweeper for Callard or even to switch with him in certain
circumstances. Gone are the days when wingers just stayed on their wings.
Tony Underwood missed a try against the All Blacks by carrying the ball
under the wrong arm so he could not hand-off his tackler. He did it again in
the Scotland game and again missed a try. He is fortunate the selectors have
such patience. In player parlance, he owes England one: in my book, he owes
England two.
For Ireland, Eric Elwood has been magnificent. Magnificent at kicking that
is. But the Irish strategy is hard to read. Elwood will soon be compared to
an illustrious predecessor, Tony Ward, who was frequently criticised for
playing just a kicking game. Will Elwood be allowed to play a wider game and
is he capable of it? Poor Simon Geoghegan - the Irish winger must be
starting to feel a forgotten man.
Against France, Ireland had one tactic: to kick the ball over the French
defensive lines. It failed but they went on playing that way and appeared
happy for Elwood to kick goals. Even though these tactics lost against
France and Wales, I doubt that they will be any different at Twickenham.
The French take an unchanged side to Cardiff where they have not lost to
Wales since 1982. The French front five is one of the heaviest in rugby
history, but the back row of Abdelatif Benazzi, Philippe Benetton and Marc
Cecillon could be severely tested. All three are specialist No 8s picked for
the lineout in spite of their lack of mobility in the loose.
The Welsh had done the psychologically difficult bit - they won their
opening game against Scotland and followed it up with a composed win against
Ireland. But their chance for their first Grand Slam since 1978, has been
undermined by injuries to their backs.
The shortage of tries and the increased importance of penalties, such as the
controversial kick for handling in a ruck that gave England victory over
Scotland, have exercised the rugby world this past fortnight. Since rugby is
supposed to be a handling game, I do not understand why it is an offence to
handle in the rucks, provided the player is not preventing the ball being
played.
The laws governing penalties are a muddle. The 'double' penalty that allows
sides to kick to touch and still gain the throw in has made line-outs even
more important. From the line-out the fly half then kicks the ball up in the
air in the hope of winning the scrum from the ensuing 'turnover' maul or
ruck. This is American football not rugby football.
The penalty laws have so changed the nature and balance of the game that the
international laws committee should reverse them at the end of these
championships. They could also add a rider that an offence committed in the
'penalty' area of the defensive side's 22 should result in a penalty in
front of the posts.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: Twickenham without beers - Rugby Union, Five Nations
/ Tom Fort used to spend lunch in a pub and the match in agony. He is wiser
now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT

<TEXT>
In my feckless youth, the notion that international day required strategic
planning never entered my head. We simply went to a pub - any pub - and
drank beer until it was time to go to the match. Afterwards we went to a pub
 -any pub - and drank beer until it closed, or we could drink no more. We
went home feeling hilarious, woke up feeling vile, and ran it off on the
rugby field on Sunday afternoon.
With the passing of years, shortcomings were exposed in this approach.
Increasingly the pre-match pub side of things palled. You would stand for
ages crushed on all sides by red-faced prop forwards and hulking second row
men, deafened by patriotic bawling and thunderous denunciations of
selectorial idiocy. Fighting your way to the bar was bad enough; getting
back to your chums without pouring the ale down someone's neck required an
improbable degree of resilience and dexterity.
Then there was the matter of the bladder, which I will not go into in detail
for fear of giving offence. Suffice it to say that of the 50,000 or so
attending a rugby international, three-fifths at a conservative estimate
will arrive with bladders full; that of these, three fifths will need to
relieve themselves again before the game is over; that no sporting arena on
earth boasts the facilities to cope with such demands; and that the
inevitable consequences are distasteful to sensitive souls like myself.
In addition, in those days we used to stand, and once you are jammed into
the crowd there is simply no escape however urgent the desire to do so. I
shudder at the memories.
Twenty years ago, we went to see England play France at Twickenham. As
always, it was the game of the season, and we had standing tickets for the
east side enclosure. We made our way first to the Orange Tree at Richmond.
It was my eldest brother's first trip to Twickenham, and I advised him to
restrict himself to a couple of pints.
In the annoying way eldest brothers have, he ignored me and drank six. We
got the the ground in good time, and by the time the ref blew his whistle,
we had battled our way to a first rate vantage point on the halfway line.
Scarcely was the ball in the air than my brother gave an anguished cry. He
turned, was swallowed by the throng, and was not seen again that day.
Paris showed us there could be a better way. In the absence of heaving pubs,
we developed the habit of lunching expansively on oysters, andouillettes,
choucroute and wine at the Brasserie Du Gard Du Nord, before travelling in
orderly fashion to the cauldron of frenzy known as Parc des Princes.
Afterwards, admittedly having had a beer or three somewhere, we would dine
in a Michelin approved restaurant and discuss the match like the civilised
men we were.
We decided to see if we could duplicate this refinement in west London.
Another of my brothers, a man steeped in foodyism, was deputed to find
somewhere suitable. He took us to a little restaurant called well, actually
I don't think I will tell you, for obvious reasons.
It is close to a railway station, and opposite a tolerable pub, for those
unable entirely to shake off the old ways.
The advantages are that the crowds are absent, and there is parking, and
peace.
The restaurant is a rum establishment. It opens only at lunchtime, and has
no licence which makes it extremely cheap, as you bring your own wine. The
dishes have not changed in a dozen years. Each time, I seem to eat liver in
the provencale style, and each time I think what a thoroughly decent dish it
is.
There we gather, eat, drink, explore shared memories, organise the
sweepstake on the score, analyse the prospects, make a certain amount of
noise but not too much, I trust.
Then to the match, with passably clear heads and blessedly unstrained
bladders; then to the pub, where the scene tends to become somewhat less
decorous, and sometimes not decorous at all; then home by train and taxi.
In all this there is the satisfaction of having a good day, without behaving
like an oaf. It is a pleasing routine, which lightens the darkness of dreary
winter. And never let anyone try to kid you that sitting at home and
watching the game on TV can come within a mile of matching it.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Motoring: Renault's executive ploy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renault's significant new model, the medium-sized Laguna, makes its debut at
the Geneva motor show in just over two weeks and arrives in British
showrooms in April. Its appearance with right-hand steering so soon after
the mainland European launch shows how seriously Renault takes the British
market - especially sales to business users and company fleets.
Renault is having a product-led recovery in Britain where it sold just over
93,000 cars last year - its best performance since 1979. The Laguna,
successor to the old Renault 21, will compete mainly with the Ford Mondeo,
Opel Vectra (Vauxhall Cavalier in Britain), Peugeot 405 and Citroen Xantia.
But it will also be an alternative to the British-made Nissan Primera, Honda
Accord and Toyota Carina E.
Where does it stand against such strong opposition? At a probable price
range of Pounds 10,500-Pounds 19,000, it should give any of them a run for
their money.
The Laguna is son of the Safrane - Renault's large, executive-class car -
and not a bigger version of the Renault 19. Along with the Xantia, it is the
most distinctively styled vehicle in its class.
At present, there is just one body: a five-door hatchback that could be
mistaken for a four-door saloon. But estate cars, including a family model
with three rows of face-forward seats, are expected to follow soon.
To start with, only petrol engines will be offered - a 1.8-litre, 95
horsepower version and another of two litres and 115 horsepower, both with
four cylinders, plus a V6 three-litre of 170 horsepower. But a 2.2-litre,
85hp diesel joins the range in Britain in October.
As a design, the Laguna breaks no moulds. It is a conventional,
transverse-engined, front-wheel driven car. Five-speed manual transmission
is standard on all but the UK-specification V6. This will come with a
four-speed automatic, also available on the two-litre at extra cost. Its
suspension uses MacPherson struts (combined coil spring and damper units) at
the front and torsion bars at the rear. Four-cylinder models have front
disc, rear drum brakes; the V6 has discs all round with ABS as standard, but
this is an optional extra on all other Lagunas.
There are three trim levels, so buyers can pick and mix engines and
interiors to arrive at a car that suits their pockets and tastes. Every
Laguna has power-assisted steering, central locking and electric windows.
With up-market cars such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Rover in its sights,
Renault UK is loading the V6 automatic with leather trim, air-conditioning,
on-board computer and powered sun roof. Everything, in fact, to which the
executive user has grown accustomed without unnecessary bulk.
The Laguna offers four people lounging space and would be tolerable for
five. Its boot is among the largest in class.
In Tanzania this month, I drove 1.8-litre, two-litre and V6 three-litre
Lagunas with manual transmission, and a two-pedal three-litre V6. No, not on
dirt roads in the game reserves - these remain Land Rover territory - but
mainly on stretches of pretty good tarmac which, one day, will form part of
a Cape to Cairo highway.
All rode well and felt reassuringly solid. Renault says its aim was to make
the Laguna feel like a German car and it does, although the seats are more
yielding.
Having been assured there was no speed limit in Tanzania* outside the
potholed, old banger-infested towns and villages, I gave the Lagunas their
heads where it was safe. Even the 1.8-litre cruised quietly at more than
100mph (160kmh), and at 125mph (200kmh) the V6 felt relaxed with power in
hand. For a combination of performance and economy, the two-litre was my
favourite. It was considerably quicker off the mark than the 1.8 and pulled
harder in fourth and fifth gears. It was agreeably nimble on winding hill
roads, and the 65-series tyres rumbled only moderately on coarsely-textured
surfaces.
The figures suggest the fuel consumptions of the various models will be
little different - an average 32-33mpg (8.82-8.56 l/100 km). But with
temperatures at times around 40`C, what really set the various Laguna models
apart was air-conditioning. In the two-litre and V6, it was appreciated -
and sorely missed in the 1.8.
* Over a drink before flying home, an expatriate put me right. Tanzania has
a 100kph speed limit - although few local vehicles seemed capable of much
more than half that.

FT  19 FEB 94 / As They Say in Europe: Dutch trick or treat for the Germans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One problem the British scarcely worry about is what they call people from
the Netherlands. They have been calling them 'Dutch' forever, but the Dutch
started to use it to mean the Germans, and not themselves, around 1600.
Schoolchildren in the Netherlands are usually asked, after their first
English lesson, 'Are you Dutch?' They immediately yell that they are not.
Maybe this is what makes them anxious to ensure nobody mistakes them for
Germans.
I recall such a moment at a press conference where a Dutch finance minister,
I think it was Onno Ruding, was asked what he would do if he were running
the Bundesbank. (There was one of the usual rows about German interest rates
going on at the time.) 'Never ask a Dutchman what he would do if he were a
German,' was the reply.
But things are changing in the Netherlands, maybe. At the end of last month,
the weekly, Vrij Nederland, ran a long piece headed 'On our knees before
Germany'.
It was a mildly critical study of a new German-friendly tone in Dutch
official policy. 'Is a taboo against the Federal Republic being lifted? The
new Deutschfreundlichkeit is on the map.'
Now it is widely believed that it is the British who are mainly responsible
for sustaining an anachronistic image of the Germans as scarred,
monocle-wearing, swastika-covered thugs.
The truth of the matter is that it is only the British who make jokes and
draw cartoons inspired by such figures.
But it seems the Dutch share the same stereotype: Vrij Nederland says that
the only bit of German history Dutch pupils learn is the bit between 1933
and 1945.
Today, however, Germany is 'in' - in political circles at least.
The weekly newspaper reported that the nation's top diplomat, given the
choice between taking over the Bonn or Washington embassy, took the one that
mattered, Bonn.
A new, friendlier atmosphere has been made possible because of the
retirement of Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign minister and the
transition of his Dutch opposite number, Hans Van den Broek, to the Brussels
commission. It seems that they did not like each other (I bet you did not
know that.)
But none of this has seeped down to the Dutchman in the street.
One official told the paper, 'If you say your daughter is going as an au
pair to Paris, everyone says, 'Fine'. Even better if you say she is off to
the US. To Lausanne is good.
'But if your daughter is going to Berlin, everyone says, 'What - au pair in
Berlin]''
And, it seems, when Dutch young people meet young Germans they speak to each
other in Pidgin English. Which is hard to believe for anyone who thinks of
Dutch as just a version of German. The Dutch writer, Harry Mulisch, once
wrote, 'The Germans and Dutch stand together, back to back.'
The latter have looked traditionally to Britain but might have to stand the
other way now, for the British are partly responsible for the changes taking
place in Dutch policy.
'England has turned its back on Europe . . . and we have to make ourselves
more European,' said a former ambassador to Nato.
This is all quite interesting stuff, but not as interesting as the German
reaction: Vrij Nederland aroused sombre comment.
Apart from the title ('On our knees . . . ') it was not a hostile piece. But
instead of being pleased about the new turn in Dutch official attitudes, a
writer in the Frankfurter Allgemeine took it all rather grimly.
'Between Germany and Holland there should rule the closest friendship.'
Fortunately this is meant ironically; Germans no longer believe in the
concept of compulsory friendship.
The article continued with typical pessimism: 'There could exist between
Germany and Holland the paradoxical relationship which existed between the
old socialist 'fraternal countries': at the highest political level, an
ostentatious friendship, while the people still show mutual distrust and
want to know nothing of each other.'
Actually this is quite false on one side at least: the Germans like the
Dutch and have no idea how they feel. At least, not until the German
national team plays football against the Netherlands, when the Dutch spit or
show their backsides to German supporters.
The few Germans who take note of Dutch attitudes seem to believe that they
are formed by constant reading of the diary of Anne Frank and school visits
to Nazi deportation camps.
The Dutch education minister went to Bonn three months ago to say he was
really trying to give his youngsters a wider view.
The trouble is, in fact, that so much, not only in the Netherlands, is
defined by the German relationship.
After all Vrij Nederland means, as you will have guessed, Free Netherlands.
'Free from what?' I ask Dutch friends. 'Van de Duitsers, from the Germans,
of course,' they reply.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Superconductors hot up - The
Nature of Things / How trains will fly and computers read your mind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here are some predictions for the year 2020. We will be travelling on
magnetically levitated trains at 300mph. Power will be transmitted across
continents without the smallest loss. Giant electric 'batteries' will store
enough emergency power to run a city for a whole day. Electronic sensors
will be sensitive enough to follow your brainwaves as you think.
These innovations will all result from research into superconductivity, the
abolition of any resistance to electric current - a kind of frictionless
electric wire. The world's physicists have been working frenziedly on the
phenomenon since 1986, when two Swiss scientists at International Business
Machines' Zurich research centre discovered the first 'high temperature
superconductors'.
In the excited aftermath of the discovery, commentators aroused inflated
expectations about the speed with which the phenomenon could be put to
practical use - and within three years they were expressing disappointment
about the lack of progress.
In fact superconductivity research has moved pretty fast. All the
applications originally foreseen are still in prospect and the technology
stands on the brink of commercial exploitation.
Superconductivity has three important practical consequences:
Current can flow for ever round a superconducting circuit. This is the basis
of proposed power engineering applications, such as no-loss electricity
cables, and huge 'battery' coils to store energy for use at peak periods.
Superconductors can generate intense magnetic fields of their own and
strongly repel external magnetic fields. These forces are powerful enough to
lift a train off the track and propel it at 300mph.
On the micro-scale, electrons can jump instantaneously between two
superconducting components. This so-called Josephson effect could be used to
build portable *something in here (HP) *
supercomputers, millions of times faster than the present generation. It is
also the basis of the Squid (superconducting quantum interference device)
which detects tiny changes in external magnetic fields, such as those
produced in our brains when we think.
Scientists discovered superconductivity in 1911 in mercury cooled by liquid
helium to -269`C. That is just four degrees above the lowest temperature
conceivably possible (absolute zero) at which all molecular movement is
stilled. For 75 years scientists experimented with other metals and alloys
in an effort to achieve superconductivity at higher - and therefore
potentially more useful - temperatures. By 1986 the highest recorded
superconducting temperature had crept up to -250`C, which still required
expensive helium cooling.
Then Karl Muller and Johann Bednorz made the breakthrough for which they won
a Nobel prize in 1987. They created a ceramic material - quite different
from conventional metal superconductors - that lost its resistance at
 243`C. The 7`C improvement may not sound much but it excited the world's
physicists, who saw the scope for pushing superconductivity to much higher
temperatures by playing with the composition of these ceramics.
Confirmed superconducting temperatures leaped to -180`C in 1987 and -146`C
in 1988. The current record is -140`C in an oxide of mercury, barium,
calcium and copper, though there were unverified reports two months ago of
superconductivity at -23`C - tantalisingly close to the target of room
temperature superconductors.
Already, however, the proven materials are comfortably above -196`C, the
temperature of liquid nitrogen, an industrial coolant which costs less than
milk.
So why are they not in widespread use already? In the first place, the
ceramics are fragile materials - far more difficult to work with than the
metals and semiconductors so far used in electrical and electronic
engineering. A particular problem is to make sure the individual grains
within the ceramic are aligned in a way that does not interrupt the flow of
electricity.
A second difficulty is that the ceramics have maddeningly unpredictable
magnetic properties. They are apt to lose their superconductivity when
carrying large currents or in the presence of a strong external magnetic
field.
Even so, the current carrying capacity of superconducting ceramic wires is
increasing rapidly. American Superconductor - one of several companies
started in the US with venture capital to exploit the technology - recently
made a prototype cable carry 2,300 amps over a metre, enough to supply a
steel mill.
But the first commercial ceramic superconductors are at the other end of the
scale: electronic devices made from material laid down in microscopically
thin layers. Early models are being used for military purposes in the US,
but the civil telecommunications industry is expected to start buying them
later this year.
It took 10 to 15 years for two of the 20th century's other key physical
discoveries, the transistor and the laser, to find widespread application.
The real disappointment is at the theoretical rather than the practical
level. Scientists do not really understand how the materials can carry
current without resistance at such 'high' temperatures. The answer has
something to do with their banded structure. Another Nobel prize is waiting
for anyone who comes up with a comprehensive theory of superconductivity.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The cutting edge of science - Two
physicists who turned their knowledge of lasers into a business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dr Malcolm Gower looks at newspaper advertisements for the correction
of short-sightedness by surgery with laser beams, he wonders whether he
could have been a millionaire by now.
Nine years ago, soon after he and fellow physicist Dr Phil Rumsby had
started Exitech, the future seemed mapped out.
However, instead of plunging into the lucrative world of consumer optics,
the two men decided to concentrate on micromachining across a variety of
applications, using extremely precise excimer lasers, in which they are
international authorities.
Nowadays Gower and Rumsby travel the world, and visitors from many countries
come to the rural Oxfordshire headquarters of what chairman Dr Gower calls
'the world's most precise hole boring operation'.
An example of what this means can be seen in the company's display area. A
photograph taken with an electron microscope shows how Exitech lasers can
cut precise notches in a strand of human hair.
In an adjoining laboratory, there is a small production line for a
commercial customer where a laser bores microscopic holes into catheters for
blood monitoring in babies.
This batch work earns Exitech Pounds 100,000 a year. It undertakes similar
work for the electronics industry, inserting almost invisible 'gratings' or
windows into optical fibres, to convert them into optical sensors which
measure temperature and stress changes.
In 1985, shortly after Gower and Rumsby, had formed Exitech in a former
slaughterhouse building in Oxford, they were asked by a London ophthalmology
professor to explore the use of lasers to correct short-sightedness.
They successfully researched the use of lasers for corneal sculpting - now a
widely advertised private treatment - but decided against developing
equipment for that application.
'We thought very hard about it but decided that the amount of money involved
in developing the equipment would have meant seeking major outside
investment - something we did not want to do at that stage,' Gower said.
'The potential was vast but it was too early in the company's history. We
would have lost control of Exitech.'
Instead the pair continued to work at the place where they met, the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in nearby Abingdon for several more years.
'We agreed that we should always grow the business out of profits,' Gower
said. 'Our borrowings have never exceeded our overdraft limit, currently
Pounds 150,000.'
Exitech is still a research-based company, specialising in developing high
powered short wavelength lasers to perform tasks that cannot be seen with
the naked eye.
'Five of our 20 employees are PhDs and the majority of the others have
science degrees. The Excimer lasers we use were only invented in 1975, and
they are only just being used as industrial tools. Here we combine research
that would not be out of place in a university with collaborative projects
with major manufacturers,' Gower said.
About 50 per cent of the company's Pounds 2m turnover comes from commercial
contract research and development. About Pounds 150,000 a year comes from
British government and EC projects. For these projects the company gains
only 50 per cent funding, so it has to find half the cost itself.
'Generally we only get involved in part-funded projects that we would in any
case want to undertake as a company,' Gower said.
Exitech aims at 40 per cent profit on turnover, although Gower admits they
have yet to hit that figure.
The company has expanded in the last three years, with the purchase of two
more industrial units on the park where it is based, one of which is rented
out to a hi-tech start-up company in which Exitech holds a 30 per cent
share.
The main reason for the big expansion in the past three years is the Exitech
Series 7000, a complete excimer laser microdrilling system. Each machine is
built to order and sells for between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 500,000.
Exitech builds up to 12 a year.
'All the machines are designed and built here to the customer's
specification. No two are the same,' Gower said.
It needs a highly flexible workforce to switch from batch processing one day
to assembling such a machine the next, but the team of research scientists,
software specialists, designers and mechanical designers is able to cope.
'We tend to expand when we need to and when we see a market,' Gower said.
'Our market is so specific and our products so specialised that we can
usually see the trends and can adapt ourselves accordingly. For a small
company we probably do too many things and we are still not entirely clear
about the best way of marketing ourselves.
'Our great strength is that we can move fast when we see a new technology.
We can never beat the Japanese at manufacturing, but when we have innovative
ideas we are good at explaining them to foreign customers, who are happy to
come here for lengthy bench sessions.'
About half Exitech's turnover comes from sales of the 7000 series machine.
Gower and Rumsby are grateful that the percentage is no higher.
Manufacturing such expensive machines creates problems of cash flow.
'Cash up front, even for a machine that might cost Pounds 500,000, is
something that large multinationals are loath to supply to a small company
on the other side of the world,' he said.
'We have to live with this. We have had sticky moments when building a
machine that costs Pounds 400,000 and face an immediate bill of half that
amount for buying in components. However, the bank is usually sympathetic
when we are in a huge cash flow trough.
'They have no doubts over our profitability, and have the comfort of knowing
that we own our three buildings outright.
'There are many laser producers who would like to work closely with us, and
we have good relationships with biomedical and electronic end users. It's
nice to be liked.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Despatches: The night that friends turned into murderers -
Gillian Tett thought she knew the gentle people of a valley in Tajikistan.
But that was before civil war set neighbour against neighbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I thought I had misheard my friend Jamila when she said: 'They took the men
out and killed them . . . .' For a few seconds, the words hung in the air
while I stared in shock. On my lap, Jamila's little daughter was putting
muddy fingerprints all over my notebook. In one corner of the village house,
a television was playing spangly Iranian pop music. But Jamila herself was
terribly still.
'You killed them? Dead?' I asked, stupidly.
Jamila thought I had not understood. She drew a flour-covered finger across
her throat. 'Dead, dead,' she repeated slowly, in Russian instead of her
native Tajik. Uncomprehending, her little daughter mimicked her.
'Do they do that type of thing in England?' asked Jamila, slowly. I did not
know how to reply.
When I set out from Moscow to visit this remote village in Tajikistan, where
I had spent 12 months working as an anthropologist, I expected the worst. In
England during the past year, I had heard bits and pieces about the vicious
civil war there and knew it was unlikely my friends in this valley had
escaped entirely. Indeed, I arrived suspecting they might have been victims.
But killers? That had never occurred to me.
These people did not match the wild television pictures that I had seen from
Georgia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan or Bosnia. They seemed simply too ordinary
and kind to be really violent.
At least, they had when I sat with them during a winter gossiping, laughing,
and watching the raunchy, Russian-dubbed Mexican television soap operas to
which they were so addicted; and then travelled with them in the summer to
their mountain pastures where I got thoroughly sunburnt while they tended
their goats.
When, 18 months before, I met a group of villagers during a demonstration in
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, they were clutching shopping lists, not rifles.
And although I wondered occasionally what was happening on the ground, I
could never match the news reports mentally with my photographs and
memories.
But then, sitting in a pizza restaurant in Moscow a few weeks earlier, I
heard something that alarmed me. A Dutch diplomat, who had been monitoring
the civil war, mentioned casually that the valley had been captured by
anti-communist forces.
That hit me with a jolt. Then, and even worse, I realised that, since my
friends generally were pro-communist, they would have been the first to be
killed if the opposition really had taken control.
I flew to Dushanbe immediately and began to ask questions. The city, once as
green and calm as a central Asian Milton Keynes, was scarred by war. Russian
troops and aid workers had overrun the hotels. A chronic fuel shortage had
brought the cars to a standstill and people were too scared to go out after
4pm.
Since no one seemed to know what had happened to the village. I took a car
into the mountains with a driver and his son who declared, cheerfully, that
he was a martial arts expert. As we bumped along the devastated road, I
asked for news. Why were all the bridges in the area destroyed? Was it
fighting?
'Just earthquakes,' he said, scornfully - and I felt a little foolish.
And when, finally, I arrived in the village, it seemed for a few minutes
that nothing had changed. A roadblock had been set up, but the goats were
wandering around as usual. And although the opposition had passed through
the mountains, scaring the shepherds and stealing some horses, only a few
people had been killed.
I concluded, a little smugly, that I had been right all along - these simply
were not violent people. Then, when I had been plied with more plates of
mutton soup than I could possibly eat, I stopped to see Jamila (for obvious
reasons, not her real name).
She is an elegantly featured and intelligent woman who often had lively
debates with me about Gorbachev and Britain's former prime minister,
Margaret Thatcher. When once I showed her an English coin she asked me,
admiringly, if that was Thatcher's head on it.
This time, however, she started talking about the Pamiris. At first I hardly
listened. Although the Pamiri people, who generally supported the
opposition, had been among the biggest victims of the civil war, they lived
far away - in the Pamir mountains at the foot of the Hindu Kush.
A handful also lived in this particular valley, but they had been there so
long that the Tajiks worked with them, ate with them and went to their
weddings. To the casual observer they seemed identical to the villagers.
Indeed, one particular Pamiri boy, who looked like James Dean and had a
highly suggestive swagger, was considered a heart throb by many of the
village girls.
'They took the Pamiris,' Jamila told me, slowly. Then she began a monologue
so intense that I suspect she had never voiced it before.
Her story was this. One day, after months of fighting, isolation and fear,
government forces entered the valley. They asked Jamila's husband and the
other village men to find the Pamiris.
Terrified, the Tajiks descended on the houses of their Pamiri neighbours.
And then, as darkness fell, they took them up into the hills and killed
them.
Exactly how they died, Jamila did not say. But the detail that kept
recurring to me was that, when the Tajiks walked into their houses, the
Pamiris had cheerfully asked them to stay for supper. I wondered if the
James Dean lookalike had been there - and, if so, at what point he had
realised his fate.
'But why? Why them?' I asked. 'These are ordinary people]' I wanted to
shout, and then wondered how many thousands of other wives were now sitting
in Tajikistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan or Bosnia, hugging their own untold
stories of fear, madness and a terrible night when they had turned on their
neighbours.
Jamila did not answer. Probably she couldn't. Instead, she said only: 'What
happened was very, very bad. They did not deserve it.' Later, when her
daughter had gone out to play, she cried quietly.
Perhaps she was mourning for the village that, only two years ago, had been
so quiet. I like to think she was crying also for the dead Pamiris. Above
all, though, I know she was grieving with a terrible fear - because she
knows that, if the Pamiris ever return, the next victim of the killing could
be her husband.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Paraguay, pickled in its own history - The country
turned to democracy only last year. Progress remains slow
</HEADLINE>

The cab reeked of alcohol. The driver, a squat, stubble-faced man with
halting Spanish, must have been hard at the bottle. As he groped around the
unfamiliar territory of Castilian vocabulary - like many Paraguayans,
Guarani, not Spanish, was his first language - a vodka-like odour drifted
through the soupy air.
It was punishingly hot. The tarmac of the airport car park was sticky
underfoot and a ridge of sweat formed a liquid moustache over the driver's
lip.
I had just arrived. Half-an-hour earlier, I had been in the
temperature-controlled comfort of an international jet. From the air,
Asuncion, the capital, looked like a nature reserve - a vegetal mass of
trees, palms and creepers with the odd tiled rooftop peeking from the
undergrowth. A slow, brown river sludged its way through a break in the
trees, and a network of earth-red tracks spiralled off from a skeleton of
tarmaced road.
On the ground, things did not look much different. Plant life was sprouting
from every crevice, cabbage-sized flowers burst from crumbling brickwork,
trees arched precariously over roadways, and matted creepers gyrated round
lamp posts and crawled along pavement cracks. It was as if someone had
founded a capital city in the Kew Gardens hot-house.
We pulled into a petrol station, where it emerged that my first assumption
about Paraguay had been wrong: the cab driver had not been drinking. The
vodka smell odour was coming from the car's engine. Like many Paraguayan
vehicles, the taxi ran on alcohol. 'Some people drink it, too,' he said.
We drove on at snail's pace through the botanical garden-cum-city.
Everything moved slowly. People sauntered, cars meandered. Even the insects
buzzed drowsily through the air. Asuncion, unlike most other speed-crazed
Latin American cities, was dozing in the heat.
It is not surprising that Paraguay should be different from its continental
counterparts. Like a country in a jar - isolated for decades from the rest
of South America - it has been pickled in its own history. Post-independence
events began with one Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia - 'El Supremo' to his
friends - who pursued a policy of absolute isolation. From 1814 until 1840,
no one was permitted to enter or leave. There was no external trade.
In 1865, isolationism gave way to expansionism when Mariscal Francisco
Solano Lopez, a Paraguayan Napoleon, embarked on a suicidal escapade known
as the War of the Triple Alliance. Tiny Paraguay took on the combined might
of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay - and lost.
More shockingly, of its pre-war population of 800,000, only 194,000
survived. Of these, a mere 14,000 were men, a small but willing group which
set about the task of re-populating the nation.
There was still time for at least one further crazed turn of history's
wheel: the near 40-year dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner, a man
who seized control 15 years before Americans landed on the moon. Only last
year did Paraguay join the rest of the continent in taking a stab at
democracy.
All official references to Stroessner are supposed to have been removed, but
some bus companies - evidently a little below speed on recent events - still
advertise routes to streets named after him.
Such historical shenanigans have left Paraguay a little dazed. Its people
are among the poorest and shortest-lived in South America. One quarter of
them live abroad. The country has virtually no industry; its main exports
are soya and cotton.
If traces of its dictatorship are still in evidence, so are elements of its
more distant past. Scattered around the south of Paraguay, some three hours'
drive from Asuncion, are remains of several Jesuit missions, deserted since
1767 when the holy order was banished from the region.
These so-called 'reductions,' where Indians lived with priests in
self-sufficient communes, began gradually to pose a threat to the state,
which relied on Indians for slave labour. Missions were often attacked; some
communities were constantly on the run.
I stumbled across some present-day Jesuits in an out-of-the-way museum and
spent the following day with them clattering over the sweltering Paraguayan
pampas in an ancient, bright orange Jeep. The Jesuits, all training to be
priests in Belo Horizonte, were on holiday in Paraguay, killing time before
a month-long Jesuit get-together in southern Brazil.
Holidaying Jesuits - one had an antique-looking camera slung over his
shoulder, another washed down his steak lunch with a couple of beers - did
not fit my preconceptions of religious self-contemplation and withdrawal
from earthly affairs. I wondered where they got the money from.
'That's the beauty of a vow of poverty,' said Tim, a meek-looking fellow who
appeared more suited to a quiet English vicarage than the rigours of Latin
America. 'You never have to worry about money. You just ask for whatever you
need at the beginning of the month.' His advice on priestly budgeting was
always to request a third more than needed - to compensate for unholy South
American inflation.
We set off in the Jeep early one morning, yelling over the din of the
engine. Fat bugs streamed through the air towards us like fighter jets,
splattering on the windscreen and leaving a trail of multi-coloured streaks
on the glass. The landscape, swathes of brick-red earth and explosive
greens, might have been uninhabited save for tell-tale streams of rubbish
flung out of bus windows or dumped by the side of the road.
In San Ignacio Guazu, home to a stoop-backed Irish priest whose years in
South America had not dented his creamy accent, was an old Jesuit workshop
where Indians once were taught to write their own language.
The attached museum contained extraordinarily delicate carvings fashioned
out of wood by Indian craftsmen, who scaled up miniatures of saints and
religious icons brought by the Jesuits from Europe. They are some of the few
that have survived the rigours of Paraguay's stormy history and the humidity
of its stormy climate.
Back in Asuncion, the waiter in an American-style diner was holding forth on
Paraguay's latest novelty - democracy. He was standing behind a
semi-circular bar lined with bottles of ketchup and other doubtful-looking
sauces. 'I was born in a dictatorship. I grew up in a dictatorship. And I
grew old in a dictatorship,' he said, measuring out his phrases in even
portions.
Outside the diner, as if in response to his soliloquy, a tree full of
insects began to chirp, like an electric generator. 'It's going to take us a
while to learn what democracy is all about,' the waiter continued.
He had an anecdote prepared. 'Take my neighbours.' It transpired that the
people who lived in his street had taken to playing loud music at
inconvenient times. 'Twenty-four hours a day they make that racket,' he
said, ladling out another phrase. 'But whenever I go over to complain, they
tell me: 'We're living in a democracy now. We can do what we like'.'
He paused for dramatic effect. 'That's not democracy. That's stupidness.'
The insects stopped buzzing. 'It's going to take us a while to get this
thing right.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Go Baltic while there's time - John Westbrooke finds
that western influence is affecting Russia's former satellites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE

<TEXT>
For a few months, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were on the front pages,
pulling out of the crumbling Soviet Union on a last-in-first-out basis . . .
then they were gone again, their news value usurped by bloodier conflicts.
So, the three new Baltic nations were reborn quietly; few people were aware
of them before, and few are now. Go there and you will seldom see another
tourist: just rolling farmland, birch forests and unexpectedly fine cities.
Tallinn, Estonia's capital, is the most picturesque, with medieval alleys
winding up Toompea hill, heart of the Old Town, its skyline punctuated by
slender church spires and stout defensive towers: Arrow Sharpener Tower, Fat
Margaret Tower, Peek into the Kitchens Tower. If you do not feel like
walking, a little blue tourist train called Toomas will carry you.
From the top you can see out over the town, or across the Gulf of Finland
towards Helsinki. The Finns and Estonians are related and so are their
languages, which specialise in double letters (the television in our hotell
offered erootic films).
The locals claim to be sober, hard-working Lutherans. Our guidebook informed
us, sagely that 'an Estonian knows that 'more people drown in a glass of
spirits than in the sea' and that 'an inn is the Devil's chapel'.
Interesting, if true. They would be the only teetotallers north of Watford.
We found them polite and helpful although few spoke English.
In the post-Soviet economic confusion, crime has spread alarmingly. 'Not all
you read (about safety) in the Financial Times . . . should be taken too
seriously,' cautions Tallinn's City Paper, only to admit a few pages later
that its murder rate is higher than Detroit's. Take comfort, though: it is
mostly gangsters killing one another.
Riga, capital of Latvia, is much bigger. With nearly 1m people, most of them
Russians, it was a major Soviet port. At ground level, it feels a solid city
full of worthy stone edifices recalling 19th century bourgeois
respectability. There are even some old Zeppelin hangars, now housing the
town market. The delight is in the details: this is an art nouveau city to
equal Prague or Vienna, and some 800 buildings reflect Jugendstil in big
ways or small. Many were designed by Mikhail Eisenstein, father of film
director Sergei - Rigans both.
If Riga seems a bit run down after years of Soviet neglect, this has spared
it the wholesale destruction of historic areas visited on western towns. It
still has a big-city bustle. We watched in surprise one evening as two
drunks fought to a standstill while a police car trundled up.
The next day in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, another drunken brawl; this
time, the loser was pushed through a shop window. Something must be wrong
here: 15 years in London and I have never seen a real punch-up; in the
Baltics, two in two days. We should not read too much into anecdote and
coincidence, no doubt, but it is hard not to suspect a great deal of anger
and bewilderment under the surface as people wonder where their countries go
next.
There are memorials outside Vilnius's parliament to those who died in a
last-gasp Soviet attack in 1991; but since the euphoria of independence wore
off, politics has reflected the same disorientation, with voters seemingly
torn between desire for reform and nostalgia for the good old, safe old days
of Soviet hegemony.
Having been Europe's last pagans, until 1386, the Lithuanians are now mostly
Catholics, like the Poles to the south rather than their fellow Balts. Under
Moscow's rule, most of Vilnius's baroque churches were re-assigned. St
John's, the handsome university church, became a museum of scientific
thought. The domed St Casimir's, dedicated to the country's patron saint,
was a museum of atheism. The neoclassical cathedral - dating from 1387, on a
site devoted only a year earlier to the thunder god Perkunas - became an art
gallery. Symbolically, it was the first one reconsecrated.
Modern Vilnius, a green and pleasant town, can have changed little in the
past 200 years and is being rebuilt energetically. It even offers what is
reputed to be the best restaurant in the Baltics, Stikliai. Like the other
capitals, though, it still looks Soviet-poor: half-empty shops,
half-deserted roads. Outside town, the motorway passes log cabins,
horse-drawn ploughs and head-scarved women working in the fields.
None of the Baltic states is ready for mass tourism. Intourist, the Soviet
state operator, used to be king. Its hotels - graceless 20-storey slabs -
are still there. Their views are splendid, partly because they are the only
places in town from which you cannot see the Intourist hotels. But they are
now run locally and Intourist is just another client.
Sometimes, the same unhelpful staff have lingered on, saying nyet to
everything. All you can do is mutter, and give up. But the rooms are
comfortable and the food filling and the Lietuva was said to have the only
hot water in Vilnius.
Our Intourist chaperon was a pleasant chap, but he spoke none of the
languages and had not been there since independence. So, it was without his
help that we spent an entertaining morning watching folk dancing at an
open-air museum outside Tallinn - brassy music and colourful costumes, all
done for their own pleasure and not for non-existent tourists.
Baltic guidebooks are scarce: a colourful Insight guide and a chunk of
Lonely Planet's Scandinavia book seemed best. Maps are available locally; so
is Vilnius in Your Pocket, a sardonically chatty bi-monthly full of arcane
advice (police are tough on drink-driving, but the town's only breath
analyser has no mouthpiece).
As in Russia itself, streets are reverting to pre-socialist names. Local
languages, always important to the nationalist movements, are being
re-asserted; Lithuanian, close to Latvian, is said by some philologists to
be Sanskrit's nearest living relative. New currencies have arrived: the
lats, the litas and the Estonian kroon, a hard currency tied to the D-Mark.
The Russians themselves are still there, a source of continuing friction.
Estonian and Latvian attempts to disenfranchise the thousands of settlers
who do not speak the local tongue have not gone down well in Moscow. But
Russian displeasure no longer means tanks in the high street next day. In
their own ways, the Baltics are heading westward. Best see them now, before
they get there.
Operators offering Baltic tours include Intourist (tel. 071-538 3202);
Instone (081-983 0204); Finlandia (071-409 7334) and Regent (0272-211711).

FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Please, sir - you don't speak English very well -
Mark Hodson eats burnt eggs on a beach near Saigon and then finds Vietnamese
schoolchildren don't think much of his accent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not every day in Vietnam that you are invited to eat a cooked
breakfast while watching the sun rise over the South China Sea. It even
seemed worth the agony of getting up at 5.30.
I arrived on the beach thinking it would be deserted. The previous
afternoon, there had been just a handful of Saigon businessmen lying around
on deck chairs wearing suits and ties. But by 6am, the mist was rising over
the town of Nha Trang to reveal dozens of people, young and old, jogging up
and down the sand, swimming and practising tai chi.
Children in neat school uniforms played badminton without racquets, kicking
the shuttlecock studiously over an imaginary net. Loud-hailers strung on
lamp posts screamed out tinny tunes and workers' slogans.
When I got to his cafe, Chieu yelped with excitement and ran over to shake
my hand. 'I'm so glad you came,' he said. 'Sit down. I have coffee and eggs.
Yes, eggs]'
I was just in time to see the sun rise over the slick, grey water. The
palm-lined beach stretched out of eyeshot in brochure-mocking perfection.
Women wearing conical rice hats and scarves tied over their mouths swept the
sand with long witches' brooms.
An old man propped his bicycle against a tree and stood facing out to sea.
Then, with great ceremony, he reached to the sky before bending to touch his
toes.
Breakfast was not going so well. I heard shouting from the kitchen and
Chieu's friend came out to explain that they had forgotten the bread. He was
very, very sorry. He would go and buy some. I assured him I was in no hurry
but the eggs appeared within seconds, conspiring to be both burnt and
under-cooked.
Chieu's friend stayed to make sure I was enjoying them. I nodded furiously
and, between smiles, tried to force down the eggs. Ten minutes later, the
bread arrived: warm, oven-fresh baguettes.
The cutlery and plate were made of aluminium. At the end of the war,
thousands of pieces of abandoned military hardware were re-fashioned into
basic commodities; even today, scrap metal remains one of the country's most
important industries. Of all the legacies left by the Americans, this seemed
the most bizarre: eating off plates that began life as aircraft parts.
By the time the coffee arrived, the sun had risen high in the sky and the
badminton players had gone to school. Chieu joined me for the customary tea
chaser that follows the strong, gritty Vietnamese coffee.
A dejected-looking man with a battered Pentax strolled over and asked if he
could take my picture. It would cost me 15p. He was one of a dozen
photographers who worked the beach, often outnumbering the tourists.
He told me he had been a helicopter pilot during the war, fighting with the
Americans. 'I was a lootenant,' he announced in a thick Brooklyn accent.
Before the war he had taught architecture, but now he was forbidden to take
a white-collar job.
Later that day, I was back on the beach when a small man wearing thick
glasses and a shabby black suit raced after me. 'May I please ask where you
are going?' he asked.
This was stunningly polite by Vietnamese standards. I had become used to
shouts of 'You]' and 'Lien Xo]' ('Soviet]') which children yell at all
westerners, mistaking them for Russian advisers. I told him I was just
walking.
'So you are English,' he beamed. 'I can recognise your accent. I often
listen to the World Service of the BBC. What are you doing in Vietnam?' I
said I was a tourist and he looked pleased, nodding and smiling. 'You are
very welcome to my country,' he said. 'My name is Dung.'
Dung (pronounced Yoom) was 36, married with three children, and taught at a
secondary school. He earned about Pounds 3.50 a month at the prevailing
exchange rate and lived with his family in one room at the school. Dung
topped up his income by translating articles from foreign newspapers.
'Teaching is a good job,' he said. 'I am very lucky.'
Next day, I visited Dung's school and sat at the back of an open-air
classroom as he gave an English lesson. He read from a tatty, 1960s American
textbook, reciting phrases which his pupils would then repeat. That was the
lesson.
He asked me to take over. Under the watchful gaze of Ho Chi Minh, whose
photograph was pinned above my head, I stood in front of 40 wide-eyed
teenagers and read out a description of how American children celebrate
Christmas.
The pupils responded flawlessly, chanting their lines on cue: 'We find our
presents. Under the tree.' But when I tried to chat with them individually,
asking their names and ages, I drew a blank. They stood sharply to attention
but said nothing. Later, I asked Dung about this. He seemed embarrassed.
'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'They have never heard English spoken by an
English person. Please do not be offended, but they said your accent was not
very good.'
A useful brochure is that of the specialist company Asia Voyages, which
features 19 countries. It says prices for 1994 are in many cases similar to
1993 and that, if customers wish to vary their hotels, use different
airlines or alter their itineraries, this can generally be arranged.
Of Vietnam, it says: 'The infrastructure is very poor, particularly outside
Saigon and Hanoi, and you can expect very basic accommodation and simplistic
food. Domestic flights are often over-booked, delayed and even cancelled,
which can mean last-minute adjustments . . . However, the Vietnamese are
very friendly and the dramatic scenery and . . . sights more than compensate
for the discomfort and inconvenience.'
Other countries covered in its new brochure include Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia,
China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives,
Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand.
Asia Voyages is at 230 Station Road, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 2PH (tel.
0932-820 050).

FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Green and serene in downtown Tokyo - The Korakuen
garden has survived earthquake and war. Christopher McCooey finds it now to
be an oasis of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away along back streets in downtown Tokyo, just a home run hit from
the Tokyo Dome where the Yomiuri Giants baseball team plays, is a quiet
oasis of great beauty. The oldest garden in Tokyo nestles a discreet cheek
to the roistering jowl of the baseball and recreation park, typical of the
Japanese capital's startling juxtapositions.
Though it is now a sanctuary for ordinary salarymen and housewives who want
to take a breather by stepping out of Tokyo's urban roar, Korakuen garden
was at first the exclusive reserve of the city's samurai class. It was laid
out during the early years of the Tokugawa era as a formal strolling garden,
with pathways around landscaped lakes, mountains, waterfalls, rivers and
temples. Famous scenic spots of China and Japan, especially from the former
capital of Kyoto, were faithfully reconstructed in miniature.
Tokugawa Yorifusa, the feudal lord of the Mito branch of the family, started
work on digging ponds and raising hillocks in 1629, but it was his successor
who saw the completion of the task.
Tokugawa Mitsukuni had a keen interest in things Chinese, and had given
protection to Chu Shun-Shui, a refugee from the Ming dynasty of China, who
lived from 1600 to 1682. He was the garden's chief landscape architect and
his influence accounts for some features directly modelled on famous places
in China. One such spot is Korakuen's down-sized version of China's Lu Shan
mountain, as smooth and round and full as the original, the twin hillocks
totally covered with dwarf bamboo.
Originally, the area of the garden was 63 acres, but it was reduced to a
quarter of that during the city planning changes in the middle of the 19th
century. The 16 acres that remained were designated as an outstanding scenic
site of historical importance by the Cultural Property Protection Committee.
Management of the garden was turned over to the Tokyo metropolitan
government in 1936.
Unfortunately, much was destroyed by two shattering disasters to hit Tokyo
this century: the devastating Kanto earthquake and resulting fires in 1923,
and the US fire-bombing of Tokyo in 1945. Although some of the original
trees, planted in the 17th century, have survived, the original buildings on
the site - tea houses, gates, shrines - went up in flames.
The city has been busy since the second world war restoring some of
Korakuen's former glory. For example, a small but exquisite temple to
Benten, an Indian goddess of good luck, first erected 350 years ago, has
been rebuilt on an island in the middle of the garden's large,
horseshoe-shaped central lake.
Other reconstruction work is still going on with the special care so
characteristic of a formal Japanese garden, which may be described as the
enhancement of nature in the search for perfection.
Although Korakuen is overlooked by office blocks such as Toyota's Tokyo
office, it is difficult to believe that you are slap-bang in the middle of a
metropolitan area of more than 12m people. The walls and trees and bushes
mute the city's roar, and the most immediate sounds are natural ones - water
falling, wild birds calling, insects buzzing.
Korakuen has special attractions for each season, which accounts for the
regular visits by those who live or work nearby. Office workers come with
their lunch boxes of cold rice and pickled vegetables; retired men arrive
with their tripods and cameras; young men bring their girlfriends, and
housewives their gossip, to sit on benches and enjoy the parade of the
seasons.
Korakuen is at its finest in spring, when Tokyo comes alive with Japan's
beloved cherry blossoms. It is at this time that the garden has most
visitors. Masuda-san, the head gardener of five, says that 2,000 admission
tickets (Pounds 1.20 each) are sold daily during the peak hanami (cherry
blossom viewing) season in April.
Since children under 15 are admitted free, more than 3,000 may pass each day
under the stunning pink-and-white explosions. Perhaps the most impressive of
these is produced by a fine, 100-year-old weeping cherry tree standing just
inside the garden's entrance. Over 50 years ago the tree was in a sorry
state, slowly dying and unable to blossom in the spring. But it was
rejuvenated in 1942 with the botanic equivalent of a heart transplant; new
roots from a similar tree were successfully grafted on to the old stock.
Not long after the delicate cherry blossoms fade comes the mauve wisteria of
May, weeping down from the trellises. Summer is for irises, and also a time
to search out the turtles on the rocks in the ponds, their necks stretched
out and up but as still as a statue, enjoying the sun on their shells.
In October, the garden's rice field is ready to harvest. Snatch a stalk when
the gardeners are not looking and husk the grains by rubbing them palm to
palm; there is something especially reassuring about being able to pick
Japan's traditional staple in the centre of its capital sprawl.
In November, the stunning colours of autumn run riot in the garden's maple
groves. Tokyo's relatively mild winters provide only the occasional
snowscape, but there are camellias in February to brighten the subdued
browns of winter.
Korakuen abounds in small delights. Look closely in any of the garden's
ponds and you will see, vacuuming the bottom, fat goldfish so startlingly
coloured that they seem not real but painted.
There is a fascinating collection of bridges, from simple stepping stones to
proud vermilion wooden spans to a half-circle stone arch known as the
Full-Moon Bridge because its reflection in the water completes a full
circle. Tucked away in odd corners are a variety of small markers and
monuments, perhaps the most unusual of which is a stone memorial to the
seventh lord of Mito's favourite peregrine falcon.
For the less curious, Korakuen offers the priceless pleasure of immense
peace and quiet. Follow the example of the local salaryman who removes his
trademark tie, slips off his shoes (he places them neatly under his bench,
like a brace of rabbits at rest), and stretches out on a spread-open
newspaper for a delicious 30 minutes of time out.
Rest assured that you will be woken from your reverie by nothing more
jarring than the rolling splosh of a carp, the tseep, tseep of a handful of
whiteyes picking their way through the foliage, or the whiffling whistle of
a wintering wigeon.
Korakuen garden is less than 10 minutes' walk from Suidobashi subway station
on the blue Toei Mita line (all of Tokyo's subway and rail lines are
colour-coded). Walk west (towards Iidabashi) in front of the main entrance
to Tokyo Dome and, after passing the huge Toyota building, turn right down
the next side street: the entrance to the garden is 200 yards on the right.
The garden is open every day except Monday, from 9am to 4pm. If a public
holiday falls on a Monday, the garden opens that day but closes the
following Tuesday. An illustrated guidebook in English and Japanese is
available for about Pounds 1.80.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Establishing the facts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have two questions on capital gains tax.
1. I hold shares in a company that went into receivership in 1991 and was
declared (or so I understand from a circular the company sent me) of nil
value by the Inland Revenue.
Can I index the losses to the date when the Revenue declared them nil value
(this was before the Budget)?
2. I hold shares in two companies from the early 1980s. Both were registered
in Amsterdam and both have 'disappeared from the scene,' probably because
they were fraudulent. Am I entitled to indexation on these losses?
1. If the company was still in existence on November 30 last year, then you
will get no indexation allowance at all, as you will see from the free
Budget press release 1R28 (obtainable from the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry
Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB).
In saying this, we are assuming that you mean you did not submit a
negligible-value claim (under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992) before Budget day.
On the other hand, if the company was struck off (or otherwise ceased to
exist) before November 30, you will get indexation allowance up to the day
of striking-off (or extinction), and the indexed loss will be deemed to have
accrued on that day, by virtue of section 24(1).
This says that 'the occasion of the . . . extinction of an asset shall, for
the purposes of this Act, constitute a disposal of the asset.'
2. If the companies were fictitious, then you will get no loss relief at all
(because what you lost was sterling, which is outside the scope of CGT,
presumably).
If the companies were real, then the answer is the same as to question 1. In
practice, of course, the cost of trying to establish the facts to the
satisfaction of the Inland Revenue (or, on appeal, the General or Special
Commissioners, ) could be prohibitive.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Eligible for indexation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In Briefcase (January 15/16), you say CGT indexation can now be used to
mitigate gains but not to increase losses on gilt unit trusts. Could you
tell me:
1. Does the application of indexation apply in retrospect from the date of
purchase or only from the date when the Finance Bill became law?
2. Does the new rule apply to all gilt and/or fixed-interest unit trusts?
What is the CGT position regarding transfers of investments (unit trusts)
from spouse to spouse. Do such transfers, carried out in accordance with the
the standard stock transfer form, now constitute a disposal by the
transferer, or does the original base rate still apply for indexation?
1. All assets disposed-of after November 29 last year are eligible for
indexation allowance from the month of acquisition to the month of disposal
(up to the amount of the unindexed gain, if any).
The denial of indexation relief against gains on gilt unit trust units etc
(after March 19 1990), and on shares in UK building societies and industrial
and provident societies (after July 3 1987), is to be abolished by
sub-sections 7 and 11 of clause 89 of the Finance Bill, as published on
January 11*.
The restoration of indexation relief for gains on building society shares
will benefit trustees, in particular, on the occasion of deemed disposals at
market value (when the market value reflects accrued income and is,
consequently, above par).
2. Such transfers have always constituted a disposal by one spouse and an
acquisition by the other; but they have been, and continue to be, treated as
made for such a consideration as will give the transferer neither a gain nor
a loss.
The difference, broadly speaking, which is made by sub-sections 4, 5, 6 and
11 of clause 89, is that a transfer after November 29 will not give the
transferee the benefit of the transferer's indexation (up to the month of
the transfer) unless, and then to the extent that, the transferee has a
potentially taxable gain on her or his eventual disposal.
In making plans on the basis of the Budget proposals and the original
(417-page) version of the Finance Bill, you must bear in mind that every
finance bill is amended substantially by the government of the day during
its passage through the House of Commons. The present bill is unlikely to
receive its third reading until quite late in April.
*'(7) Sections 103 (collective investment schemes, etc.), 111 (building
society etc. shares), 182 to 184 (groups and associated companies) and 200
(oil industry assets) of that Act (all of which relate to indexation
allowance) shall cease to have effect.'
'(11) This section shall have effect in relation to disposals made on or
after 30th November 1993.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: When a gain can be a loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For CGT, I understand that indexing the cost of shares is no longer
permissible if they are sold at a loss but is still available when a sale
results in a gain.
Say I buy shares for Pounds 1,000 and sell them for Pounds 1,400. Since
there is a gain, I am allowed to index the base cost. But what happens if
the indexation takes the base cost from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,600. A
money gain of Pounds 400 has become an indexed loss of Pounds 200?
Since indexation is not permitted to increase a loss, what should I do? Do I
declare a gain of Pounds 400, a loss of Pounds 200, or nil gain?
The answer is neither a chargeable gain nor an allowable loss. If shares
which cost Pounds 1,000 are sold in a month for which the indexation factor
is 60 per cent, it makes no difference if the net proceeds are Pounds 1,600
or Pounds 1,000: the result for CGT purposes is zero.
Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand,
London, WC2R 1LB, for a (free) copy of the Budget day press release IR28
(Capital gains: indexation allowance and capital losses).

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Supplementing a pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have retired and, to supplement my pension, I propose letting two rooms in
my principal residence as bed-sits under the government scheme which allows
an annual income of Pounds 3,250 without tax liability.
1. As this is my principal residence, will letting the rooms affect the CGT
exemption?
2. If I keep within the Pounds 3,250 limit, need I declare this income on my
annual tax return?
1. No (so far as we can deduce from the facts given). Ask your tax office
for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and IR87 (Rooms to let).
2. Yes.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Exemption from CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am out of work and receiving unemployment benefit plus a small
occupational pension which, because I am under 55, is untaxed. I do,
however, invest in both shares and traded options and am showing a
reasonable profit at the moment. I realise that capital gains tax is levied
at whatever rate of tax one pays on income, so could you confirm that, as a
non-taxpayer, my earnings on shares and options are exempt?
Someone whose income is too small to attract any income tax liability for
the present 1993-94 tax year is liable to pay capital gains tax on the
following scale: No CGT on the first Pounds 5,800; 20 per cent on the next
Pounds 2,500; 25 per cent on the next Pounds 21,200; 40 per cent on the
rest. Ask your tax office for the free introductory booklet to capital gains
tax, CGT14.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Investing for grand-daughter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly two years, I have been putting about Pounds 60 a month in an
investment trust savings scheme on behalf of my grand-daughter, now aged
four. The shares are in my name. I intend to continue investing until she is
18.
The investment will no doubt become a substantial sum while, at the same
time, producing significant dividends. Am I correct in assuming that,
provided her annual income does not exceed the single person's tax
allowance, she will be able to claim a tax refund on the dividends?
Also, when she receives the accumulated investment at 18, if/when she sells
the shares, will any associated capital gains be her responsibility and not
mine?
The fact that you have kept the shares in your own name (instead of simply
handing the monthly gifts of cash over to the girl's guardians for
investment on her behalf) might be taken as evidence that, although you plan
to give the shares to your granddaughter one day - when she is 18, for
example - they remain your own property at present.
You might wish to consult a solicitor about executing a declaration of trust
if there is no clear evidence of your bare trusteeship (such as a letter to
the girl's guardians and their consent to the shares being held in your name
rather than theirs). It could be, of course, that you consider the guardians
to be untrustworthy.

Does a taxpayer have any right to ask that his tax affairs be dealt with at
an office close to his residence?
Mine have been handled in the local IR office in Devon for the past 13
years, which is handy for local telephone calls and visits. Now it says my
affairs are to be handled in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 300 miles away.
The only reason it gives me is that Newcastle is the source of the major
part of my pension income.
Write to the Controller, Inland Revenue South-west Regional Office, Finance
House, Barnfield Road, Exeter EX1 1QX (quoting your tax district and
reference number) and explain why it makes sense for your tax affairs to
continue to be dealt with at your local office.
You could also ask for a copy of the free leaflet IR120 (You and the Inland
Revenue), either from the regional office or from your local office. At the
same time, you might like to write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry
Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, for a free copy of Budget
press release IR3 (Self-assessment and simplification of personal tax).

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Transfer could be costly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I will soon be able to exercise a share option in my name which will be
subject to CGT. Since the gain exceeds the tax-free allowance, I intend to
transfer some shares to my wife, which she will then sell. How will the gain
be assessed for CGT, assuming that all transactions happen on the same day?
Your tax inspector (and your wife's) could well take the view that you have
merely used your wife as a nominee or puppet, so that any gains are
assessable upon you alone. You have the right to appeal, as outlined in the
free pamphlet IR37 (Income tax and capital gains tax: appeals), but we doubt
if you would succeed.
To make clear that your wife is acting on her own initiative, and that your
gift of shares reflects a bona fide wish to give her a measure of financial
freedom, it is preferable that no sale take place until after the shares
have been registered in her name for some time.
The proceeds, and any dividends in the meantime, should be credited to an
account in your wife's sole name (to which you have no access). None of the
money should find its way back to you, even indirectly.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: A case of statutory sex discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I are both in the 65-74 age bracket, but, while I have an income
above the limit below which I could claim some or all of the age-related
married couple's allowance, my wife has a much lower income and could claim
all of it.
If we elected to transfer the allowance from me to her, could she then claim
the age-related married allowance in addition to the basic married
allowance? The tax office says she cannot but, for the life of me, I can't
see why not.
The tax office is right; parliament has forbidden the transfer of anything
more than the basic Pounds 1,720. This is explained briefly in the free
pamphlet IR121 (Income tax and pensioners).
If you object to this piece of statutory sex discrimination, you might like
to write to your MP at the House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts keep their appeal - But how
should you buy them? / A look at the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back to basics is a slogan more suited to private investors than
politicians. Now that the base rate, currently 5.25 per cent, appears to be
approaching its lowest point, investors may need to re-examine the fixed
income element of their portfolios.
UK government bonds, known as gilts, have provided investors with the chance
to earn a higher yield or income available from bank or building society
accounts in the past couple of years. Interest rates have been declining
since the end of 1990, but those investors hungry for income can still get a
higher yield from long-dated gilts than from a standard deposit account.
At the top end of the range, bank and building society accounts offer
between 5-6 per cent gross. Redemption yields on longer-dated gilts were
hovering at just below 7 per cent last week, giving a real return of just
over 4 per cent.
However, those investors hoping to see a continuation of the gilt market
rally and the prospect of further capital gains may need to reconsider their
strategy. Economists and bond analysts are wondering if the bull run in
gilts has much further to go.
Providing inflation stays firmly under control, some economists think the
base rate could come down further, perhaps to 4 per cent. But many big
institutional investors, with a more international portfolio, regard the
gilt market as overvalued.
There are three main ways to buy or sell gilts.
The National Savings
Stock Register (NSSR)
This method has the advantage of being cheap in terms of commission and
convenient in that you receive your dividend income gross (although
taxpayers, of course, are obliged to declare the income), but the
disadvantage is that you buy and sell 'blind.'
The NSSR offers the complete range of gilts. You simply fill in a purchase
or sale application form, available from most post offices, and send it off
with your cheque. You can either invest a specified sum of money (in which
case, you simply make the cheque out for the sum invested plus the
appropriate commission), or you can buy a specified nominal amount of stock
(which means you leave the cheque blank so that the cost can be calculated
once the price at which the stock is purchased is known).
The NSSR is probably the best way of buying small amounts of stock because
the commissions are low - Pounds 1 for amounts up to Pounds 250. Above
Pounds 250, there is an extra 50p for each multiple of Pounds 125 purchased.
Selling commissions are 10p for every Pounds 10 (or part) on sums under
Pounds 100, and Pounds 1 on sums of Pounds 100-Pounds 250. Above Pounds 250,
the cost is Pounds 1, with a further 50p for every additional Pounds 125.
The main disadvantage of the NSSR is that you have no say in the price you
pay for the individual stock. The NSSR aims to process applications the
morning they arrive but, like many financial markets, the gilts market can
be volatile. Good news, such as the release of an unexpectedly low inflation
figure, can send prices much higher, whereas bad news, such as a high
government borrowing forecast, can depress them.
Your bank or stockbroker
Commissions charged by banks and stockbrokers vary but tend to be higher
than those charged by the NSSR.
Sharelink, an execution-only broker, charges 1.5 per cent on the first
Pounds 2,500, 0.75 per cent for the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on
amounts over Pounds 5,000. Stockbroker Killik &amp; Co charges 1 per cent on the
first Pounds 10,000, 0.4 per cent on the next Pounds 10,000, and 0.125 per
cent on additional sums.
The big banks also have dealing services for small investors. For example,
NatWest has gilt buying and selling services for customers and
non-customers. If you are a customer, you can go into a branch and place
your order over the counter. There is a minimum commission of Pounds 25. For
sums up to Pounds 5,000, you pay 1 per cent commission; for the next Pounds
15,000, 0.5 per cent. There is also a Pounds 1 administration charge.
Alternatively, customers and non-customers can use NatWest's 'brokerline'
telephone dealing service. Again, the minimum charge is Pounds 25.
Commission is 0.75 per cent on deals of up to Pounds 5,000 and 0.25 per cent
on the next Pounds 15,000, with an administration charge of Pounds 1.
Although the bank or broker route is more expensive, you do have more
flexibility when it comes to choosing when to buy or sell. Your broker
should also be able to advise you about which particular issue to buy, and
whether it is ex-dividend or approaching the dividend payment date.
Given the strong rally in the gilt market over the last three years,
investors going into the market now are likely to find stocks are trading
above par (in other words, above a price of 100). Gilts are redeemed at par,
so you will make a capital loss if you hold onto such an issue until
maturity. A broker should be able to advise you when to switch into a new,
more attractive issue.
Income from gilts is taxable but capital gains are tax-exempt. However,
capital losses on the gilts cannot be used to offset other capital gains. If
you buy gilts through a broker, you are buying them from the Bank of England
register and your income will be paid net.
Non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax, but if you want to receive your income
gross, you can transfer Pounds 5,000 nominal of any one stock in any given
calendar year from the Bank of England register to the NSSR.
The unit trust route
If you prefer to leave the management of your gilt portfolio to someone
else, but have a relatively small amount of money to invest, probably the
most efficient route is through a unit trust. But be warned: there are
plenty of gilt unit trusts which have underperformed the FTA British
Government All-Stocks index in the past 12 months.
As a unit trust investor, you are liable to both income and capital gains
tax (but you have a Pounds 5,800 capital allowance). Most unit trusts also
charge: apart from a front-end fee (between 0-4 per cent), there is the
annual fee (of 0.75-1.25 per cent).
Finally, remember that investing in gilts is more risky than putting your
money on deposit in a bank or building society, since gilt prices can rise
or fall.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family:  Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reporting season has not yet really started and many directors remain
constrained by their closed seasons. Buying remains muted, but some sizeable
sell transactions have been noted.
Rodime has interests in computing. In August, three members of the board -
including Malcolm McIver, the non-executive chairman, managing director
Peter Bailey and James Swent, a non-executive director, bought more than
7.2m shares at 8p each.
The share price performance has been prodigious since then, and the sale of
more than 2.6m by the same three directors was made at 44.75p. The shares
have come back a little and are trading now around 38p.
SJPC 1990 used to be known as St James' Place Capital and is associated
mainly with Lord Rothschild as his investment vehicle. The other large
shareholder is Nils Taube.
Recently, he announced his intention to retire and has now sold more than
half his holding, a total of 2.5m shares. Clive Gibson also sold stock,
partly on behalf of his family trust.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Directors' deals - Are they a guide?
/ The significance of boardroom share manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN GREGORY and JOHN MATATKO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can directors predict the direction of their companies' share price better
than the average outsider?
Investors and academics alike have been intrigued by this question. Clearly,
many believe that buying shares when directors buy, and selling when they
sell, is a sound investment strategy.
This has produced a demand for the type of directors' trading information
produced by specialist agencies such as Directus, which is summarised each
Saturday in the Weekend FT. Academics, too, have brought their databases and
statistical analyses to bear on the problem.
Early studies in the United States seemed to confirm that it was possible to
outperform the market by following directors' transactions. Unfortunately,
later research suggested that the outperformance was larger in small firms.
In both the US and Britain, the bid/offer spread (the difference between the
price at which a broker will buy and sell shares) is larger in the case of
small companies.
Because of this, it appears that returns probably were not big enough to
cover the costs of dealing when the directors did so.
The first studies in the UK produced conflicting results, with one
suggesting insignificant (although positive) returns following directors'
purchases and significant negative returns following sales.
The other, which used the Financial Times directors' trading reports as its
data source, showed highly significant positive returns following purchases
but insignificant negative returns after sales.
Given the contradictory evidence from previous research, we undertook a
study* to see if it was, in fact, possible to earn abnormal returns by
copying the directors' trading patterns.
Abnormal returns are the differences between actual returns and those which
might have been expected from general market movements and the relative risk
of the shares.
In the table, it appears that statistically significant abnormal returns of
around 14.5 per cent arise in the two years following directors' purchases,
with -6.5 per cent arising in the two years following sales.
Roughly two-thirds of these totals are earned by the end of the first year,
with comparatively little occurring in the first month following the trade.
Our research showed also that the large proportion of the positive abnormal
returns following directors' purchases occur in small and medium size firms.
We believe it is essential to allow for the fact that such firms
outperformed larger firms during the period of the investigation
(1984-1988).
More generally, research by professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, of the
London Business School, has shown that small firms have, on average,
performed considerably more strongly than large firms since 1955. If an
allowance is not made for this, it is easy to confuse apparently significant
outperformance with a 'small firms' effect.
Once we take this superior performance by smaller companies into account,
the size of these apparently significant abnormal returns is reduced
substantially. Although they remain significant statistically after
directors' purchases, they become insignificant following sales.
Excluding all purchases and sales related to share options, the 'buy'
transactions produce cumulative average abnormal returns of about 2.3 per
cent after six months, 6 per cent after 12 months, and 8.9 per cent after
two years, with the latter two returns being significant statistically.
On the 'sell' side, the average transaction underperforms by 1.6 per cent
after six months, 1.5 per cent after 12 months and 2.1 per cent after two
years, although none of these returns is significant.
In our view, these figures - adjusted for 'size effect' - are the true
average superior returns which accrue to a strategy of copying directors'
transactions in their own companies. But there are two caveats.
One is that our data is based necessarily upon a sample of 1,653
non-option-related trades in 150 companies. Another is that this sample was
selected to exclude any firms which were taken over or went into
receivership between 1984 and 1988.
Nonetheless, some striking conclusions emerge from this research. The first
is that 'buy' signals have much stronger associations with outperformance
than do 'sell' signals with underperformance.
The second is that the outperformance persists for as much as two years
after the directors' purchases. This is consistent with directors taking a
medium to long term view of their company's prospects when buying shares.
Finally, this research emphasises the need to take proper account of both a
share's risk and its size-related return when measuring the abnormal
performance associated with any trading strategy.
Failing to recognise this 'small companies effect' can mis-represent
substantially the scale of these abnormal returns.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: A sector in need of facts - John
Cuthbert continues his analysis of UK growth unit trusts and argues that
more data is needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK growth unit trust sector contains very different types of funds.
Despite appearing under the classification 'growth,' for example, there are
funds distinguished better by their specialisation and unique risk/return
signatures than by a growth approach to investment.
Last week, I divided the sector into specialist funds - such as recovery and
special situations funds which pursue growth with a twist - and
non-specialist funds. I argued that specialist funds were not really growth
funds at all.
The second class of funds in the sector, the non-specialists, can, by
contrast, be described as growth funds. The problem here is that the notion
of growth has two meanings.
On the one hand, it refers to the fund's aim: the growth of capital. And,
indeed, all these funds pursue this aim. On the other, however, growth also
describes a distinct investment approach: the purchase of stocks with
earnings growth rates higher than the market average. This is an exacting
standard for which, sadly, few funds qualify.
The question here is: which notion of growth is the more valuable guide? The
answer depends largely on exactly what you think sector classification is
for.
My view is that sector labels are a way for investors and advisers to
compare relative performance. Only funds with the same characteristics
(these help to explain the way their price behaves) and orientation
(something which comes through in the risk/return profile) should be lumped
together - in which case, the specialist class of funds should be split into
three new sectors: aggressive growth, cautious growth and growth.
Aggressive growth funds would be those which pursue a true 'growth'
investment approach - stocks with high rates of earnings growth. Cautious
funds would include the six (Axa E&amp;L British Excellence, Gartmore British,
Henderson Best of British, Invesco Ruperts Children's, Mercury British Blue
Chip and TSB British Growth) which retain a virtually constant exposure to
the 100 biggest (FT-SE 100) stocks, as well as a further group which retain
a core bias towards FT-SE stocks.
The new Growth sector would contain a group of more independent funds which
trawl the whole market for the best buys.
Reclassification alone, however, will not do. Many funds, aggressive and
growth alike, often pay over the odds for growth stocks. Likewise, many
cautious funds often conduct extra growth sorties into the ranks of
medium-sized and smaller companies.
Both factors can change a fund's risk and character considerably. So, we
also need some way in which these characteristics also can be made apparent.
My recommendation is that Autif, the investment fund trade body, should
insist that all unit trusts (and not just growth funds) disclose five
things: average price/earnings ratio, average price/book ratio, five-year
earnings growth rate, their size relative to the FT-A All-Share index, and
fund composition by stock size (small, medium and large).
If this is done, many of the problems that arise from attempting to
second-guess the true character of benighted funds would have a solution.
A fund which displayed a high p/e relative to the market, for example, would
raise the suspicion that the manager had paid over the odds. If a cautious
fund, which should have market average earnings growth, suddenly produces
earnings growth well above this, this boost might suggest that it has become
less cautious.
Recent history points also to the value of such information for portfolio
planning. The most successful UK equity strategy over the past four years
would have been holding FT-SE stocks with high earnings growth in the two
years up to Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 - and
then shifting into undervalued medium and small-sized companies immediately
thereafter. But without disclosing more information, this type of portfolio
planning - essential to beat the market - will remain whimsy.
Whatever Autif decides, we should stick to risk-adjustment of total returns
as the performance standard. Risk-adjustment provides us with a way of
assessing if the causes of a fund's performance include managerial ability
or if they are just the exclusive product of risk.
This works by applying a minimal standard for performance. It requires that
the total returns of active managers beat a passive measure (that is, one
where no managerial decisions are involved), such as the FT-SE A All-Share.
But because managers could beat the All-Share simply by increasing risk,
they should demonstrate also that they can better the All-Share on a
risk-adjusted basis.
Of the 74 non-specialist growth funds with five-year histories that I
surveyed, only eight make the grade - that is, their performances are of a
sufficient size to suggest that something more than mere risk has been at
work.
Of these eight, none has achieved this through a strict growth strategy. The
majority blend their selections into a mix of stocks with
higher-than-average earnings growth rates and stocks which are undervalued.
The non-specialist class, however, is dominated by three funds - Pembroke,
Gartmore British and AIB Grofund - the consistency of which, relative to the
All-Share, indicates clearly that superior managerial ability is at work.
Surprisingly, there is very little to chose between these funds in terms of
risk, so the differences in the risk/return scores are due mainly to total
returns.
Whether the performance of these funds continues in the same way depends on
their present average p/e and earnings growth rates. Without this
information, the future of these funds is a matter of conjecture.
It is time, I think, to recognise that a sector of this size, and the Pounds
12bn of investors' money sunk into it, should be both reclassified and
strengthened by the disclosure of further information.

Years are December 31st to December 31st. NB The five year total is
based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the five
year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic
difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or
benchmark ratio expresses the percentage non-cumulative total return
outperformance over the FT-All Share by the fund over the five years.
Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is measured by the
standard deviation of monthly returns over five years to Dec 31, 1993.
Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by
the sector's average standard deviation of 4.74. Risk/return is the
division of the five year average monthly total return by the five year
standard deviation of monthly returns. The five year risk/return figure
for the All-Share Index is 0.29. Return data, offer-to-offer, net

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Sensible way to a balanced portfolio
 -Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professional investors value bonds for their redemption yield (total return)
rather than price. Normally, a rise in the yield of a bond with a short life
(say, three years) will equate to a much smaller fall in price than would
the same yield movement in a 25-year bond.
The longest bonds of all are irredeemables, known also as perpetuals. For
these, which pay a fixed rate of interest without limit, a general change in
yield levels can exaggerate greatly the price movements of shorter bonds.
This is known as volatility.
Permanent interest-bearing shares, which are irredeemable fixed-income
securities issued by building societies, have recorded sharp falls recently,
partly because of their volatility. But the extent of the falls has had an
interesting side-effect.
The ease with which Pibs may be bought, and held, has resulted in a high
proportion of them being held by private investors. But the market is
dominated by institutional investors because of the greater liquidity
(dealing in large size) in the perpetual Eurosterling market.
Over recent weeks there have been some selling orders in Pibs, forcing
prices down to levels not seen for several months. But few professionals
have sold their perpetuals. Why not? The main reason is the problem of
re-investment. Often, bonds are the core holdings of a larger portfolio for
generating a consistent flow of income. If high-yielding bonds are sold, the
income from the portfolio will fall.
Of course, if you are sure that bond prices are going to fall and equities
will rise, a switch into shorter-dated bonds or equities would be well
advised for the shorter term. But no one ever can be certain where markets
will go next.
At times like this, investors must ask themselves: why do I invest? If the
main reason is income, then compare the return from bonds with that
available elsewhere. Annuity rates are low, while UK deposit rates continue
to fall.
For a low-risk portfolio with a more moderate income, you should consider
short-dated bonds. If you require a balanced portfolio with income, hold a
proportion of the money in bonds and build capital via equities or
equity-based investments.
This means that while the value of your portfolio fluctuates, the bonds will
continue to pay a fixed income (however, the benefit of a fixed income is
not normally possible from bond funds).
For the more cautious seeker of a balanced portfolio, a mixture of bonds and
zero dividend preference shares could well provide the ideal combination.
But if your only desire is for capital gains, then perhaps now is not the
time for any sort of bond.

is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients directly. Readers
interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Errors in tax codings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many employees are getting wrong tax codings because of changes to car and
personal benefits, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Sir Anthony Battishill,
chairman of the Inland Revenue, said this week that mistakes were made in 9
per cent of all dealings with pay-as-you-earn employees.
About 15m codes are being sent out compared with 8m last year, mainly
because of the restriction of the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent
instead of the taxpayer's marginal rate. The allowance is Pounds 1,720 for
those under 65 and, from April 6, it will be worth only Pounds 344 instead
of Pounds 430 to a basic-rate taxpayer, or Pounds 688 to a higher-rate
payer.
The most common coding problems are:
Company cars. The system for assessing benefits will change from April 6 but
Andrew Shaw, tax partner at City accountant Kingston Smith, says: 'All the
codes I have seen so far have used the old 1993/94 scale benefit.' The new
scheme will be based on the original list price of the car instead of scale
charges. The Revenue says that if the word 'new' in brackets does not
appear, it is probable the old system has been used.
Cars more than four years old in 1994/95 qualify for a one-third reduction
in the taxable benefit but, often, this is not reflected in the codes.
The married couple's allowance. The only way the Paye system can deal with
this year's change is to restrict the allowance, according to Martin Donn,
of chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'The Revenue has had to guess
whether an individual will be paying tax for 1994/95 at 20, 25 or 40 per
cent in order to include the correct 'allowance restriction',' he says.
'Very strange numbers have been appearing in coding notices as a result.'
Under or overpayment of tax. The Revenue will adjust codes to reflect either
case. Often, this can often lead to errors.
'Other' benefits. Shaw says deductions for 1994/95 are based on 1992/93
benefits provided by the employer but these have changed in many cases.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Sun shines on - But while pension
performance is strong, the charges are hefty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1810, as the company's official history records, 'several highly
respectable and opulent gentlemen, having it in contemplation to establish a
society for life insurance with an ample and bona fide capital,' hired an
actuary and set up Sun Life Assurance.
A few years later, the staff doubled with the addition of an 18-year-old
clerk, who retired at 66 and drew a Pounds 500 pension for 30 years. As he
continued to collect it in person, he would proclaim: 'Ah] You can't kill an
annuitant.'
The company now has total assets under management of Pounds 16bn and is
owned equally by UAP, the largest insurance company in France, and Liberty
Life, South Africa's third-largest life assurance concern. They acquired
their stakes in 1992; since then, shares in Sun Life have not been traded.
The society offers an innovative range of pension products and is
particularly strong in the small company pensions market. Its mainstream
personal pensions are considered to be among the best available, while
clients with more than Pounds 20,000 to invest can take advantage of a
low-cost, discretionary private fund facility.
Sun Life was one of the first life offices to sell 'unitised' with-profits
individual pension plans, which aimed to simplify the complex structure of
the traditional with-profits contract. Under a unitised plan, the fund -
which invests chiefly in equities, property and gilts - is split into units
which can be bought and sold in the same way as other unit-linked funds.
The two main advantages for clients are a more explicit charging structure
(fees on traditional with-profits contracts are notorious for being obscure)
and being able to switch between the with-profits fund and those that are
unit-linked.
The society's charges may be explicit, but user-friendly they are not. Take
a regular premium contract. During the first two years, your premiums buy
capital units which carry an extra annual fund management charge of 3.5 per
cent in addition to the l per cent charge on the accumulation units
purchased from year three. This hefty charge on capital units is maintained
throughout the full term of the contract. But where no commission is paid to
the adviser, capital units account for only the first year's premiums, while
single premium investments purchase only accumulation units.
In addition to the annual management charge, there is an initial management
charge (the bid/offer spread) of between 5-6 per cent, plus charges for
administration and switching between funds.
For those who stay the course, Sun Life pays an 'extra fund injection'
loyalty bonus on plans that reach the agreed retirement date. The bonus
rebates some of the regular charges levied over the years, together with an
allowance for investment growth. This helps to explain the society's
competitive 'reduction in yield' figure of 1.2 per cent, which shows the
equivalent annual percentage charge over the life of the contract.
The bonus helps to offset the otherwise relatively high charges of the early
years. But the society also imposes a penalty on contracts terminated early.
If you stop payments after 10 years on a 25-year contract, you will lose
more than 50 per cent of the value of the capital units bought in the first
two years.
John Woolnough, Sun Life's business development manager for individual
pensions, argues that the overall level of charges should be considered in
the light of other important features. He says: 'The client's adviser should
recommend a company with consistently good performance over different
periods of time, backed by a long-established investment team. Higher
charges can be an irrelevance if the performance is good.'
Certainly, Sun Life is on firm ground when it comes to that. The two most
popular personal pension plans - the unitised with-profits and unit-linked
managed funds - are top performers over the short and long term. The
compound annual growth rate of the managed fund (which invests in all of the
society's specialist funds) is 20.02 per cent since its launch in May 1980,
compared with the sector average of 16.76.
The number of transfer plans the society has sold to employees with company
scheme benefits is low compared with competitors: 15,000, of which only
3,000 were through direct sales. Nevertheless, Sun Life is reviewing all
3,000 to check that each was in the best interests of the client.

Charges At present life office illustrations of what your investment
may produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact
of real charges on the final fund of Sun Life's managed unit-linked
plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45
who expects to retire at age 65 (ie a 20-year contract), paying (a)
Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds
10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are
much lower than charges used by most life offices, are shown in
brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges
were made.
The growth assumptions are Lautro's standard 6 per cent and 12 per cent.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Fixed-rate mortgages are just too
popular - Lenders want to switch emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate mortgages have proved so popular with new borrowers that lenders
have been trying gradually to shift attention back to their more profitable
variable rates.
Two years ago, 27 per cent of new mortgages had the interest rate fixed;
this rose to 60 per cent between June and September 1993 (the most recent
figure from the Council of Mortgage Lenders).
'We want a balance between fixed rate and variable rate business,' says
Halifax, the largest lender which, with half its new loans on fixed rates,
is below the market average. 'Too high a proportion of fixed rates leaves us
with less flexibility if interest rates turn against us. We do not want to
leave ourselves open to adverse market conditions.'
Halifax offers first-year discounts of up to 3.5 percentage points on its
variable rate of 7.64 per cent.
Last September, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester introduced a one-year discount of 2
percentage points on its variable rate, which has been increased to 3
percentage points. This brings down the variable rate to 4.64 per cent to
borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit.
Abbey National has also brought in discounts of up to 2.25 points until July
31 1995 on its present variable rate.
Northern Rock will post borrowers a cheque for Pounds 1,000 two weeks after
they complete a mortgage with the society - but only if the loan is on a
variable rate. Northern also gives discounts of up to 4.24 percentage points
on the variable rate until April 1 1995.
From Monday, Britannia building society will - for one week only - give a
discount of 5 percentage points on its variable rate to those with a 25 per
cent deposit. This brings down the rate to 2.75 per cent until January 1
1995. Britannia provided funds for essentially the same package marketed
last week by mortgage broker John Charcol and Scottish Life. But there is a
disadvantage in going directly to Britannia in that you would have to take
out the society's buildings and contents insurance.
Lenders are keen to focus attention on variable rates because, with base
rates at 5.25 per cent and the standard variable mortgage rate at about 7.64
per cent, margins are much wider than on the fixed rates. 'The variable rate
is more profitable for us because we launch fixed rates on tight margins to
attract new business,' says C&amp;G.
For borrowers, there is a danger that this shift of emphasis might mean that
the choice of good fixed rates will begin to ebb. Nationwide, for example,
has just launched some new fixed rates which are higher than those they
replaced. The two and three-year fixes, available to all home-buyers, are
6.2 and 6.65 per cent and replace those of 5.99 and 6.45 per cent.
This does not necessarily mean fixed rates have hit the bottom - many
economic strategists expect base rates to fall further in the UK. But
choosing a fixed rate now could be a good move. If, however, your own lender
does not offer competitive fixed rates, the cost of re-mortgaging - moving
from one lender to another - could be prohibitive.
Alan Patten, senior property partner at London-based solicitor Harbottle and
Lewis, says: 'A lender will treat a re-mortgage as a completely new
transaction so it will want a new local search.
'There will be a land registry fee to pay and the solicitor's conveyancing
costs for checking titles and preparing and registering the new mortgage.
But at least there will be no stamp duty.'
John Charcol estimates that typical costs on a Pounds 100,000 mortgage are
Pounds 260 for the land registry fee, Pounds 100 for the local search and
Pounds 225 for the conveyancing fee. Other costs include a mortgage
valuation fee (about Pounds 225) although some some, such as Halifax, C&amp;G
and Nationwide, will waive or refund this.
There will be early redemption penalties if you are already on a fixed rate,
a fee for the new fixed-rate mortgage, and a new mortgage indemnity premium.
The latter is calculated on a percentage of the amount borrowed above 75 per
cent of the value. Woolwich says a 90 per cent mortgage on a property worth
Pounds 112,000 would incur an indemnity premium of Pounds 1,200.
Lenders are usually happy to work through the figures to see if it is worth
making a switch, and some make it easier financially than others to
transfer.
Midland bank, for instance, is offering to pay legal and valuation costs for
home-owners switching before the end of the month to one of two of its fixed
rates - a five-year fix of 7.25 per cent or a two-year fix of 5.95 per cent.
There is no fee for the fixed rates but it will not pay indemnity premiums.
John Charcol will pay the re-mortgage costs for those transferring to a
five-year fixed rate of 6.99 per cent; it charges Pounds 250 instead of the
typical costs on a Pounds 100,000 mortgage of more than Pounds 1,000. The
offer is limited to those with a deposit of at least 25 per cent.
Maximum loan size is Pounds 250,000 and the mortgage is with Bank of
Ireland, which has a competitive variable rate of 7.6 per cent. There are no
compulsory insurance-related products and the mortgage is available on all
repayment types as well as being portable.
Ian Darby, of John Charcol, estimates that people on high fixed rates would
make substantial savings by switching. If someone took out one of the most
popular fixed rates in 1992 - 10.65 per cent for five years - the cost of
re-mortgaging with the John Charcol package would be Pounds 2,912
(comprising Pounds 2,662 for six months' gross redemption penalty and the
Pounds 250 re-mortgaging fee).
The customer would save Pounds 10,156 in lower interest payments over the
three years left of the fixed-rate mortgage, leading to a net saving of
Pounds 7,244. It would take just over 10 months to recover the cost of the
mortgage.
One caution, though: anyone considering a re-mortgage should check that they
will not lose any tax relief.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Where value comes first - Joanna
Slaughter on Boyton Financial Services. Fourth of a series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1986 Financial Services Act, which spells out the industry's system of
regulation, is not every independent financial adviser's favourite piece of
legislation. But Richard Boyton identifies it as the turning point in his
career.
Boyton, founder of the Essex-based firm Boyton Financial Services, entered
the industry in 1965 but says: 'After the FSA, I saw that the world was a
changing place and that it was no good playing Canute and waiting for the
water to come to us. The legislation made us focus on where we spent our
time and where we were profitable.
'The public wanted change, and we took the decision that we would be
fee-charging. I saw our role here as being a niche player, not all things to
all men but doing certain things better than most.'
Boyton's office is a Queen Anne house in the village of Castle Hedingham.
The business is staffed tightly and he confesses to being a workaholic.
He believes that fee-charging IFAs stand or fall by their ability to give
their clients added value. 'That is what we are providing. The reason why
people get fed up with their solicitor, accountant or adviser is because
they see that value patently hasn't been added.'
In the past two years, Boyton has lost 29 clients - five of them died - but
has taken on 538 new execution-only and advisory customers. He will not
quote a figure for funds under management, as he has not decided if the
total should include money invested through the firm's execution-only
service, business expansion schemes, or even cash on deposit. 'A more
relevant figure is the new money flowing into the organisation,' he says,
'and the present rate of new funds is Pounds 1.5m-2.5m a month.'
Boyton believes that clients' costs should be controlled as rigorously as
his own. He does not think, for instance, that they need always go to Castle
Hedingham. He explains: 'We don't deter clients from coming to see us. But
if you write and say you want to be a client, we can do that on the
telephone. With a meeting, you are looking at spending something like Pounds
280 plus value added tax on something that I know I can do in 10 minutes.'
Nor does he give prospective clients a free first interview, arguing that
the cost of this special offer inevitably is borne by existing clients. 'If
you are giving your time for free, you must be making it up somewhere else,'
he points out.
Boyton finds that new clients 'tend to be very wary and sceptical of the
advisers they have seen in the past. l tell them that I don't trust anyone,
either, and that they will get everything in writing. And I tell them that
if they are not happy with what is suggested, they should not do it.'
The firm offers a comprehensive financial planning service, including advice
on pensions and school fee plans. Last year, Boyton established a joint
venture with Mcintyre Stuart, a Cambridge chartered accountancy firm, to
help clients with their tax returns.
He believes, however, that investment management is the firm's pivotal role.
'What we are about is running assets. You can be a rotten planner but, if
the portfolio has performed, the client will love you. It is performance,
performance, performance.' One big success was investing in the Gartmore
Emerging Pacific investment trust in 1992 and selling it just over a year
later, making gains of more than 250 per cent.
Time spent on a client's affairs is monitored scrupulously, with fees
ranging from Pounds 38 to Pounds 140 an hour (excluding VAT). Clients can
decide whether to offset any commissions that arise against their fees, or
use them to enhance their investment. Either way, Boyton wants their
decision in writing.
There is no minimum investment. Boyton says: 'The minimum portfolio is not
dependent upon size. It is a question of whether the client is prepared to
pay fees. We can actually operate for small sums of money if the client
tells us what he wants.'
There is an execution-only service for those who require no hand-holding and
a fund watch service that alerts clients to UK and international launches.
But the heart of the firm centres on its investment advisory and consultancy
service.
This is driven by an in-house data base that can analyse 11,500
institutional funds, and Boyton has links with a number of investment houses
and stockbrokers. Where appropriate, advice will also embrace gilts,
National Savings and permanent interest-bearing shares.
There is no annual management fee for the investment management service;
instead, it works rather like a bank budget account. Boyton says: 'We
calculate what we think we will spend, looking at the portfolio. We then
calculate how much we will spend on specific advice. Clients pay monthly, by
standing order, and once a year we look at our estimates and adjust them.'
Clients who have opted for the service get six-monthly valuations and are
contacted 'when we think the portfolio needs to be rearranged, either
because assets are fully valued or because an opportunity to buy
under-valued assets has arisen.'
Boyton's investment approach appears painstakingly disciplined. He imposes
performance parameters on each investment monitored, and acts when there is
any movement outside these. 'I'm lethal about cutting losses. I never run
them.'
He adds: 'We don't always get it right, but what we are looking to do is to
get it more right than wrong. We are not paid to lose clients' money.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Worry over Crest plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While professional investors await eagerly the arrival of Crest, a
settlements system that does away with paper for securities trading, its
advent early in 1996 is worrying many retail investors.
The Bank of England, which is controlling Crest while it is being assembled,
released a progress report this week outlining some of the changes
individual investors can expect.
Under Crest, the existing 14-day settlement gap will be condensed into a
five-day rolling period. This will change the way private investors handle
their dealings and alter their relationships with their stockbrokers, the
report suggests.
It acknowledges that private clients may well have to use nominee companies
if they cannot hold paper share certificates and if they are to settle all
transactions so much more quickly. But moves are being made to smooth the
transition.
The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body which covers
private client stockbrokers, is seeking new laws to bring so-called nominee
companies under the Financial Services Act. Such laws would require all
companies to seek authorisation from a regulatory body. Should a company
become insolvent, and if assets of clients disappeared, they could claim
under the Investors Compensation Scheme - a crucial point.
The Bank also is searching for ways to ease the anxiety for private
investors. Those who do not wish to keep their shares in a nominee company
may be cheered by a proposal to introduce 'sponsored membership.' This would
allow individuals to become members of Crest - and have their trades settled
through it - without having to buy such infrastructure as computer systems
or place their shares in a nominee company.
A sponsored member would have to arrange credit facilities to cover stock
purchases and sign a contract with Crest, as well as authorising another
member to give instructions to the system on his behalf. Private clients
could designate their broker as their intermediary, although the Bank warns
that investors would 'be exposed to risk if their agent should act in error
or improperly.'
Meanwhile, another initiative is on the way. This comes from ProShare, a
group which promotes individual share ownership, and is aimed particularly
at investors who enjoy their direct relationship with the companies in which
they invest.
ProShare is urging a voluntary agreement under which the listed company
could extend the rights of company ownership to the customers of nominees.
This would need to be matched by nominees passing - with their clients'
consent - relevant details about customers to the registrars. ProShare hopes
to settle all details by May.
Whatever happens, both the Bank and the Association of Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers say it is inevitable there will be
changes in the way private investors deal.
The move to five-day rolling settlement means that unless clients shift
their shares to the account of a nominee, there will be practical
difficulties in delivering either cash or shares to their broker in time.
Geoffrey Turner, chief executive of APCIMS, Turner says it is likely brokers
will have to re-write completely the letters of agreement they have on file
for each client.
The Bank says private clients appear already to have difficulty making
payments within five days of buying stock. In a recent survey, the Stock
Exchange found that 30 per cent of all deals made six days before the
settlement deadline were not paid on time, and that the majority of these
were those of small private investors.
Turner believes that intra-account trading almost certainly is a thing of
the past. While some clients manage to buy and sell a stock within the
present 14-day settlement period, this will become almost impossible under
the five-day system. 'No one has said intra-account trading is banned but,
as a practical matter, it will be very difficult,' he says.
All told, the advent of Crest undoubtedly will change the way private
clients invest their assets. How smoothly the transition to the new
arrangements is made would seem to depend as much on the diligence of the
client as on the efficacy of the broker.

ICI is expected to reveal doubled profits of around Pounds 300m for 1993
before exceptional charges when it reports full year results on Thursday.
The figures will have benefited from cost-cutting and some improvement in
its UK and US markets but ICI is likely to report that continental Europe
remains very difficult. Total dividends should be held at 27.5p though
uncovered by earnings.
Full-year figures from the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever are due on Tuesday
with estimated profits ranging from Pounds 2.25bn pre-tax to Pounds 2.325bn,
against Pounds 2.029bn previously. Trading has been tough in Europe, mixed
in the US and strong in Asia-Pacific. There may be big rationalisation
charges, partly offset by gains on disposals. Full-year results from
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, also due on Tuesday, are
unlikely to be as spectacular as Glaxo's. Pre-tax profits should be close to
Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.047bn) and the full year dividend is likely to
increase from 8.76p last time to at least 10.5p.
On Wednesday National Westminster Bank becomes the second large high street
bank to disclose its 1993 figures, and is expected to report a pre-tax
profit of between Pounds 950m and just over Pounds 1bn, compared with Pounds
398m in 1992.
Bad debt provisions are expected to fall substantially, but operating
profits are not thought to have grown strongly. The dividend rise is likely
to be smaller than those at Lloyds and TSB Group because of NatWest's weaker
capital ratios.
A year ago BAe reported the biggest annual loss in UK corporate history  -
the Pounds 1.2bn pre-tax loss included exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn. On
Wednesday the group is expected to report a reduced full year loss of about
Pounds 200m after Pounds 250m of exceptionals.
On the same day British Gas is due to report full year pre-exceptional
profits of between Pounds 900m and Pounds 1bn together with substantial
staff redundancy and restructuring provisions. Meanwhile three UK composite
insurers reporting results for 1993 next week are all expected to be
comfortably back in the black, after three years of difficult trading
conditions.
Guardian Royal Exchange starts the ball rolling on Tuesday with its pre-tax
profits expected to be between Pounds 135m and Pounds 170m, before
investment gains are included. That compares to profits of Pounds 3m in 1992
 -again before investment gains.
Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composites in recent years,
is expected to post profits of between Pounds 179m and Pounds 213m when it
reports on Wednesday compared with Pounds 24m last time.
Finally on Thursday Royal Insurance is expected to register profits of
between Pounds 120m and Pounds 160m against a Pounds 27m loss in 1992.

Investors will have yet another chance to buy shares in a nursing home group
when Goldsborough Healthcare comes to the stock market on Thursday with a
flotation valuing it at Pounds 74.5m. This is slightly different from the
purer plays in the sector as it combines 26 care homes - of which four are
residential, not nursing, homes - with acute hospitals, Goldsborough has two
plus a half share in a third, and a home care division which provides nurses
to clients in their own homes.
There is great interest in this industry just now. Following 1993's
Community Care Act, the roles of purchaser and provider have been separated,
allowing the private sector to expand. Goldsborough claims its range of
activities give it strength, although the bulk of profits still come from
the care homes which produce higher margins but, in the expansion phase,
consume more cash than they produce.
One concern about Goldsborough is that it is coming to market with net debt
of Pounds 7.8m, and gearing of 15.4 per cent, in spite of raising Pounds 29m
of new money. The other Pounds 33.3m being raised in the float is going to
existing shareholders - mainly Kunick, the gaming machine group - which are
selling.
That leaves Goldsborough at something of a disadvantage to other companies,
which have arrived on the market with net cash. And given that it is only
seventh in the pecking order of care home operators, investors may prefer to
stick to one of the larger groups, even if their shares are rated more
highly.
At the 170p offer price, the shares are on a prospective p/e of 14.8 on a
forecast of Pounds 6.55m pre-tax on a pro forma basis.
Sponsor to the issue is SG Warburg and the broker is SG Warburg Securities.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Soaring investment trusts set record
pace / New and existing issues jostle for business - but is this a good time
to buy?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment trusts are more popular now than they have been for decades. New
launches in the first quarter of this year could well raise more than in the
whole of last year, which was record-breaking as well. And existing trusts
are attracting unprecedented investor interest because of lower interest
rates.
The price of investment trust shares fluctuates according to market demand,
rather than the value of their assets. If a trust is out of favour, you
could buy the shares at a substantial discount to the value of its assets.
If the trust is very popular, you might have to pay a premium.
Just how big a comeback the investment trust sector has made is shown by the
fact that the average investment trust discount to net asset value was at
its narrowest for more than 20 years last month. But a flood of new issues,
and the stock market response to the recent US rate cut, has started to
reverse the tide since. Discounts actually widened slightly last week.
This is a timely reminder to investors that a narrowing discount is not a
one-way process: if the market turns bearish, premiums can turn into
discounts, and small discounts can become yawning gaps of 20 or 30 per cent
 -making a severe dent in your profits when you want to sell.
Existing trusts
Now that investment trust discounts are at historically narrow levels, one
of the old arguments for buying investment trusts has been eliminated: that
they provided an opportunity to acquire undervalued assets cheaply. If that
is no longer true, is this generally a bad time to buy investment trusts?
According to the experts - not necessarily. Value has not disappeared from
the sector: you might just need to look harder for it. Philip Middleton, an
investment trust analyst at Smith New Court, says: 'At the moment, there are
some perfectly decent international generalists which you can buy on quite
acceptable discounts.' He mentions Scottish Eastern, Witan, and Kleinwort
Overseas as trusts in this category. Some Far Eastern funds are looking
attractive, too.
The fact that a trust is at a premium does not always mean you should avoid
it, says Brian Tora, of stockbroker Greig Middleton. Several of the funds
recommended by his firm are at a premium, including Fidelity European
Values, and Perpetual Japanese. This is because the managers are respected
and have a track record which can justify paying a premium. Management
experience and performance is what to look for.
But David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says investors should know
they are taking a greater risk by buying at present levels. He advises them
to look at unit trusts in the same sector before buying shares in an
existing investment trust at a premium - particularly if they are run by the
same manager. The unit trust could be a more cost-effective option, Harris
adds.
New issues
Conversely, the narrowing discount improves the case for buying new
investment trust issues. It used to be that new issues were a bad deal: you
had to pay the full asset value plus the issue expenses. But, by buying
shares in an existing trust, you could get the same assets at a 15 per cent
discount. Now, new issues can be better value.
Middleton warns, however, that even when a trust is expected to be popular,
you should not subscribe with the intention of 'stagging' it - selling
immediately for a profit, as many people did with privatisation shares,
which were priced cheaply.
Investment trust issues cannot be underpriced, as they have no assets to
start with. Even the recent Kleinwort European Privatisation investment
trust, which was oversubscribed heavily, went to only a 2 per cent premium
on its first day. Issues should be judged on their medium to long-term
prospects.
Harris says careful choice is necessary because of the many issues and it
might be more sensible for small investors to go for big names in fund
management, with a track record in their area, rather than unknown
management groups.
C-share (conversion share) issues, where existing trusts raise new share
capital, also can offer better value than ordinary shares in the same trust.
C-share issues under way now include Templeton Emerging Markets, Fleming
Japanese, and Abtrust New Dawn.
What about warrants?
The majority of the new investment trusts being launched now are offering
subscribers to the public offer 'free' warrants, one for every five ordinary
shares. A warrant gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares
in the trust at a fixed price at some date or dates in the future.
Warrants are traded separately from ordinary shares. They are highly-geared,
speculative instruments which can deliver huge capital gains if the trust's
share price rises above the warrant's exercise price. But if the trust
flops, they become worthless.
Many private investors who normally would never trade in warrants can find
themselves holding them because of a public offer. The question then arises
of what to do with them. It can be tempting to sell them quickly but
advisers say this is not always the most sensible option.
Middleton argues that the term 'free warrants' is a misnomer: investors have
paid for them as part of the package of ordinary shares. 'You should not
just regard them as some bit of frivolity that has been thrown in for
nothing. Generally, you should hang on to them,' he says. After the trust
has been running for a few years, you can decide whether to sell or exercise
them.
Tora feels that the best course is to keep warrants, perhaps tucked away in
an envelope labelled 'round the world trip 2003.' Alternatively, you could
put them in a child's portfolio, where capital growth is more important than
income. But you should not forget about them altogether - warrants do have
fixed expiry dates.
Harris says that investors not prepared to take the longer view could sell
the warrants immediately and look on the proceeds as a discount on the
ordinary shares.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Buba leaves the Bank to juggle the rates - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waiting for Buba is never one of the markets' favourite pastimes. The
Bundesbank seems to enjoy dragging out the suspense of an interest rate
shift, springing it on the markets when their attention is elsewhere and
conditions for a change appear to have gone.
Finally on Thursday, a wearisome 118 days since its last rate cut, the
German central bank dropped its discount rate by half a percentage point to
5 1/4 per cent. Markets across Europe rose on hopes of further reductions by
their own monetary authorities but the enthusiasm quickly wore off.
London equity and gilt markets, roused by apparently weak UK economic data
earlier in the week, added the Bundesbank's action to their list of reasons
why the UK government and Bank of England should ease interest rates again.
But by the end of the week the arguments were less persuasive. Moreover,
inflation jitters in the US upset bond markets there, with a knock-on effect
on UK gilts and equities. The FT-SE 100 index struggled to end the week up a
net 3.7 points at 3,382.6.
On Tuesday, the Footsie had reversed a four-day, 76-point slide and gained
ground on news that manufacturing output had slipped in December and that
the Central Statistical Office had cut its trend growth rate for
manufacturing to 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent. The mood was reinforced the
next day by a weak rise in the retail price index and an unexpected 15,500
rise in unemployment after four months of falls.
The trouble is that these statistics suffered from weather, public holidays
and other seasonal adjustment problems. If the Bank of England was less
willing than the government to make the recent UK base rate cut - hence a
compromise reduction of a quarter of a percentage point - then this week's
data would not have changed its mind much.
The Bank is having to juggle a number of considerations revolving around
sterling's recent weakness, external trade trends and demand for gilts at
up-coming auctions. The auction next week is small but foreign investors are
a little jittery about gilts after the market turmoil of the past fortnight.
Although the superior yield of gilts over German bonds had recovered
somewhat from its low point in late January, it has eroded again in recent
days, as the chart shows. Although another UK cut soon might be justified by
domestic economic considerations, external factors are weighing against it.
Such an argument was used by Nick Knight, Nomura's high-profile market
strategist, when he unsettled the equity market on Thursday with his advice
to sell into any strength equities exhibit. From the man who made his name
as a raging bull when Britain left the ERM, his talk of adverse trends on
inflation, the trade deficit, sterling and interest rates was pretty
bearish.
Most institutional investors will take more persuading about the risks of
equities at these levels before they act decisively on such advice. But they
are already backing off from putting more money into the market. The latest
Smith New Court monthly survey of fund managers' intentions found that cash
had a growing attraction to them. For the first time since the survey began
in 1990, more of them planned to increase their cash balances than reduce
them.
UK investors are still troubled by the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's
raising of US interest rates and the recent reduction by UK authorities. US
investors, despite being unsettled in the last couple of days, appear to
have adjusted more rapidly to the changed environment. Since the Fed
tightened, equities have clocked up a negative return of less than 2 per
cent in the US but more than 3 per cent in the UK. Likewise, the bond return
is less than a negative 1 per cent in the US but more than a negative 1 per
cent in the UK, points out Goldman Sachs' London strategists Sushil Wadhwani
and Musthtaq Shah.
'The on-going correction is unlikely to be very large', not more than 5 per
cent, and the outlook six to 12 months ahead 'is good', they believe.
Analysing the last four occasions on which US interest rates had bottomed
out in the past 22 years, they found that the total return on UK equities
was an average of 17.49 per cent for the subsequent six months.
They offer four main arguments for equities: they are still under-valued
relative to short-term interest rates; they typically outperform bonds when
earnings growth is expected to be above-average; US retail investors should
continue to increase their equity holdings since interest rates are still
relatively low; European rates are still coming down and retail investors
are still underweight in equities.
One big test of their argument begins in earnest this coming week as the
reporting season picks up speed. Earnings and dividend growth has indeed
been strong among the early reporters to-date such as Reuters, Lloyds and
Glaxo.
But sparkling performances are expected from big international companies
such as Glaxo and Reuters, thanks in part to currency factors. The more
telling performances will come from among the vast swathe of smaller, more
UK-oriented companies.
The sorriest corporate story of the week was Tiphook. It has sold at last
its container business but only for Pounds 734m, leaving it with a trailer
rental business carrying Pounds 160m of equipment purchase commitments for
which it has no finance, Pounds 500m of existing debt and shareholders'
funds of Pounds 40m.
One man gambling on its recovery is Robert Montague, chief executive. To
sweeten a cut in his base pay from Pounds 816,000 a year to a mere Pounds
200,000, he was given options on 2m shares at 20p, 500,000 at 65p and a
bonus of 1 per cent of pre-tax profits. But investors watching for
Montague's trailer to come in, loaded high, will have a far more
excruciating wait than anybody has ever had for the Bundesbank.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Sir Richard sets his target - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a week for Sir Richard Sykes. On Tuesday the chief executive of Glaxo,
Europe's biggest drugs company, went to Buckingham Palace to be invested as
a knight of the realm.
On Wednesday, he was named chairman of the company's executive committee, a
privilege denied his predecessor, Ernest Mario. The executive committee runs
the company on a day-to-day basis and has until now been controlled by Sir
Paul Girolami, Glaxo's chairman since 1985.
And on Thursday, Sir Richard announced six-month results better than any
City analyst had forecast. Glaxo broke the Pounds 1bn pre-tax profits
barrier for the first time for a half-year, raised the dividend by 29 per
cent to 9p and saw the shares gain 22p on the day.
Sir Richard took it in his stride. His slight physique belies his evident
stamina. He presents a determined, enthusiastic and approachable
personality, and has kept his Yorkshire accent. The company he runs, on the
other hand, is an almost frightening combination of size and power.
It is the second biggest in the UK by market capitalisation. It makes the
world's biggest selling drug, Zantac, an ulcer treatment, which saw
six-month sales grow by 5 per cent to more than Pounds 1.2bn.
Coming up behind Zantac are two of the most promising drugs in any company's
portfolio. Imigran is a migraine treatment that does not have any
competitors. First-half sales grew from Pounds 35m a year ago to Pounds
113m. Zofran is used to control nausea in cancer patients and those who have
just had an operation. Six-month sales grew 17 per cent to Pounds 207m, and
work continues on new applications for the drug such as in Alzheimer's
disease.
The bottom line is that it took less than four years for Glaxo to move from
making Pounds 1bn pre-tax profit in a year to Pounds 1bn in six months. If
product strength is anything to go by, there is little to stop that growth
continuing.
And yet the shares have not been popular for many months. In parallel with
the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector, investors have been selling and the
price has underperformed the market dramatically.
As a result, what was once the darling of the capital growth investor has
become a buy on the basis of its 4 per cent-plus yield.
What the capital growth investors fear is that one day the gravy train will
hit the buffers of international healthcare reforms. The signs are there.
Behind the spectacular headline figures, some markets are in trouble.
Zantac sales in Germany fell by 21 per cent as healthcare reforms cut
doctors' prescribing powers. Sales in Italy (state contributions to the cost
of drugs are being reformed) fell by 6 per cent.
And in the UK, sales fell 9 per cent, partly because the UK government last
year cut drug prices by an average of 2.5 per cent.
Sir Richard says the sales falls are just hiccups, not symptoms of a
creeping disease. The German and Italian markets are already beginning to
'turn around', he says, and the upward slope in sales and profits will
reappear, although perhaps not as steep as it used to be. He may be right on
Europe. But it is likely that healthcare reform in the US will provide the
key to the company's fortunes.
Glaxo does 47 per cent of its business in North America, up from 42 per cent
a year ago. It is an increasing dependence that comes as healthcare costs
are under scrutiny by the Clinton administration.
Changes already under way include a switch to 'managed health care', in
which providers of healthcare agree to look after the ailments of a group of
people in return for a fee.
The key to winning in this market may be to create alliances that can offer
a broad range of medical services. Last year, Merck, the biggest US drugs
company, set the pace by buying Medco, one of its biggest customers.
Glaxo knows it must respond by creating a 'matrix' of alliances. This could
include other drugs companies and distributors. Sir Richard wants to build
his matrix by the end of the year. He may have another triumphant week next
year, if he meets that target.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Save the saver with a single tax break - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors need no reminding at the moment of the complexities of the
personal tax system. They need to check the new tax codings sent out by the
Inland Revenue for 1994/95 to see that they are correct (see page VII) and
they now have only a little over a month before the end of the tax year on
April 5 to implement tax planning measures.
The choice includes any number of tax-efficient savings and investment
schemes, some small, like a tax-exempt special savings account, which will
pay income gross on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000 over five years,
and some potentially large, like personal equity plans. These offer relief
from income and capital gains on an investment of up to Pounds 9,000 a year,
which can be split between two main types of plan - a general and a single
company plan.
The choice does not end there if your spare cash is limited. Should you
instead increase contributions to your personal pension, subject to the
limits, or should you take out an additional voluntary contribution if you
are an employee in an occupational scheme?
Deciding which is best depends not only on your personal circumstances; you
are likely also to be influenced by the different tax system under which
these investments operate. Pension contributions are the most tax-efficient
since they are grossed up and invested in a tax-free fund, which is not the
case with money put into a Tessa or Pep.
Private investors also have to remember when to make their investment for
maximum tax-efficiency. The financial year is not the same as the calendar
year; a Pep year used to be a calendar year but is now a financial year
while a Tessa year is neither and corresponds instead to the anniversary of
the initial investment.
How can we find our way out of this savings mess? Instead of simplifying
matters Kenneth Clarke's budget last November if anything has made things
worse, as our growing Q&amp;A briefcase postbag testifies. The abolition of CGT
indexation, for example, to create or increase losses has been met with
bemusement by some readers and incredulity by others.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies this week urged reform of the taxation of
savings, arguing that the current regime satisfies none of the requirements
for 'neutrality, fairness and transparency.'*
While arguments about how the tax system might be simplified are endless,
one of the Institute's recommendations, that Peps and Tessa should be swept
up into a single tax free plan, has merit. After all, if savers are being
given tax breaks of a similar nature, why not give an allowance for tax-free
savings and leave it up to the individual to decide which investments to use
it for?
The IFS suggests that savings could be invested in a range of financial
assets, from shares and securities to futures and options in the new
extended plan, which it names Expep.
No tax relief would be given for amounts put in the Expep but income and
capital gains would be tax-free and (unlike a Tessa), withdrawals could be
made at any time. It suggests setting the annual limit at Pounds 12,000 to
be roughly in line with an amalgamation of the current Pep and Tessa annual
allowances.
Part of the attraction of a tax-free allowance idea is that attempts by the
government to channel private investors' money into areas it wishes to
develop have not been too successful. Tessas were meant to encourage small
savers but anecdotal evidence suggests that little of the Tessa money has
been new; instead, those with building society savings have simply
transferred them into a Tessa to make use of the tax break.
The Business Expansion Scheme, which was abolished at the end of December,
was meant to encourage investment in growing businesses but it only became
successful after the government allowed it to be used to increase the supply
of private rented accommodation. Sponsors developed loan-back schemes so
lucrative that they were banned overnight by Norman Lamont in his March 1993
budget.
Some BES schemes still remain controversial. Investors in Johnson Fry's
Mortgage Express Super Growth BES (which is not a loan-back scheme) are
awaiting the outcome of a dispute between the company and the Inland Revenue
over the timing of tax relief, which will affect the level of returns to
investors.
Enterprise Zone Trusts, potentially the largest tax break of all, received a
blow this week when the House of Lords rejected an appeal by Matrix
Securities, investment advisers, against the Inland Revenue for refusing to
grant clearance to its docklands scheme. In this case, investors' cheques
have already been returned but some investors in the BES and EZT have been
attracted by the size of the tax breaks and have not fully appreciated the
risks.
There is certainly an argument then, for protecting investors by
consolidating tax breaks into one allowance, since these elaborate schemes
often seem to benefit City promoters more than investors. That would also
have the virtue of simplifying the personal savings tax system.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: New York feels the Fed's icy breath - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like New York city, which is struggling to clear up the mess left by last
week's heavy snowstorms, the stock market is still coping with the aftermath
of the wintry blast of cold air the Federal Reserve sent Wall Street's way
on February 4, when it raised interest rates for the first time in five
years.
The two weeks that have passed since the Fed's move have been dominated by a
mood of nervous optimism. Share prices have been rising, but not in a
straight line. The stock market is walking forward, but constantly glancing
over its shoulder, fearful that the Fed will creep up on it again with
another sneakily timed policy tightening.
Take this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points in the first
three trading days, a solid enough performance. The upward momentum was
maintained early on Thursday when prices rose following the release of a
positive set of consumer prices data, data that appeared to suggest
inflation remains dormant in spite of the rapidly expanding economy.
Then suddenly, prices turned tail after lunch. The retreat was prompted by a
big sell-off in the bond market, which had decided to ignore the bullish
news in the morning's January consumer prices numbers and react instead -
somewhat improbably - to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's report on the
monthly outlook for local business.
I say improbably because normally, the Philly Fed's monthly forecast does
not move markets. This time it did, because hidden in the data was a
worrying sign that prices in the Philadelphia region are rising on the back
of a strong manufacturing sector. Because this is seen as a leading
indicator of consumer prices, as opposed to the CPI data, which was a
lagging inflation indicator, the bond market sat up and took notice.
Fearing that the rise in prices in Philadelphia presaged a similar movement
nationwide - and that the Fed in Washington would reach a similar conclusion
 -bond market investors headed for the hills, turning what had been a
handsome morning rally into a frightening afternoon rout. By mid-afternoon,
the benchmark 30-year bond had fallen so far that its yield had risen above
6.5 per cent for the first time since August 1993.
Nervy stock market investors rapidly followed the bond market's lead, and
the Dow slid from a 19-point gain to a 30-point loss within less than an
hour (although it recovered some ground before the close). Like the bond
market, the stock market plunged because investors were afraid the Fed would
raise rates again in a second pre-emptive move against inflation.
Everyone has good reason to be nervous about another rate increase. The
first, two weeks ago, was unpleasant but was eventually digested without too
much trouble because it was only a small upward move - a quarter of a
percentage point on the bank overnight borrowing rate. Investors were also,
ultimately, able to shrug it off because one policy tightening in itself is
not that disturbing. Two policy tightenings, especially if they were to
happen within a few weeks of each other, is another matter. A trend would be
established.
Investors are understandably nervous at the prospect of another interest
rate increase. Stock and bond markets have enjoyed an unprecedented period
of prosperity over the past three years because interest rates were falling
to - and staying at - the lowest levels seen in 30 years. Several
consecutive policy tightenings by the Fed in early 1994, however, would
clearly signal the end of the low interest rate cycle.
Yet, as many analysts pointed out on February 4 when rates first went up, it
was always unlikely that the Fed would stop at just one policy tightening.
The newspapers lately have been full of pundits saying that the February 4
rate rise was the first step in a two- or even three-stage process.
So why all the fuss about the prospect of another rate increase? One
possible answer is that market sentiment may have been more badly damaged by
the Fed's first tightening than was realised at the time. A second is that
people are alarmed by the rapid rise in bond market yields, which have
jumped above 6.5 per cent faster than anyone expected.
Analysts warn that the break above 6.5 per cent will have a big
psychological effect on the bond market, making it more likely that yields
will keep on rising toward the next landmark - 6.75 per cent.
The 30-year bond was yielding 5.7 per cent only as recently as October.
Another 20 basis points higher, and bond yields will have jumped a full
percentage point in little more than five months. No wonder the stock market
is nervous.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Latin American markets draw the investors - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International investors moving money out of Asia and looking for new, more
profitable destinations have been pushing up Latin American stock markets.
There has been a 20 per cent rise in dollar terms since the start of the
year, following strong performance in 1993. The region still has economic
problems, but the North American Free Trade Agreement is expected to have a
beneficial effect.
Three new UK investment trusts specialising in Latin America will shortly be
adding to the flow of funds to the region. The launches of Edinburgh Fund
Manager's Inca trust, Templeton's Latin American trust, and Morgan
Grenfell's Latin American trust have all been announced within the past two
weeks. Public offers for the funds open in March or April.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Rate cuts undermine Sterling's rise - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's rise from a low of DM2.43 in mid-October to a high of DM2.6250 in
mid-January was driven by a gathering consensus that the UK was enjoying an
economic recovery. The trigger for the recent correction was the 25 basis
points cut in UK interest rates announced last week. The move was not well
received in the market, which queried the economic justification and worried
about possible political motivation. The Bundesbank's half-point cut in its
discount lending rate on Thursday, has not helped sterling. The market
appears to take the view that UK rate cuts are more likely in the short term
than German cuts.

FT  19 FEB 94 / The Long View: Toujours richesse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the clearing banks at last reporting increased profits after a
protracted recession, it may seem premature to remind people that the party
always ends in tears. But this column is not called The Long View for
nothing; and it always pays to remember that movements in bank balance
sheets have an important influence on the behaviour of the macro-economy. An
accurate forecast of the precise way in which the banks will lose billions
of other people's money in the course of the present economic cycle could
provide important clues to the future rate of inflation and the relative
performance of bond markets against equities.
The starting point for this gloomily deterministic exercise  - perverse
though it sounds  - is that bank balance sheets in the English-speaking
economies are looking healthier than they have done for years. The efforts
of the US Federal Reserve to prevent a credit crunch by encouraging the
banks to trade in Treasury paper have been triumphantly successful. Both the
capital and profitability of the US banking system have been restored, which
is why the Fed was able to raise interest rates earlier this month without
trepidation.
In the UK, profits and capital are similarly on the mend, although the means
to that end have been different. In American parlance, the banks have simply
leveraged the customer base  - a euphemism for extracting increased profits
from customers when you know that they are unable to go elsewhere. Recent
howls of anguish from the small business sector are the sound of bank
customers being leveraged. This unique approach to marketing, a variant of
Morton's fork, is rooted in the notion that the customer is always wrong in
a recession; and it is less stupid than it sounds, for the banker's
relationship with the client is essentially monopolistic in an economic
downturn and competitive in an upturn.
Consequently the UK banks' operating income has remained strong through the
recession. Now the fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts is having a
geared effect on profits. That is, the improvement in bad debt experience
causes pre-tax profits to rise disproportionately. This brings us to the
central point. The British banks are about to confront an embarrassment of
riches: capital and retained profits are set to grow uncontrollably as the
recovery progresses.
This might seem counter-intuitive. When bank capital is high, the return on
capital employed is lower and the commercial banking system suffers a loss
of competitive advantage to the markets. For in the wholesale money markets,
securities firms compete with the banks to bring together those with surplus
funds and those who are in need of funds; and the markets operate on a much
smaller base of capital because they do not have a fiduciary obligation to
millions of depositors.
In the retail business, where banks face less competition from securities
firms the problem is maturity. Home lending is a busted flush and there are
growing doubts about the banks' prospects in life assurance. Moreover,
excess profits usually lead to increased competition and then back to lower
profits. So why are analysts forecasting a sustained increase in retained
profits?
The answer is that in Britain, unlike the US, universal banking is now the
norm. A loss of competitive advantage between the banking system and the
markets simply means that a bank such as Lloyds, which chose not to buy into
a big securities firm, suffers at this point in the cycle relative to
Barclays and Natwest which did. Retail business may be mature, but it still
generates big profits. As for competition, it works only with a long delay
in Britain's heavily concentrated clearing bank system. So Ogden Nash was
right after all: bankers are just like everyone else except richer. But how
will they respond to their sudden enrichment?
The logical answer would be to return capital to the shareholders in the
form of much higher dividends. The long-suffering owners do, after all,
deserve it, having put so much capital into the banks over the past 20
years, often to see it either squandered or paid back in dividends, before
receiving another call for fresh capital. A high payout policy would lead to
a less managerial form of capitalism, in which shareholders would exercise a
more powerful veto over grandiose expansion plans.
But while dividends will no doubt rise, they seem unlikely to absorb all the
extra profits. Even Lloyds, which has acquired a reputation for looking
after shareholders' interests, appears to have lost its appetite for
shrinking the business and is on the lookout for acquisitions. While a more
conventional dash for growth in lending or other forms of expensive mistake
cannot be ruled out, the acquisition trail looks an all too plausible answer
to the problems of the sorcerer's apprentices. In the UK the belief that
takeovers solve problems rather than create them dies hard.
It would be good news if the banks acquired businesses at a premium over net
asset value, the resulting goodwill on acquisition would cause their own
capital to shrink. So might any subsequent poor performance by the acquired
company. The monetary consequences would thus be less inflationary than with
a plunge into property lending or corporate deal making, because shrinking
capital constrains the growth of money and credit.
The bad news would be that shareholders were made to suffer because of
imprudent acquisitions. The history of bank takeovers prompted by excess
capital and high ambition is profoundly discouraging  - witness Midland's
disastrous acquisition of Crocker in California in the early 1980s and the
TSB's acquisition of merchant bankers Hill Samuel in 1987. It is a sad fact
that even the best banks have an unimpressive record in running their own
businesses. The notion that they can turn themselves into wizards of the
takeover game beggars belief. Stand by for more trouble, if only in the long
term.

FT  19 FEB 94 / From Russia with complaints and disillusion: Jews flocked
from the former Soviet Union to the Promised Land looking for a better life
 -but on their terms. As Anne Applebaum reports, they received a shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The last time I saw Ilyusha was two years ago; it was the week before he was
due to travel to Tel Aviv from Lvov, his birthplace in western Ukraine. His
bags were packed, his aircraft ticket awaited him, his immigration papers
had been prepared. He was planning to travel via Warsaw in order to trade a
few things on the way; Ilyusha did not want to arrive in the Promised Land
without cash.
We walked through Lvov, a city with a history that has included Poles and
Jews, Habsburg governors and Hungarian merchants, but not many contacts with
the Middle East. Ilyusha, very much a Lvoviak (he 'traded things' for a
living, speaking Russian, Polish and Ukrainian along the way), was
nevertheless telling me that he had the Middle East - Arabs, Israelis, sand,
everything - all worked out.
He had memorised Ha-Tikva, the Israeli national anthem. He had been told of
a restaurant that served pork sausage. He knew lots of people - a dozen of
his school friends were there already - and that they watched Russian
television and read Russian newspapers. Soviet citizens adapted easily, he
said. 'If they want me to fight, I'll fight. If they want me to become
religious, I'll convert. I'll fit in.'
He had heard stories of arranged marriages and fake birth certificates ('We
can get anybody to Israel if we want to') and told me a joke: 'What will be
the second language of Israel in 10 years? The answer is Hebrew - because
Russian will be the first language.' He expected that life in Israel would
continue more or less as it had in Lvov except that, in Israel, the
telephones would work, the supermarkets would be stocked with food and, if
one worked hard, it might be possible to own a flat.
Over the next two years, mutual friends passed on occasional reports of
Ilyusha's progress and I heard even more frequent accounts of Israel's
Soviet immigrants. Nearly 500,000 Jews have arrived there from the former
Soviet Union since August 1989, a huge number for a country of 5m people:
imagine 6m emigres from post-communist Europe arriving suddenly in Britain.
Among them were 60,000 doctors, 10,000 musicians, and a proportion of
educated people four times larger than that of the existing Jewish
population of Israel.
They were welcomed at first with almost messianic enthusiasm. Simcha Dinitz,
the chairman of the Jewish Agency (which oversees the immigration process),
understood immediately that this wave of immigration might finally make
Israel secure in the Middle East: 'No longer are we a nation which might
disappear, which might be easily pushed into the sea,' he said. The Arab
world recognised this, too, and did its best to stop the Jews from coming;
Dinitz is not alone in citing their failure to halt the immigration as one
reason for the decision of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to talk
peace.
If, however, the first reaction was enthusiasm, the second was
disappointment. Not only was there no immediate cultural renaissance: there
were pianists sweeping the streets, nuclear physicists emptying dustbins,
top scientists emigrating again upon arrival and others returning home. In
1993, the huge burst of immigration slowed to a trickle; only about 7,000
arrive every month now.
In Israel these days, you hear that the Russians (as they are usually
called) have pushed up prostitution, tax and unemployment rates and that
nothing is good enough for them; they are never satisfied. One left-wing
Israeli told me she had disliked the Russians ever since she heard them
calling the Falashas (Jews from Ethiopia) racist names. The Falashas, she
said, had at least wanted to come here, whereas everyone knew the Russians
just wanted handouts from the state.
An Orthodox woman told me that her community's attempt to integrate some
Russian families had failed: they took advantage of what people gave them,
complained constantly, and never even pretended to be Jewish.
Perhaps some of these disappointments have been due to a misunderstanding.
Whereas their grandparents - like Israel's founders - might have spoken
Yiddish and lived in Jewish communities, most Soviet Jews of this generation
are Russian-speaking and, if asked, would call themselves Russian. Obsession
with classical music, and an almost religious love of lofty literature and
heavy novels, are Russian characteristics; so are high expectations from the
state and a propensity to complain.
Bringing them, their prejudices and their assumptions to the Middle East is
a complicated prospect, more so than either side had expected - like
grafting an alien branch onto a tree. Bearing this in mind, I went to see
Ilyusha, who now lives in a small flat on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
He opened the door, smiled - then frowned at the bottle I had brought as a
gift. 'Ah, we don't drink here any more,' he said, placing it on the shelf.
The climate was wrong and Israeli vodka was expensive and poor quality. 'It
tastes of peaches,' he explained. 'I simply got used to doing without it.'
He had acquired new eating habits, too: avocados cost less than potatoes in
Israel while oranges and lemons - non-existent in Russia - were practically
free.
It seemed, at first, as if that was the limit of adjustment. Ilyusha spoke
Russian to his girlfriend and had few Israeli friends. He still laughed
about the number of 'Jews' who had arrived in Israel under false pretences
and how good the Russians were at beating the Israeli system.
Once again, he told a joke: 'What will be the second language of Israel in
10 years? The answer is Hebrew - because Russian will be the first
language.'
This time, though, when I asked if that really would prove to be true, he
stopped laughing. No, he said, it was not true. Contrary to what he and his
friends had expected in Lvov, Israel had not adjusted to the Russians; they
had been forced to adjust to Israel. Knowing the words to Ha-Tikva had not
proved enough.
Learning to cook was part of the change, but learning to work was more
important. In Soviet society, money was made informally - on the side,
through friends and connections, rather than through an office job. In
Israel, though, Ilyusha first learned enough Hebrew to find work as an armed
security guard, then as a hotel receptionist. After a while, he saw he could
be a receptionist but not a manager, so he signed up to study for a masters'
degree in business administration.
This, too, had to be treated differently. University was not something taken
seriously in the Soviet Union, where connections helped to gain entry to a
degree course and even a medical school degree could be bought. In Israel,
degrees matter: many of the 'doctors' from the Soviet Union proved, in fact,
unqualified by Israeli standards. Ilyusha was studying hard: so hard, in
fact, that he no longer saw any of his Lvov friends.
It is often said that the famous Jewish sense of humour disappeared when the
Jews moved to Israel. Ilyusha admitted that this might be true, but only
because there was less time to think up new jokes. In Lvov, one spent
afternoons drinking and talking. In Israel, with 5 1/2 -day weeks and
constant financial pressure, it was impossible to live the same way.
Much more difficult are political adjustments. In the Soviet Union, the
state was to be laughed at, but Israel belongs to another extreme: everyone
serves in the army and people feel a loyalty to the state - or, at least,
the nation - because of the danger it faces; that loyalty is much stronger
than that felt by many west Europeans to their countries.
In the Soviet Union, too, private values ranked higher than public ones:
among Russians, it was thought more admirable to love and understand poetry,
for example, than merely to obey the law. Some Soviet Jews have responded to
the shift in values with snobbery. Israeli literature is inferior to that of
Russia, and Israeli television is inferior to Russian, they claim, while all
of the nonsense about the army is shallow patriotism, of the sort indulged
in by the Russian lower classes.
One Soviet couple told me, with great pride, that their friends had set up
special weekend classes to supplement Israeli schools, which did not require
children to learn poetry by heart. One wonders if this will last: how long
is it possible to recite verses about snowy forests when the landscape
outside is dry desert?
Others have moved from snobbery to cynicism. Contrary to what was expected
from people fleeing communism, Soviet Jews were responsible in part for
electing Israel's Labour government at the last general election. Equally
contrarily, they may well vote for a Likud government later on. But these
are protest votes - against the status quo and poor conditions for new
immigrants - rather than votes for anything positive.
Curiously enough, although their enthusiasm for Israel (and Israel's for
them) is low, the evidence is that the Soviet Jews have been responsible for
an economic upturn. A huge leap in construction and consumption has led to
increased production, while growth in exports to eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union (engineered mainly by Soviet Jews) has helped to improve
trade figures. In fact, more than 70 per cent of Soviet Jews now have jobs,
and companies run by them are attracting attention for their rate of growth.
Yet, the feeling persists that the Soviet Jews are not assimilating. 'We
don't ever see them,' people often say. 'We don't feel their presence.'
Perhaps it is because those who are assimilating are becoming Israeli and,
therefore, unremarkable, while those who are not will never be noticed by
the mainstream, anyway. But the Russians themselves often say the same
thing: we are invisible here, we don't matter.
Perhaps, though, it is because there is little pleasure for an immigrant in
assimilating. For Ilyusha, fitting in is a matter of working out the system
and then conforming to it. For someone older, adapting can also include
realising that an entire life's accumulated wisdom no longer has much
relevance.
Even for those with good jobs and flats, the pace of life has accelerated
and responsibilities have multiplied. New habits will take many years to
form, the attainment of happiness many more.
The experience of Russians in Israel could help to explain why Russians in
Russia also vote in protest against the changes there: unless imposed from
above, no one will undergo them willingly. Ilyusha merely shrugged when I
asked if he was pleased he had decided to leave. 'Happy I left Lvov, yes.
Happy in Israel? Too early to say.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Fowler stance on European federalists irks Tory factions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, came under attack from
pro- and anti-European Tories yesterday after distancing the party from its
federalist allies in the European parliament, the European People's party.
In a speech in his Sutton Coldfield constituency, Sir Norman said
Conservative members of the European parliament 'will not be bound by, nor
will they stand upon' the manifesto prepared by the European People's party
for June's European Parliament elections.
Sir Norman said the MEPs expected to disagree with the EPP over its support
for the Social Chapter and a single currency within Europe. But instead of
appeasing leading Tory Eurosceptics such as Mr Bill Cash and Sir Teddy
Taylor, Sir Norman's speech provoked criticism within party ranks.
Sir Teddy said: 'Sir Norman should explain why our MEPs are allied with the
EPP if it has such shocking opinions. The tragedy of this whole business is
that the Conservative party has grown apart from the people.'
Mr Cash called on the party chairman to repudiate the EPP's call for a
common immigration policy, a separate European Union defence policy and a
European central bank.
'If Sir Norman wants to distance himself from some of the policies of the
EPP, he should distance himself from all of their polices. Let's be clear
where we stand so we do not deceive the voters,' Mr Cash said.
Tory officials had hoped that Sir Norman's speech would avert a split on
federalism in advance of the publication of the EPP's manifesto next week.
Leading MEPs said they had been reassured by Conservative Central Office
that it supported their attempts to make concessions to their federalist
allies. One said: 'Sir Norman's speech is an attempt to prevent an election
split that occurred in the 1989 European elections, with disastrous
consequences.'
But pro-European Conservative MPs made it clear they were as disappointed
with Sir Norman's speech as were the Eurosceptics. One prominent
pro-European Tory MP accused Sir Norman of 'mishandling the situation badly'
by 'pandering to the Eurosceptics'. He said unless the party put forward a
more positive view on Europe several of his colleagues would not bother to
campaign in the elections.
Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative MEPs, told Ludlow
Conservatives the EPP parliamentary alliance was designed to build a
centre-right Europe. 'It enables us to work together where we agree, and
diverge amicably on points where people differ.'
He is known to be angry with attempts by the Tory Eurosceptics to portray
Conservative MEPs as federalist.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Russian life 'tough but bearable': Living standards after
two years of reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of Russians regard life as 'tough but bearable' after nearly two
years of stop-go market reforms and months of economic crisis.
That is the attitude of 58 per cent of the population, according to a survey
published yesterday. But 28 per cent say they live in 'intolerable poverty',
and only 1 per cent believe they are now 'very well off'.
The All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research found that 9 per cent of
3,977 Russians polled were optimistic or rich enough to argue that 'things
are not as bad as all that'.
The polling was carried out across the country by the organisation which
forecast last December's election victory of ultra-nationalist Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
Asked to evaluate their material situation, 33 per cent of those polled said
they were badly off, 7 per cent thought they were 'well off' and 51 per cent
said their situation was 'average'.
In recent years, Russian industry has suffered severe job losses, with
factories closing or laying off workers. The population has also had to
contend with continuing food shortages and rapidly rising prices.
The survey coincided with attempts yesterday by Russian officials to
persuade the International Monetary Fund that reform was still on course and
the economy under control. An IMF delegation was in Moscow to clarify
Russia's market reform plans since the shift in political direction after
December's elections.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who faces a credibility problem
after pledging to fight inflation by non-monetary means, is believed to have
warned officials they will be sacked if the IMF does not disburse a new loan
of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn).
Russian officials have told the IMF that the government will drive inflation
down to 10 per cent a month by the end of this year, from about 20 per cent.
They argued that Moscow was still committed to achieving financial
stabilisation, despite the resignation of its most ardent proponents in the
Russian government.
The IMF has publicly expressed confidence that the Dollars 1.5bn, the second
tranche of a facility to help countries switch from communism to capitalism,
may be forthcoming.
Privately, however, officials said yesterday they were concerned about
granting new money when it was still unclear whether or not Russia would
stick to its budget promise to control spending and inflation.

FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Pinault-Printemps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Being a minority shareholder in a French company can be a perilous business,
as investors in Canal Plus will readily testify. But those in La Redoute,
which is being bought out by Pinault-Printemps at a sub-market price, would
appear to have even greater cause for complaint. Given that
Pinault-Printemps already owns 54 per cent of La Redoute's shares and has
the support of other interested parties, the deal appears as good as done.
But Pinault-Printemps' scrip issue before the one-for-one share swap
inflicts a further humiliation.
The net effect is that La Redoute's shareholders will have to accept low
quality Pinault-Printemps paper worth about FFr900 in return for their
shares in a promising retailer with a market value of FFr960. The mysterious
13 per cent fall in La Redoute's shares over the past month - at a time when
there was speculation that it would be sold - is a another story in itself,
which the French stock exchange should perhaps seek to unravel. This episode
is hardly the best advertisement for the French equity market at a time when
the government is trumpeting the virtues of Paris as a financial centre. Mr
Francois Pinault's abrupt treatment of minority shareholders at the time of
the Au Printemps acquisition prompted an official review of French takeover
rules. One hopes his latest deal will provoke a similar response.

<TEXT>
Come on Italy] may be the name of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new political
movement but it also sums up sentiment towards the country's stock market.
Italian equities have shot ahead by more than 40 per cent over the past
year, outstripping gains in the UK, France and Germany. The market has been
particularly strong since the start of 1994 with investors exhibiting steady
nerves ahead of next month's unpredictable general election.
Yesterday's 0.5 percentage point cut in the discount rate confirms some
favourable trends. The lower lira has stimulated export gains. Economic
growth has resumed. Emerging Italian mutual funds and overseas investors
have pumped liquidity into the market in anticipation of earnings recovery.
On Kleinwort Benson's estimates, the market has moved to a rating of 27
times 1994 earnings. The restricted choice of stocks may have led to some
over-enthusiastic buying of big industrial groups, such as Fiat, Olivetti
and Montedison, but the telecommunications and banking sectors are now
gaining favour. The multiples on many second-tier Italian companies do not
look so highly stretched.
The worst case scenario for Italian politics - and the market - is that no
clear government emerges and confusion reigns for several weeks. But, at
least, the privatisation momentum is unlikely to stall. The right favours
privatisation for ideological reasons, the left because it breaks the mould
of economic power. Both recognise its financial imperative, given the size
of Italy's deficit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good week for Lloyd's of London. The tragic death of
another Lloyd's Name and the rejection of the market's proposed Pounds 900m
settlement of past losses are evidence, if any were needed, that the pain
remains real. Lloyd's proclaims that there will be no improved offer to
losing Names. But the prospect of litigation and years of bad publicity must
make the authorities' hearts sink every bit as much as those of the
aggrieved Names. A deal is surely there to be done. Perhaps Lloyd's
hard-nosed attitude arises because progress is being made elsewhere.
Corporate capital is in, and a dustbin for old liabilities is under
construction. Lloyd's is considering the possibility of trading
participations in syndicates for future underwriting years. That would allow
Names to realise value for what is, in effect, the membership of a rather
unpopular club.
This conjures an asset from thin air, but raises serious issues. In effect,
current members of syndicates would be granted saleable pre-emption rights
over underwriting capacity. That may be preferable to the grace-and-favour
indulgence previously granted by Members' Agents. It may also alleviate some
problems if Names can sell their membership of profitable syndicates to
cover losses elsewhere. But corporate members may object to this assignment
of value to Names. The move will also increase the hybrid nature of many
syndicates, with membership increasingly split between limited and unlimited
liability. If the market runs into serious claims during the transition to
fully limited liability, this pantomime horse could fall apart.

FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Yielding ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two things seem to be worrying equities. One is the domestic concern that,
after botching the presentation of the latest rate cut, the authorities have
lost the policy initiative just when recovery prospects are overshadowed by
April's tax increases. The other is the international concern that the
liquidity flow that has boosted world financial markets will dry up now the
Federal Reserve has begun to tighten.
With the New York bond market jumpy about how quickly the Fed will tighten
again, there is not much incentive to put more cash into any leading bond
market. That already makes it harder to disguise the extent to which the
governments of industrial countries are under pressure to raise money. When
bond markets start to worry about supply, the natural consequence is that
real yields rise, even though inflationary pressures still appear dormant.
The UK may be more advanced on the recovery road than the rest of Europe but
equities can do without a general trend towards higher real yields.
Compounding the problem is sterling's weakness, which may make further base
rate cuts harder even if domestic economic developments suggest they are
desirable. There is still a chance that, having moved sharply down this
week, the gilts market has created leeway to absorb next week's auction
comfortably. If it does not, equities will be in for a rougher ride. Despite
yesterday's sharp fall, the FT-SE 100 index was barely changed on the week
and selling pressure has been modest. Obviously the market also has an eye
on the results season getting under way in earnest next week. But it will
now have to be really good to reassure.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Global bond markets fall sharply on reports of heavy US
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World bond markets fell sharply yesterday afternoon as reports of heavy
selling by US investors created nervousness among international investors.
'There was an air of panic in the markets,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head
of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), describing conditions
at one stage as a 'bloodbath'. Stocks were hit on Wall Street by a fall in
the US bond market.
The activity in Europe was mainly in the futures markets and bond dealers
said the main culprits were the US hedge funds - private pools of funds
which are managed very aggressively and are highly geared. Such funds were
buyers of European government bonds - particularly in the futures market -
last year and now appear to be liquidating their positions.
Dealers at US securities houses in London said rumours had swept the bond
markets of hedge funds being forced to close out their positions in order to
stem losses. 'There are rumours that some of the big hedge funds are in
trouble because they are highly leveraged players, and they are being forced
to liquidate their positions,' said one trader.
On Wall Street, longer-dated US Treasury bonds went into a steep fall for a
second consecutive session, prompting a sell-off on the share market.
Mixed news on inflation made the prospect of a second increase in short-term
interest rates loom larger, with Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, set to deliver his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on
monetary policy to a congressional committee next Tuesday.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.621 per cent, the first
time it has broken 6.60 per cent since last July. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average finished 35.18 lower at 3,887.46 on volume of 289m shares.
In the UK, analysts said the gilts market had not responded to economic
statistics, which pointed to low inflation and subdued growth. Gilt futures
closed down nearly 1 1/4 points. Bonds, Page 10

FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges on free fall in
long bonds

Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks plunged yesterday as longer-dated US bond prices went
into a free fall for the second day running, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.18 lower at 3,887.46. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was steadier, closing down 2.66 at
467.68. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite fell 3.51 to
470.95, and the Nasdaq composite 1.39 to 788.85.
NYSE volume, at 289m shares, was moderate. Declines led advances, 1,411 to
699.
Two sharp swings in the Dow industrial index the previous session brought a
subdued tone to the opening. Stocks drifted lower as investors mulled over
the bond market's perplexing reaction to Thursday's mixed signals on
inflation.
In spite of a favourable reading on consumer prices, traders chose to focus
on a second-tier regional report suggesting higher prices paid by
manufacturers. Analysts interpreted the subsequent sell-off as the most
convincing demonstration of a change in sentiment since the Federal Reserve
took a first step in tightening monetary policy two weeks ago.
As the financial markets looked ahead to Tuesday's congressional appearance
by the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Green span, bonds tumbled once again yesterday.
By the close, the 30-year government issue was bid down 1 1/32 to 95 5/32 ,
after sliding a point the previous session. The blue chips followed closely
behind, falling by as many as 40 points before regrouping and retracing some
ground.
When the closing bell sounded, all but three of the 30 Dow industrial
components were showing declines. The exceptions were Sears, up Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 46 7/8 , DuPont, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 54 7/8 , and
Woolworth, unchanged at Dollars 24. Among the biggest losers, 3M dropped
Dollars 2 to Dollars 105, McDonald's shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2
and Disney Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 .
Paramount Communications was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at 75 amid investors'
misgivings about its pending merger with Viacom. The latter's B shares fell
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 , while Blockbuster Entertainment, Viacom's
ally, added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 .
Some semiconductor stocks were better after Mr Rajiv Chaudri, a Goldman
Sachs analyst, said prices for DRAM chips were firming. Micron Technologies
jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to a new 52-week high of Dollars 65 1/2 , while Texas
Instruments shot up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 79 1/4 .
Brazil
Sao Paulo dropped 9.2 per cent at the close, hit by heavy profit-taking
sparked by renewed concerns over the approval by Congress of economy
minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's social welfare fund proposal.
The Bovespa index ended 960 down at 9,449 points.
The market was ripe for some profit-taking and portfolio-squaring ahead of
Monday's options settlement, but analysts said today's drop came as a
surprise.
Canada
Toronto's stock prices closed lower in relatively light trading as shaky
bond markets continued to drive down North American equities.
The TSE-300 Composite index fell 28.89 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at
4,378.39. Volume was about 59.2m shares, down from yesterday's 82.2m.
The Composite index finished the see-saw week down about 27 points.

FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes week on a
higher note

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cautiousness over currency movements prevailed, and share prices closed
moderately higher after fluctuating in a narrow range on small lot
index-linked trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 28.21 to 18,959.60 after a high of 19,078.41 and
a low of 18,873.09, a week's loss of 2.5 per cent. The index rose in the
morning on Thursday's gains in the Chicago Nikkei futures market; however,
afternoon selling on the Singapore futures market pushed share prices lower.
While the yen stabilised against the dollar at the Y105 level, lingering
worries over currency fluctuations left investors inactive. Volume was 260m
shares against 299m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.56 to 1,557.11 and the
Nikkei 300 closed up 0.90 to 287.96. Losers led gainers by 505 to 471, with
187 issues remaining unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.93 to 1,294.50.
Telecommunications stocks, which had lost ground this week on US threats of
trade sanctions, firmed with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rising Y14,000
to Y900,000 and NEC advancing Y11 to Y979.
Sony surged Y230 to Y6,030 on better than expected earings estimates for the
year to March. Aiwa, a Sony subsidiary, rose Y30 to Y2,300.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, plunged Y220 to Y7,280 on reports of
poor earnings estimates. After the market closed, the company announced that
it would report a pre-tax profit of Y42.5bn for the current year to March,
instead of the previously forecast Y57.5bn, due to slack earnings in Europe.
Pioneer Electronic plunged Y220 to Y2,580 on prospects of the company's
first loss since its listing in 1964.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.45 to 21,096.20 in volume of 43.1m shares.
Roundup
A depressing theme, taking in interest rates, bond markets and pressure on
equities, weighed on the region yesterday.
HONG KONG finished cautious ahead of a key interest rate meeting, the Hang
Seng index closing 39.30 higher at 10,825.88, but 5.9 per cent lower on the
week.
Brokers were talking about a rate increase in line with that in the US but,
in the event, the prime rate was held at 6.5 per cent. Nevertheless,
analysts said that they still expected a rate increase soon and, in London,
the Fleming Hong Kong index fell 124 to 10,702.
TAIWAN hit more selling in the financial sector as the weighted index closed
off 60.02 at 5,845.47, down 7.1 per cent over the two week period which
included a week's closure for the Chinese new year.
The Big Three banks fell between TDollars 6 and TDollars 8. One observer
said that some investors were withdrawing from banks and focusing on
asset-backed issues.
BANGKOK ended a volatile session higher, with the SET index recording a rise
of 10.88 to 1,456.08, a week's gain of 3.5 per cent. Turnover was firm at
Bt10.2bn. Bangkok Bank remained the main focus of interest, losing Bt3 at
Bt197.
KUALA LUMPUR moved higher after Thursday's setback in improved turnover of
MDollars 1.4bn compared with the previous session's MDollars 831m. The
composite index gained 14.59 to 1,086.73, barely changed on the week.
AUSTRALIA saw a sharp fall in bonds as an ADollars 150m fixed interest
portfolio moved slowly through the market, and the All Ordinaries index
closed 17.7 softer at 2,223.2, 0.8 per cent down on the week in turnover of
ADollars 481m.
The gold index lost 25.4, or 1.5 per cent to 2,392.0, but Samantha Gold
jumped 30 cents to ADollars 6.90 on what was described as a recent excellent
quarterly report. Petroz peaked at ADollars 1.17 before closing another 5
cents to the good at 95 cents, up since Wednesday when it announced that its
well in the Timor Gap was the first to strike oil in the region.
NEW ZEALAND also blamed the bond market as the NZSE-40 index dropped 40.74
to 2,284.17, down 2.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of NZDollars 65m.
BOMBAY advanced on sustained buying by domestic investors and mutual funds,
bringing lifting the BSE 30-index by 47.65 to 3,915.04.

FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Derivatives expiry meets bad
bonds news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news on the US business outlook from the Philadelphia Fed hit the US
long bond on Thursday night, feeding through into European bond markets and
equities yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's Dax index, initially, lost some of the post-bourse gains it
chalked up after the Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday afternoon. While the
blue chip indicator closed officially 23.25 higher at 2,151.97, 2.9 per cent
up on the week, this was some 10 points below the Ibis close of the day
before.
Worse was to come. Wall Street opened weaker again and the Ibis Dax
eventually dropped another 18.12 to 2,133.85.
The bourse also had domestic considerations. Yesterday saw the expiry of
stock options, and options on the DAX future which held up during the
session but dropped heavily thereafter, hitting 2,138.0, down 49.0 at one
point late in the day. Turnover, frequently affected by the expiry
operation, rose from DM8.5bn to DM9.9bn.
Furthermore, brokers were worried about the prospects of industrial strife,
with IG Metall officials due to vote on a strike ballot on Monday.
PARIS retreated in late trading in line with the trend elsewhere. The
session was extended because of a technical problem, the CAC-40 index ending
off 29.40 at 2,251.78, a week's loss of 1 per cent.
Aside from influences outside of the equity market, particularly in the
matif, there was little to stimulate trading activity, with turnover a low
FFr3.3bn.
Pinault-Printemps, the retailer, announced that it was to merge with La
Redoute, its mail order division. Both shares were suspended until Monday,
having closed on Thursday at FFr995 and FFr960 respectively.
Euro Disney was one of the day's few risers, up FFr1.40 at FFr36.60, but the
shares remain 14 per cent down since the beginning of this year.
AMSTERDAM slid into negative territory in the afternoon session, influenced
partly by the expiration of options. However, sentiment remained uncertain,
with some traders suggesting that the market might start to consolidate
around these levels.
The AEX index closed off 6.00 or 1.4 per cent at 426.91, a week's fall of
1.7 per cent.
Investors are also taking profits ahead of results due out in the next week
or so from Royal Dutch, down Fl 3.50 at Fl 208.70, Unilever, off Fl 3.10 at
Fl 225.50 and Akzo, down 10 cents at Fl 213.60.
ZURICH brokers said that the expiry of futures and options contracts helped
lead the market lower. Volume was low as the blue-chip, SMI index fell 44.7
to 3,025.9, still showing a recovery of 1.3 per cent on the week.
The blue chips led the way down, as they had led on the upgrade earlier in
the week. The SPI all-share index fell 21.73 to 1,926.45. Roche, SFr80 lower
at SFr7,015, led the active list. Since volume was low, it did not take much
to drive prices lower and push some shares down to the derivatives' strike
prices.
MADRID, always susceptible to foreign market weakness, was also led into a
late correction by the expiry of the February futures contract.
Bond market weakness cancelled out the Bank of Spain's decision to cut its
daily intervention rate by 25 basis points, to 8.55 per cent.
The general index fell 2.52 to 345.46, 0.7 per cent lower on the week.
Volume almost doubled in the last 45 minutes of the session as the futures
expiry boosted activity - although total turnover, at Pta33.9bn, was well
below its recent daily average.
Telefonica fell Pta30, or 1.4 per cent to Pta2,045. Banks were generally
weak and while Banesto recovered Pta25 at Pta785, BBV lost Pta20 at Pta3,405
and BCH Pta30 at Pta2,960.
STOCKHOLM retreated with heavy profit-taking seen in Volvo following the
Thursday's news that the Swedish car maker and Renault of France were to end
their strategic alliance. Volvo Bs lost SKr9 to SKr683, but closed the week
still 4.6 per cent ahead.
The Affarsvarlden index lost 6.60 to 1,582.40, also 4.6 per cent higher over
the week.
Turnover was up to SKr4.2bn from SKr2.9bn, with activity in Volvo accounting
for nearly half of yesterday's amount.
ATHENS moved upwards on prospects of a peaceful settlement in the Bosnian
conflict, leaving the general index up 36.94 to 1,067.35, and 0.5 per cent
higher across the week.
Turnover was estimated at Dr8bn, with construction companies outperforming
the market with rises of 8 per cent.
ISTANBUL brought its week's gains to nearly 40 per cent as the composite
index advanced a further 143.64 to 19,274.64. However, some traders
commented that further rises might be restricted because of instability in
the money markets. Turnover was down to TL1,440bn from Thursday's TL1,540bn.

FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Milan defies forecasts of political
turbulence - A strong Italian performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's surprise cut in the German discount rate, which was followed by
a similar move from the Bank of Italy, gave Milan's increasingly
overburdened screen-based trading system an extra workload it hardly needed.
Spurred by the privatisation boom and the steady fall in international
interest rates, US policy notwithstanding, the Comit share index has risen
by 11 per cent so far this year and 1.3 per cent in the past week.
Meanwhile, daily equity turnover, arguably an even better indication of
sentiment, has soared. For a number of days this month, trading easily
exceeded L1,000bn (Dollars 591m). For brokers brought up on the market's
previous lowly volume, - let alone the nadirs of the summer of 1992 - such
activity seems virtually incredible.
This year's strong performance belies the pundits who, as recently as last
December, were recommending clients to sell ahead of growing political
uncertainties. Surprisingly, the expected political turbulence has not yet
materialised. Although an election date has now been set for March 27, and
the political scene remains in turmoil as parties scramble to form
alliances, investors have not taken fright.
Most analysts expect pre-poll nervousness eventually to have some impact.
The post-election period is also unlikely to be a honeymoon, as politicians
jockey for position in whatever new government takes shape, and matters may
be clarified only some weeks after election day.
So far, investors appear to have been unmoved by the possible turbulence
ahead. That is partly because of an energetic 'charm offensive' by the
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former communists, who are widely
expected to perform well at the polls.
PDS leaders have for some time been meeting bankers discreetly to calm fears
about the potential consequences of an election victory. Later this month,
Mr Achille Occhetto, the party leader, and a group of top followers are
expected to take the message to the City of London at a seminar arranged by
a leading merchant bank.
Political anxieties may also have been eased by the arrival on the political
scene of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. If some polls are to be
believed, Mr Berlusconi - Italy's answer to Mr Ross Perot, the former US
presidential candidate - could make a strong showing. In the next
parliament, his political alliance with the Northern League could create a
strong centre-right wing counterbalance to a left-leaning government.
The market's performance, however, owes a great deal to the weight of money
flowing into equities, much of it from abroad. Many investors in the UK, let
alone the US, appear either ignorant of, or uninterested in short-term
politics. For many, Italy is a 'recovery story', where decades of corruption
and mis-government are being swept away.
On the corporate side, the outlook may be gloomy for 1994, but a strong
cyclical upswing is in sight. Moreover, privatisation, now speeding ahead,
offers both special situations in the short-term and more efficient, better
managed companies for the future.
'We are seeing a lot of big institutional investment, especially from the
US,' says Ms Marie-Christine Keith, of NatWest Securities in London.
Such investors, distanced from Italy's everyday political upsets and
continuing corruption revelations, are taking a longer term view. For US
buyers riding on the strong dollar, Italian shares are also rather cheap.
The focus on recovery means attention has switched from former star
performers such as Benetton, bought on the back of strong export prospects,
to cyclical stocks which could benefit from the upswing.
That has led to heady rises in industrial blue chips such as Fiat, Pirelli
and Olivetti, in spite of their unappealing immediate prospects. Fiat warned
shareholders of a potential L1,800bn net loss for 1993, while Olivetti is
expected to stay firmly in the red for 1993.
Even troubled companies such as the Montedison industrial group, which was
facing a very uncertain future as recently as late last year, have become
favourites. Montedison's stock has powered ahead on the back of possible
stake building, triggering massive speculation. But the group's own
'recovery story', recently recounted via a Warburgs presentation in London,
has also convinced investors.
The question is whether the current buying spree is premature. Exporters
have enjoyed a surge in foreign business because of the lira devaluation,
with sales to countries outside the European Union rising particularly fast.
How significant the impact has been on big industrials such as Fiat,
Olivetti and Pirelli is rather less clear.
If the upswing in the domestic economy is delayed, the big foreign investors
now pouring into Italy may have second thoughts. Expectations will play an
important part. Prices may already look high for those recalling the
doldrums of summer 1992, but shares could still have much further to climb.
'We have clients who bought shares at their lows in summer 1992, forgot
about them for the next 18 months and are now sitting on 300 per cent
gains,' says one trader.

FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton stumbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness over Carlton Communications ahead of the annual meeting next
week sent the shares down 17 to 947p in a buoyant sector.
The selling was prompted by recent news that three big media organisations -
MAI, Time Warner and Pearson - had formed a consortium to bid for a national
Channel 5. The channel would be in competition with Carlton's terrestrial
broadcast arm.
There was also speculation that BZW, the company's joint broker, had lowered
its forecasts although Mr Peter Hilliar, BZW's leisure analyst, said: 'If we
were to change the figures we would move them up rather than down'.
Hoare Govett said the shares had underperformed the All-Share index by 4.7
per cent over the past month and fallen to a 10 per cent premium. Pearson
was steady at 720p and MAI firmed a penny to 296p. It was announced that
MAI's bid for Anglia (up 4 at 655p) would not be referred to the monopolies
and mergers commission.
Television stocks were enlivened by the implications of Thursday's deal
between Flextech, an arm of the world's biggest cable TV group, and HTV, the
Welsh and West of England broadcaster. USM-listed Flextech rose 13 to 457p
and HTV 7 to 159p. The improved bid potential gave a boost to the other
regional groups. Scottish gained 24 to 574p while Ulster jumped 44 to 760p.
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees rose 5 to 351p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo lost two thirds of the gains notched up after
Thursday's sparkling interim results. Some US investment houses refused to
be cheered by the figures. Lehman Brothers, for example, said at its morning
meeting: 'At a p/e of 15 times 1994 earnings Glaxo looks fully valued', and
advised clients to take profits whenever the stock broke through 700p. The
shares fell 18 to 679p.
Hong Kong-related stocks, which have closely reflected the fortunes of the
Hong Kong stockmarket recently, went their own ways. HSBC and Cable &amp;
Wireless fell 29 to 990p and 13 to 469p respectively on profit-taking.
Standard Chartered, benefiting from a recommendation by Swiss Bank, lifted
17 to 1302p.
Oil majors reflected a crude oil price at a five-year low of around Dollars
13 a barrel. Analysts expect oil prices to remain under pressure at least
until the next OPEC meeting in late March. BP fell 5 to 361p and Shell
Transport lost 5 at 729p.
ICI slid 15 to 774p ahead of figures on Thursday, which are forecast to
reflect a turnaround in profits. In spite of downgrades late last year on
concerns over tough trading conditions, analysts predict profits of between
Pounds 270m and Pounds 328m, compared with hefty losses last year.
Wellcome lost 8 at 656p. The company announced that the amount of shares
held in the form of American Depositary Receipts was below 4 per cent for
the first time since the 288m share offer by Wellcome Trust in August 1992.
The stake has fallen to 3.97 per cent from a peak of 8.7 per cent then.
Textiles company Atkins dropped 28 to 139p after a profits warning.
Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries added 4 at 479p on
perceptions that the group will benefit from this week's Dollars 6bn Saudi
aircraft order. Smiths is a supplier to Boeing.
A buyer of around 2m shares at 584p, boosted Inchcape, the shares gaining 3
to 579p.
Vosper Thorneycroft raced 27 ahead to 799p, after an agency cross of around
200,000 shares at 800p a share.
Concern over the extent of interest in the Channel tunnel helped P&amp;O, the
cross-Channel ferry operator, the shares adding 6 to 700p.
Ashtead resisted a thin day in building and construction stocks to rise 30
to 451p ahead of interims on Monday.
Composites insurers were dragged down with the market, in spite of good
figures expected next week. 'Pre-results torpor' was how one analyst
described the day, adding that the market was forecasting a downturn in
underwriting profits by 1994-95.
First to report next Tuesday is Guardian Royal Exchange, down 7 to 232p.
Charterhouse Tilney is forecasting a Pounds 165m profit. Commercial Union,
down 12 to 636p, reports on Wednesday, with Panmure Gordon forecasting
Pounds 190m against Pounds 24m last year. Thursday sees figures from Royal
Insurance, down 5 to 314p. General Accident fell 11 to 681p and Sun Alliance
10 to 378p.
A mixed trading statement from Greenalls confirmed the current dull trend
among domestic drinks stocks. The shares fell 5 to 455p.

FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs hit by worries over Offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bearish rumours surrounding the regional electricity companies (Recs) sent
shares across the sector sharply lower yesterday.
Prominent among these was speculation that one of the sector's leading
brokers was set to turn cautious on Monday. There was also talk that some
Recs face losses from the decision last week by Offer, the industry
regulator, to force National Power and PowerGen to peg electricity pool
prices. Some companies are said to have tied themselves into contracts with
the generators at the old rate and now face selling on the electricity at
the new lower rate. According to the more pessimistic versions, one of the
Recs faces losses up to Pounds 20m.
However, most analysts were dismissive of the rumours, which have also been
hotly denied by the companies, and point to regulatory concerns as the big
negative factor hanging over the shares. The Recs face their own Offer
review in the coming months and the intervention in the generating market
has increased fears of new regulation in the supply side.
Among those hurt by the rumours, Eastern slid 14 to 679p, Southern 12 to
674p and Northern 14 to 716p.
Meanhwile, the big UK generators gained on continuing relief over last
week's Offer ruling. SG Warburg said PowerGen and National Power offered the
best dividend growth prospects in the sector. 'This and the new regulatory
stability mean that the two stocks should be rated on an earnings and not a
yield basis,' said analyst Mr Nick Pink. PowerGen shares gained 5 to 579p
and National Power 3 to 502p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
March Footsie futures fell sharply yesterday, pulling the underlying market
lower and indicating further falls on Monday, as dealers reacted to a global
bond market slide writes Joel Kibazo.
An initial advance in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 soon gave way to
worries about US inflation.
At the official close March stood at 3,368, its low point of the session and
a 14-point discount to cash on volume of 15,387 contracts. A further slide
in after hours trading saw March close at at a 27 point discount to cash.
Expiry of the index options was the main feature in the traded options.
Turnover of 51,049 included 30,315 in the FT-SE 100

FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit by big international
bonds sell-off - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market took fright at the latest retreat by the all-important
US bond market, which impacted across international markets, and retreated
to close sharply lower on the session.
At the close yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index was 42.7 lower at 3,382.6 and
the FT-SE Mid 250 index was 28.8 down at 4,025.5. Over the week the 100
index rose 3.7 while the Mid 250 index fell 4.5.
There was a general feeling of deep unease across the markets with UK gilts
on the slide again and down over Pounds 1 1/4 at the long end. US bonds were
down a full point during London market hours and German bunds down over  3/4
of a point. Wall Street fell sharply also, retreating almost 40 points
before embarking on a rally.
The market's malaise came directly from the performance of US bonds and Wall
Street shares overnight when bonds were sold off heavily just before the
close following a warning that US inflation could be about to accelerate.
The warning came from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve business outlook for
February which said regional prices were moving up. The report fuelled
strong speculation that inflation pressures could be building in the US.
Adding to the market's discomfort was a persistent rumour that one of the
biggest US investment banks had been badly hit by the recent retreat in US
bonds and was having to unload bonds and stocks across international
markets.
There were suggestions two weeks ago that Goldman Sachs had been badly
wrong-footed by the markets and suffered exceptionally heavy losses. The
investment bank denied the rumours.
The equity market was under strong pressure from the outset, with the FT-SE
opening down 19.7 points. A mild attempt at a rally followed the January
money supply figures which prompted hopes of further cuts in UK interest
rates, but it quickly petered out.
Led down by the FT-SE future which traded at a substantial discount to the
cash market all day, the 100 index fell away to a session low of 3,382.2
shortly before the close.
Senior marketmakers, although disturbed by the size of the fall in share
prices, emphasised the orderliness of the retreat. 'There was sizeable
selling and some aggressive marking down by marketmakers, but it never ever
resembled a panic,' said the head of sales at one broking firm. Asked
whether the London market would sell-off again on Monday, one leading
marketmaker said the FT-SE would probably match any fall in the Dow Jones
Average last night 'point for point'.
Also affecting sentiment in the market was the expiry of the FT-SE February
index options and evidence of at least one and possibly two big sell
programmes going through the market during the morning. And one of the
market's most aggressive marketmaking houses was said to have taken a view
of the market in mid-morning and unloaded heavy blocks of stock across the
market.
Strategists said the FT-SE could well test its recent support level of 3,350
in the short term and would probably see 3,300 before it gets back to 3,500.
Turnover yesterday was a lowly 630.9m shares, giving credence to stories
that marketmakers were reluctant to deal in the face of the uncertainties
surrounding bond markets. The value of customer business on Thursday dropped
to Pounds 1.4bn, the lowest of the week.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trend of European interest rate cuts continued yesterday with Sweden,
Denmark, Finland and Spain following the example set by Germany on Thursday,
writes Philip Gawith.
Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy had already cut rates on
Thursday.
After weakening on Thursday, the D-Mark yesterday made up ground against
most European currencies as other countries cut rates. The market appeared
to be rewarding the easing of policy as being good for growth.
Elsewhere, sterling traded lower after disappointing lending figures
prompted concern about the strength of economic recovery, raising the
prospect of a further rate-cut.
In Europe the Danish central bank cut its discount and key deposit rate to
5.50 per cent from 5.75 per cent; Sweden cut its key marginal rate to 7.25
from 7.50 per cent; the Bank of Finland's money market tender rate fell to
4.75 from 4.95 per cent and the Bank of Spain reduced its daily intervention
rate by about 0.25 to around 8.55 per cent.
The Spanish cut surprised domestic money markets. Some analysts saw the
easing as a possible gesture to help Spain's fragile economic recovery.
The Danish Central Bank governor Mr Erik Hoffmeyer told Reuters in an
interview that having brought Danish key rates down to the same level as in
other European countries, Denmark would probably now follow the general
European downward trend in interest rates.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said the stronger D-Mark was
a case of markets 'rewarding pro-growth policy initiatives.'
Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, cautioned however against D-Mark
appreciation because of reflex pessimism about the likely pace of monetary
easing. 'If the D-Mark is going up because another cut is not seen for
another 4 months, then it's on dodgy ground.' Mr Turner said Germany looked
to be 'firmly back on the easing path.'
A feature of the European scene yesterday was the failure of the French
central bank to cut rates despite the depressed state of its economy. Mr
MacKinnon said a 'very significant' relaxation was required to ensure
economic recovery.
With the Bundesbank, however, expected to concentrate on steadying market
expectations rather than pursuing a path of dramatic cuts, he predicted
rates might not fall 'fast enough or to levels that are to the liking of the
French.'
Sterling closed yesterday at DM2.5406, down from DM2.5559 on Thursday. Part
of the weakness can be attributed to the the release of M4 bank and building
society figures - lending rose Pounds 200m in January compared to market
forecasts of a Pounds 2.5bn increase - suggesting that the private sector
remains unwilling to take on new debt.
A further factor weighing on sterling is the perception that UK rates may
well fall faster than those in Germany, following the Bundesbank's cautious
easing of policy on Thursday.
Sterling also finished stronger against the weak US dollar, closing in
London at Dollars 1.4788 from Dollars 1.474 on Thursday.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 900m of
assistance yesterday afternoon after not operating in the market in the
morning.
This assistance matched a forecast liquidity shortage of around Pounds 900m,
revised up from an earlier estimate of about Pounds 700m.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Aluminium
and copper  set pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium and copper continued to set the tone at the London Metal Exchange
this week and all base metals contracts finished higher.
Further output cut announcements by western aluminium producers (the latest
yesterday of 37,000 tonnes from Spain's Inespal) took the total since last
month's multilateral agreement in Brussels to 737,000 tonnes a year; and an
official of Russia's Aluminiy producer group helped to shore up a sometimes
shaky market with an assurance that his country's cuts, 100,000 tonnes a
year so far, would grow to 300,000 tonnes by the end of April.
Cheered by these developments, the market, which on Monday had tested
support at Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three months delivery, was able to
resume the uptrend that was interrupted last week. Yesterday morning three
months metal touched a fresh 18-month peak of Dollars 1,330 a tonne before
settling back to close at Dollars 1,321.50, up Dollars 56.50 on the week and
Dollars 149 since the conclusion of the Brussels meeting.
Three months copper surrendered Dollars 9 of its rise yesterday but still
ended Dollars 62 up on the week at Dollars 1,906.50 a tonne. Far Eastern
buying was the main influence in the rise and a substantial reduction in LME
warehouse stocks, though widely expected, helped to underpin the market. A
sustained fall has reduced exchange copper stocks by 52,950, or 8.5 per
cent, since mid-January.
Constructive chart patterns helped the zinc market to rally following the
heavy set-back caused by last week's news of the collapse of European
producers' efforts to forge an agreement for jointly financed output cuts.
After dipping to Dollars 948 a tonne on Tuesday the three months price
closed yesterday at Dollars 994.50, up Dollars 22 on the week.
A renewed uptrend in the tin market was fuelled by concern about supply
tightness developing for the early May delivery period. That resulted in
cash metal moving from a Dollars 52.50 discount against three months at the
end of last week to a Dollars 5 premium.
In the precious metals market the platinum price was yesterday knocked off a
five-year peak as selling spilled over from a weak gold market. The price
had been lifted to Dollars 404.50 a troy ounce in London by concern about
possible disruption to production during the South African election campaign
and Japanese buying encouraged by the weakness of the yen. But it was fixed
yesterday afternoon at Dollars 399 an ounce, still Dollars 9 to the good, as
the gold price plunged Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 378.50, near the bottom of
its recent trading range.
Oil prices were also very weak, with New York futures hitting five-year
lows. Traders said there were no particular developments to account for the
weakness of the market, which was still suffering from Opec inaction on
cutting excessive production.
At London's International Petroleum Exchange the prompt April futures
position, which dipped to Dollars 12.96 a barrel on Thursday morning, was
quoted in late trading yesterday at Dollars 13.20 a barrel, down 56 cents on
the week.
Technical rallies boosted both coffee and cocoa futures at the London
Commodity Exchange yesterday. May delivery coffee broke through resistance
at Dollars 1,228 a tonne and moved on to close at Dollars 1,243, up Dollars
16 on the day and Dollars 39 on the week. Cocoa, which had been trading in a
narrow range, put on a late spurt to end at Dollars 919 a tonne in the May
position, up Dollars 31 on the week.

FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Skopbank cuts operating losses
to FM1.7bn

<TEXT>
The crisis at Skopbank, the state-controlled Finnish bank, eased last year
after a halving of operating losses to FM1.70bn (Dollars 309m) from FM3.59bn
a year earlier.
However, the bank expects to make another loss this year and it is likely to
require further state support.
Skopbank is the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis. The bank has
received a total of FM17.03bn in government assistance since it was rescued
by the Bank of Finland in September 1991.
Last year's improvement was largely the result of a 40 per cent drop in
credit losses to FM1.7bn from FM2.8bn.
However, the group benefited from a 69 per cent rise in income to FM728m and
a 41 per cent fall in expenses to FM649m.
Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has changed
following the sale of the Savings Bank of Finland to four other Finnish
banks last autumn.
Skopbank continues to service domestic corporate customers and represent the
savings banks in wholesale markets.

FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pinault bids for La Redoute
minority

<TEXT>
Pinault-Printemps, the French retail group, yesterday announced an all-share
offer to take full control of La Redoute, its mail order subsidiary,
triggering protests from minority investors over the terms of the deal.
Pinault, which has been transformed from a small Breton timber business into
one of France's largest distribution companies under the control of Mr
Francois Pinault, owns 54.4 per cent of La Redoute and is offering to buy
the remaining 45 per cent in a one-for-one share swap.
La Redoute, one of Europe's largest mail order companies which became part
of the Pinault group following its 1991 acquisition of Au Printemps
department stores, is capitalised at over FFr12bn (Dollars 2bn) on its
suspended share price of FFr960.
The Pinault group's shares were suspended at the slightly higher price of
FFr995. Pinault said it had decided to do the deal as a one-for-one share
swap due to the similarity of the two companies' share prices.
However, fund managers argued that the offer was too low given the 13 per
cent fall in La Redoute's shares over the past four weeks. 'Francois Pinault
is trying to buy La Redoute on the cheap,' said one fund manager. 'We'll
fight him: but being realistic he already owns enough of the shares to swing
the deal.'
Mr Pinault has fallen foul of minority shareholders in previous deals. The
outcry following the Au Printemps acquisition, when he won control through a
partial bid, triggered an official review of French takeover law.
The Pinault group, which is offering one free share to its own investors for
every 10 shares they own to compensate for the dilutive effect of the deal,
said it had launched the offer for commercial and strategic reasons.
Mr Pierre Blayau, chairman, said the deal offered an opportunity for the
group to maximise the scope for economies of scale in buying, technology and
some aspects of central management.
He said it would help strengthen Pinault's financial position. Pinault has
for some time been trying to reduce the debts left by its acquisitions. It
raised FFr5.8bn from disposals in 1983, thereby helping to cut net debt to
FFr12.5bn from FFr18bn.
The addition of La Redoute should help improve its financial performance. La
Redoute made net profits of FFr488m in 1992 (its last fully audited year)
against net profits of FFr586m in the same year for Pinault-Printemps.

for year

<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the commercial bank shortly to be
privatised by IRI, the Italian state holding company, has announced parent
company net profits up 1.8 per cent in 1993 to L268bn (Dollars 158.5m).
The results reflected a heavy increase in tax provisions, up to L713bn from
L290bn, and a large increase in the sums set aside for possible loan losses.
The latter item has been increased to L554bn from L373bn reflecting the
effect of recession in the domestic market. The proportion of doubtful loans
in BCI's portfolio rose to 3.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent - but this was
almost the average percentage for the Italian banking system.
Operating profit increased to L1,901bn from L1,088bn, a 75 per cent
increase. Net interest income for the year remained stable, marginally
increasing to L2,822bn from L2,816bn. Total assets amounted to L115,813bn
against L111,577bn at year end. Non-interest income rose 78 per cent to
L1,738bn, benefiting from favourable market conditions.
The directors are proposing unchanged dividends of L200 per ordinary share
and L230 for savings shares still outstanding after the conclusion on
February 11 of the offer to convert savings into ordinary shares paying L250
to BCI.
Net profit for the group as a whole, to be announced in mid February, is
expected to reflect an improved performance by BCI subsidiaries and allowing
a better overall result than in 1992.

FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Harwanne buys stake in Belgian
mines group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compagnie Fonciere du Chateau d'Eue de Paris (Focep), a subsidiary of
Harwanne, the Swiss financial group, is to acquire 64.7 per cent of
Compagnie Royale Asturienne des Mines' the Belgian mining group, at BFr880 a
share, which values Asturienne at BFr2.9bn.
Most of the 55.92 per cent stake in Asturienne is being sold by Union
Miniere, the Belgian metals and mining group, as part of its strategic plan
to dispose of some non-strategic assets to fund investments in its core
business. The rest of the Asturienne shares will come from UM's parent,
Societe Generale de Belgique.
Harwanne will fund the acquisition from its cash flow and intends to
maintain Asturienne's Brussels market listing. Banque Degroof, Focep's
adviser, 'will implement a procedure to maintain the price of the
(Asturienne) shares for the benefit of other shareholders', the company
promised.
Focep said the acquisition was in line with its expansion of its minerals
activities and that it was particularly keen to expand Asturienne's Cogebi
division which has operations in Belgium and the US and claims to be a world
leader in mica-based insulation products.
Asturienne owns La Compagnie Miniere de Toussit which operates a lead-silver
mine in Morocco. In 1992 this produced concentrate containing about 55,000
tonnes of lead and 1m troy ounces of silver.
Asturienne's 1992 accounts showed a BFr14m (Dollars 388,888) net loss. Most
of the loss was accounted for by another mine in Morocco, Societe Miniere du
Djebel Aouam (SMA), which was subsequently closed. While giving no details
until the accounts are finalised, UM said Cogebi 'generated a healthy profit
in 1993'.
Focep's minerals interests include Kaolins du Morbihan and Denain Anzin
Mineraux which operate profitably in France and Portugal.

FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla returns to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The improving fortunes of the Finnish forestry sector were underlined
yesterday when Metsa-Serla unveiled a FM269m (Dollars 49m) profit after
financial items for 1993.
The group said the result represented a FM559m swing from a FM290m loss in
1992.
It is the second Finnish forestry company this week to announce a return to
the black, following several years of losses. Enso-Gutzeit announced a
FM385m profit for 1993 on Wednesday after a FM192m deficit in 1992.
Both groups benefited from cost-cutting, the weaker Finnish markka, and
lower domestic costs rather than any upturn in market conditions.
Metsa-Serla saw sales rise to FM8.24bn from FM7.75bn. It said its three main
divisions all contributed to an increased operating profit of FM964m,
compared with FM718m in 1992.
Paper and paperboard showed the biggest improvement, doubling operating
profits to FM414m from FM199m. Corrugated board and tissue profits improved
to FM382m from FM352m, while sawn goods, pulp and chemicals rose to FM263m
from FM189m.
Another benefit came from lower interest costs, which helped reduce net
financial expenses to FM695m from FM1.01bn.
The group expects a further improvement in its result this year, due to
improving prices, higher volumes and reduced financial costs. Commenting on
market prospects, it noted: 'The over-supply situation is expected to ease,
but for many products a balance between supply and demand is unlikely in the
near future.'
The group strengthened its financial position considerably last year, helped
by an international share issue and the sale of more than half its stake in
Repola, Finland's largest industrial group. Gearing fell to 73.6 per cent
from 178.3 per cent.
Metsa-Serla is restoring its dividend, after a two-year suspension. It
proposes to pay FM2.00 per share.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austrian Airlines will buy a 42.85 per cent stake in Tyrolean Airways, the
country's second largest scheduled flights operator. The deal, which must be
approved by the companies' boards, is a further step towards restructuring
the country's airline industry and will strengthen the Austrian national
carrier's position in negotiations over co-operation with Lufthansa.
Under the transaction the share capital of Tyrolean Airways will be
increased by 50 per cent to Sch135m (Dollars 11.1m). Austrian is believed to
have paid close to Sch300m for its stake in the small but profitable
Tyrolean, whose Innsbruck-based operations have successfully served as a
regional hub for business and leisure traffic. Last year Tyrolean carried
510,000 passengers providing a turnover of about Sch1bn.
Mr Rudolf Steicher, chairman of Austrian's supervisory board, said the move
would strengthen both companies. Other shareholders will be Gernot
Langes-Swarovski, the fine crystal and glass manufacturer, with 42.85 per
cent and Leipnik Lundenburger Industrie, pulp and paper producer, with 14.3
per cent.
The services of the two airlines will be integrated using Tyrolean's 13
aircraft and 10 of Austrian's fleet - ones which are dedicated to regional
services within Austria and to short-range international destinations such
as Budapest and Zurich. The 23 aircraft will carry about 1.2m passengers.
Austrian is seeking co-operation with Lufthansa following the collapse of
attempts to set up a joint airline with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines
Systems and KLM.

Saurer, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, said its net
profit last year was higher than the SFr21.4m (Dollars 14.4m) earned in 1992
when operating profit was flat at SFr54.5m.
In a preliminary statement, the group described the result, on sales off 5.6
per cent to SFr1.7bn, as satisfactory in a very recessionary economic
situation marked by severe price competition.
Sales of the dominant spinning and embroidery systems division were down 3
per cent to SFr1.4bn. The components division, concentrated in Italy,
maintained sales in local currency terms thanks to the devaluation of the
lira and made an operating profit.

FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suzuki Spanish offshoot applies
for protection
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Santana Motor, the troubled majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of Suzuki of
Japan, was forced to apply for protection from its creditors yesterday in
the face of mounting losses.
The move raised fears that it could close down its assembly plant in
southern Spain, unless the company received help from the government.
Santana is one of the leading makers of four-wheel drive sports/utility
vehicles in Europe and produces the Suzuki Vitara and the Suzuki SJ series.
The financial collapse is a second setback for the Japanese vehicle maker's
expansion plans in Europe following the Volkswagen group's decision last
year to abandon the joint development programme for a small car between
Seat, its troubled Spanish subsidiary and Suzuki.
Suzuki, which holds an 82 per cent stake in Santana, said that it was only
prepared to cover losses of Pta5.2bn (Dollars 36.9m) to help restore the
company's balance sheet, a sum that falls short of the capital injection
required by Santana.
It was prepared to continue to provide technical and commercial support but
said that it would not make any additional financial contributions to
salvage Santana.
Santana is understood to have current assets of Pta24.5bn and liabilities of
Pta22.6bn.
The company's losses jumped by 53 per cent to Pta6.3bn in the first nine
months of last year from the corresponding period a year earlier. In July it
had accumulated debts of Pta16bn.
Suzuki's decision to apply for receivership underlines the gravity of the
crisis in the Spanish motor industry, where both Seat, the Spanish
subsidiary of Volkswagen, and Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish subsidiary
of Nissan of Japan, have suffered heavy losses and have undertaken drastic
restructuring programmes.
Suzuki said it did not feel bound by previous agreements on financial,
technical and commercial assistance to Santana that had been undertaken with
the regional government of Andalucia.
In March last year, it was agreed that subsidies by the local authorities
would match a Pta12bn three-year investment plan for Santana.
This agreement was jeopardised by the financial problems of the Anadalucia
government and when an attempted financial restructuring of Santana ran into
difficulties. This involved a write-down of the share capital to offset
losses and a subsequent rights issue.
The financial collapse is threatening the Santana plant at Linares, near
Cordoba, which has a workforce of 2,400 people. Production at the plant,
which chiefly assembles the Suzuki Vitara, fell by 6 per cent last year to
36,700 units from 39,000 in 1992.
It had forecast a drop this year to 25,000-30,000 units, and output fell by
38 per cent year-on-year in January to 1,654.
Suzuki appears unwilling to shoulder alone Santana's financial problems. Its
losses have risen sharply under the impact of the recession in the west
European new vehicle market, and under the impact of the appreciation of the
yen, which lifted the cost of imported components.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Atkins' shares decline 11% following
profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Atkins Group fell 11 per cent to 139p yesterday as the hosiery
manufacturer warned that net profits would be substantially lower this year
because of a sharp slowdown in trading during the final quarter.
Mr Andrew Freeman, chief executive, said Atkins had been enjoying 'a
rip-roaring nine months' and had increased operating costs to meet the
increased demand.
However, sales had slowed dramatically since the new year holiday.
Although turnover was still ahead of last year, it was substantially below
the 15 per cent increase experienced in the first half.
Mr Freeman said the slowdown had been due to weakening consumer demand and
retailer confidence.
Profits would also be hit by difficulties in the garments business. The
withdrawal from fabric dyeing, announced last year, had caused disruption
and loss of profitability in this division.
Mr Freeman stressed that the difficulties were 'not terminal. We are still
enthusiastic and encouraged about our prospects.'
During the year Atkins had increased its share of the depressed hosiery
market, he said, and now claimed a 7.5 per cent share in the UK. About 60
per cent of Atkins' sales are in hosiery.
In 1993 the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 448,000 for the year to
April 3, against a loss of Pounds 227,000 in 1992.
Gearing at the year end was expected to rise from an exceptionally low 17
per cent to 40 per cent. Last year the group benefited from asset disposals
and low stock levels.

<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has cleared the Pounds
292m bid for Anglia Television by MAI, the television and financial services
group.
Mr Heseltine said yesterday that the bid would not be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission following undertakings given by MAI.
The undertakings are the same as those obtained in Carlton Communications'
acquisition of Central Independent Television and Granada's hostile bid for
London Weekend Television.
Under the terms of the undertakings MAI must reduce its involvement in
television advertising sales to below 25 per cent of the total television
market.
This could mean disposing of stakes in sales houses or terminating sales
contracts.
The 25 per cent barrier can be marginally exceeded to allow enlarged
companies like MAI to sell advertising for smaller ITV companies which might
be disadvantaged because of lack of clout in the advertising market.
The Independent Television Commission is now reviewing its position on how
large a slice of advertising revenue a single ITV company can control.

Hanson has sold a further 2.75m shares in Wassall, the conglomerate run by
former Hanson executives, reducing its stake to less than 3 per cent, writes
Maggie Urry.
Hanson took a stake in 1988 when two of its executives moved into what was
then a tiny company.
In the 1992 accounts Hanson was shown as holding 13.6m shares, 8.9 per cent
of the total. In March last year it sold 6.18m shares for Pounds 14.5m. With
Wassall shares at 284p, down 3p yesterday, the shares sold would have been
worth Pounds 7.8m.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Southern Radio sells 22% stake in Orchard
Media
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Radio, which provides independent local radio services in
Hampshire, Sussex and Kent, has sold its 21.96 per cent stake in Orchard
Media, the commercial radio operator in Taunton and Yeovil, to Radio
Investments for Pounds 282,000.
The shares rose 9p to 111p.
Mr Rory McLeod, Southern's managing director, said the sale was part of the
group's strategy of focusing on its core business in the south-east of
England and investing in radio companies where the group could add value.
'The sale has provided further cash to boost the group's reserves, already
well ahead of budget following a first quarter of record revenues for the
company. New, exciting opportunities are emerging and Southern Radio is well
placed to take up those opportunities as they arise.'
In December, Southern reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 956,000 (Pounds 774,000) for the year to September 30 on turnover 13
per cent ahead to Pounds 8.61m (Pounds 7.64m).
Those results were the first full year for the group following the merger
with Invicta Radio in December 1991.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expansion plan for David Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in David Lloyd Leisure rose 5p to 240p yesterday after the tennis and
health club group announced a large-scale expansion plan.
The strategy follows an 84 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
5.67m (Pounds 3.1m) in the 12 months to September 30.
The company said that the expansion could double the size of the group and
would be financed from the proceeds of last year's Pounds 13.3m flotation.
Mr David Lloyd, chairman, said the group was involved in negotiations to
develop a number of new clubs around the country.
He told the group's annual meeting yesterday: 'Premature disclosure of these
sites would unnecessarily place the company in an exposed position in
relation to local competitors.'
He confirmed, however, that it was hoping to build clubs in Birmingham and
Bristol. The company already operates six clubs in London and the home
counties, one in Glasgow and one in Eastbourne.
'Meanwhile, I am pleased to report that current trading is particularly
encouraging,' Mr Lloyd added.
The shares have climbed steadily since flotation last year when the company
came to the market at 150p.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner to cut gearing via Pounds 16m
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gestetner, the distributor of office equipment and photographic supplies,
yesterday raised Pounds 16.2m net from a placing of shares aimed at reducing
gearing and providing capital for potential small acquisitions.
Mr Stephen King, finance director, said the board had decided the group was
undercapitalised following a Pounds 65m drop in shareholders funds last
year. The cash from the placing of 9.09m new shares at 180p, a 5 per cent
discount to Thursday's closing price. will reduce gearing from 66 per cent
to 53 per cent.
The issue, arranged by James Capel, is underwritten by Schroders.
The shares fell 8p to 181p yesterday.
Gestetner is emerging from a troubled period. It announced a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 33.2m for the year to October 1993, reflecting exceptional losses of
Pounds 50m to cover restructuring.
This represented the attempts of a revamped board of directors - comprising
Mr David Thompson, former Rank Xerox chairman, and three directors from
Inchcape - to reduce costs and refocus on the core office equipment
business.
Gestetner said at the time that a main objective for the current year was
the reduction of debt, and this could fall more substantially through
conversion of outstanding 6.75 per cent convertible loan stock.
In May 1993, when Inchcape, the international distribution and marketing
group, took a 15 per cent stake in Gestetner from Chiltern, an Australian
company, it bought an additional option to purchase its holding of
convertible loan stock.
Conversion of this stock would increase Inchcape's stake to close to 25 per
cent, and would reduce Gestetner's gearing to 30 per cent.
Inchcape's effective conversion price is 172p, and most brokers expect it to
take up the option, which expires on July 1. Conversion can take place up to
September 1999.
Mr King said operating conditions remained tough for Gestetner, although
sales were in line with expectations. 'We're not planning on market
expansion in any areas we operate in,' he said.
Brokers expect some further development of Gestetner's distribution network,
but no significant investment.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings is selling its 56.6 per cent stake in Euromobiliare, the
Italian investment bank, to Credito Emiliano.
HSBC said it had agreed in principle to sell the stake, which it acquired
through the takeover of Midland Bank in 1992, for about L56bn (Pounds
22.6m). It added that negotiations were continuing, and no date for a
transfer had been set.
Euromobiliare did not fit with its broader investment banking business, HSBC
said. Euromobiliare has capital markets and treasury operations, as well as
asset management, but is concentrated in domestic Italian business.
Euromobiliare shares slipped from a trading level of L2,965 after HSBC
disclosed that it had agreed with Credito Emiliano a price of L2,800 per
ordinary share, and L1,830 per non-convertible preference share.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons disposes of coffee activities
to concentrate on tea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons is breaking with its past through the sale of its coffee
operations, thought to be worth about Pounds 30m.
The Lyons coffee brand was established 90 years ago and coffee drinking has
been growing relative to tea drinking. However, Allied-Lyons has decided to
concentrate its 'hot beverages' activities on its Tetley tea business.
The group, which includes wines and spirits, brewing and retailing as well
as food manufacturing, said that Tetley had a better international spread
and was the predominant part of its hot beverages oper-ation.
It has 26.3 per cent of the UK tea market by value.
The coffee activities are being divided into two, instant and real. At
present the two are located on the same site at Greenford, Middlesex, but
are in separate factories.
The instant coffee business, employing about 400 people, is being sold to
Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of Philip Morris, the US food group, which
already owns the Kenco and Maxwell House brands.
KJS has 24 per cent of the UK instant coffee market and the acquisition of
the Lyons business, which largely makes for own-label customers, will give
it a further 11 per cent.
While KJS said the deal was subject to the approval of the Office of Fair
Trading, it took comfort from a 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report which cleared Nestle, which has 55 per cent of the instant coffee
market, from acting against the public interest.
KJS said the deal would make it a more effective competitor to Nestle.
It would still have the Lyons name for instant coffee.
The real coffee side is being bought by Paulig UK, part of the large Finnish
food group, which already owns the Melitta coffee brand in the UK.
Paulig UK also announced the appointment of Mr Richard Hancock as managing
director.
He said the deal would give Paulig UK more than 20 per cent of the real
coffee market in the UK making it the market leader.
Paulig is looking at moving production from Greenford, where 100 people are
employed on the real coffee side, to its own plant in Wimbledon, south-west
London. Some jobs could move with the work.
Allied-Lyons merged its UK and international hot beverages activities last
year, and the business has since undergone a thorough review which resulted
in the decision to sell the coffee side.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: St Michael sees his future in the cards -
Marks and Spencer's plan to extend the activities of its financial services
arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If credit card issuers had not asked so much in fees that Marks and Spencer
was not inclined to accept them in their stores, then St Michael might not
be on the brink of becoming the patron saint of pensions as well as of
clothes and food.
Over the past 10 years, the UK's most profitable retailer has developed from
issuing its own charge card, through making personal loans and unit trusts,
to announcing earlier this month that next year it will enter the pensions
and life assurance market.
Mr Keith Oates, now joint managing director, has been at the forefront of
devising M&amp;S's strategy for financial services throughout that time: he was
the first employee of M&amp;S Financial Services, the growth of which is
reflected in its contribution last year of Pounds 24m to the group's pre-tax
profits of Pounds 712.5m.
For him, a critical experience in developing the strategy came on a visit to
Sears, Roebuck, the US retailing giant. Mr Oates recalls that although
Sears, Roebuck had concluded - as M&amp;S was to do - that the way forward was
for a retailer to have its own card and develop its own financial services,
its operations did not communicate with each other.
'There was no flow between them, they couldn't see how the whole thing could
be integrated,' he comments.
Sears, Roebuck has since been disentangling itself from the sector: the US
group took several steps last year to scale down its involvement in
financial services.
It was apparent early on, however, that M&amp;S Financial Services was not going
to make the mistake of not communicating.
What started as an operation to issue a charge card, in order to save the
percentages of purchases passed on to credit card issuers, quickly became a
grander design as the organisation saw the possibilities in the data it
could accumulate about its customers from their use of the card.
'We looked at it two ways,' Mr Oates says. 'We could save these very large
costs, and if you allowed the other cards in, you hadn't got the database,
it was their database.'
Commercially, Mr Oates's enthusiasm for this information is impressive: from
the point of view of a personal customer, however, it is slightly chilling
to imagine the dossier on purchases and spending habits being built up in
M&amp;S's systems.
Once the M&amp;S charge card had reached a reasonable level in the late 1980s, a
move into personal loans was seen as 'the logical extension', first for
larger M&amp;S purchases as the store moved into furniture, and then more
generally. M&amp;S's high credit rating put it in a 'strong position' to lend to
customers at competitive rates.
A unit trust management company followed in 1988, but despite the heady
climate of the housing market during the 1980s, M&amp;S decided against moving
into mortgages and estate agency.
It is a decision the company is pleased now that it took. 'We've gone as far
as we want to in straight borrowing,' is Mr Oates's view. 'Mortgages would
be quite unsuitable for M&amp;S, they would bloat the balance sheet. We could
sell the debt, but then we would lose most of the profit.'
Nor are the concerns entirely financial: he is keenly aware of the wider
disadvantages of entering an area which could end in M&amp;S having to repossess
property from some of its customers.
But entering the life and pensions market, where complex products require
long-term commitment both from the organisation and the investor, carries
its own risks of disadvantage.
The sector, as many practitioners will testify, is going through a period of
uncertainty and change. There is a danger that a poor per-formance could
have an adverse impact on the brand image of the M&amp;S retailing business.
It already sounds odd, for example, despite the explanation that M&amp;S's two
unit trusts were designed to give a spread of risk-averse investment for the
'building society type of customer making a first move into equities', to
hear Mr Oates say of their average-ish performance that 'it was never our
aim to be number one'.
Even so, some of the advantages that M&amp;S will have are clear.
Its financial advisers will be salaried and receive no commission or
incentive to sell, in a move intended to intensify the confidence it is
likely to inspire anyway as a read-across from its high street presence. In
an industry where many consumers are, perhaps, increasingly inclined to
distrust advice, that could be a powerful attraction.
Similarly, its stated intention of focusing on better surrender values and
devising innovative products, suggests that it could be well-placed to give
some existing providers a run for their customers' money.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society will be involved in product development
and training plans, and will also provide consultancy and systems support.
M&amp;S has not yet decided the critical question of who should do its fund
management, nor what the objectives should be.
But there is still the question of scale. The company plans to offer the new
life and pensions products in about six stores from early next year, rising
to only 50 by the end of 1995.
Mr Oates is clearly unhappy with the description of M&amp;S Financial Services
as a 'niche' player in the market. But he is not interested in competing
directly with the banks.
'We are first and foremost a retailer. Our financial services arm ought to
be allowed to expand as it thinks fit without disturbing the plan for the
whole group,' he says. The limits of that expansion could be determined by
the success of the new venture.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bullers to raise Pounds 2.6m for purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullers, the giftware, fine art and decorative products group, is raising
Pounds 2.56m net through a placing and open offer to fund an acquisition. At
the same time it is undergoing a capital reorganisation and debt conversion.
It is buying Clashfleet, a media services company, for a maximum Pounds
2.8m, to be satisfied in cash and shares. The purchase will form the core of
a new media division.
Most of Clashfleet is made up of a company operating as Wiseman, which in
the year to May 31 1993 incurred losses of Pounds 690,000 on turnover of
Pounds 3.3m. It then had negative net worth of Pounds 500,000.
Under the capital reorganisation the 1p shares are being split into 0.01p
ordinary and 0.99p deferred. The ordinary shares are to be consolidated into
10p shares. The 4.2 per cent cumulative preference shares of Pounds 1 are
being consolidated into Pounds 6 shares and split into 13 new ordinary and
470 deferred of 1p.
It is the company's intention to cancel the deferred shares and the share
premium account leaving the deficit on the profit and loss account at Pounds
1.4m.
Under the placing and open offer 26m new shares are being issued at 11p, of
which 6.51m will be available to shareholders at a rate of 32 new ordinary
for one new ordinary.
Part of the cash raised will be used to buy out the leases on equipment
operated by Wiseman. The rest of the purchase, involving an initial payment
of Pounds 900,000 and a profit related payment to a maximum of Pounds 1.1m,
will be satisfied by new ordinary shares.
As part of the acquisition Clashfleet is paying Bullers Pounds 703,000 in
preference shares for equipment.
Marmara Bank, which has advanced Pounds 1.75m, is converting Pounds 398,000
into preference shares and Pounds 989,000 into new ordinary shares. Marmara
and Auric, an associate, will have a holding of 20.5 per cent. The companies
are appointing three directors to Bullers.
Barclays, which is owed Pounds 1.1m, is converting Pounds 600,000 into a
medium term loan.
Bullers has recently been experiencing considerable difficulty. In the year
to June 30 it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds
2.4m with a deficit on net assets of Pounds 1.28m.
It is monitoring existing businesses with the intention of disposing of
those which cannot be returned to profit. Caverswall, which has incurred
significant losses, is being sold for a nominal sum and Michael Sutty, which
is not operating satisfactorily, is being considered for disposal or
closure.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Student loans not real success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms COLETTE MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article 'Student loan 'success' hailed' (February 17), I was
quite stunned at higher education minister Mr Tim Boswell's apparent
ignorance of the average student's financial position.
Grants have been frozen and entitlement to most benefits removed since the
late 1980s. Students' real income has taken a remarkably heavy battering and
the sluggish economy has removed a great proportion of the potential to
supplement income through part-time employment. Therefore, it is hardly
surprising that individuals have had to augment their income with these
loans. Thus, the take-up rate indicates very little evidence of a 'success'.
I left university with Pounds 1,500 worth of debt and am jobless. This
worries me. However, what worries me more is that higher education resources
inevitably will be misallocated more and more to those who can afford to buy
them rather than to those with true academic potential.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A gap in understanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS DILLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why does Samuel Brittan continue to waste his time on the fool's errand
of attempting to measure the output gap ('The enigma of the output gap',
February 16)? The very fact that estimates of the gap vary between 1.5 per
cent and 7 per cent should be sufficient to discredit the concept.
First, the wide divergence of these estimates draws attention to the fact
that we simply do not have the information - on capital scrapping,
production functions or the degree of mismatch between capacity and demand -
to make reliable estimates of the gap.
Second, if we do not know the size of the output gap, then we cannot test
the hypothesis that it is a central determinant of inflation. In giving
publicity to these wild goose chases, Mr Brittan is reinforcing the public
impression that economists have nothing to contribute to an understanding of
the world. Could his considerable talents in future be used to address
questions where an answer is at least possible?

Sir, Am I alone in finding the spectacle of the chief executive officer of
Motorola waving his latest gadget and complaining that it is 'unfair' that
the Japanese are not buying it a trifle unedifying (World Trade News,
February 17)? As Lars Ramqvist, the ceo of Ericsson, showed clearly in his
Innovation Lecture at the Royal Society on Tuesday, the proper approach to
selling to Japan is to make systems compatible with their standards.
Motorola, by contrast, applied political pressure to get Japan to adopt the
US standard alongside its own system and now whinges when the Japanese
prefer to buy their own standard to one forced on them.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Luxury for the not-so-old and stately: The world's elite
hotels continue to attract commercial interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moneyed guests who pass through the marble lobbies and ankle-deep
carpets of the world's luxury hotels will have felt a tremor of apprehension
at the news that the Aga Khan's sumptuously appointed Ciga group of Italy is
to pass into the hands of the Sheraton chain.
How such venerable establishments as the Grand in Rome and the Danieli in
Venice will fare as part of an international chain is as yet unclear. So is
the question of how Sheraton can make a financial success of a deal for
which it is paying L900bn (Pounds 365m) - a sum that has astonished the
industry.
Forte, the UK hotels group which together with international financier Mr
George Soros offered Pounds 270m for Ciga, conceded defeat when it heard how
much Sheraton was prepared to pay for a company which lost L195.43bn last
year.
Mr Alan Hopper, chairman of leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster, said:
'We just cannot see the commercial logic of the Sheraton offer.' Many in the
industry wonder whether Sheraton, which is owned by ITT of the US, was
simply seduced by the prospect of adding prestigious Ciga hotels to its
portfolio. ITT says it will not talk about Ciga until the deal is finalised,
which it expects to take a few weeks.
Other hoteliers have found the allure of the world's elite establishments
too great to resist. Lord Forte, founder of Forte, spent much of the 1980s
in a battle to buy the Savoy group, which owns properties including the
Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught in London. Forte ended up with a
majority of Savoy's shares but a minority of voting shares and continues to
express a desire to take full control.
It is not just the commercial logic of owning Ciga that can be questioned,
however. Some industry observers wonder why anyone would want to own luxury
hotels at all. With companies insisting on tighter control of travel costs,
many executives are avoiding the best-known luxury properties and opting
instead for more modest hotel accommodation.
A senior manager at one of London's most prestigious establishments says it
does not matter what discounts or special deals he offers guests: the
hotel's name is so redolent of expensive living that no cost-cutting
campaign could remain credible if word got round a company that its chief
executive was staying there.
While other luxury hotel groups have done better than Ciga, few have turned
in strong financial performances recently. The Savoy group announced a
Pounds 1.75m pre-tax loss for the first half of 1993.
Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotel operator, saw net
earnings for the first three-quarters of 1993 fall to CDollars 5.2m (Pounds
2.65m) compared with CDollars 6.1m the previous year. The company said it
planned to sell six hotels, including the Four Seasons, formerly the Inn on
the Park, in London, to reduce its CDollars 350m debt. And Mandarin
Oriental, the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel company, announced a 2 per cent
profits increase to Dollars 19.5m for the first half of last year, which was
below expectations.
Some of the luxury hotels' weaknesses are cyclical and attributable to the
recession in North America and Europe. Mr Roger Garland, Four Seasons
executive vice-president, says: 'It's been a miserable market for three
years. The Gulf war disrupted business travel and it didn't come back
quickly.'
Mr Giles Shepard, the Savoy's managing director, adds that it is more
difficult to trim a luxury hotel's operating costs than those of cheaper
establishments. He says: 'Providing services such as valeting, beds being
turned down and curtains being drawn all costs money and needs people to do
it.'
Luxury hotels cannot cut staffing levels or refurbishment costs without
losing guests. Mr Shepard adds: 'In an ideal world, when you walk into a
hotel room you want to feel you are the first person to use it.'
The question for luxury hotel operators is whether guests will return and
rates rise as the world economy improves, or whether companies' travel
cost-cutting has become permanent.
Mr Garland says there are already signs of guests returning. Four Seasons,
the world's biggest luxury hotel operator, saw such an improvement in North
American business last year that it increased room rates by up to 12 per
cent. The group's hotels in Asia have also enjoyed an improved performance.
Mr Hopper of Pannell Kerr Forster says that, in spite of the Savoy's
troubles, business is also looking up for London's luxury hotels, although
continental European cities are still depressed.
He says that London's luxury hotels made Pounds 30,000 operating profit per
available room last year, up 25 per cent on 1992. London luxury hotel
occupancy was 67 per cent last year - 8 percentage points up on 1992.
However, achieved room rates - the prices guests actually paid - fell to
Pounds 178 a night from Pounds 184 in 1992.
But the crucial measure for hoteliers is the revenue divided by the total
number of rooms, whether occupied or not. In London's luxury hotels, this
increased last year to Pounds 120 a night from Pounds 109 the year before.
Mr Hopper says the average for all London hotels was only Pounds 55.
Mr Richard Lovell, executive vice-president for northern Europe and Asia at
business travel agents Wagonlit, says there will always be guests who want
luxury. He adds, however, that the luxury market will be far more
competitive than in the 1980s and hotels will have to provide something
special to succeed.
Ms Jill Kluge, Mandarin Oriental's group communications director, says her
company has introduced exclusive business floors at its hotels in Singapore,
Manila and Jakarta. These have their own check-in and check-out facilities,
lounges providing complimentary food throughout the day, and facsimile
machines in every bedroom as a matter of course rather than on request.
In spite of the difficult conditions faced by operators in Europe, Mr
Garland believes it needs additional luxury hotels - but of a different
sort. Too many European hotels are old, stately and badly run, he says. 'The
problem is that the customers are not old and stately. They are aggressive,
hard-working people who need faxes that work and their suits cleaned
overnight and sandwiches at 2am.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reorganisation could be the death
knell of local democracy in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MAURICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's comments on the Tory party's attack on local government
are as accurate as they are belated ('Dustbin-lids to the fore', February
15). A steady erosion of local democracy was seen between 1979 to 1994, and
reorganisation legislation for Wales and Scotland, currently before
parliament could well prove the death knell.
Here in Wales particularly the overt injustice of success by opposition
parties in local elections time and time again being matched only by the
aggrandisement of government-appointed quangos makes a mockery of democratic
pretensions.
As one who has served in elected office since 1981 and who disappointingly
was allowed a walk-over last year in what had been originally a Conservative
seat, I can only conclude that the route to local power through elections
has now been abandoned by that party in favour of patronage and sinecure
with its attendant association in Wales of secrecy and disrepute.
We have been allowed no Local Government Commission by our Whitehall-imposed
secretary of state and consultation and public debate over proposals for
reform now in the Lords have been superficial.
Joe Rogaly comments that in England if blood still ran red it would be in
mid-revolution, and such a remark applies equally to Wales.
In many cases for the first time, supporters of local democracy in Wales are
beginning to wonder if the nationalist and republican homes of the Celtic
world are not more appropriate than the current scenario of unaccountable
bodies often manned by imported placemen lauding over ineffective unitary
authorities.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Executive share options: value should
be clear at the time they are granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN M JUDES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Lining the executive nest'(February 14), concludes that
stock options and the levels of executive remuneration must be a matter for
shareholders to resolve.
Reporting on the levels of gains derived by an executive from the exercise
of an option does not aways help to inform shareholders as the the
appropriate levels of options to grant. Shareholders need to know the value
of the options at the time they were granted.
There is an obligation under company law to disclose the estimated money
value of options granted to directors in the accounts of the company
covering the period of grant.
If not so disclosed there is an obligation on the auditors to include in the
audit report a statement of the required particulars so far as they are
reasonably able to do so. I am not aware of any UK company complying with
its obligations.
It is not coherent to claim that options cannot be valued when the value of
traded options is reported on a daily basis and 'fill the blank' option
pricing calculators and computer models are available to any investor.
Perhaps if proper disclosure of the value of the option grants were made,
the focus of the media, and shareholders, would be more properly on the
value of emoluments rather than on gains arising at the time of exercise of
the options. Other share based remuneration strategies would then be
explored by companies, in order to align the interests of directors with
those of shareholders.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Slow slow, quick quick, slow: Philip Coggan and Emma Tucker
test the strength and durability of the UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The main reasons for doubting the durability of the present recovery appear
to be: uncertainty about the strength of world recovery, and of Britain's
ability to improve its trading performance, a belief that the recent
consumer boom will fade away without triggering a new cycle of increased
investment and general worries about the future of wage inflation.'
That view could easily sum up the current debate about the health of the UK
economic recovery. In fact, the quote dates from a Financial Times economic
survey of September 1983, just as the UK was embarking on its longest
postwar boom.
As in 1983, the current uncertainty about whether the recovery is
sustainable has been fuelled by apparently ambiguous economic indicators.
After relatively buoyant figures released in January, statistics this week
have shown that manufacturing output fell in December, while in January
unemployment rose and bank lending was exceptionally weak. On the other
hand, January house sales were up on January 1993.
Conflicting signals are the hallmark of the early stages of an upturn. In
1983, for instance, gross domestic product rose by more than 3 per cent, but
monthly manufacturing output figures showed falls on five out of 12
occasions and industrial production dropped on three.
It may seem hard to believe, but the UK recovery has already lasted as long
 -seven quarters - as the recession which preceded it. The trouble for the
government is that the growth rate has been too slow to generate a
'feel-good' factor among consumers. 'This is what GDP growth of 1 1/2 -2 per
cent feels like - slow, halting and patchy,' says Mr David Fell, economist
at Business Strategies Limited, which studies regional economies.
The picture is confirmed by Mr James Watson, chairman of NFC, the transport
company whose fortunes are dependent on the general health of UK businesses.
'Overall, we have seen a slow and steady improvement rather than a boom,' he
says. Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive of Siebe, a leading UK engineering
group, adds: 'We're not dismayed by the recent economic numbers and we
believe the unemployment figures were a blip. There has been no downturn in
our business recently.'
Most economists believe that - in spite of all the gloom generated by this
week's figures - the economy is still on the same, sometimes bumpy growth
path. Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the
Confederation of British Industry, says: 'You are seeing growth, but from a
very low base.'
The recovery has not been strong enough to allow manufacturing output to
return to its pre-recession levels. In December 1993 it was still 5.5 per
cent below the peak month of March 1990; machine tool sales were little more
than half the level in 1990.
The danger now for the economy is that tax increases in April will undermine
consumer spending and so delay the economy's return to health. Last year's
Budget changes mean the tax paid by a married man on average earnings will
rise from Pounds 118.36 to Pounds 130.88 a month.
Recent statistics on retail sales have been sending out particularly mixed
signals. This partly reflects difficulties statisticians have had in making
normal seasonal adjustments for Christmas and New Year shopping on December
and January's figures.
However, there is some indication of weakness already, even before the April
tax increases. The figures suggest that consumer spending is patchy, with
large retailers doing better than small ones and some stores being forced to
make hefty price cuts to attract shoppers. January's retail prices index,
for example, showed prices of goods such as furniture and electrical
appliances, recorded their largest monthly fall since comparable records
began in 1956.
Accordingly, the views of retailers on the outlook are mixed. Mr Nigel
Whittaker, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's distributive
trades panel, says: 'I don't believe that the pace of recovery is
diminishing. There is no panic and gloom and doom out there. Most retailers
say that by and large there is a reasonably steady pace of recovery.'
But Mr John Bryson, centre manager of the Metro centre in Gateshead, says:
'Sales just fell off the cliff after the middle of January. People had run
out of money after a good Christmas and January sales period.' The real fear
of retailers, he says, is that the public have not realised by how much
their disposable incomes will be cut.
Mr John Clare, chief executive of electrical retailer Dixons, says: 'While
the longer-term indices are suggesting that recovery is there, the market
for discretionary purchases, as opposed to food and other basics, is still
very tough . . . The worrying thing is that, when the taxes go up in April,
it will be the first time that people have felt worse off for a long time.
'As we have come out of this recession, most consumers have generally felt
better off. Now the government has decided to tackle its deficit and there
is a danger that this will threaten the recovery considerably.'
Estimates this week from the London Business School suggested that the
impact of the tax increases in the next two financial years would be
relatively mild, causing economic growth to slow to 2.2 per cent next year,
from 2.5 per cent in 1994. Nevertheless, such growth rates would not be
sufficient to bring down unemployment substantially, say, or to absorb idle
manufacturing capacity.
The likelihood of only modest growth may tempt the government into cutting
base interest rates, from the current 5 1/4 per cent, to offset the effect
of the tax increase.
The Treasury is aware, however, of the risks of being buffeted by one
month's set of figures, especially after the previous month's data had been
stronger than expected - and the seasonal adjustments around Christmas are
so unreliable.
One of the reasons why the Bank of England and the Treasury were so heavily
criticised by City analysts for cutting base rates by a quarter of a
percentage point last week was that there seemed no immediate need to
stimulate the economy.
For the Treasury, this week's figures are not sufficient evidence that the
economic recovery is faltering. Similarly, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general
of the Institute of Directors, says: 'These are the figures for only the
first month of 1994 and we must not fall into the trap of staging a monthly
examination in which we pull up the plant to see whether the roots are
growing.'
But that has not stopped some economists calling for immediate action to
propel the economy on to a faster growth track. Professor Wynne Godley, one
of the six advisers to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says the
government should put less emphasis on using interest rates to try to
maintain some sort of currency parity with other European Union countries.
'People seem to forget that the US had a tremendous cut in interest rates a
long time ago, as did the Japanese. We musn't be imprisoned by the daft
notions of the French and Germans but should pursue US-type policies which
have been shown to produce growth while not being inflationary,' he says.
As yet there is little sign that either the Treasury or the Bank of England
favours such an aggressive policy. They are happy for now with a low-growth,
low-inflation economy. Observers will have to get used to monthly economic
figures which point to a less than exhilarating return to growth.

FT  19 FEB 94 / The lady's not for turning: Burma's detained opposition
leader poses a dilemma for the junta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of her compatriots still believe in her, foreigners still admire her,
and the military junta which put her under house arrest four and a half
years ago still does not have a clue what to do with her.
The events of this week have confirmed that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
detained Burmese opposition leader, is both the only credible voice of her
country's battered pro-democracy movement and the main obstacle preventing
the junta from gaining international respectability.
Mr Bill Richardson, the US congressman who visited Ms Suu Kyi this week and
took her a letter of unqualified support from President Bill Clinton, left
in no doubt that her commitment to bring democracy to Burma had not been
blunted by captivity.
'She is a woman of towering intellect and strength of conscience,' he said,
noting that she rose daily at 4:30am to exercise and meditate. 'As an
American politician I would hate to run against Aung San Suu Kyi.'
Burmese politicians feel the same: her party, the National League for
Democracy, won 80 per cent of the seats in a national election in 1990 even
though she and other NLD leaders were already under arrest.
The armed forces, which had killed hundreds of civilian opponents during an
uprising two years earlier, were convinced their allies would win at the
polls. Aghast at the NLD victory, they decided to ignore the result and
continue ruling Burma through the junta, the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc).
In many ways, the Slorc is more secure than at any time since it was formed
in 1988. Ethnic rebel groups along the borders - such as the Karen and the
Kachin - have been pressed by their former patrons in Thailand and China
into negotiating ceasefires with the Slorc after decades of guerrilla
warfare.
The economy, boosted by private-sector investments from Singaporean, Thai
and western companies, is beginning to recover from a long period of
stagnation and decline. Asian governments, particularly China and Singapore,
are scornful of western concerns about human rights in Burma and sell
weapons to Rangoon.
Outspoken opponents of the regime have been jailed, driven into exile or
terrified into silence.
Burma's generals, however, want more: they want foreign aid from Japan and
the west, and they want recognition for their ham-fisted attempts to
engineer a new constitution that would allow them to run the country in a
less overt way than they do today.
The continued detention of Ms Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize,
makes any improvement in foreign relations which could lead to infusions of
western aid improbable.
If the Slorc releases her, on the other hand, it fears she would immediately
become the focus of a new pro-democracy uprising. She refuses to win her
release by agreeing to go into exile.
Faced with this dilemma, the Slorc has dithered. Last month Lt-Gen Khin
Nyunt, the intelligence chief known as 'Secretary-1' who is regarded as the
most powerful member of the junta, led Japanese journalists to believe that
Ms Suu Kyi might be freed in July after five years of detention.
Burmese officials promptly denied she would be released, but the junta
removed the unsightly pillboxes guarding her house on University Avenue.
Then Mr Richardson was allowed this Monday to pay her a visit - the first by
a foreigner apart from her English husband and children - with all the
attendant publicity such a meeting entails. Ms Suu Kyi sent a message to her
supporters: 'Be courageous and democracy will win.'
Mr Richardson also met Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, who told him that a final decision
about her detention had not been taken. The next day, Col Kyaw Win, Lt-Gen
Khin Nyunt's deputy, announced that she would be held at least until next
year.
Backed by the Clinton administration, Mr Richardson took up Ms Suu Kyi's
suggestion that she should have talks with the Slorc as a way of trying to
resolve the stand-off be-tween the armed forces and their opponents.
Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt replied that the Slorc would consider a meeting between
himself and Ms Suu Kyi as long as it was not a 'political dialogue'.
But it is hard to see what the Slorc could hope to gain from such an
encounter. She has long expressed a desire for talks, and the meeting would
therefore be seen as a victory for her as well as recognition of her
standing in Burma and abroad.
Some of her former NLD colleagues have been bullied into participating in a
national convention organised by the Slorc, charged with rubber-stamping a
new, pro-military constitution (one dissenter who urged delegates to stand
up for democracy was jailed for 20 years).
But Ms Suu Kyi, daughter of Gen Aung San, who led Burma to the brink of
independence from Britain, in public would doubtless dismiss the convention
as 'an absolute farce' - as she did during her meeting with Mr Richardson.
That would contradict the Slorc's relentless propaganda and embarrass Asian
governments such as Thailand's, which profess admiration for the junta's
'democratisation' process.
Whether the Slorc decides to free her or continue detaining her without
trial, and whether or not Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt decides to meet her, there is no
indication that the junta is prepared to yield any power to the democratic
opposition. It is equally unlikely that Ms Suu Kyi will abandon her
democratic ideals.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Chance for life in the dead zone: US and Russian pressure
could improve the prospects for a Bosnian peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 11th-hour Russian diplomatic initiative in Bosnia has made it
increasingly unlikely that the Nato threat to launch air strikes against the
Bosnian Serbs will be carried out.
Formally, the Nato powers are sticking to their ultimatum of February 9.
This stipulates that the Bosnian Serbs' gun positions around Sarajevo will
be bombed if they do not withdraw their heavy weapons from a 20km (12-mile)
exclusion zone around the city, or place them under United Nations control
by tomorrow night.
In practice, however, the decision by the Russians on Thursday to send 400
peacekeeping troops to bolster the UN force in Sarajevo, to be followed by
another 400 later, gave the Bosnian Serbs the face-saving formula and sense
of security they needed to withdraw their weapons.
General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said that
following the announcement of the agreement on Thursday evening between Mr
Vitaly Churkin, deputy Russian foreign minister and special envoy to the
Geneva peace conference, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
the pull-out of heavy weapons had become 'an exodus'.
Yet only a few hours before his statement, which followed less convincing
reports of a trickle of weapons which had been placed under UN control, it
was by no means certain that the Nato deadline would be met. The Bosnian
Serbs, though they appeared to be taking the Nato ultimatum more seriously
than they had treated similar threats in the past, were clearly extremely
reluctant to comply with demands made solely by the western alliance.
They were comforted in their attitude by the critical stance adopted by the
Russian leadership towards the Nato ultimatum. President Boris Yeltsin,
harassed by his right-wing nationalist opponents and upset at not being
consulted by Nato on an important issue affecting Russia's traditional Slav
allies, was obliged to act to preserve his personal and his country's
credibility.
In the event, the Russian initiative turned out to be something of a
diplomatic coup. It fulfilled three essential objectives, satisfying both
the Russian and western positions:
It reinforced Nato's demands by persuading the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw
their weapons, while reassuring them that the weapons would not be
abandoned;
It will give Russia a more important role in forthcoming negotiations on a
Bosnian peace settlement;
More generally, it has re-established Russia as a player to be reckoned with
on the international stage, at a time when it was beginning to be ignored by
the west.
It is virtually certain that these results would not have been obtained in
the absence of the Nato ultimatum, itself something of an achievement in
international diplomacy between the western nations.
The 22-month-old Bosnian crisis has been littered by numerous similar
threats of air strikes, all unfulfilled. If the latest in the long series
has appeared more credible, it was because it was made by Nato as a whole
with the strong support of the US, which has been conspicuous by its absence
from the Bosnian conflict, as well as having a time-limit attached to it.
Ironically, it was France and, in the last resort the UK, both opposed to
air strikes when they were first proposed by Washington in May this year,
which did all the pushing to get the US involved this time.
In the case of France, by far the biggest contributor to the UN Protection
Force in former Yugoslavia, the public outcry at the massacre in the central
Sarajevo marketplace two weeks ago undoubtedly influenced the decision of a
government already more inclined than others to use force in Bosnia.
The UK's position has all along been more ambiguous, with the government,
handicapped by a slim parliamentary majority, opposed to any action which
could lead to the loss of life of British troops and cause further splits in
the governing Conservative party.
There were two main reasons why London finally changed its mind on air
strikes. It did not want to be isolated within the Atlantic alliance and,
above all, it wanted to avoid a rift with the US which had forged an
uncustomary alliance with France on a vital foreign policy issue.
Yet the most constructive aspect of French and British policy, pursued with
confrontational Gallic vigour on the part of Paris and more discreet
diplomatic finesse by London, was the desire to get the US more closely
involved in the Bosnian conflict.
The Bosnian Moslems, even when they were under severe pressure from the
international mediators to make territorial concessions, had always put
their faith in Washington not to back any plan they considered unviable.
With both the US and Russia likely to play a much more prominent part in the
peace negotiations in the future, the prospects of reaching a settlement
have undoubtedly improved - on the assumption, of course, that each of the
two powers is prepared to put pressure on its respective Bosnian allies to
make the necessary compromises.
The breakthrough is, however, only the beginning of what is bound to be a
long process. The next few days will be crucial in setting out a coherent
agenda, not only for bringing all sides back to the negotiating table in
Geneva, but ending the fighting throughout the republic.
What happens in Sarajevo could be a test case. In addition to the withdrawal
of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons, UN officials said yesterday they wanted
the siege of the city to be lifted. This would mean removing road blocks,
allowing humanitarian aid to get through, and restoring water, electricity
and communications to the city. As Gen Rose has repeatedly said, the
complete demilitarisation of the city would require more troops. But western
governments are reluctant to send reinforcements.
Mr James Gow of the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, London,
says the crucial factor in extending demilitarisation to the rest of the
country is the attitude of the Bosnian government, which 'must be persuaded
that it is in its interests to settle for a peace plan'.
Achieving the latter might prove tricky. The Bosnian government has already
expressed reservations about Russia's presence in Sarajevo, on the grounds
that Moscow is considered pro-Serb. The Moslems were seeking, above all,
western military intervention at a time when the Bosnian army was building
up a disciplined and well-trained infantry superior to the Serb forces. This
option has been pre-empted by the arrival of Russian peacekeepers, since
nobody will launch air strikes while they are monitoring Serbian positions.
'The Bosnians trust only the Americans. To secure an overall peace
settlement, the US will have to move quickly. The Bosnians may have to
recognise the limitations of what they have achieved,' added Mr Gow.
The current peace plan on the table in Geneva involves the division of
Bosnia-Hercegovina into three ethnic statelets, with a clear bias towards
rewarding Serb and Croat territorial gains.
The UN forces are anxious that the peace talks should reflect developments
on the ground. They have no mandate to monitor Bosnian Serb weapons outside
the Sarajevo exclusion zone. 'Those weapons can be moved anywhere in eastern
and central Bosnia where the fighting continues unabated,' a Nato diplomat
said.
'The pressure now is tremendous,' a UN official conceded. 'All sides,
knowing that we are concentrating on Sarajevo, could beat the hell out of
each other in other parts of the country so as to secure territorial gains
before we turn our attention beyond the capital.'
The UN objectives are:
Lifting the siege in Sarajevo;
Lifting the sieges of Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, and Tuzla in central and
eastern Bosnia;
Continuing Russian pressure on the Serbs and US pressure on the Moslems to
make compromises on reaching a peace accord; Increasing pressure on Croatia
to withdraw its troops from Mostar, the regional capital of western
Hercegovina, which, unlike Sarajevo, has been almost reduced to rubble.
'I have no doubt that this will involve tens of thousands of peacekeeping
troops,' a former senior military adviser to the British government said
yesterday. 'And just because Nato threatened the use of force only in
Sarajevo, there is no reason that Nato, and especially Washington, cannot
apply the threat to other cities, although that will require the backing of
the Russians.'
Nato and UN officials yesterday said none of these aims could be achieved
without persuading all the protagonists that it is in their interests to
stop the fighting, including the patron states of Serbia and Croatia. 'It is
clear that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia wants international
economic sanctions against his country lifted,' a Nato diplomat said
yesterday. 'But any talk of that is too early. We have to keep the pressure
on.'
He added that Croatia could be brought to the negotiating table because the
threat of economic sanctions remains. But the Bosnian government would only
stop the fighting if the US could guarantee a permanent and more just peace
settlement, he said.
The setting up of a civilian administration by the UN could be the next step
for Sarajevo. 'This is what we did in Cambodia,' said a UN official. But
such an arrangement would require large numbers of personnel. 'More than
that,' said Mr Gow, 'it is only the Americans who can tie up the whole
thing.' Washington has said it would provide peacekeepers under UN auspices,
if and when a negotiated peace settlement is reached.
'The Russians are on board. It is time for the US to help secure this peace.
This is the last chance for peace,' the Nato diplomat said. 'We must
capitalise on the previous few days. But then, our record in failing to
grasp the moment in the Bosnian crisis is truly miserable.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A mid-Atlantic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the dark days of the 1970s, Britain was said to have the only economy in
the developed world that overheated when the chancellor started the
ignition. This week a welter of statistics showed that the UK economy is as
far removed from that diagnosis as Rover Group is from the days when
firebrand conveners could bring it to a halt at the drop of a hub cap. The
message in the official data was that most of the surprises are still coming
on the side of a better than expected inflation outcome. Yesterday's weak
bank lending figures confirmed that consumer demand is nothing like as
buoyant as some had assumed. Everything continues to point to a slow and
fumbling recovery along the path earlier described by the US. The engine has
yet to warm up.
In the English-speaking economies and in Japan, this is an economic cycle
where financial factors are having a disproportionate influence. A build-up
of debt in the personal and corporate sectors, followed by a high incidence
of bad debts in the banking system, has dampened demand and reduced the
effectiveness of monetary policy. A well-judged response from the US Federal
Reserve, which until this month had made the recapitalisation of the banks a
specific target of monetary policy, has ensured that the US banking system
is now playing its part in a recovery that is robust enough to call for
modest pressure on the monetary brake.
While Britain went into the downturn at much the same time as the US,
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism deferred its recovery.
The subsequent devaluation and reduction in short-term interest rates from
15 per cent to 5 1/4 per cent means that the British economic cycle, like
the soul of the Tory party, is awkwardly suspended between the US and
continental Europe, which is lagging the rest of the developed world. The
question is whether the present stance of monetary policy is sufficiently
relaxed to ensure that April's fiscal tightening will not bring the economy
to a grinding halt.
Fiscal squeeze
One striking difference between the British experience and that of the US is
that American exporters had the benefit of a much more substantial
devaluation. Another is that US real interest rates have been close to zero
throughout the early stages of the recovery. In contrast, real rates in
Britain remain high by comparison, with the underlying inflation at between
2 and 3 per cent.
Moreover, the fiscal squeeze now proposed by the government is on a scale
that far exceeds the modest tightening under way in the US. And since
Britain is a more open economy, it is more beholden to its trading partners
in Europe. Their problem has less to do with debt than overvalued exchange
rates; and the resulting stagnation has proved a massive stumbling block to
the kind of balanced, export-led recovery that Britain ought to have enjoyed
against a background of continuing high personal sector borrowing and a
return to surplus in the corporate sector.
Modest loosening
The Bundesbank's decision to signal a modest loosening of monetary policy on
Thursday looks overdue. Coming after the earlier quarter-point reduction in
British rates, it confirms that the US and Europe are now on divergent
monetary paths. Yet despite the fact that British rates are converging with
those in continental Europe it remains striking that British gross domestic
product since the start of the decade has not only lagged behind the US but
behind Germany and France as well. It remains way below trend by any
comparative yardstick.
That suggests that the authorities are still finding it hard to adjust to
the new disinflationary circumstances and that UK rates will have to come
down again. And it may be that the markets are finding it equally hard to
adjust. The Fed's tightening at the start of the month continues to make
both bond and equity markets nervous in Europe.
To the extent that interest rate differentials have altered in favour of the
US, some repatriation of US capital was always on the cards. Yet
disinflationary forces in Europe remain very powerful, which makes the bond
market response look slightly perverse. Equities, meantime, are enjoying the
benefit of a very American-style mutual fund boom as falling rates make bank
deposits less attractive. In Britain the personal sector has ceased to
disinvest in equities and has also pushed unit trust sales to record levels.
A less remarked phenomenon is the way Italian mutual fund inflows have
soared over the past 15 months and French equity investment in SICAVs (unit
trusts) has done much the same.
If interest rates have further to fall in Britain and the rest of Europe,
then instinct suggests that European capital markets should no more be
taking their cue from the US than the underlying economies. The change in
the direction of US interest rates was bound to impart a profound shock to
global capital. But the markets, hitherto effervescent, will prove difficult
to read until the dust has properly settled.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Mr Absent without leave: Political and economic reform are
being jeopardised by the semi-detached state of Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian president appears to have played little part in the governing of
the country for some weeks. This fact is causing comment in Russia and
concern abroad: the more so since on him depends the setting of a strategic
course for the government, the lineaments of a relationship with the
parliament and a clarification of foreign policy - all areas where
unanswered questions multiply anxiously.
His decision to delay until next Thursday the critical state-of-the-nation
speech, scheduled for yesterday, was the most overt sign of Mr Boris
Yeltsin's semi-detached state. The delay was said to be due to a bad cold:
indeed, one of his press secretaries, Mr Anatoly Krasikov, went so far as to
urge correspondents to look for themselves at Mr Yeltsin on television that
day, to see how ill he looked.
Unfortunately for this proposition, Mr Yeltsin - appearing with Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister, at a press conference - did not look
particularly ill. He spent well over two hours talking to Mr Major, took a
press conference (standing) for about half an hour, had a meeting with the
president of the Republic of Tatarstan to sign a treaty and in the evening
hosted a Kremlin dinner. British diplomats insist that the president was in
complete charge of his brief, took the initiative, made jokes.
Thus to plead a cold as reason to cancel a vital speech three days away
seems transparent as an excuse. It comes on top of a string of broken or
refused gatherings with foreigners, the non-acceptance for three days last
week of a telephone call from US President Bill Clinton and a profile so low
that Mr Sergei Parkhomenko of Sevodnya newspaper dubbed him 'Mr Absent' in a
recent article.
Other vital dates are being put off: the cabinet session to discuss the
budget was put back from this Thursday to the coming week; potentially more
seriously, the local elections set for spring may also be delayed until
summer or autumn because - according to Mr Sergei Filatov, the presidential
chief of staff, in an Izvestiya interview - 'people will be afraid to make
the wrong choice'.
What is going on? The rumours of heavy drinking, always recycled at times
like these, are - say US sources - not a cause for real concern. But Mr
Yeltsin is often a man in pain, the legacy of two crashes - in a car in
Moscow and in an aircraft in Spain. He needs both treatment and drugs to
allow him to work. How far that is a factor now is not known and will not be
revealed. Information about the president has become scanty.
The Moscow political world has discounted illness as an explanation. Mr
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko political grouping, a presidential
challenger and according to the polls the most popular politician in Russia,
believes that 'he is simply invisible because he does not know what to do.
There is no concept of how to go ahead in the economy or in the society. The
parliament has no one with whom to relate - and its mood is not very hostile
to the president, it just wants to know how to work with him.'
The other proffered explanation is a more charitable one. Mr Alexander
Meshchersky, deputy editor of the mass-circulation Argumenty i Fakti and
close to presidential circles, said yesterday that he believed Mr Yeltsin
was now in one of these periods of 'withdrawal and reflection' - the kind
seen after the August 1991 putsch, and again at the beginning of last year.
There is much to withdraw and think about, for Russia stands at the
beginning of a period in which the choices of its president are critical to
the further progress of political and economic reform.
First, there is a soup where an economic policy should be: Mr Yegor Gaidar
the former first deputy prime minister, said yesterday that 'there are very
many contradictory features in what the government is trying to do'. Mr
Alexander Shokhin, now economy minister, seems to be trying to do everything
at once: gathering together academicians of the late Gorbachev period to
draw up plans for him; appointing such radical Gaidarites as Mr Sergei
Vasiliev as his deputy minister; and confirming that he, not the
academicians, are in charge of drawing up an economic reform plan.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and the second most powerful man
in the country, is in the grip of an economic nightmare. In losing Mr Gaidar
and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for finance, he has lost
men on whom he could pin the blame for the consequences of reform.
'Really,' says Mr Gaidar, 'the choices that must be made now are very, very
difficult, the most difficult perhaps in the last two years.'
Mr Chernomyrdin is wrestling with inflation already running at about 20 per
cent a month, and a vast budget deficit is staring him in the face for the
first quarter. Yet everyone is pounding him to give them more money.
'Chernomyrdin is being pursued by three lobbies,' says Mr Yavlinsky, 'the
military industrial, the agricultural and the energy. And they all claim to
be starving.'
If the prime minister is to construct a defence against their demands, he
needs a direction. Only the president can supply this - though he may be
unwilling to do so, since he will not wish to be seen to be dictating a pace
of change which is unpopular. Manoeuvring between these two men, who met for
some time yesterday, is one reason for the delay.
Second, there is a gap where a constitutional framework should be. The
deputies in the new parliament have begun a programme of work and, for the
moment, appear in no mood for confrontation. The ultra-nationalist party of
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to whose great success in the December elections so
much attention has been paid, is clearly undergoing internal convulsions as
its deputies struggle to distinguish themselves from their threat-a-minute
leader. The Communists and the Agrarians on the left stress
constitutionality and adhesion to democratic ways. But they have no
president with whom to co-operate or whom to oppose, no presidential
programme to fufil or to amend.
The most significant constitutional move in the new year has been the
conclusion of a treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, its largest autonomous
republic, right in the centre of Russia. Tatarstan had declared virtual
independence with its own constitution. Now a treaty has, it is said,
brought it back within the federation and stands as a model for other,
difficult republics and regions.
But the deputies yesterday would have none of the treaty: 'We were not able
to see the six detailed agreements which went with the treaty, so how could
we vote on it?' asked Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian communists.
From the vague wording of the treaty, it is possible that Tatarstan has been
ceded effective powers over all taxes and other areas normally at least the
co-responsibility of the centre in any federal state.
Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedayev, the former first deputy foreign minister, said
earlier this week that the Russian ministers negotiating the treaty 'looked
for vaguely worded formulas in the negotiations with Tatarstan which won't
fool anyone but may lead to the break-up of the federation'.
Mr Yeltsin, the guarantor of the integrity of the federation, a task he has
made as 'sacred' as Mr Mikhail Gorbachev made the retention of the Soviet
Union, signed the treaty with Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the Tatar president, and
talked of a new era in relationships. But can he mean it?
Third, there is a puzzle where foreign policy should be. 'We do not have a
foreign policy, we have foreign reactions,' says Mr Andranik Migranyan, a
presidential adviser. Russia, which scored a rare diplomatic success this
week in getting agreement from the Bosnian Serbs to pull back their
artillery, was only stung into action by the unilateral declaration by Nato
that it would stage air strikes against the Serbs' positions unless they
withdrew.
A treaty with neighbouring Belarus is approaching completion, which would
merge the two countries' economies and make Belarus a province of Russia in
all but name. The radicals like Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov see it as a grave
threat to Russia's finances. But majority political opinion welcomes it as a
sign that at least one state cannot live without Russia. The Belorussians,
in the main, seem to belive they have no choice.
Throughout the former Soviet republics, there is a shuffling of feet and a
turning back to Moscow by leaders who in some cases had called down curses
upon the 'imperial centre' and now, exhausted by wars or economic collapse
or both, seem again willing to have Moscow make the central decisions in
their countries' lives. But in this movement there is a wide choice -
between what many in the west fear is a neo-imperialist impulse (frankly
espoused by Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats) and an eastern version of
the European Community. Only Mr Yeltsin can define the strategic direction
of a fledgling foreign policy: and he does not seem to have done so.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Rapid cable growth expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK cable communications industry is entering a period of potentially
explosive growth and could be a multi-billion revenue business by the year
2000, say two City studies.
Lehman Brothers, which has considerable experience of the industry in the
US, believes that, at a cost of Pounds 7bn, cable for television and
telecommunications services will be available to 13.5m UK homes by the next
century.
Given what the investment bank describes as a 'modest expectation' that
about 45 per cent of people who can subscribe to cable do so, it says
industry revenues should exceed Pounds 5bn a year.
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank that was recently appointed financial
adviser to TeleWest, the largest cable operator in Britain, says cable is at
last achieving dramatic growth. The improved economics of combined
television and telephone network operation are mainly responsible for this.
Kleinwort says that, on conservative assumptions, by the year 2000 the
television side should produce annual revenues of Pounds 1bn with
telecommunications adding a further Pounds 1.6bn. It argues that the UK
cable industry presents the world's first opportunity to invest in broadband
networks that will act as 'information super-highways'. They will be able to
carry a potentially vast range of entertainment, communications, multi-media
and interactive services.
Lehman notes that so far the local appetite for cable investment has been
minimal. The industry was now rapidly gaining credibility and its viability
was increasingly demonstrable. 'Those who wait for further evidence and
delay investment face the prospect of an entry price that much higher,' it
says.
The Lehman study says that five leading cable companies are considering
equity financing with the prospect of a London listings 'a very real
possibility'. The five are TeleWest, a TCI-US West joint venture, Bell
Canada, General Cable, Jones Cable and Comcast.

FT  19 FEB 94 / BT freezes managers' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications will from April impose a pay freeze on 90 per
cent of its 26,000 managerial staff. This follows the breakdown of
negotiations with the managers' union, the Society of Telecom Executives.
An estimated 1,000 BT managerial staff protested at the decision outside the
company's headquarters in London yesterday. The union has called a delegate
conference for March 10 to decide how to react.
Mr Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said: 'We regret there
has been no agreement. There was no meeting of minds. This is the first time
we have ever gone ahead (in imposing pay) without making a deal.'
The best-performing 10 per cent of managers will receive pay rises averaging
3 per cent with a maximum improvement of 6 per cent. BT estimates that 85
per cent (including the best performers) will next month receive one-off
payments averaging 2.5 per cent or Pounds 800 - within a range of Pounds 300
to Pounds 1,940. Their pay levels will be frozen after April. About 4,000
managers - 15 per cent of the total - will not receive pay rises or one-off
payments.
The total cost will add an estimated 2.5 per cent to BT's annual pay bill.
Mr Archer said the two sides had earlier come close to agreeing a deal. He
said that was not possible because the union had insisted that all managers
receive an increase consolidated into basic rates if possible.
Last month BT decided to suspend a performance-pay scheme that started last
year, on the grounds that it was paying managers too much.
Mr Simon Petch, the union's general secretary, said: 'BT has shot itself in
both feet. We have tried to rescue the company from its difficulties. It is
true our members are well paid but they have played a big part in adding
value to BT.'
The union said it wanted whichever proved to be the greater of a 2.5 per
cent rise or a percentage greater than the size of March's inflation figure.
The company insists that it must bring the pay of its managerial and
professional grades more into line with what it sees as market realities. BT
executives argue that their managers are paid 11 per cent to 15 per cent
more than others in similar jobs in comparable companies.
BT said yesterday that 85 per cent of managers in the largest grade earned
an average of Pounds 24,000 a year compared with Pounds 22,000 for their
counterparts elsewhere. The company said its most detailed pay comparison
showed that no other part of its 160,000 workforce was as well placed as its
managers. Mr Petch said the union did not accept the findings of the survey
and questioned the basis on which they were compiled.

FT  19 FEB 94 / No majority for Banking unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banking unions have failed to win the majority they needed to take joint
strike action against compulsory redundancies at Barclays Bank.
Bifu won a 54 per cent majority for a national one-day strike on a low
turnout. Barclay's Group Staff Union, which has a much larger membership in
the bank, had a similar vote in favour - 55 per cent - but its rule book has
a 60 per cent threshold for action. The unions say they are seeking an early
meeting with Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, in an attempt
to remove the threat of 505 compulsory redundancies from staff in London and
the south-east.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Dublin demands stronger plan for co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, will today tell Mr John Major
that the British government must strengthen its proposals for greater
cross-border co-operation in order to achieve a political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
Mr Reynolds will indicate to his British counterpart, during a planned
one-hour meeting in Downing Street, that Dublin is likely to make clear its
own ideas on the north-south relationship within about a month.
This month Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, gave Dublin a
check-list of outline proposals for renewed talks aimed at a settlement and
asked for the republic's response.
Today's meeting comes a week before Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
holds its annual conference near Dublin.
With signs that the Irish government remains more optimistic than London of
a positive response to the peace proposals, Mr Reynolds is expected to urge
Mr Major to be cautious in his efforts to step up pressure on Sinn Fein to
renounce violence and take a place at the negotiating table.
Downing Street was yesterday playing down the significance of the meeting,
saying that no formal statement was expected. One official said it could be
seen as 'a visible demonstration of the desire of both governments to be
relentless in putting pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their
hands'.
Mr Reynolds is keen to give the meeting more prominence however, and has
interviews planned later with the media at the Irish embassy in London after
the England and Ireland rugby match.
There appears to be a conviction in Dublin that, while a breakthrough may
not be imminent, there are nevertheless indications that an IRA ceasefire
may be forthcoming soon.
Significantly, it is the belief at the highest levels in the Irish
government that Sinn Fein and the seven-man army council of the IRA are
willing to accept the joint declaration.
Last week Mr Reynolds responded by letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, for his request for 'clarifications' of the joint declaration.
There have since been further communications via intermediaries, and
according to officials in the republican movement Sinn Fein views the Irish
government's stance positively.
The problem appears to be that lower echelons in the IRA are not willing to
go along with the declaration and a permanent ceasefire without further
assurances from the British government.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Lottery spending rules laid down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money raised for good causes from the National Lottery should be spent
mainly on capital projects, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary,
said yesterday.
Mr Brooke said this would ensure that lasting new and improved facilities
would be created by lottery profits which analysts believe could reach
Pounds 1bn a year.
The national heritage secretary was setting out a framework for distributing
funds raised by the lottery.
Five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national
heritage and sport - will receive equal amounts. The distributing
organisations are the Arts Council, the Sports Council, the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium Commission and the National Lotteries
Charity Board.
Mr Brooke said that with the exception of the charity board, the
distributors would be asked to concentrate on capital projects to create
'first-rate facilities for sport and the arts and for investing in our built
and natural heritage'.
The distributors will be asked to give priority to projects that have an
element of 'partnership funding'.
All projects, Mr Brooke said, must be considered on their individual merits
and all type and size of organisations should be able to apply.
Eight consortia have made bids for the licence to run the National Lottery
and the winner is expected to be announced in May. Ticket sales should begin
either late this year or early next.
Meanwhile, the BBC seems to be ahead in the television lottery stakes. The
corporation believes that a majority - and possibly as many as six  - of the
bidders may have specified it as their preferred lottery broadcasting
partner. Detailed broadcasting negotiations will only begin after a winner
is chosen.
ITV is so concerned that this week Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the
ITV Association, went to the Independent Television Commission to discuss
what ITV believes are restrictive rules on broadcasting the lottery.
The ITC has made it clear that ITV can broadcast a lottery programme but
insists there can be 'no undue prominence' for what is a commercial product.
The BBC does not appear to be so constrained and has been pitching hard for
the right to carry the big draw, which could carry a top prize of up to
Pounds 5m each week.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Clinton seeks harmony after Anglo-US rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has assured Mr John Major that he wants to draw a
line under the rift in Anglo-US relations caused by a row over Northern
Ireland and sharp differences in their approach to the Bosnian war.
In spite of an undiplomatic attack on the US administration's Bosnia policy
yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, Downing Street
expects Mr Major to receive a friendly reception when he visits Washington
at the end of this month.
Mr Clinton plans a return trip to London in early June before the
50th-anniversary celebrations of the Normandy landings during the second
world war.
British and US officials said that during recent telephone conversations Mr
Clinton had sought to reassure Mr Major about the strength of what used to
be called the special relationship. The officials confirmed that, contrary
to denials from Downing Street, Mr Clinton had warned Mr Major of serious
damage to the Nato alliance if Britain had sought to veto the threat of air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
But once Mr Major backed the plan Mr Clinton made it clear that he was
anxious to repair the recent damage to the relationship between the White
House and Downing Street. The president told Mr Major that his decision to
override British objections to a visit to New York by Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein leader, should not be interpreted as a deliberate personal slight.
Mr Clinton disowned reports in some US and British newspapers that he had
been totally unconcerned that the decision to give Mr Adams a visa might be
interpreted as a slight against the British prime minister. Instead he
blamed freelance briefings by US officials.
The stance adopted by the US president has been greeted with intense relief
by prime ministerial aides. Mr Major is conscious that Britain's declining
influence in Washington threatens further damage to his political authority.
There remains a possibility that differences over Bosnia could flare up
again before Mr Major travels to Washington. Mr Rifkind's attack on the US
over its refusal to contribute troops to the United Nations force in Bosnia
was indicative of tensions that remain.
The help given by the Conservatives to the Republicans during the
presidential election and investigations by the Home Office into Mr
Clinton's stay in Britain in the 1960s mean also that the relationship
between the two men will never be particularly warm.
But the British side is now convinced that Mr Clinton is ready to make a
conscious effort to emphasise that good transatlantic relations have been
restored.

FT  19 FEB 94 / BT freezes managerial pay: Professional staff stage protest
outside London headquarters
</HEADLINE>

British Telecommunications will in April impose a basic pay freeze on most
of its 26,000 managerial staff. This follows the breakdown of negotiations

of last year.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Digital expands in Scotland
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer which is continuing to make
heavy losses, is to invest Pounds 90m at its two plants in Scotland. The
investment will increase capacity in semiconductor and computer
manufacturing.
The company will invest more than Pounds 65m in new equipment at its
semiconductor plant at South Queensferry near Edinburgh and more than Pounds
20m on manufacturing capacity at its plant at Ayr, Strathclyde, to meet
consumer demand.
The South Queensferry plant, which Mr John Major, the prime minister,
visited yesterday during a tour of Scotland, is Digital's only facility
making its high-powered Alpha microprocessor. The new investment will enable
the plant to produce the next generation of Alpha chips.
Digital has agreed with Advanced Micro Devices, the US semiconductor maker
which is a rival to Intel, to produce its microprocessors at South
Queensferry. It expects output of the Am486 to reach a rate of 2m a year in
the first half of next year.
The Pounds 90m investment will bring to about Pounds 300m the total that
Digital has invested in Scotland in the past 18 years.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Greater clarity urged in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chairman of the Financial Reporting Council yesterday called for
greater clarity in the presentation of company accounts.
Sir Sydney Lipworth, former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, said at the annual awards ceremony for published accounts that
they should be true, fair and also clear.
Technical interpretations of accounting standards had obscured 'the wider
and plainer' sense of the requirement for accounts to present a true and
fair view.
He called for an end to 'sharply differing practices' and said he believed
there would for some time be the need for the Financial Reporting Review
Panel, the accounts watchdog, to deal with cases of bad accounting.
Sir Sydney said he would continue to pay attention to the concern of
industry that there was a danger of an 'overload' of new requirements. The
Accounting Standards Board could not please everyone in drawing up new
standards but it listened objectively to the case against its proposals.
The award, which is sponsored by the Stock Exchange and the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, was won by Coats Viyella, the
textiles and clothing company, and James Cropper, the paper and board maker.
Mr Richard Sykes, chairman of the judges, said he was impressed with the
information provided on the companies' operational divisions, compliance
with accounting requirements and the guidelines of the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance, and details on share options and directors'
emoluments.

FT  19 FEB 94 / An opportunity to trade out of trouble: Insurance market
reforms which could benefit Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Followers of Lloyd's of London will become increasingly familiar with an
ugly word during the next two years as the insurance market presses ahead
with its strategy to modernise its capital base.
'Assignability' - the rights of the Names whose assets traditionally support
the market to transfer or trade their participation on syndicates - is one
of the reforms on the agenda of a new 10-strong committee, the Value Group.
The group will also examine ways that Names can be given pre-emption rights
 -allowing them the opportunity to increase their share on a syndicate if
its management chooses to increase its capacity and underwrite more
business.
Once answers to these issues have been found, a market in syndicate
participations could be set up. On the basis of the supply and demand it
should be possible to give value to participations.
The possibility of selling their participations in syndicates might allow
Names to raise funds, allowing them to raise the extra capital needed to
participate as limited-liability investors. Alternatively, Names could use
the money to settle outstanding liabilities and withdraw from the market.
This latter option could help Lloyd's in its efforts to set up a new
reinsurance company, NewCo, into which it aims to transfer all assets and
liabilities for business underwritten before 1986.
As part of its preparatory work for NewCo, which is to be set up by the end
of 1995, Lloyd's is assessing the adequacy of reserves held by all
syndicates to meet these so-called 'old-year' liabilities.
Some syndicates may be asked to make calls on Names to increase their
reserves. It is clearly possible that some hard-pressed Names could generate
funds for this purpose by the sale of their participations on other
syndicates.
Meanwhile, the group, led by Mr Robert Hiscox, the market's deputy chairman,
will also examine ways in which Lloyd's can more successfully manage its
capacity in the future, in order to avoid the kind of rate competition that
plunged it into loss in the late 1980s.
One of the ways it could do this is by 'risk weighting': adjusting solvency
ratios - the ratio between capital and premium income - in line with the
riskiness of particular lines of business.
Among other ideas likely to come under consideration are:
Rule changes allowing corporate Names to own a majority or possibly all the
participations on a syndicate. At present any one corporate Name can account
for no more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity, while corporate
capital in general must account for no more than 50 per cent of a
syndicate's capacity. One-year accounting. Two years ago, Lloyd's rejected
the idea of changing its present system of accounting for results three
years in arrears. However, there is some pressure from corporate investors
for this to change.
The introduction of two-year accounting is regarded as a strong possibility
in the medium term, while some agencies may decide independently to account
on an annual basis. If this were to occur the individual syndicates at
Lloyd's could present their results independently - much as companies do -
and Lloyd's might dispense with presenting its results on a global basis.
Each of these ideas indicates that after the successful introduction this
year of corporate capital - trading on a limited liability basis - the
market's management is determined to change the character of its capital
base. As Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said recently: 'Last year will
seem tame to what we are preparing for 1994.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Societies hit by big outflow of retail funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal savers seeking better returns on their money contributed to a net
outflow of retail funds from building societies for the first January ever,
according to figures released yesterday by the Building Societies
Association.
The association said net receipts last month fell by Pounds 265m compared
with a Pounds 363m inflow in January 1992.
Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general, attributed part of the
outflow to the launch of the pensioners guaranteed income bond during
January, and warned it was likely to have an impact on the figures for
February as well.
'Further pressure on building society accounts will occur in February as the
second instalment on the British Telecom third share issue falls due on
March 1,' he added.
The figures underscore continuing difficulties for societies in attracting
retail funds, at a time of low interest rates, against competition from
savings products such as unit trusts.
In each of the last two quarters of 1993, societies suffered a net outflow
of funds. In November not even the interest credited to accounts could
prevent a fall in total retail funds for only the second time in societies'
history.
Some societies are not too worried about the state of the retail savings
market because demand for mortgages is so slack they do not need to raise
large amounts of retail funds.
If there were a significant increase in mortgage demand while interest rates
remained low then societies might have to turn more to the wholesale markets
for funds. At present, wholesale funds are cheaper than retail deposits.
There is, however, a regulatory limit on the proportion of wholesale funds
that societies can raise, though none is close to it yet.
More evidence of competition in mortgage lending came in falls for gross
mortgage lending and net new commitments.
Gross mortgage lending fell from Pounds 2.7bn in December to Pounds 2.1bn
last month, while net new commitments fell to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds
2.1bn.
But net advances - the difference between gross mortgage lending and
repayments - increased to Pounds 672m.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Newcastle and Birmingham to cut council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Council tax levels for 1994-95 will be lower than last year in several of
the metropolitan authorities which face elections in May.
The government predicted last December that council taxes would rise by an
average of 7 per cent. But this seems certain to conceal big variations
caused mainly by last year's overhaul of the standard spending assessment
system used for government grants.
Birmingham, which is Labour-controlled, is reducing its council tax for band
D properties from Pounds 657 to Pounds 632. Newcastle upon Tyne, also
Labour-controlled, expects to cut council tax in this band from Pounds
791.81 to Pounds 771. Other Labour authorities in the north-east also expect
reductions - of about 8.5 per cent for Sunderland and 6.1 per cent for South
Tyneside.
In London, Tory-controlled Westminster, recently accused of 'gerrymandering'
by the district auditor, has cut band D council tax from Pounds 295 to
Pounds 245, although many residents may pay more because of the phasing-out
of government transitional relief.
Cuts are also predicted in the council tax precepts from three counties  -
Durham, Northumberland and Oxfordshire.
County council precepts make up the bulk of the council tax in
non-metropolitan areas, although the tax is collected by districts, and
final council tax figures can be set only once district and parish figures
have been added.
Provisional figures from the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils show big variations. While Northumberland expects to cut its
precept by 5.1 per cent from Pounds 491.31 to Pounds 466.68, five counties
expect increases of more than 10 per cent - 10.3 per cent for Suffolk, 10.5
per cent for Nottinghamshire, 11 per cent for East Sussex, 11.5 per cent for
Northamptonshire, 12.8 per cent for Cleveland and 13.9 per cent for
Hampshire.
Precepts range in value from Hampshire at Pounds 420.84 for band D
properties to Cleveland at Pounds 578.70.
Mr Paul Harford, leader of Labour-controlled Cleveland county council, which
is due to be abolished next year as part of the review of local government,
said the government was 'feather-bedding taxpayers in the south of England
at the expense of people in this area'.
The new system of grants is the biggest factor behind the shifts, although
the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that some
councils had collected much more in the first year of council tax than they
had budgeted for, allowing them much more flexibility in setting this year's
budgets. Falling interest rates have also cut councils' planned debt
repayments.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Clinton seeks harmony after rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has assured Mr John Major that he wants to draw a
line under the rift in Anglo-US relations caused by a row over Northern
Ireland and sharp differences in their approach to the Bosnian war.
In spite of an undiplomatic attack on the US administration's Bosnia policy
yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, Downing Street
expects Mr Major to be given a friendly reception when he visits Washington
at the end of this month.
Mr Clinton plans a return trip to London in early June before the
50th-anniversary celebrations of the Normandy landings during the second
world war.
British and US officials said that during recent telephone conversations Mr
Clinton had sought to reassure Mr Major about the strength of what used to
be called the special relationship.
The officials confirmed that, contrary to denials from Downing Street, Mr
Clinton had warned Mr Major of serious damage to the Nato alliance if
Britain had sought to veto the threat of air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs.
But once Mr Major backed the plan Mr Clinton made it clear that he was
anxious to repair the recent damage to the relationship between the White
House and Downing Street. The president told Mr Major that his decision to
override British objections to a visit to New York by Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein leader, should not be interpreted as a deliberate personal slight.
Mr Clinton disowned reports in some US and British newspapers that he had
been totally unconcerned that the decision to give Mr Adams a visa might be
interpreted as a slight against the British prime minister. Instead he
blamed freelance briefings by US officials.
The stance adopted by the US president has been greeted with intense relief
by prime ministerial aides. Mr Major is conscious that Britain's declining
influence in Washington threatens further damage to his political authority.
There remains a possibility that differences over Bosnia could flare up
again before Mr Major travels to Washington. Mr Rifkind's attack on the US
over its refusal to contribute troops to the United Nations force in Bosnia
was indicative of tensions that remain.
The help given by the Conservatives to the Republicans during the
presidential election and investigations by the Home Office into Mr
Clinton's stay in Britain in the 1960s mean also that the relationship
between the two men will never be particularly warm.
But the British side is now convinced that Mr Clinton is ready to make a
conscious effort to emphasise that good transatlantic relations have been
restored.

FT  19 FEB 94 / O'Reilly urges Independent summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, appealed
yesterday for everyone involved in the bid for The Independent to meet for
talks on the newspaper group's future.
The call was made when Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive of HJ Heinz,
the international food group, yesterday met Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the
main founder of The Independent.
'It was good that we met. I am sorry we did not meet earlier,' said Mr
O'Reilly, who bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing - owners of The
Independent - on the day the consortium that includes Mr Whittam Smith made
an offer for the company.
'I said what I have said all along that all the parties should get
together,' said Mr O'Reilly, a former Irish rugby international over in the
UK this weekend for the Ireland-England rugby game.
'I think that there is a realistic chance that the interested parties will
come together to discuss. I am not sure there is a realistic chance they
will agree,' he added.
The consortium, which brings together Mirror Group Newspapers, the El Pais
newspaper of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy and the main founders of
Newspaper Publishing, already owns just under 48 per cent of the company. It
is expected to make a higher offer for the company next week but it is
believed that no final decision has yet been taken.
Mr O'Reilly and the Irish Independent clearly have the money to finance the
loss-making Newspaper Publishing or seek a larger stake.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Drugs companies fight generics push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute between pharma-ceutical industry representatives and the
Department of Health erupted again yesterday over whether generic drugs
should be prescribed in place of more expensive branded versions.
The Department of Health has said that it wanted to restart talks with
doctors aimed at allowing pharmacists to dispense generic versions.
But the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries' says this could
cut drug sales by Pounds 500m a year and drive out drug-company investment.
It added: 'If generic substitution was permitted by parliament this could
have a very serious affect on the UK-based business. Canada introduced a
policy of generic substitution 30 years ago. Very quickly it went from being
a net exporter of pharmaceuticals to a net importer.'
The government is considering various ways of controlling its spending on
the National Health Service.
The NHS drugs budget is about Pounds 3bn and last year the government
imposed a 2.5 per cent price cut on pharmaceuticals sold in the UK.
On Thursday, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, told the Commons health
committee that he wanted to reopen talks with doctors aimed at increasing
the proportion of generic drugs dispensed under the NHS.
The department said yesterday that it had long held a policy of encouraging
generic prescribing. Of the 60 per cent to 65 per cent of branded drug
prescriptions that could be replaced with generic prescriptions, more than
40 per cent already were.
Patents protect other drugs from generic competition.
The department said it had held talks with doctors over generic substitution
since 1983. The British Medical Association said these talks failed because
the department wanted to add a box to prescription forms for doctors to tick
if they did not want a generic drug dispensed.
The BMA said it was re-examining its opposition to 'ticking out', which was
one of the reasons the government wanted to restart talks.
It said there were questions over safeguards on the quality of generic drugs
and warned of a danger that the government might use pressure on doctors,
rather than advice, to prescribe generics.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Acrimony in motor industry criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carmakers and components suppliers in the UK plan to establish a forum to
improve relations. The move follows publication of a highly critical report
sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
The report says the 'necessary levels of trust' are not present between
vehicle makers and components suppliers. 'The mistrust which is in evidence
is the result of many years of broken promises, abuse of confidence and
general acrimony in the industry.'
The report was prepared by Professor Richard Lamming, professor of
purchasing and supply management at Bath University School of Management. It
was based on a series of discussion workshops held last year with the aim of
improving relationships between manufacturers and suppliers, and highlights
the lack of progress in reducing the traditional animosity between them.
The report says: 'In developing new working agreements with their suppliers
most vehicle manufacturers still appear to deal more in rhetoric than
reality.'
Prof Lamming said the loss of direct ownership control of most of the
vehicle-making industry in the UK had made the process of improving
relationships more difficult.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, urged the two sides to
work more closely together to meet the challenge presented by the
'globalisation' of markets.
Mr Heseltine said the report argued that a continued legacy of mistrust
remained 'a formidable barrier' to lean production and supply, and that
there was 'insufficient collaboration' on product and process development.

European Passenger Services, which will operate the cross-Channel rail link
out of Waterloo later this year, is to be temporarily transferred to
government ownership, the Department of Transport announced yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, confirmed that EPS, which should
gain huge revenues when it starts selling tickets to tunnel passengers later
this year, will eventually be transferred to the company that wins the bid
to build Britain's Channel tunnel rail link. Ownership of EPS will ensure a
steady revenue stream for the company that builds the link.
Mr MacGregor said that in the interim the company would be taken out of
British Rail's hands and managed by Mr PJ Butler, a former senior partner of
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, on behalf of the government.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Lambeth dubbed a 'shambles' by chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was 'a shambles at the very heart of the organisation' of Lambeth
Borough Council mid-way through last year, Mr Henry Gilby, the London
borough's chief executive, has told councillors, John Authers writes.
He recommends department mergers and redundancies as part of the changes
needed in the borough. Only eight directorates would report to the chief
executive rather than the present 13.
The changes would be part of Lambeth's attempt to answer criticisms in a
report by the district auditor last year, which found that Pounds 20.2m had
been spent unlawfully.
Mr Gilby says the council's central support services unit for members is
'wholly unsatisfactory, confused and overmanaged', and 'developed in an ad
hoc way that does not directly relate to the requirements of this section'.
The corporate standards unit - charged with co-ordinating policy - 'had not
had an appointed head for nearly two years' and its work had not been
satisfactorily dealt with. The equalities unit 'has not had an appointed
head for a very considerable period'. This meant that equalities had become
marginalised. The two units would be merged.
The information services and finance services departments would also be
merged.
The report is still at the draft stage and must be approved by councillors
before further management action can be taken.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Lloyd's disputes suicide allegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's yesterday rejected an allegation that more than 30 Names had
committed suicide or died as a result of stress-related conditions linked to
their underwriting losses.
Lloyd's said: 'Public records show that seven deaths in the past few years
have been attributed, by others, in whole or in part to the deceased's
membership of Lloyd's'
It was reacting to a statement by Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the
Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party. This body links the action groups
of loss-making Names - whose assets have traditionally supported the
insurance market.
He was speaking after the death earlier this week of Admiral Sir Richard
Fitch. Sir Richard, 64, a Name since the late 1980s, was found dead in his
car outside his home in Middleton-on-Sea, West Sussex. A tube was attached
to the car's exhaust pipe.
His son, Richard, said his father was 'very distressed' by the prospect of
heavy financial losses he was facing.
Mr Roger Pascall, administrative director of the Association of Lloyd's
Names, which represents about 9,000 Names, said:
'To say Names are under pressure is an understatement. Undoubtedly there are
hundreds, if not thousands, of Names who are greatly distressed.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Civil service fast stream probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government revealed yesterday that it is reviewing one of the
cornerstones of the British civil service, the fast stream entry system that
assures a glittering career for an elite of young high flyers.
For nearly 140 years the fast stream has picked out a small group of civil
servants at the start of their careers and virtually ensured that they are
Whitehall mandarins some 20 years later.
The system has been regularly attacked for ensuring that the civil service
is run by a like-minded group of white, middle-class males educated at
Oxford and Cambridge universities.
The Cabinet Office said yesterday that the review 'would look at the
strategic question of whether the civil service needs a fast stream system
at all'.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service
minister, announced that a review of the system was being carried out and it
would be completed by June.
The review follows calls - from inside and outside Whitehall - for changes
to the top structure of the civil service to bring it into line with the
management reforms of the last six years.
The creation of executive agencies to deliver central government services
has led ministers to look for private-sector skills in those who run them.
A recent Whitehall report into career management also claimed that the fast
stream system 'could encourage the worst aspects of elitism and, without
care, might perpetuate a set of skills more suitable to the past than the
future'.
Mr John Garrett, Labour MP for Norwich South and a former member of the
Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said the announcement was the
first time ministers had admitted that the system needs changing.
'A crack has appeared in the facade,' he added. He claimed that civil
service reforms could have a big impact on elite career management in the
private sector.
Cabinet Office staff were more downbeat about the announcement. 'It shows we
are a good, sensible employer, and this is a regular review of whether our
recruitment is up to best practice,' said an official.
The Cabinet Office is to review the future of Recruitment and Assessment
Services, the civil service recruitment agency. The agency recruits civil
servants and administers the fast stream system on behalf the Civil Service
Commissioners.
The review, which comes three years after the agency was created, will
consider privatisation and contracting-out as well as a continuation as an
agency. The views of outside organisations are to be sought on the options.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Council tax for Wellingborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Occupants of the most expensive house in the Northamptonshire district of
Wellingborough will pay a council tax of Pounds 587 in the coming financial
year - less than many residents of modest terraced homes in parts of Britain
with less wealthy councils, Chris Tighe writes.
In 1994-95, the Conservative-controlled borough is not only levying no
council tax for its own services, but is giving discounts of up to Pounds
400 on the precept levied by Northamptonshire County Council.
Northamptonshire will levy a precept of Pounds 490.78 for Band D. On this
figure, Wellingborough will offer a Pounds 200 discount, bringing the total
tax paid down to Pounds 290.78.
In 1993-94 Wellingborough had the lowest council tax bills in Britain, and
Mr Brian Veal, chief executive, predicts that it will keep the lowest bill
in the shire districts in 1994-95.
Another rural district, Hambleton in North Yorkshire, which is sitting on
reserves of Pounds 40m, is also to make a zero charge in 1994-95, and offers
a discount, Pounds 32 on Band D. This means Hambleton's smartest residences
will attract a maximum council tax bill in 1994-95 of Pounds 933, including
the county and maximum parish precepts.
Under local government reorganisation both Wellingborough, with 81,000
population, and Hambleton, with 68,000, face amalgamation with other areas.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Disgruntled Washington backs away from Aristide

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration and President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti
appear to be irredeemably at odds after the failure of another attempt to
persuade him to make more concessions to the military junta that ousted him
two and a half years ago.
Under pressure from the administration to show more flexibility, Mr Aristide
met a delegation from the Haitian parliament in Washington, but he did not
discuss a new peace plan that the US has been strongly backing.
This parliamentary plan calls on Mr Aristide to name a new prime minister,
but unlike the Governor's Island agreement last year which was supposed to
bring about the restoration of a democratic government, it sets no date for
the ousted president to return to Haiti.
It also calls for the resignation only of General Raoul Cedras, the army
commander, and not of other military leaders such as Colonel Michel
Francois, the police chief.
The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr
Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to
the military.
'I think we still have a working relationship with Father Aristide. We
believe he's the democratically elected president of Haiti, and our policy
stil is to restore a democratically elected government which is headed by
Father Aristide,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.
But the US has for months now been urging Mr Aristide to appoint a
government that includes members of the military, and has been cool to his
demand that the United Nations stiffen its economic sanctions against Haiti.
'The relationship between the US and Aristide has never been worse,' says Mr
Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington
monitoring group, who describes the US's Haitian policy as 'devoid of any
capacity for moral indignation or an ethical compass in favour of a
president who won more than two thirds of the vote of his own people.
Critics note that the US has blithely continued to do business with Haiti,
despite the UN embargo.
US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year to Dollars 154m,
thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of
goods assembled in Haiti from US parts ' principally clothing and baseballs.
US exports to Haiti also rose last year to Dollars 221m.
European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they
see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Japan fights for right blend of foreign rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With the first bags of foreign rice hitting Japan's supermarket shelves,
worries about the best way to serve it have overshadowed concern that the
Japanese way of life and its cultural values might be threatened.
Shoppers in Tokyo are being offered foreign rice for the first time because
a shortage of domestic rice has prompted emergency imports.
For Japan, the question of rice imports has created political problems at
home and abroad. Local farmers have protested, and the determination to keep
foreign rice out, at one stage, threatened the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks. In the end, typhoons and a cold summer last year
ruined the local rice harvest and forced the government into allowing
imports.
Officially, Japan has until next year before it opens the country's rice
market to foreign imports.
The emergency imports - a total of 2m tonnes - are from the US, China,
Australia and Thailand. Imported rice will account for over 70 per cent of
the rice marketed in the next three to four months.
The government wants wholesalers and retailers to blend Japanese and foreign
rice, rather than sell it on its own.
Householders have been scrambling for advice on the ideal ratio of foreign
to Japanese rice and the past few weeks have seen even the serious news
channels airing taste tests on sushi made with Thai long grain rice and
California Rose. Will it be Californian seven to Thai three ma'am, or
Japanese three to Australian two and Chinese five?
At the same time, consumers have also been confronted with reports of mouldy
rice imported from California and packets of fungicides and pesticides
marked with skull and cross bones, used to treat imported rice.
'The negative coverage in the newspapers and television makes me very
scared,' says Mrs Sonoko Yoshimura, a 42-year-old housewife whose family of
five consumes 11 pounds of rice every month. She adds that the older
generation, including her 69-year-old mother, sensitive about how her daily
rice tastes, will probably not take to foreign rice.
However while farmers grind their teeth at the sight of Japanese purity
mixed with imports, businesses have quickly adjusted, turning public
concerns of poor quality and taste of foreign rice into a marketing
opportunity. Food companies are now rushing to sell tablets which make
foreign rice taste better when popped into the pot together, and special
vinegars for sushi made with foreign rice.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the leading consumer electronics company and
largest maker of electric rice cookers, has also been bombarded with calls
on how to cook imported blends. It is advising consumers to wash and soak
foreign rice longer than normal Japanese rice and hopes to develop a rice
cooker for foreign rice once it finds which rice blend best suits the
Japanese palate.
But some consumers are willing to put xenophobia and prejudice aside for
cheaper prices. Seiyu, a leading supermarket chain, was shocked to see 2.5
tonnes of California rice - priced at half of that of Japanese rice -
disappear in a matter of hours.
'They were queueing up for it because it's just as good and half as
expensive,' says Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador, stressing that US
brands are easily accepted if there are no barriers.

<TEXT>
Four Venezuelan financial institutions are receiving government aid because
of liquidity problems, Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said
yesterday.
Testifying before a congressional committee on the state of Venezuela's
financial system, he said three of the troubled entities were commercial
banks.
Venezuela's financial system is still reeling from the effects of the
failure of the country's second largest bank, Banco Latino. The government
took control of Banco Latino in the middle of last month. With the help of
several large banks, it has provided Latino and other troubled banks with
over Dollars 1bn.
Bankers in Caracas say privately that more than four financial institutions
are in trouble and that a series of government measures announced this week
are not sufficient to confront the financial system's problems.
These measures included a determination to re-float Latino, a government
demand that banks receiving official financial assistance increase their
capital bases and improve performance, and a plan to strengthen the
country's bank regulatory system. Last month, the central bank reportedly
had eleven financial institutions on its 'watch list'.
President Rafael Caldera said yesterday he was replacing Roger Urbina, the
superintendent of banks, which regulates and supervises the system, and
Esperanza Martino, president of the Deposit Insurance Fund.

Belgium's 1993 gross domestic product shrank by an estimated 1.3 per cent,
the Belgian central bank said, Reuter reports from Brussels. In 1992 the
Belgian economy grew 1.4 per cent. The central bank's new 1993 estimate is
slightly better than the 1.5 per cent contraction it forecast in October.
This was due mainly to hopes for a stabilisation of fourth-quarter growth.

Industrialised countries have agreed on the need to strengthen the
international climate change treaty to reduce emissions of gases that warm
the earth's atmosphere, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The treaty,
signed by over 160 countries in 1992 and due to come into effect next month,
commits rich nations to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
However, governments have now accepted that this will not be enough to
prevent potentially dangerous atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases. Scientists have said a 60 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions is
needed to halt global warming. Environmental groups are urging a rapid
reduction of at least 20 per cent.

FT  19 FEB 94 / US ambassador takes hard line with Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador in Tokyo, yesterday indicated mounting
frustration at the US-Japan trade impasse, but stressed that the two powers'
political and security relations must not be harmed.
'We're waiting for Japan to take the initiative to open its market. We have
said, and we mean it, that the status quo is unacceptable,' he said.
Mr Mondale had earlier supported attempts to strike a compromise with Japan
on government procurement, an important aspect of the trade dispute, but
without success.
The hardening in his stance directly influences the US position, since Mr
Mondale, a former US vice president, has a closer relationship with US
president Bill Clinton than is usual for ambassadors.
Washington would continue to insist on numerical measures to gauge the
increase in foreign goods' market share, said Mr Mondale. 'I don't want to
hint that we're willing to get off indicators. We have to have some way to
measure progress,' he said.
Despite the growing disarray of Japan's seven-party coalition, Washington
would keep up the pressure. 'At some point, nations have to do business with
each other,' said Mr Mondale.
He would not speculate whether the deadlock would be loosened by the
Japanese government's latest plans to improve access for imports, expected
to be unveiled shortly, but warned: 'We need and must have a response that
opens this market in a decent interval,' he said.
The Japanese government plans to draw up market opening emergency plans,
possibly in time for the meeting of finance ministers and central bank
governors from the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Frankfurt next
Saturday.
'The ball is in Japan's court,' admitted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief
cabinet secretary. The measures are expected to include simplified import
procedures, promotions of imports and foreign investment, more open
government procurement and tougher anti-trust rules.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The boss of Okuma, a leading Japanese machine tool maker, and two directors,
yesterday resigned after a row with the government over plans to lower the
company's compulsory retirement age.
The move highlights the political and social constraints on Japanese
companies' attempts to cut costs during the recession. The Labour Ministry
has warned other employers not to follow Okuma's example.
Mr Yutaka Maeda, Okuma's president who resigned, applied last month for
permission temporarily to lower the company retirement age from 60 to 56, to
help reduce losses, expected to more than double to Y12bn in the year to
March. The plan had the backing of Okuma's company union.
This provoked a rare warning from Mr Chikara Sakaguchi, Minister of Labour,
that the plan would be socially harmful. He plans to submit a bill to
parliament setting the retirement age at 60.
Okuma's move was controversial because it challenged Japan's social contract
of a job for life in return for lifetime loyalty.
Earnings tend to rise with age, rather than merit, so people taking early
retirement often make a bigger sacrifice than European or US equivalents.
Okuma has promised to restore the retirement age to 60 when its earnings
improve, said a ministry official.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An unprecedented Syrian decision to allow a delegation of Israeli Arabs to
visit Damascus was welcomed in Israel yesterday as a sign that relations
might be about to undergo a transformation.
The 30-strong delegation, led by Mr Abdul-Wahab Daroushe, an Israeli Knesset
member, is expected to travel to Damascus in the next few days, ostensibly
to extend condolences from Israeli Arabs to President Hafez Assad on the
recent death of his son Basil.
Israeli-Syrian peace talks resumed last week in Washington, but Israel has
been calling on President Assad to invigorate the process by agreeing to a
summit with Mr Rabin.
President Assad is seeking the return of the Golan Heights from Israel as
the price of peace - a price that most Israelis are unwilling to pay,
particularly in the absence of more concrete evidence of a warmer long-term
Syrian attitude to Israel.
Arrangements for the visit, suggested by Mr Daroushe, were made by Mr Amr
Moussa. Egypt's foreign minister. Earlier this week, Mr Mohammed Bassiouny,
Egypt's ambassador in Israel, informed Mr Daroushe that the Syrians had
given their approval.
'It is a positive signal which we welcome, though it has its limitations,'
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday. Privately,
officials in the prime minister's office were more enthusiastic, one noting
that this was the first time Assad had agreed to meet openly with Israelis.
Israeli officials drew further encouragement from a message from Damascus
that Syria remained committed to preventing rocket attacks on Israeli
territory from South Lebanon. However at least two were fired into northern
Israel on Wednesday.

FT  19 FEB 94 / The Chinese go for gold: Why the authorities are encouraging
the traditional love of the most precious of metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Professor Li Yin ing, one of China's most influential economists,
advised people this week to buy gold h e was doing no more than preaching to
the converted.
The World Gold Council estimates that since China lifted a ban on the sale
of gold jewellery in 1984 increases in gold consumption have averaged 20 per
cent a year.
Given traditional Chinese affection for gold as decoration and as a hedge
against bad times this revived appetite for the precious metal is hardly
surprising, although the strength of demand has caught the industry
offguard.
Gold is so embedded in Chinese consciousness that it ranks first in popular
mythology among five sacred elements fundamental to people's existence
together with wind, fire, water and earth. Indeed, the Chinese ideograms for
'metal' and 'gold' are identical.
Mr Liu Shanen, director of research at China's Gold Bureau in Beijing, says
simply that gold is money. 'To many Chinese gold never loses its value,
unlike paper money. It's also money one can save and pass on to one's
descendants.'
A 'Gold Acquisition Study' conducted last year by the WGC in China's three
main cities found that on average one in five people in Shanghai and
Guangzhou bought gold jewellery in 1993, followed by one in seven in
Beijing.
Average per head gold consumption among 1.17bn Chinese was Dollars 42 in
1993, or approximately 0.2 grams per head. Overall gold ownership levels,
that is numbers of people buying gold, were up about 5 per cent last year
against 1992.
But mainland Chinese gold consumption per head still lags far behind Hong
Kong and Taiwan whose citizens purchase on average 10 grams each a year.
Such is the obsession with gold these days, that when young women get
together they talk about little else but gold jewellery. 'If you're a young
woman without gold jewellery you'll be looked down upon,' said one observer.
China's Gold Bureau reports that gold consumption - the bulk is used in
jewellery manufacture - grew from 150 tonnes in 1991 to 250 tonnes in 1992,
compared with annual production from China's own mines of about 100 tonnes.
Gold purchases are expected to exceed 400 tonnes a year within the next few
years. This would make China the world's biggest consumer ahead of India and
the United States.
'Greater China' - China, Taiwan and Hong Kong - is already the biggest
consumer, absorbing about about 500 tonnes of gold, or a third of western
mine production in 1992.
Prof Li's advice to Chinese to buy gold as a form of saving, and more
importantly his recommendation that a gold exchange be established, is
certain to attract attention in China where a vigorous debate is in progress
about ways in which to rationalise and enliven the country's gold market.
A professor of economics at prestigious Beijing University and prolific
writer in the local press, Prof Li is also a member of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
Writing in the China Gold Daily, he noted that allowing people to own gold
in the form of coins or ingots - gold purchases are restricted to jewellery
 -would be a means of channelling savings away from short-term consumer
spending thus easing pressures on prices.
Other benefits of the establishment of a gold exchange were that it would
help enliven flagging production, counter smuggling of gold abroad, generate
tax revenues and contribute generally to the creation of a gold 'industry'
in China.
Debate about the establishment of a gold exchange has intensified recently
since China's state monopoly over gold began to crumble with mines selling
produce on a booming black market energised by surging demand for gold
jewellery.
State purchases of gold were down by 40 per cent in 1993 compared with 1992,
in spite of a doubling from September 1 of the purchase price to Yn2,986
(UDollars 343) a troy ounce. That price has not budged since and has
remained at about 10 per cent below the world market.
With China in the grip of inflation - the cost of living increased by nearly
24 per cent in December - there would be lively demand among consumers for
gold as a traditional hedge. The People's Bank seems reluctant, however, to
yield its gold trading monopoly.
In the meantime, organisations like the WGC, representing the world's major
mining companies, are certain to redouble their efforts to promote gold's
allure in a potential market almost beyond imagination. WGC plans to spend
Dollars 3m this year on promotion.

Prosecutors yesterday recommended that 102 people, including Mr Bettino
Craxi, the former Italian prime minister, should stand trial on corruption
charges in connection with the building of Milan's underground railway,
Reuter reports from Milan.
A preliminary hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to put
the suspects on trial was set for April 19.
Defendants include three former executives of industrial group Fiat and
construction tycoon Salvatore Ligresti, who has testified that he paid about
Dollars 1m in bribes to politicians for building contracts on the
underground between 1987 and 1990. Almost all of the 102 are accused of
corruption and illicit party funding in connection with the project, which
added a third line to the transport system in the late 1980s.
Mr Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987, dominated the Socialist party
until he was forced to step down as its leader last year because of
corruption investigations.
He is already set to stand trial in a different case involving alleged
bribes from an insurance group for contracts with state energy giant ENI.
Prosecutors said two former Socialist mayors of Milan, Mr Paolo Pillitteri
and Mr Carlo Tognoli, had been dropped from the list of suspects in the
railway investigation.

<TEXT>
Greece's partners in the European Union yesterday strongly increased their
pressure on Athens to lift its controversial trade blockade on the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, and Mr Willy Claes, the
Belgian foreign minister, said in the Greek capital that they had asked
Greece to reconsider its action. After meeting Greek President Andreas
Panadreou, Mr Kinkel said that Greece's move could further destabilise the
region and was 'against the interest' of the EU.
Britain, along with other EU member states, delivered an official diplomatic
protest to the Greek government in Athens, and, in Paris, the French
government summoned the Greek ambassador to express its concern.
European officials are expected to discuss the issue with Greece on Monday,
when the EU's foreign ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the Balkans
crisis and issues involving possible EU enlargement.
Diplomats in Brussels are deeply irritated at the move, which has been
interpreted by some as an attempt to divert attention away from Greece's
unease about the threatened Nato air strikes in Bosnia, and European
Commission officials said yesterday that they would be seeking further
'clarification' from Greece.
However, they said that it was unlikely that Greece's partners would seek to
take concerted action until the Commission's legal services had prepared a
report on whether the action had contravened EU law.
The Greek delegation in Brussels said yesterday that it would argue that its
action was legal since it involved national security.
Despite the heavy criticism from its allies, Greece, which currently holds
the rotating EU presidency, has begun stopping ships from handling goods for
Skopje, the new republic's capital, at Thessaloniki and blocking trucks from
crossing the border 70 kms to the north.
Mr Claes and Mr Kinkel were in Athens for a regular meeting of the EU
troika, which groups the current holder of the EU presidency with the
previous one (Belgium) and the next one (Germany).
'I want to say openly and clearly that the EU expects Greece to show
solidarity with the attitude of the other 11 (EU member) countries,' Mr
Kinkel said. 'I expect that Greece will withdraw this decision.'
Asked if the Macedonian republic should first meet any Greek demands, he
said 'No'.
Greece is demanding three pre-conditions before resuming UN talks to resolve
the two-year-old feud. It wants the new republic to change its name,
national symbols and constitution to prove it has no territorial ambitions
on Greece's Macedonia province, where 2.5m Greek Macedonians live. Macedonia
declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and gained UN admittance last
year under the temporary name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister for European Affairs said
in Athens yesterday, the blockade would last until Skopje, capital of the
republic, bowed to Greece's demands.

FT  19 FEB 94 / BNL post takes Sarcinelli home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of Mr Mario Sarcinelli as chairman of Italy's Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro will bring a further shake-up to the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. However, the prospective move to the BNL by
this well-respected former director general of the Italian Treasury adds
considerable impetus to the planned privatisation of Italy's largest
state-controlled commercial bank.
Mr Sarcinelli, 59, who is No. 3 at the London-based EBRD, said last night he
was looking forward to heading the BNL. 'I always go to places where there
is a lot of challenge.'
Mr Sarcinelli said he was offered the BNL job in a telephone call from a
'high place' in the Italian government on Thursday morning. Although one
business associate of Mr Sarcinelli yesterday described him as 'a fish out
of water' at the EBRD, he said he was 'not at all unhappy' at the bank.
Formerly in charge of the development banking department that was merged
with EBRD's merchant banking team towards the end of last year, Mr
Sarcinelli said the EBRD reorganisation 'was one largely at my instigation.'
He added: 'I am sad that I will not be reaping the results.'
One EBRD executive said Mr Sarcinelli's move came as a surprise. 'He was not
forced out. He has landed a wonderful job. It is a good reflection on us.'
Mr Sarcinelli said he would leave the EBRD after its annual meeting in St
Petersburg on April 18/19. Choosing a successor was a matter for Mr Jacques
de Larosiere, the EBRD president. 'I hope he has someone in mind,' Mr
Sarcinelli said.
Mr Sarcinelli was the most brilliant mind of his generation recruited by the
Bank of Italy, and rapidly moved up the ranks during the 1970s to become
deputy general general. But he paid a very high price for daring to behave
as an impartial public servant, pushing in 1978 for an inspection of the
troubled Banco Ambrosiano, run by Mr Roberto Calvi.
In a politically-motivated move, Mr Sarcinelli was arrested in 1979 along
with Mr Paolo Baffi, the then governor of the Bank of Italy, on trumped up
charges by Rome magistrates. The charges were subsequently dropped and he
was reinstated, becoming director-general of the Treasury.
However, he felt constrained in Italy's highly politicised environment in
the late 1980s, and resigned in 1989 in a row over the way the Andreotti
government was permitting uncontrolled credit cover for the Soviet Union.
The BNL has a tortured history. The bank has been associated with the secret
masonic lodge P2 headed by Mr Licio Gelli. Mr Gelli and the P2 were found to
be closely linked to the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano.
Mr Sarcinelli's appointment is also a signal from the government of Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi that it will try to push through BNL's privatisation. The
BNL, traditionally controlled by the Socialists, has resisted any such move.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Serbs take heart from Russian intervention: Smiling
Milosevic meets Churkin and persuades his people Nato air strikes will be
averted
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A television shot of President Slobodan Milosevic smiling after a meeting
with Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy on Yugoslavia, has done
more than anything else to convince Serbs that Nato air strikes will be
averted.
The Serbian president broke his silence on the Nato ultimatum to send thanks
to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president for 'his help in handling the
biggest crisis so far in the peace process and reducing the danger of
escalation of hostilities.'
Mr Milosevic, facing an increasingly unstable Serbia, largely because of the
impact of sanctions, has tried to distance his government from the Sarajevo
ultimatum, even refusing an opposition request for a parliamentary debate on
the threat of air strikes.
Mr Milosevic's position was made more uncomfortable by the fact that his
ally, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, voiced support for the air
strikes.
Yesterday, however, state-controlled television for the first time carried
reports from Sarajevo on withdrawals of heavy weapons by Bosnian Serb
forces, in compliance with the ultimatum. The Belgrade daily Politika ran a
headline saying: 'The Serbs are withdrawing, the Russians are coming.'
The independent weekly Vreme wrote: 'After all these years, we now have the
right to a little optimism, based on the hope that the worst will not
happen.'
Mr Yeltsin's letter, addressed jointly to Mr Milosevic, Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, and other Serbian officials, asked the Bosnian
Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and lift the
siege of the city.
The letter also asked the two Serb leaders to reinforce the security zone
around Sarajevo and backed the UN plan for demilitarisation of the city. Mr
Yeltsin's offer of 400 extra Russian troops to join the UN peacekeeping
force in Sarajevo was seen as boosting the chances for achieving peace in
the city.
The presence in Sarajevo of troops from Russia, traditionally supportive of
the Serbs, would 'give the Bosnian Serbs a sense of security from Moslem
attack once the heavy weapons are withdrawn,' one analyst said.
In Belgrade, the threat of Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs served
to divert attention from both a prolonged stalemate over forming a new
government and worsening economic problems.
Two months of political manoeuvring after an election in which Mr
Milosevic's Socialist party was denied an overall parliamentary majority,
denting his image as undisputed leader of the Serbs, has failed to produce
any result, although some opposition leaders now appear willing to support
the Socialists.
At the same time, cracks in the Socialists' new economic programme are
appearing, with a shortage of new dinars now evident. Following strike
threats earlier this week by 12,000 Belgrade metal workers, the government
has decided to resume subsidising production at the plant, reviving fears
that a heavy bout of inflation will soon return.

The national leadership is now expected to decide on Monday in which region

favour, that would open the way for limited strike action in the region,

FT  19 FEB 94 / French output continues slow climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French manufacturing industry arrested its decline at the end of last year
but the economy faces a slow recovery after recession, according to
manufacturing output and industrial production statistics announced
yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office.
Manufacturing output rose by 0.5 per cent in December, its second
consecutive monthly increase, as a result of stronger demand for steel,
construction materials and a stabilisation in consumer goods output.
A sharp fall in energy output, however, which resulted from a mild December,
prompted a fall of 0.7 per in industrial production during the month.
The French Economy Ministry described the manufacturing output figures as
encouraging. It said that the figures, which follow a number of other
positive indicators, including increased production of intermediate goods
and capital equipment, provided 'evidence of consolidation in economic
activity.'
Private sector economists were more cautious. 'There was a stabilisation in
activity at the end of last year and there is some improvement in business
sentiment. But there is no indication yet of a significant recovery,' said
one economist at a French merchant bank.
The hesitant French recovery could be bolstered, however, by a reduction in
interest rates following the 0.5 percentage point cut in Germany's discount
rate on Thursday. The move opens the way for the first cut in borrowing
costs by the Bank of France since it gained independence last month.
Many analysts expect, however, that the French central bank will wait for a
reduction in the German repo rate before bringing its intervention rate, the
floor for money market rates, below its current level of 6.2 per cent.
'The strategy of the French monetary authorities seems to be to maintain a
slight positive differential on money market rates with respect to Germany,'
said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris.
As a result, it is the German repo rate which provides a stronger guide for
French interest rate policy.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Finland softens stance over EU farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finland yesterday softened its opposition to European Union proposals on how
to integrate Nordic and Alpine agriculture once Austria, Sweden, Norway and
Finland join the EU.
The shift comes as the 12 and the four applicants start make-or-break
ministerial talks on Monday to finish the enlargement negotiations by the
end of this month.
Finland, along with Austria and Norway, opposed EU plans to cut their farm
prices - 25 to 100 per cent higher than the EU norm - to fit in with the
Common Agricultural Policy. Brussels advocates direct compensation to Arctic
and Alpine farmers for the income lost, paid for by the applicant countries.
The Finns, Norwegians and Austrians want to apply the traditional EU system
of border rebates for farm price differences, to ease the transition to EU
price levels. The European Commission and the 12 reject this as reinstating
the frontiers done away with by the single European market.
Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finnish foreign minister and former farmers' leader said
yesterday that Finland was willing to examine the direct compensation plan
if border rebates were ruled out. 'If border rebates are not possible then
we will have to look at it,' he said, referring to the Commission plan.
Finland, like its Nordic partners, insists on a permanent regime to assist
Arctic farmers. That, and how much the EU should contribute to the direct
compensation payment will be at the heart of next week's negotiations.
Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said yesterday that the negotiations should
concentrate on the big remaining issues. He confirmed Mr Haavisto's shift,
saying 'we are ready to discuss that but after we know what the permanent
arrangements for Arctic farmers are.'
Mr Aho also revealed that Finland would probably hold its referendum on
membership in September, if next week's talks succeed.
Since Finland is the Nordic country most likely to vote yes, this could have
a positive effect on more sceptical public opinion in Sweden - where a
referendum will probably not take place before November - and even in
Norway, where anti-EU sentiment is strongest. The Norwegian referendum is
likely to take place much later.

FT  19 FEB 94 / German move triggers further rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's interest rate cut on Thursday triggered further reductions
in other European rates yesterday.
Sweden and Denmark both moved to cut rates yesterday, underscoring an
already promising outlook for economic growth in both countries this year.
The Danish central bank, making its 11th rate cut in six months, shaved 0.25
per cent off the rates for its key deposit, discount and 14-days
certificates of deposit. The deposit and discount rates now stand at 5.50
per cent while the CDs stand at 6 per cent.
Sweden's Riksbank, meanwhile, cut its marginal rate from 7.50 per cent to
7.25 per cent. The government, facing a huge budget deficit, is relying
chiefly on monetary policy to help stimulate growth expected to top 2 per
cent this year after three years of recession.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish bank governor, said Denmark, also expecting
similar growth this year, needed cuts in interest rates to sustain the
recovery but would follow the general trend in Europe. 'When you are
participating in an integrated European economy, you cannot conduct an
independent interest rate policy,' he said.
The Swiss National Bank cut its Lombard rate to 6.375 per cent from 6.5 per
cent, while the Bank of Spain said yesterday it cut its daily intervention
rate to 8.55 per cent from 8.8 per cent, signalling a possible cut in its
benchmark rate next week.
Italy, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands cut their rates on Thursday
immediately after the Bundesbank move. The Belgian cuts, effective from
yesterday, take the , central rate to 6.55 per cent from 6.7 per cent and
the discount rate to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent.
Italy's central bank cut its official discount rate by half a percentage
point, to 7.5 percent, with effect from yesterday.
Austria cut both its discount and Lombard rates by a quarter percentage
point to 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, with effect from yesterday.
The Dutch central bank cut its official rate on advances, its benchmark
rate, from 5.25 to 5 per cent.

<TEXT>
A new row has broken out between the Irish government and the European
Commission over the allocation of IPounds 7.2bn in EU structural and
cohesion funds to Ireland for 1994-99.
A team of Commission officials, headed by Mr Eneko Landaburu, the director
general for regional policy, arrived in Dublin yesterday for what was
expected to be a stormy meeting to discuss Ireland's plans for spending the
IPounds 7.2bn under the various operational programme headings.
Mr Landaburu has publicly raised questions over Ireland's emphasis on human
resource development, for which IPounds 3.1bn is earmarked under Ireland's
national development plan for 1994-99, and of which IPounds 1.9bn is to be
funded by the EU.
Mr Ruari Quinn, Ireland's minister for enterprise and employment, yesterday
attacked Mr Landaburu for having publicly criticised Ireland's spending
plans in advance of yesterday's meeting. Commission officials said yesterday
that 'nobody in the government can have been under any illusion that the
plan would be simply rubber-stamped by the commission.' .

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian deputies yesterday refused to vote on the treaty signed between the
Russian government and the leadership of the autonomous republic of
Tatarstan, voicinggrowing concern that the agreement cedes too much power to
the republic.
Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, said yesterday
that deputies refused to vote because six separate agreements, including
details of fiscal and other relations between the two sides, had not been
published.
Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedayev, a former first deputy foreign minister and
leading member of Russia's Choice, said that the agreement could lead to a
'break-up of the federation'.
In the main treaty, which has been published, the issue of the Tatarstan
constitution - which describes the republic as a sovereign state and which
was declared incompatible with the previous Russian constitution by the then
constitutional court - has been dropped. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, minister for
regions and nationalities and one of the main negotiators of the reaty,
admitted that the Tatar parliament would be unlikely to amend or revoke
their constitution in the near future.
The treaty is also ambiguous about who has the right to levy taxes and on
what they are to be spent. Mr Shakhrai said that the original demand of
Tatarstan to have a 'one channel' tax system under which it would decide
which if any taxes to remit to the centre had been squashed - but it is not
clear with what it has been replaced.
The treaty also explicitly allows Tatars who do not wish to serve in the
Russian army to opt out in return for performing some other service
specified by the Tatar authorities - a large concession in a country where
compulsory service is widely resented and evaded.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Lloyd's may allow Names to trade syndicate shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is considering a radical extension of its reform programme
by giving its members the right to trade their shares in syndicates at the
insurance market.
The initiative, being studied by a team of market professionals and
advisers, may also make it easier for Names - the individuals whose assets
back the market - to operate with limited liability.
A 10-person team, headed by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman, will
examine the scope for introducing a market in syndicate 'participations'. If
introduced, Names would have the right to buy, sell or transfer their shares
in syndicates which underwrite insurance business.
An outline of the team's brief was contained in a letter this week from Mr
David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, to colleagues. He said the market might
allow existing Names 'to realise value from their current participations'.
He added: 'Any market mechanism should provide for complete transparency and
also provide some benefit to the society (of Lloyd's) as a whole.'
The news signals that Lloyd's is pressing ahead with far-reaching reforms,
despite the failure on Monday of its efforts to settle litigation with a
Pounds 900m out-of-court offer to more than 20,000 loss-making Names.
The fresh push for reform follows the successful launch last year of 12
investment trusts, which own 'corporate Name' subsidiaries. The trusts are
trading at the market with limited liability for their losses.
The trusts, along with a number of smaller corporate Names, have committed
Pounds 800m to the market and account for about a sixth of its Pounds 10.9bn
capacity - its ability to accept premium income - for 1994.
Mr Rowland said the team, known as the Value Group, would also look at ways
of attracting fresh capital and fulfilling commitments made last year to
members about 'pre-emption' rights. These would give Names the right to
increase their shares of syndicates when managers decide to increase
capacity.
Funds released through the sale of 'participations' could be used by some
Names to help meet their liabilities on syndicates which have years of
account left open because of uncertainty over future claims.
Lloyd's is hoping to close most of these so-called 'open years' by creating
a new reinsurance company, NewCo, into which assets and liabilities relating
to all business underwritten before 1986 would be transferred. It is
expected that NewCo will be operational by 1996.
Other members of the Value Group are Sir Laurie Magnus, a director of
corporate finance at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which sponsored
Lloyd's biggest investment trust, London Insurance Market Investment Trust
and Mr Mark Brockbank, a leading underwriter.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Recovery doubts raised by weak bank lending: Clarke
confident on growth despite a week of poor statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak bank lending figures yesterday kindled further fears that the UK
recovery is losing strength even before April's tax increases take effect.
The data - showing the lowest level of private sector lending since November
1992 - increased discomfort for the government at the end of a week in which
a spate of poor economic statistics raised doubts about the recovery's
sustainability.
Lending by UK banks and building societies - M4 lending - was a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 200m last month, the lowest level for more than a year and
much less than the Pounds 3.6bn recorded in December. It also fell short of
economists' expectations for lending of Pounds 2.6bn.
The news failed to ruffle Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who insisted
that the recovery was on track and described the UK as 'the fastest growing
major economy in Europe'.
He told Harrow East Conservatives the UK was the only major European Union
country where the trend in unemployment was downward.
'Our interest rates remain competitive and are among the lowest in the EU,'
Mr Clarke said.
'As a result, we were recently ranked top out of seven European countries as
a good location for manufacturing investment.'
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: 'No one can be surprised,
as the scale of the Tory tax rises sink in, that consumers are refusing to
start spending, companies are nervous about new investment and unemployment
is still high.'
'The figures recently have been very weak,' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK
economist at Salomon Brothers. 'I am in the camp that believes inflation
will be subdued and recovery slow, but I didn't expect to see the evidence
so starkly this week.'
The Bank of England figures also showed that the broad money supply measure,
M4, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent last month compared with
December to stand 5.5 per cent higher than a year ago. This compares with a
5.4 per cent rise in December. M4 takes in notes and coins in circulation,
plus bank and building society deposits.
Although disappointing, analysts said that the slowdown in private sector
lending after the large December rise was not surprising and largely
reflected debt repayment across the corporate sector.
One explanation was that companies had used improved cash flow to pay
corporation tax instead of borrowing, which usually inflates the January
figure.
The Treasury and the Bank said the figures showed that the annual growth
rate of M4 was within its 3-9 per cent monitoring range. Officials said
activity was continuing elsewhere in the economy, but was not reflected in
money supply figures.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Nato holds Serbs to strict deadline: Slow pull-back prompts
renewed air strike threat - UK challenges US commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the slow pace of the Bosnian Serb pull-back from Sarajevo
prompted Nato yesterday to renew its threat to launch air strikes if the
deadline for a complete withdrawal is not met by midnight tomorrow.
In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said an expected
new deployment of 400 Russian troops in the war zone would not affect Nato's
ultimatum and he rejected a Russian warning that air strikes risked all-out
war in Bosnia.
'We have information that they've taken out probably 50 or so of the heavy
weapons . . . it means that they've got lots more to take out,' he said. If
they did not meet the ultimatum to withdraw all heavy weapons from the 20km
exclusion zone they would be 'subject to air attacks . . . there will be
severe punishment if they don't comply . . . they will pay a very heavy
price,' Mr Christopher said.
The warning to the Bosnian Serbs came as Russia and Britain called on the US
to become more actively involved in helping to negotiate a permanent peace
settlement for Bosnia, with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary,
pointedly remarking that the US had only 15 men on the ground in Bosnia.
In Washington, officials said the US remained willing to commit ground
troops only if a peace settlement were agreed.
Yesterday's warning from Nato was made despite Russia's diplomatic success
in securing an agreement by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia that
Bosnia's Serbs would meet Nato's ultimatum.
In Bosnia there was conflicting evidence about the extent of the withdrawal.
General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, repeated his
conviction that Bosnian Serbs would hand their siege weapons over to UN
forces or pull them out of the exclusion zone around the city by Saturday
night, 24 hours before the Nato deadline.
A Nato official said: 'If Russian pressure will help, we welcome that. But
there should be no misunderstanding; any initiative will be assessed by its
results.'
But Russia, determined to maintain the diplomatic initiative, called on the
US to play a more active role.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, who was in Athens for talks
with the German, Greek and Belgian foreign ministers, said: 'It is important
that the other side, the United States and others, encourage other parties
not to try to exploit the withdrawal but to exploit the possibility for
peace and also make progressive steps from their side.'
In Moscow, Mr Anatoly Adamishin, the first deputy Russian foreign minister,
challenged the west. 'Russia has done her part of the job - now the west
must do its part,' he said. 'We used our strong point - our influence on the
Bosnian Serbs. Now the west must use its influence on the Bosnian Moslems.
They too must hand over their weapons within the deadline specified by the
United Nations.'
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Adamishin said the Moslems
should not be allowed to use the Serbs' withdrawal to improve their
battlefield positions.
But France said more measures were needed to lift the siege of Sarajevo. Mr
Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said a withdrawal of Serbian
artillery from around Sarajevo had to be followed by other measures to end
the siege of the city.

FT  19 FEB 94 / European Equity Markets tumble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A worldwide fall-off in bond markets prompted a tumble in European equity
markets yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 index, which covers the UK's most highly valued companies,
fell 42.7, or 1.25 per cent, to 3,382.6. By the end of after-hours trading,
UK stocks were 27 points below their Friday close, indicating more pressure
on the market on Monday.
However, senior market-makers stressed that the volume of business was lower
than it had been in recent weeks and there was very little panic-selling.
The German market lost most of the gains it had chalked up following a rate
cut on Thursday and the French CAC 40 index ended off 29.40 at 2,251.78.

FT  19 FEB 94 / UK and China join ban on dumping nuclear waste at sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK and China surprised environment groups yesterday by joining an
international ban on the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.
Their decision leaves Russia as the only country to continue dumping among
the 72 signatories to the London Convention, a worldwide treaty on sea
pollution.
Britain, China and Russia were among countries that abstained when a
majority of the signatories voted for the dumping ban last November. The
decision by the UK and China to join comes just two days before the deadline
for registering opposition to the ban.
Ms Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, told parliament that the UK
'recognises that the weight of international opinion on this matter means
that dumping is not . . . a practical proposition'.
However, she added: 'Scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea under
controlled conditions causes no harm to the marine environment and poses no
threat to human health.'
The ban covers low and intermediate level radioactive waste, but the
convention also gradually phases out industrial dumping and incineration at
sea.
There has been little dumping in recent years. The main target of the ban is
the waste likely to arise when nuclear submarines and reactors are
decommissioned in coming decades.
Ms Mary Morrison of Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said: 'The
UK's action was a great surprise - but it now has a big problem dealing with
this bulky waste on land.'
Plans by Nirex, the UK nuclear industry's waste disposal company, to build
an underground nuclear waste store, have been repeatedly delayed.
Mr Bruce Alderman of Nirex said yesterday his company's proposals remained
flexible. 'We have always planned to take Ministry of Defence waste. But we
have not reckoned on large submarines - the MoD would have to cut them up
into small pieces for them to be acceptable to us.'
Mr Yang Wenhe, deputy director of the Chinese State Bureau of Oceanography,
said in Beijing that China would stop dumping from this weekend. He told the
official Xinhua news agency: 'Disposing of wastes without licence or dumping
irresponsibly at sea will be punished severely according to the law.'
The ban will be reviewed in 25 years, although scientists will continue to
re-examine the safety of dumping. The UK said it would reopen negotiations
if opinion changed in favour of dumping. Britain, which has not dumped
radioactive waste at sea since 1983, has already accepted a ban on dumping
until 2008 under a separate treaty covering the north east Atlantic.
Belgium and France, which also abstained from voting on the ban in November,
have accepted it in recent weeks.
Mr Manfred Nauke, the London Convention's secretary, said Russia had
announced yesterday that it would not accept the ban. Russia said it needed
to continue sea dumping until at least 1996.

FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: HTV bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, and JOEL KIBAZO.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multi-media optimism boosted several television and publishing stocks after
Flextech, the unlisted media investment concern, announced that it was
putting Pounds 27m into HTV, the Welsh television group.
Flextech highlighted its desire to expand into cable and satellite
broadcasting and the news prompted investors to focus on Yorkshire Tyne Tees
TV, which has a strong production record, and Pearson, owners of the Thames
Television production company and library. Flextech rose 8 to 444p, HTV 27
to 152p, YTT 10 to 346p and Pearson 20 to 720p.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson impressed the market with a 148 per cent jump
in profits to Pounds 111.7m. But investors were concerned that the rise owed
much to the surge in the stock market and might not be sustainable. The
shares fell 20 to 632p.
Securities house Smith New Court fell sharply after it was disclosed that a
Pounds 10.7m award against Citibank for fraudulent misrepresentation in the
sale of Ferranti shares had been cut by the court of appeal to Pounds 1.1m.
The shares recovered to close 2 off at 466p. Smith said it would appeal the
hearing.
Far Eastern bank HSBC advanced 27 to 1019p after the Hong Kong stock market
rebounded 1.4 per cent.
The prospect of a 10 per cent rise in European glass prices helped to lift
Pilkington by 5 to 201p. Turnover was a larger than usual 12m shares. The
company confirmed the price increases yesterday, which are likely to equate
to 6 per cent in the UK. Saint-Gobain, the French glass producer, has also
recently announced price rises as both companies attempt to offset weak
European demand.
However, building analysts doubted whether the two leading glass producers
could make the price rises stick. Sluggish building and car markets,
particularly in Germany and France, are likely to undermine the latest
moves. There is also overcapacity in the industry, which is thought likely
to continue to depress prices.
A good trading statement from Alfred McAlpine and figures at the top end of
market forecasts saw the shares climb 30 to 329p. The news helped other
construction groups. Higgs &amp; Hill put on 4 1/2 at 139p, John Mowlem 4 at
189p and Westbury 7 at 222p.
Nervous textiles analysts were concerned over the delay in the sale of
Hartstone's French hosiery business to Courtaulds Textiles, which was to
have taken place yesterday. One of Hartstone's factories collapsed under the
weight of heavy snow and the deal was postponed until the damage could be
assessed.
Sector experts say the Pounds 45.4m deal is good for Courtaulds Textiles (up
a penny at 270p) but vital for Hartstone, which dipped 3 to 75p. Hartstone
breached banking covenants last summer and has since narrowly escaped
receivership.
Fisons was a penny down at 132p. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit
rating agency, lowered its rating on the pharmaceutical group's commercial
paper, arguing that 'the potential for sustained, meaningful improvement in
free cash flow appears limited'.
Jitters before next week's full-year results saw British Aerospace
relinquish 4 to 527p. Dealers also suggested that the stock was still
reeling from Wednesday's news that Airbus Industrie, in which it has a 20
per cent stake, had lost out to its US rivals on a lucrative Dollars 6bn
Saudi Arabian aircraft order.
Turnover in BBA Group rose to a hefty 8.4m, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said
to have been the day's big player, attracting both the buyers and the
sellers. The shares gained 4 at 224p. Firm aluminium prices boosted metals
group Johnson Matthey, 3 higher at 595p.
GKN firmed 2 to 562p as it posted its offer document for its bid target
Westland Group, a penny lighter at 332p. GKN once again stated it was making
a fair offer for Westland.
Conglomerate Lonrho eased 3 1/2 to 160 1/2 p after the company confirmed
market speculation that it was to issue a Pounds 64.5m convertible bond to
mature in the year 2004.
Dealers reported several crosses in McKechnie, where a line of stock had
been on offer early in the day. The shares were eventually 5 1/2 ahead at
527 1/2 p.
General investment buying helped Vosper Thornycroft advance 15 to 772p.
Charterhouse Tilney continues to favour the stock.
In transports, Associated British Ports gained strength, finishing 6 ahead
at 622p, after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation.
In Shops agreed terms from Birkby in a deal valuing the retail space letting
group at Pounds 58m and each In Shops share at 110p. The offer is being made
on the basis of five new Birkby shares for every 12 In Shops shares. In
Shops shot forward on the news, closing 30 stronger at 113p. Birkby finished
13 up at 278p.
New arrival Clinical Computer started trading at a healthy premium to its
124p issue price. The shares opened at 150p and closed at 173p, with a new
issue investment fund said to be an active buyer.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Sterling convertible for Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the international conglomerate, yesterday ended its four-year
absence from the Eurobond market with a widely expected convertible bond
offering, the first in the sterling sector this year.
Demand was such that Lonrho was able to increase the 10-year offering from
Pounds 60m to Pounds 64.5m, achieve a coupon of 6 per cent, at the low end
of the indicated range of 6 to 6 1/4 per cent, and a conversion premium of
20.25 per cent, above the indicated range of 16 to 20 per cent. Lonrho
shares eased from 164p to 160 1/2 p.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose from an issue price of par to
103 as investors sought to top up their allocations. Dealers said that the
bonds, which offered a 3 per cent premium over the yield on Lonrho's
ordinary shares, represented good value to investors who still regarded
Lonrho as a recovery stock.
However, they noted that Lonrho had opted for a shorter maturity - most of
the sterling convertible offerings in the past year have carried maturities
of 15 years - and a call option after three years rather than the usual five
years.
An official at lead manager CS First Boston said the issue was a critical
step for the company since it was seeking to re-launch its newly-improved
credit perception with investors in both the bond and equity markets.
Lonrho said the proceeds would be kept in fixed-rate sterling and would be
used for general corporate purposes.
BNP, the French bank, added to the supply of bank paper in the Eurosterling
sector when it raised Pounds 200m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers said the the wider yield spread of 32 basis
points over UK government bonds helped BNP's bonds to compare favourably
with the other recent issues.
Elsewhere, Dresdner Bank got its timing right by issuing a DM1bn offering of
10-year Eurobonds shortly before the Bundesbank surprised the market by
cutting the discount rate. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose
from their fixed re-offer price of 99.50 to 99.80.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the Baa1 ratings on
the foreign currency debt of the Bank of Greece under review for a possible
downgrade, citing the continued deterioration of the country's fiscal
balances and the rapidly growing debt burden. Around Dollars 10bn worth of
debt is affected.
Until the start of this year, the Bank of Greece acted as the issuer on
behalf of the Hellenic Republic. Moody's action did not come as a surprise
to syndicate managers, who had been expecting the news since November last
year.

Kleinwort Benson yesterday confirmed high expectations for UK investment
banks by disclosing that its 1993 pre-tax profits more than doubled to
Pounds 111.7m (Dollars 168m), compared with Pounds 45.1m the previous year.
Kleinwort's 2,770 employees gained heavily from the strong trading
conditions in financial markets, and a rise in underwriting and advisory
work.
After excluding a Pounds 9.2m profit from selling Sharps Pixley, its bullion
and metals business, earnings per share rose to 56.4p, compared with 26p,
and the pre-tax return on equity rose to 26 per cent, compared with 11 per
cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpectedly strong performance in the fourth quarter helped cushion a
decline in full-year results at Oce-van der Grinten, the Dutch office
equipment maker.
Net profit, which had fallen by 42 per cent in the first three quarters,
rose 25.6 per cent in the final quarter ended November 30. This limited the
fall in full-year net profit to Fl 62.2m (Dollars 32.2m), a decline of 28.9
per cent compared with 1992/93.
Oce, the first large Dutch company to report final figures for 1993, plans
an unchanged dividend of Fl 2.25 in spite of the drop in profit.
Sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter but fell by 4 per cent to Fl
2.63bn in 1993/94. Sales in North America rose particularly strongly,
accounting for 19 per cent of total sales compared with 17 per cent the year
before.
The sharp improvement in the fourth quarter exceeded analysts' expectations,
and Oce's shares gained more than 3 per cent to close up Fl 2.40 at Fl
76.00. Mr Harry Pennings, chairman, predicted a further improvement in
1994/95. Oce is a producer of copiers and printers as well as of plotters
for engineering systems.
The fourth-quarter recovery was due not so much to improved economic
conditions as to the launch of new products, internal restructuring and the
pruning of jobs, Mr Penning said. Another factor was currency stability in
the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
Bank Slaski, one of Poland's biggest banks, yesterday had its stockbroking
licence revoked by the Securities Commission following charges that the bank
had mismanaged its own privatisation.
The Commission said the bank, also one of Poland's largest brokers, had
penalised virtually all of the 800,000 new shareholders because it had not
delayed the listing until shareholders had been able to register their
shares.
The Securities Commission also asked the State Prosecutors Office to
initiate proceeding against the Bank Slaski board.
The bank has been given six months to wind down its operation and the
Commission has asked Poland's 37 remaining brokers, who are already
struggling to service their existing clients, to take over the Slaski
accounts. ING, the Dutch bank, bought a 25.9 per cent share of the Bank
Slaski as part of the privatisation.
The shares, first quoted on January 25, immediately rose to 13.5 times their
public offer price of Zl 500,000 (Dollars 23) but most shareholders were
unable to trade until they had registered their shares, a process which had
been held up by a shortage of brokers.
Registration normally takes two weeks but in some cases it has still not
been completed.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Tampella swings back to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, has announced its first profit
since 1989 after benefiting from extensive restructuring, productivity
gains, and the weak markka.
Profits after financial items for 1993 totalled FM11m (Dollars 2m), a FM560m
swing from a year earlier loss of FM549m. The recovery was particularly
marked in the final four months when the company achieved a FM76m profit.
Net sales fell to FM4.08bn from FM6.54bn. This followed last May's sale of
forest and packaging operations to Enso-Gutzeit, one of the key elements in
a restructuring programme which has focused the company on mining and power
operations.
Tamrock, the group's mining unit, rebounded to a FM79m profit from a FM15m
loss, despite depressed markets. But Tampella Power had a more difficult
year, due to a heavily loss-making US unit. It swung to a FM43m loss after
financial items from a FM34m profit in 1992.
Tampella said markets in its main business areas were still 'strained,' but
added that signs of recovery were increasing.
The group was acquired by the Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, as
part of a broader rescue of Skopbank in 1991.
Last year the bank cut its holding in the group from 88 per cent to 23.6 per
cent through share sales to domestic and international investors.

<TEXT>
The Ciampi government has moved to prevent the void from growing at the helm
of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Italy's biggest state-controlled commercial
bank, by naming as the new chairman Mr Mario Sarcinelli, an EBRD
vice-president.
Mr Sarcinelli will be replacing Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, who temporarily
suspended himself on February 7. Mr Cantoni was forced to step down
following the disclosure of a Bank of Italy inspection that revealed a
potential conflict of interest between his approving BNL loans that
allegedly benefited one of his family owned businesses. However, Mr Cantoni
is still refusing to formally resign.
Mr Sarcinelli's departure came as a surprise at the EBRD, where he is the
number three in the organisation. His colleagues on the executive committee
were not told until 6pm last night, after the Italian government had
released the news in Italy about his appointment.
The bank's operations were restructured at the end of last year and Mr
Sarcinelli took charge of the new southern division, making investments and
developing infrastructure in the more backward countries in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Militant Romanian coal miners yesterday postponed a planned raid on the
capital like the ones that in the past toppled a prime minister and crushed
a protest movement, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
Some 2,000 striking miners clad in overalls and armed with clubs had rallied
outside the offices of the Tirgu Jiu lignite company in the western Jiu
Valley ready to head for Bucharest, about 250km to the east.
But they decided on a delay after the minority left-wing government, facing
a deepening labour crisis, stood firm and said it would punish militant
union leader Miron Cosma if the march went ahead.
The miners decided to wait while their leaders went to Bucharest for fresh
talks today on their demands for bonuses and resignations of some officials.
'The miners postponed their raid on Bucharest. . . They said they would send
union leaders to Bucharest to negotiate with the government on Friday,'
local journalist Nicolae Brinzan told Reuters.
In 1990 miners led by Mr Cosma answered a call by President Ion Iliescu to
crush a protest movement and in September 1991 the miners toppled reformist
Prime Minister Petre Roman. At least nine people were killed in the two
expeditions.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (11): Worldwide chill reaches
eastern parts - Kieran Cooke looks at the performance and prospects of the
region's airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First, the good news. The Asia Pacific region continues to be the world's
fastest expanding market both for aircraft passengers and for aircraft
sales.
The International Air Transport Association predicts that passenger numbers
in the region will double between now and 2000. By then, the Asia Pacific
will account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic. By 2010
that figure will be more than 50 per cent.
In south-east Asia, passenger traffic is growing by about 8 per cent a year
 -compared with under 4 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America.
On the sales side, Boeing predicts that at present rates of regional
expansion, the Asia Pacific will surpass the US as the largest market for
aircraft deliveries by early next century. Boeing says that of a total of
12,000 commercial aircraft needed over the next 18 years to accommodate
growth and replace older aircraft, more than 30 per cent - valued at Dollars
245bn - will be delivered to airlines in the Asia Pacific.
But behind all the rosy growth statistics is another story. While many
regional carriers continue to outperform their counterparts in Europe and
the US, 1993 was the year when the Asia Pacific was belatedly caught up in
the chill of the worldwide industry recession.
Profits sagged or disappeared: Cathay Pacific reported a 46 per cent fall in
interim earnings last year. Malaysia Airlines' interim profit last year fell
by 96 per cent, even though turnover rose by 4 per cent. Singapore Airlines
(SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, reported
halfway profits last year down 15 per cent though, again, turnover had gone
up by more than 10 per cent.
All three carriers blamed recession in many markets and intense competition,
plus adverse currency factors, for the profits slump. 'Considering the
performance of the competition, we did not do too badly,' says Mr Cheong
Choong Kong, SIA's managing director.
Many regional carriers have been forced to cut back or reschedule aircraft
deliveries. Thai Airways, Philippine Airlines, Garuda and Malaysia Airlines
have all deferred or cancelled aircraft deliveries.
Increased competition from carriers outside the region has hurt many
regional airlines. Faced with tough conditions at home, carriers from the US
and to a lesser extent from Europe have zeroed in on the lucrative Asia
market. Asia's bigger carriers have also been hurt by competition from the
region's new airlines, such as Eva in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea.
The region's big carriers have responded by unveiling frequent flyer
programmes and improving levels of service. Passengers who have long
complained that Asia has some of the most expensive air routes in the world
are relieved to find carriers undercutting ticket costs.
The region's carriers face other problems. Airport facilities in the Asia
Pacific have not kept pace with the massive growth in passenger traffic. On
some routes, passengers spend as much time getting to and from the airport
as in the air.
Several countries are now either expanding existing airport facilities, or
building entirely new complexes. Airports are either being expanded or built
at Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and at Seoul in South Korea. Hong Kong still
hopes to have its new airport open by 1997. In Malaysia, work has started on
a new airport outside Kuala Lumpur. In Thailand the existing Bangkok
facility has been expanded and a new airport is being planned.
But in the meantime, more congestion - and more frustration among passengers
 -is likely. Iata says only two of the main air traffic 'hubs' in the region
 -Taipei and Singapore - now have the facilities to cope with expected
passenger growth.
Other obstacles lay in the path of the region's expansion. There is an
urgent need for Asia Pacific governments to standardise aerospace
regulations and co-ordinate traffic control systems.
And from the point of view of the region's carriers there is a constant need
to seek cost-cutting measures. As the region's economies grow and people
become more affluent, wages rise and cost advantages vis-a-vis carriers in
the US and Europe will start to be eroded. Some carriers such as Cathay and
SIA are further hit by rapidly escalating land costs.
These two airlines have recently responded to the problems by moving some
back office operations to more low cost centres overseas - Cathay to China
and SIA to India.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (12): The high tech way ahead -
Indonesia - Paul Betts and Kieran Cooke look at the region's only aircraft
manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia, at present the only manufacturer of aircraft in south-east Asia,
is multiplying its efforts to secure partnerships and collaboration with
western aerospace groups to develop its growing indigenous aircraft
industry.
Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN), at its giant complex in Bandung
on the island of Java, already produces the CN235 transport aircraft in
co-operation with Casa of Spain. It is also a licensed assembler of a wide
range of helicopters and is involved in several manufacturing programmes
with western companies, mainly associated with offset deals on sales of
commercial and military aircraft to Indonesia.
The most recent example of the country's aerospace ambitions was an
agreement signed at the end of last year with British Aerospace to
co-operate in the development and manufacture of regional turboprop
aircraft. At the same time, BAe is also considering establishing an assembly
facility in Indonesia for Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft if Indonesia were to
buy more Hawks. Last summer Indonesia ordered Pounds 500m worth of Hawks,
becoming BAe's second biggest overseas military export market after Saudi
Arabia.
The aircraft co-operation deal with BAe coincided with an agreement between
Rover, the BAe subsidiary recently sold to BMW, and Indonesia to develop a
national car project to design, develop and manufacture a small car for
production in Indonesia.
Co-operation between Indonesia and the UK group could also eventually extend
to the regional jet business. BAe has so far failed to negotiate a regional
jet joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace and has been looking for possible
alternative partners for these activities, including IPTN, although the main
thrust of aerospace co-operation with Indonesia is currently focused on
turboprops.
To some, IPTN is a considerable achievement, an example of Indonesia's
determination to leapfrog its way into the field of high technology and
become a fully industrialised country. But IPTN also has its critics, who
say it is a expensive enterprise which does little to promote overall
development.
Mr Bachariddin Habibie, founder of IPTN and Indonesia's minister of research
and technology, has no doubts. 'We have to be in a position to master,
understand, develop and control all the technologies in aerospace . . . this
is only possible if the man who plans it knows exactly what he wants. I am a
man who knows exactly what he wants.'
IPTN was established in 1976. In 1983 the first CN235 was rolled out of the
Bandung plant. Since 1989 IPTN has been planning the larger CN250, which
will be the first commercial aircraft to be designed and built entirely in
Indonesia.
At first, the CN250 was to be a 50-seater aircraft. In the middle of last
year Mr Habibie announced IPTN would go straight into production of a
stretched 70-seat version of the aircraft. The first CN250 is due to be
rolled out of the Bandung plant later this year with deliveries, mainly to
Indonesian internal airlines, starting in early 1997.
The ultimate aim, says Mr Habibie, is to produce a range of commuter
aircraft ranging from 20-seaters to 130-seaters and make IPTN into 'the
Toyota of aerospace'.
IPTN plans to spend Dollars 250m to expand the Bandung complex to cope with
nearly 170 commitments and options it has received for the CN250.
Mr Habibie's critics say that despite the many millions of dollars spent on
building up IPTN, very few linkages have been made between its high tech
work and the rest of the Indonesian manufacturing sector. There is also
concern about the lack of transparency in IPTN's accounts.
However, Mr Habibie says that within Indonesia alone there will be a
substantial market for IPTN's aircraft over the coming years. With revenues
from oil and gas exports falling, Mr Habibie says the only way Indonesia can
maintain a trade surplus is to develop technological manufacturing
capability.
'If my country concentrates on low tech products and imports high tech
products we will face a problem,' he says.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (9): Growth that must be measured
 -Michael Donne on the need for a region-wide air traffic development plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air traffic to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region is expected to
double from its present level to reach nearly 200m passengers a year by the
end of this decade, and double again to nearly 400m by 2010, representing
average annual growth of around 8.5 per cent, against the expected figure of
some 5.9 per cent for the rest of the world.
As a result, pressures for big improvements in aviation infrastructure -
airports (including runways, terminals and access), local air traffic
control, en route long-range navigation aids, and improved voice and data
communications between air and ground - are already intensifying.
The International Air Transport Association has warned that failure to
provide adequate infrastructure could have a detrimental effect on the
entire region's economic and social development which is largely dependent
on flourishing air transport and tourist industries.
The anticipated growth will mean not only more passengers moving through
airports, with all that entails for more and larger facilities, and improved
surface access, but also a big rise in the number of aircraft movements both
on the ground and along the air routes as flight frequencies increase, even
allowing for the use of bigger aircraft with increased seating densities.
While the growth in passenger traffic and aircraft numbers inexorably
continues, Iata is consistently targeting governments throughout the region
to ensure that they are fully aware of the problems ahead.
The increase in individual airlines' fleet sizes will be enormous. Forecasts
by the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, the world's biggest builder of
jets, show that up to 2010, out of a world total requirement of some 12,000
new jetliners, worth about Dollars 815bn - of which 75 per cent will be
needed for growth and 25 per cent to replace ageing or environmentally
unacceptable aircraft - more than 3,000 aircraft, worth about Dollars 245bn,
will be needed in the broad Asia-Pacific region, which will constitute about
half the world's jetliner market outside the US itself.
Boeing says: 'Asia's robust air travel market is driven by - and in turn
drives - the region's economy. In 1992, Asia generated about a quarter of
the world's gross domestic product. That will increase to nearly 30 per cent
by 2010. Over the past two decades, economic growth in Asia has more than
doubled, averaging 5.2 per cent a year, compared with a 3 per cent growth
rate for the rest of the world.'
Excluding the US, the rest of the world's top 10 airliner-buying countries
in the period to 2010 will include five Asian nations, with the others being
Canada and in western Europe, according to Boeing.
Japan is expected to buy more than 600 jet airliners, worth about Dollars
60bn (in 1993 dollars), to meet an annual traffic growth rate of 9.2 per
cent. China should also be on the acquisition path for some 800 aircraft
worth Dollars 40bn, to meet a 14.7 per cent growth rate. Other big buyers
will be South Korea (Dollars 22bn), Australia (Dollars 19bn) and Singapore
(Dollars 18bn). Traffic growth rates in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
will also be high, indicating substantial fleet requirements.
Because of the long distances involved in air links between many countries
in the region, and with the rest of the world, much of the present ordering
is concentrated on the new generation of wide-bodied medium and long-range
jetliners.
About half of the Boeing 747 long-range jets ordered outside the UK to date
is accounted for by Asian airlines, while such airlines are also prominent
in the order books for the new Airbus A-330 medium-range jet and the
long-range A-340.
Coping with the growth on the ground is already a headache. Iata points out
that Bombay, Seoul and Tokyo-Narita airports, for example, have severe
passenger handling problems, while Bangkok, Hong Kong, Sydney, Osaka and
Narita suffer from runway and apron constraints.
Construction and expansion are planned or under way at all these locations -
the new Kansai airport on an artificial island in Osaka Bay, the new Chek
Lap Kok at Lantau island in Hong Kong, and for Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, for
example, with new airports on the way for Bangkok, Bombay and Seoul, and new
runways and terminals planned for Narita and Sydney. But Iata has warned
that because of intervening traffic growth, some of these new facilities are
likely to be congested almost as soon as they are operational.
At the same time, there will be significant increases in local traffic
within the region as many countries expand their aviation activities - many
new local airports are already under construction or being planned in China,
for example, where its fleet will be dominated by short-to-medium range
jets.
These developments in turn are already generating the need for the
introduction throughout the region of new, up-to-date systems of air traffic
control in congested air spaces around big airports, as well as for the
latest satellite-based Fans (future air navigation systems).
The latter in various forms are now in an advanced stage of development by
the world commercial aviation community for both local air traffic control
and long-range air navigation. The International Civil Aviation Organisation
 -the aviation technical agency of the UN, Iata itself, Inmarsat (the
international satellite organisation), national governments, civil aviation
authorities, airlines, the avionics industry and national telecommunications
authorities are involved in a concerted operation to perfect the technical
and regulatory aspects of such satellite-based systems.
The introduction of such systems is inevitable - successful trials have
already been conducted - and the overall concept has been described as a
revolution in civil aviation as far-reaching as the original introduction of
the jet engine.
But Iata also stresses that all the new, expanded and improved facilities -
airports, air traffic control and air navigation - must be introduced in a
coherent and orderly fashion.
'Unless multinational planning becomes a feature of the Asia-Pacific region,
then aviation growth and wealth creation will be restricted while congestion
and delays will grow to at least European proportions,' says Iata.
Mr John Meredith, its senior director of corporate communications, who has
been running the international air transport action group aimed at achieving
global improvements in aviation infrastructure facilities, believes that the
best way of achieving this coherent approach is through the medium of a
major conference of all the Asia-Pacific transport ministers.
Until a region-wide aviation development plan is conceived, infrastructural
expansion throughout the Asia-Pacific will continue to be piecemeal, patchy
and possibly even inadequate to meet the expected growth in air traffic over
the next century.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (10): Keeping ahead of the game -
Kieran Cooke considers the challenges that Singapore faces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's aerospace sector is facing challenges familiar to most sections
of the island republic's industry. The aerospace sector has built up
expertise in a number of areas and now serves as one of the key aircraft
overhaul and maintenance centres in the Asia Pacific region.
But surrounding countries are constantly nibbling away at Singapore's
competitiveness: Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are rapidly expanding
their own aerospace industries. Those countries pay wages that are
substantially lower than those in Singapore.
Singapore's answer is to become increasingly specialised - and make its
aerospace industry ever more efficient.
The industry grew out of the island republic's policy of aiming for greater
self-sufficiency in the military sector. In the mid-1970s it was solely
concerned with the maintenance and repair of military aircraft.
Defence-related work still forms an important part of the industry.
Over the years, international aerospace and industry-related companies have
decided to set up facilities in Singapore. The island republic has become an
increasingly important hub for international airline traffic: within the
Asia Pacific region Singapore handles about 14 per cent of aircraft traffic
from Europe and nearly 8 per cent of that from North America.
Foreign companies have also been attracted by the facilities offered by
Changi airport, which is consistently rated as one of the best airports in
the world both for passenger and cargo traffic. More than 18m passengers and
nearly 700,000 tonnes of cargo pass through Changi every year. A second
terminal opened at the airport in 1989 and a third is due to be ready by the
turn of the century. A fourth terminal is in the initial planning stages.
Perhaps most importantly for the aerospace industry, Changi has more direct
city links within the Asia Pacific region than other airports. 'Having an
up-to-date facility like Changi, with the best regional links, means we can
get aircraft in and out fast,' says a Singapore-based aerospace executive.
'Singapore has overcome its land constraints and still has the edge over
other centres. But other countries are catching up fast.'
More than 50 companies are now involved in the aerospace industry in
Singapore. According to the government's Economic Development Board (EDB),
the aerospace sector grew by 6.2 per cent last year with a total output of
SDollars 1.25bn (Dollars 800m).
Mr Png Cheong Boon, the EDB's senior officer monitoring the aerospace
industry, says the outlook for this year is still uncertain owing to the
depressed state of the worldwide aerospace industry.
'However, the booming Asia-Pacific region will hold the key to future growth
in the world aerospace industry over the next few years,' says Mr Png.
More than 90 per cent of the island republic's aerospace industry is devoted
to repair and maintenance. As in many sectors of the Singapore economy, the
industry is dominated, in terms of output and employment, by
government-linked companies. The biggest company in the sector is Singapore
Aerospace which, with more than 3,000 employees, ranks as one of the main
players in aircraft maintenance in the Asia Pacific region.
Major work undertaken in Singapore ranges from complete 'nose jobs' on 747s
to maintenance of some US air force fighter engines. But the emphasis is
tending towards the more high-tech sectors of the industry. In 1992 the
industry attracted investments of SDollars 116m. According to the EDB,
industry investments rose 29 per cent to SDollars 150m last year.
Recent investments include a USDollars 30m landing gear repair and overhaul
facility by Dowty and an overhaul facility for flight and fuel control
systems by Lucas Aerospace. Meanwhile Turbine Overhaul Services, a joint
venture between state-controlled Singapore Technologies and United
Technologies/Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, has been expanding its facility for
upgrading aircraft jet engine turbine blades and vanes.
While manufacturing is only a small segment of Singapore's aerospace
industry, the island republic has scored some notable successes in winning
contracts to manufacture aircraft parts. For example, Airbus A320 cabin
doors are manufactured in Singapore, as are A340 engine mounts and Boeing
777 landing gear doors. But labour shortages and space constraints mean that
Singapore is unlikely to go into full-scale aircraft manufacturing.
While Singapore has plenty of trained engineers and technicians compared
with other countries in the region, job hopping is more prevalent as skilled
workers seek better wages and conditions.
Airline companies and manufacturers, seeking to cut costs in the midst of an
industry recession, are considering other regional sites where wages are
lower. As always, Singapore is trying to stay one step ahead of the game.
In time, the island republic's aerospace industry is likely to go regional
in order to take advantage of easier labour conditions and industry
opportunities overseas.
Late last year Singapore Engineering, the wholly-owned subsidiary of SIA,
said it would take a 10 per cent stake in a Dollars 63m aircraft maintenance
and repair facility being built in Xiamen in China. Wages in China are at
least two-thirds lower than in Singapore. And Singapore sees the venture as
an important opening into China's fast-expanding aircraft maintenance
industry.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (8): From high volume to to high value -
Richard Evans on the need for new investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ambitious strategy is under way to change Malta's image in order to
attract a different type of investment to the island.
Manufacturing has always been an important element in the Maltese economy
and accounts for over a quarter of national income, but there is a growing
need to change from traditional low cost, high volume products such as
textiles to high value technology. The process has started and initial
results are promising, but progress is inevitably slow.
With a small population of 350,000 and virtually no raw materials, Malta has
had problems competing with the expanding, low cost economies of south-east
Asia and north Africa on the one hand, and the developed world on the other.
Moreover, the Nationalist government of Dr Eddie Fenech Adami, which gained
power in 1987 after 16 years of Labour rule, inherited an economy dominated
by the state and a country regarded with suspicion in the west because of
its close political and commercial contacts with Libya, the Soviet Union,
China and North Korea.
The first priority was to improve the crumbling infrastructure. A big budget
deficit over the past few years has enabled the government to overhaul the
telecommunications network, build a smart new airport and a power station,
and construct desalination plants to combat the chronic shortage of water in
the summer.
The programme has been largely completed and the next stage of the
industrial strategy is now under way. The plan has two aspects: first, to
attract higher skill industries such as electronics, pharmaceuticals,
medical products and information technology to take the place of traditional
employers including textiles, furniture and footwear, and second, to help
the more traditional industries face up to an increasingly competitive
future, particularly if Malta succeeds in its aim of joining the European
Union.
There is already a competitive package of incentives in place involving a
10-year corporate tax holiday for export oriented companies, no municipal or
capital gains taxes, 3 per cent soft loan finance, ready-built factories at
subsidised rents and generous training grants.
The strategy has already had some success, as more than 200 foreign-owned
companies now operate in Malta, including a big investment by SGS-Thomson in
a Franco-Italian joint microelectronics venture employing 1,300, Seleco, the
Italian television manufacturers, Dowty, a subsidiary of the TI Group, De La
Rue, the security printers, and Baxter, the US medical equipment company.
But more foreign investment and know-how are needed to develop technical and
management skills in the island's workforce, which is becoming highly
trained with the expansion of university and other courses. A big advantage
is that Maltese wage costs are about a third of those in the UK and even
less compared with Germany and the US.
The task of marketing the island is the responsibility of the Malta
Development Corporation under its chairman, Professor Joe Bannister. He has
developed a network of representatives and consultants in key markets in
Europe and the US, whose job is to target potential investors and vet them
at an early stage so that scarce resources can be concentrated.
The current strategy is based on the gradual enhancement of the existing
technical skills base, encouraging the need for higher technology, increased
added value and high quality manufactured products.
An important development which is beginning to show signs of success after a
slow start is Mosta Technopark, a recently built complex a few miles from
Valletta. Four companies are already operating there, including
International Business Intelligence, a UK software company. A further 10
projects have been approved, and all 21 units are expected to be filled by
the end of the year.
Prof Bannister admits that the task of changing the country's industrial
structure has not been easy. 'It is a matter of changing attitudes and there
is a gap in the island's culture. People still expect companies to bring
machines in so that products can be manufactured immediately. But high tech
is not like that . . . it is inevitably a slow process but we are
succeeding.'
The new industries are particularly important to Malta as virtually all raw
materials for conventional manufacturing industries have to be imported with
the consequent drain on the balance of payments. In the case of information
technology and similar processes, the added value is a big bonus.
A scheme to build a fully fledged science park near the 400-year-old
university had to be shelved because of the recession in Europe, but plans
are now being dusted off to see if the project can go ahead.
The other aspect of the MDC's work, helping traditional industries, is about
to enter a new phase. Some industries are still protected by import levies
which would have to go should Malta enter the European Union, and early
action needs to be taken to avoid unemployment and cutbacks.
A series of meetings on an industry-by-industry basis is to start next month
with the food and beverage sector, followed by furniture manufacturing, to
discuss plans to meet the problems posed by the lifting of trade barriers.
All vulnerable sectors should have a strategy in place by the end of the
year.
Prof Bannister believes that stronger companies should be able to compete in
European markets, and others might be able to restructure with the help of
foreign partners or the introduction of new technology or new management.
'We are getting excellent co-operation from the Federation of Industry and
from Metco, the export trade corporation,' he says.
A further difficulty being tackled is the need for fresh sources of finance.
Banks in Malta are still state-controlled, although there are plans to
introduce a bigger private sector element. They are also conservative by
nature and are not geared to provide seedcorn or venture capital.
A new facility, the Malta Development Fund, was announced last month to pump
money into small and medium-sized local companies to help them expand and to
compete in Europe. It has been set up jointly by the MDC and Hambro European
Ventures and is aiming for a fund of USDollars 10m. Half the money has been
pledged by Mid-Med Bank of Malta and the rest is being sought locally.
Mr Jeremy Hand, assistant director of Hambro European Ventures, said at the
launch: 'We are confident we will be able to invest profitably in Maltese
industry. The workforce is educated, efficient and relatively cheap which
makes it an attractive area for manufacturing investment.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (7): Could 0.03% impose veto? - European
Union application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If membership of the European Union were solely a question of European
pedigree, then Malta would have few problems in joining.
Possessing some of the first significant traces of civilisation from
megalithic times and the Norman conquest, Malta has ample European
credentials, including the Knights of Malta's valiant defence against the
Turks and the islands' heroic role in the second world war.
But this is not enough to ensure an easy passage for Malta as a full member
of the EU. The Maltese application is caught up in circumstances largely
beyond the islands' - and the Nationalist government's - control.
Through the avis of last October, Brussels accepted Malta's 'indisputable
European calling', and talked of the need to send a 'positive signal' to
encourage the islands to meet the required criteria for an open market
economy. The avis envisages no real difficulty for the EU budget. Malta
would be a net beneficiary receiving some Ecu60-70m in structural funds and
paying in up to Ecu30m a year.
But the avis is cautious about timing. Some of Malta's long-standing allies
including Britain have warned that the application will depend on
institutional reform of the EU and the outcome of enlargement discussions
with Austria and the Nordic countries.
The application is likely to move slowly - even if negotiations begin this
year. The current Greek presidency of the EU will seek to push matters
forward because they see Malta's application linked to that of Cyprus (the
Greek side), and the Greeks are anxious that the latter's application should
prosper. Both pose similar problems as small islands with limited
populations, though in the case of Cyprus there is the complicating factor
of the Turkish presence.
The main difficulty that Malta must overcome is the resistance of EU members
to extending the current principle of the veto in voting to such small
entities. (Malta's GNP is 0.03 per cent of the EU). The Maltese claim a
concession on size has already been made in the case of tiny Luxembourg. But
of course the Maltese recognise its membership circumstances are different;
and the citing of Luxembourg is a form of short-hand for insisting that a
way can be found to admit them.
The Nationalist party has been consistently pro-European, in contrast to the
Labour party which was responsible for nailing Malta's colours to positive
neutrality and the non-aligned movement. Indeed, the amendments in 1987 to
the constitution enshrined Malta's neutrality and the policy of
non-alignment. Perversely, this occurred at a moment when the concept of
non-alignment was fast losing its rationale with the end of the cold war and
the collapse of super-power rivalry.
The present government is now willing to subscribe to the common foreign and
security policy of the EU. Nevertheless, this will not be easily done
without amending the constitution. This would require a three-quarters
majority in parliament. And if the constitution is not amended at least
notionally this would be incompatible with article five of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Malta's existing relations with the EU are governed by an association
agreement which came into force in 1971 as a result of a Nationalist party
initiative. However, the agreement was never more than partially
implemented, having been stalled by the 1971-87 period of Labour party
power. It was left to the Nationalists in 1990 to apply for full membership
against the backdrop of a Labour party less implacably opposed to a deal
with Brussels.
Given the hostility of the Labour party to integration with Europe, the
Nationalists had to start virtually from scratch to align economic policy
and trading practices. The degree of change required was underlined by the
avis: 'The reforms which imply Malta's adoption of the acquis communautaire
affect so many different areas (tax, finance, movement of capital, trade
protection, competition law, etc) and require so many changes in traditional
patterns of behaviour that what is effectively involved is a root-and-branch
overhaul of the entire regulatory and operational framework of the Maltese
economy.'
The avis then adds: 'These reforms are nevertheless indispensable, not only
to spare Malta a transition period that would be so drawn out as to be
tantamount to constituting 'special membership' of the Community; but above
all to enable its economy to take advantage of all the opportunities
provided by accession.'
On the fiscal side, draft legislation has been drawn up for the introduction
of value added tax in 1995. Until now governments have depended heavily on
duties on imported goods; and when customs duties and import levies are both
taken into account, the rates of protection are extremely high, on occasions
being 100 per cent.
The introduction of VAT and the gradual elimination of import levies will
encourage the transition to a fully liberalised market. The government is
pledged to do this, regardless of what happens to accession negotiations. As
part of developing a financial centre, the government is committed to
introduce financial and tax legislation that will be in harmony with the EU
this year.
More complex will be the position of Maltese industry which has enjoyed a
high degree of protection. The islands' electronics businesses stand to
benefit from an opening up of the EU market since their rationale is
export-oriented. But the small companies involved in such activities as
construction and furniture making, which account for 70 per cent of
industrial employment, hide behind stringent tariff and non-tariff barriers.
The sensitive shipbuilding/repairing sector, which provides almost 5 per
cent of total employment and a central part of Malta's historic calling in
the Mediterranean, is heavily subsidised. To meet competition rules,
shipbuilding would require substantial restructuring  - something which the
government has already initiated, but it is still at an early phase.
On the institutional side, the avis notes that Malta through the official
use of English would be able to avoid the introduction of another EU
language. This is clearly a plus. Against this, it highlights the limited
number of senior public officials with sufficient international experience
to 'play a full part in the decision-making processes of the Community
institutions'. (Malta's diplomatic corps mans some 15 embassies and
consulates worldwide).
Brussels' message to Malta is that these difficulties are not
insurmountable. Between now and the inter-governmental conference in 1996
when the issue of enlargement is to be addressed, substantive negotiations
are unlikely. Nevertheless, the Maltese can help their case by demonstrating
their determination to align themselves with the broad criteria for
accession.
This is being done, even in some of the less expected areas. The government
seems to have taken to heart criticisms in the avis directed against
'unsustainable bird hunting' practices. The authorities last month clamped
down on the Maltese habit of firing at anything and everything, including
rare birds of prey. This led to furious protests from the hunting community,
who have carried out a series of spray-can attacks on signposts and the
walls of public buildings.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (7): How Australia can soar -
Turnover is growing faster than that of manufacturing in general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospace is not an industry associated in large measure with Australia. Yet
scratch at the surface and, as one industry player puts it, 'there is rather
more than you might think'.
On the aircraft industry front, local revenues amounted to ADollars 1.2bn
(about Pounds 580m) in 1990, and the sector employed some 14,600 people.
Neither figure looks sizeable in the global context. Even in the Australian
setting, the sales figure compared with total manufacturing revenues of
ADollars 166bn in the same year.
But turnover in the Australian aircraft business did grow quite healthily
during the 1980s, with real sales advancing at an annual rate of around 4
per cent, according to a recent Bureau of Industry Economics study. This was
a significant notch above that of the manufacturing sector generally.
Whether that happy situation can persist in the face of the rapid growth in
aircraft manufacturing within the Asian region, and the loss of some
government assistance, is more debatable. Some commentators, including the
authors of the BIE report, see at least some temporary benefits to Australia
from the Asian surge, but warn that the competitive environment may not bode
well for the long term.
In reality, the aircraft sector in Australia breaks down into two parts.
First, there is manufacturing. The country houses a handful of medium-sized
companies which are involved in making aircraft components, systems and the
like for the big US and European producers. These businesses, in turn, are
supported by a raft of smaller local specialist suppliers.
Among the larger Australian component companies, two stand out. The first is
Hawker de Havilland is now owned by BTR Nylex, which in turn is part of the
British BTR group; the other is AeroSpace Technologies of Australia (Asta).
The latter business was born out of the former Government Aircraft
Factories, being constituted a government business enterprise in 1986. Asta
remains wholly-owned by the government, but is widely thought to be on its
privatisation list.
It is generally acknowledged that the existence of this modest component
manufacturing sector is the result of indirect government assistance. Until
1990, Australia's aircraft manufacturing sector benefited from the civil and
defence offsets programmes - which demanded that overseas suppliers of
aircraft place a certain amount of work with local manufacturers.
Four years ago, however, the civil offsets programme was halted for new
contracts and, although defence offsets continue to operate, there has been
some relaxation of their conditions. As a result, Australian manufacturers
are being forced into a more competitive stance. Where this will leave the
sector is unclear: the optimists suggest that, with sufficient emphasis on
research and development, the local producers may yet carve out niche roles;
the pessimists suggest that the future could be tough.
The second, and slightly larger, element to the local aircraft industry
centres on maintenance work, training, and the general provision of aircraft
services. Both HDH and Asta have a foot in this camp - in addition to their
manufacturing roles - and much of the work is centred around the two
domestic carriers (Qantas and Ansett) and the nation's defence forces.
Nevertheless, the general growth in the Asia-Pacific region has created some
new opportunities. Last year, for example, the Singapore air force located
its training facilities in Western Australia. This is expected to generate
around ADollars 23m-worth of infrastructure building - hangars, tarmac and
so on. Australian personnel are also due to replace the Singaporean
maintenance labour in the few years' time, creating valuable jobs.
Australia's space industry, meanwhile, is in a similarly equivocal position.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the nation played a fairly significant role in
the evolving space technology. Its Woomera Rocket Range, in South Australia,
became a base for UK and European launch activity, and Australia proudly
claimed to be the third nation to launch a satellite from its home
territory.
However, much of the financial support emanated from Europe, and when the UK
began to reduce its space effort and the European launch cap- ability moved
to French Guiana, the Australian role diminished.
Today, the country's space involvement is by no means extinct: the
Australian Space Office, for example, manages the Tidbinbilla Space Tracking
Station, outside Canberra, for Nasa. The notion of re-creating a local
launch industry - either at Woomera or in Cape York - has also circulated.
But the industry receives only minimal amounts of local funding, and there
has been much debate over what Australia's priorities in this field should
be.
An expert panel in 1992 suggested a pragmatic approach - targeting future
applications of satellite-based mobile communications, increased utilisation
of earth observation data and a continued focus on collecting such data, and
development of the supersonic compulsion Ramjet work led by Professor
Stalker but 'with a view to fostering international collaboration'.
More recently, the country formally established the Australian Space
Council, in an effort to bring a more consistent approach to space-related
work and prevent efforts being fragmented between universities, federal and
state governments, and the private sector. The first task of this body, only
formally legislated into existence earlier this month, will be to deliver a
five-year plan. The document is currently said to be in draft.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (6): Taiwan's dreams set to come
down to earth with a bump - Ambitious plans proved lofty talk

Distinguishing fact from fantasy has proven to be a dubious exercise when it
comes to Taiwan's ambitions to develop a domestic aerospace industry, as
several prospective foreign partners have discovered to their chagrin. But
following several years of lofty talk and the ignominious collapse of two
deals, the government appears to be charting a more pragmatic approach to
aerospace development.
As a key component of a broader strategy to propel Taiwan into the ranks of
the industrialised nations, the Nationalist government aimed to create a
comprehensive world-class aerospace industry virtually from scratch in a
matter of years - a feat which has long eluded neighbouring economic
powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea.
The plan was to leapfrog intermediate development stages, such as
manufacturing of parts, by using the promise of cash to entice international
aerospace companies to build entire aircraft in Taiwan, in the process
transferring technology and managerial know-how. Also on the agenda were
plans to design and build satellites. Now, those visions stand in disarray
and aerospace policy is under review.
Taiwan Aerospace Corp, set up in 1991 with 29 per cent of financing coming
from state coffers and the remainder from the private sector, was to be the
government's designated vehicle for launching a local aerospace industry.
But TAC, bedevilled by troubles ranging from internecine squabbles to
recalcitrant shareholders, as yet has not a single deal to its credit.
A USDollars 2bn plan to take a 40 per cent stake in the passenger jet
division of McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, dissolved in
failure in 1992. Then a 50-50 joint venture with British Aerospace to build
regional jets, with start-up costs of some USDollars 400m to be borne by the
Taiwan side, foundered last year amid financing difficulties and attacks
from Taiwanese lawmakers.
Both sides insist that the BAe deal remains on the table. 'We're still
negotiating with British Aerospace and we hope we can reach a bottom line
very soon,' says Mr George Liu, TAC's vice president. But observers gauge
the chances of success as remote.
It is unclear precisely what will emerge when the revamped aerospace
strategy is unveiled later this year. Mr Jack Tang, deputy director of the
cabinet-level Committee for Aviation and Space Industry Development, insists
that the original direction will not change. 'We are only going to insert
some new policies, and resolve some problems with the existing policy,' he
says, declining to elaborate.
It appears timely that planners will refocus efforts on the more plausible
and less capital-intensive strategy of developing Taiwan as a regional hub
for aircraft maintenance and parts manufacturing. The economics ministry's
industrial development bureau is conducting a feasibility study for the plan
which may be completed by the end of the year, according to Yin Chi-ming,
bureau director-general.
Early indications are that emphasis will shift from attempting to launch
from scratch a civilian aircraft manufacturing industry to building on
Taiwan's existing military aerospace capacity. In this vein, the economics
and defence ministries in January decided in principle to open the military
aircraft maintenance business to the private sector.
As the military's own facilities are insufficient to meet current aircraft
repair and maintenance needs, more sophisticated maintenance work must be
done overseas at great expense. Detailed regulations governing the
maintenance business are expected to be issued shortly in what is hoped will
prove a boon for local machinery, electronics and aerospace-related
manufacturers.
Taiwan's acquisitive military currently has nearly 1,000 jet fighters and
other types of aircraft, including the A-1 Ching-Kuo IDF (indigenous defence
fighter), developed locally with design assistance from Lockheed, the US
defence contractor. It has also contracted to buy 150 F-16 fighter jets from
Lockheed, which bought the fighter division from General Dynamics, and 60
Mirage 2000-5 jets from France's Dassault Aviation.
The economics ministry last month announced that Lockheed would invest
Dollars 610m to set up a regional base in Taiwan for parts production and
maintenance. The ministry has asked Lockheed to establish a facility for
comprehensive repairs of F-16s, involving technology transfer and personnel
training, in what would be the finest such centre outside the US.
In addition, Lockheed and Taiwan are jointly to produce a range of
technologically advanced aerospace items, according to the ministry. All
told, the centre is to generate annual returns of over Dollars 1bn in
maintenance services and Dollars 600m worth of products by the year 2000.
According to the bureau director-general, Saab of Sweden has also decided to
establish its Asia-Pacific aircraft maintenance centre in Taiwan. It will be
located in the central city of Taichung, where the government plans to build
a 100-hectare aerospace industrial park.
The government continues to seek overseas partners jointly to build complete
aircraft. Chiang Pin-kung, the economics minister, has said Taiwan is
pursuing a co-operative arrangement with Indonesia's government-run PT
Industrial Pesawat Tervang Nusantara to assemble medium-range passenger jets
with Spain's Casa.
Nevertheless, this was denied last month by the Indonesian side, while TAC's
Mr Liu said there was no firm plan for such an initiative. However, the
economics ministry has indicated that the TAC will no longer serve as the
government's vehicle in aerospace co-operation deals; instead, the defence
ministry's aerospace development centre will act in that capacity.
The government's aerospace industry development programme has been fraught
with personality conflicts and a political vendetta from the start. At the
moment it is unclear which government agency is spearheading the effort, or
the exact role played by each of the various entities involved.
Inter-departmental co-ordination appears to be ad hoc at best.
Taiwan's increasingly assertive opposition parties, ever suspicious of the
ruling party's motives, are prepared to oppose any deal cooked up in secret
by government officials requiring large sums of taxpayers' money. Such was
the fate of the McDonnell Douglas deal and the BAe venture.
Meanwhile, leading private industrial groups, which the government views as
pivotal to realising its aims, have been less than eager to fork out cash
for big-ticket endeavours which will not yield immediate returns. Thus, it
is likely that Taiwan's aerospace ambitions will be scaled back to more
modest and realistic proportions.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (8): Starting small, aiming high -
Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago Malaysia started its own car manufacturing industry. The
critics said the plan was too ambitious. Yet today the home-produced Proton
has a 70 per cent share of the domestic market and exports, particularly to
Britain, have expanded rapidly.
Now Malaysia, buoyed by the success of an economy which has grown at more
than 8 per cent in each of the past six years, is taking steps to develop
its own aerospace industry. The beginnings are modest - initially, Malaysia
plans to manufacture two small two-seaters and a 14-seater amphibious
aircraft. But Malaysia has big ambitions.
'These are undoubtedly small beginnings,' said Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister, in a speech opening Malaysia's inter- national
maritime and aerospace exhibition on the island of Langkawi in early
December.
'But then, the US entered the aerospace industry with the Kitty Hawk . . .
in a century's time we may have our Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
counterpart, God willing. A beginning has to be made and three small
aircraft make a good beginning, modest though they may be.'
The three aircraft will be produced in collaboration with foreign companies.
Last year, Malaysia took control of the Eagle Aircraft company of Australia,
which produces the Eagle X-TS two-seater. There are now plans to manufacture
it entirely in Malaysia.
The Swiss designed Datwyler MD3-160, also a two-seater, will be produced
under a joint venture with the Malaysian state-controlled company, SME
Aerospace. The third project - production of the Dornier Seastar amphibious
aircraft - is a joint venture between various Malaysian companies and
Dornier of Germany. Production of the Seastar is due to start at a factory
in Penang next year.
Malaysia already has a substantial aerospace maintenance and overhaul
industry. Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier, has rapidly developed the
facilities and expertise for high-grade services on a wide range of
aircraft.
Airod, formerly the Royal Malaysian Air Force aircraft repair and overhaul
depot, was partially privatised in the mid-1980s and, in a joint venture
with Lockheed of the US, now leads Malaysia's push into the aerospace
industry. From having one hangar in 1985, Airod now has five, including a
clear span wide body hangar that can accommodate two B747s at one time.
The bulk of Airod's business at present is concerned with the Lockheed C130
transport aircraft for which it has the main regional servicing contract.
Airod now wants to carry out more commercial work and has already won a
sizeable amount of servicing and maintenance work from regional and
international carriers.
But Airod's main focus is likely to stay on defence for some time to come.
In recent years Malaysia has been increasing its military spending. Last
year it placed orders for 18 MiG-29s from Russia and eight F/A-18Ds from
McDonnell Douglas of the US. Previous to that, it bought 28 Hawk jets from
British Aerospace.
All of these sales included substantial 'offset' agreements, guaranteeing
that part of the work involved in the manufacture and maintenance of the
fighter planes is undertaken in Malaysia.
Malaysia is not only keen to lower the costs of such aircraft through the
offset agreements. More importantly, it wants to learn the technology
involved. Malaysia's aerospace and high technology companies are now gearing
up to take advantage of the opportunities made available through the defence
purchases.
For example, Airod is expected to service and maintain the airframes and
engines of the MiG-29s, helped by a team of Russian technicians who will be
stationed in Malaysia.
Meanwhile Sapura, a diversified Malaysian conglomerate involved mainly in
the telecommunications industry, is likely to be trained to handle the
maintenance and overhauling of the MiG cockpit avionics.
The Malaysian government sees involvement in aerospace as a way to increase
the country's overall industrial capabilities, particularly in areas of high
technology. Recently, Dr Mahathir announced an all-out drive to promote the
industry and said a special aerospace industry park would be set up on the
island of Langkawi.
Mr Najib Tun Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, says Malaysia has
calculated what steps are necessary to attain a viable aerospace industry.
'We have to learn the basics first and not just follow blindly . . . we aim
to develop a viable and high technology aerospace industry to meet
Malaysia's needs and also be a part of the world aerospace sector,' says Mr
Najib.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (5): Tourism seeks more five-star winners -
The industry is trying to go upmarket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malta is becoming increasingly nervous about its success in attracting ever
greater numbers of tourists, particularly from the UK.
Though all tourists are welcome, fresh marketing tactics are being developed
and refined. While tourism is set to remain the island's predominant
industry, the authorities are keen to change Malta's cheap sun and sea image
and go more upmarket.
Two specific problems in the pattern of tourism are being addressed. The
first is the common phenomenon of the sharp tourist peak in July and August,
when the volume of visitors puts a great strain on services, and the second
is the continuing over-dependence on the UK for tourists. The latest
statistics show that the corrective campaigns are meeting with mixed
success.
Mr Michael Soler, chairman of Malta's national tourism organisation,
explains: 'Our focus has to change as we are going to reach our maximum
capacity soon. We will have to manage volume growth of tourists very
carefully.'
The figures tell the story. There was a slump in tourism in the early to mid
1980s, caused partly by high prices, variable quality and infrastructure
problems including water and electricity shortages, and partly by an adverse
political climate as the Labour government courted the Libyans and eastern
bloc in a determined attempt to stay neutral and non-aligned.
Costs were then pegged, infrastructure improvements launched, and a
differential exchange rate introduced for UK tour operators. Tourist numbers
rose steadily from 480,000 in 1984 to 746,000 in 1987, 828,000 in 1989 and
over 1m in 1992, three years ahead of target.
The upward trend continued last year despite difficult economic conditions
in most European markets, and the total reached 1,050,000, an all-time
record. But to the consternation of the authorities, arrivals in the peak
summer months were over 7 per cent up on the corresponding period of 1992.
It was not the trend they wanted.
A more even flow of visitors throughout the year would lessen the strain on
services at peak times and create more permanent year-round employment in
hotels and the tourist sector. Tourism, by far the largest industry, employs
one third of the workforce and accounts for 40 per cent of gross domestic
product.
The proposal, therefore, is to attract more visitors in the winter and in
the 'shoulder' months of spring and autumn, and at the same time to seek
tourists who will spend more per head than the package tour visitor staying
in a modest hotel or in self-catering accommodation.
'We need to give more attention to our heritage, history, architecture and
yachting facilities to cater for the better-off who will spend more in
Malta,' says Mr Soler. One senses a certain exasperation that the British
remain more reluctant than the Germans and Italians to move from the
sun-and-sea stage of recreational evolution.
The raw material for development is certainly there. The history and
archaeology of Malta and its sister island of Gozo are astonishingly varied
but largely undeveloped, probably because attention has been concentrated on
the sun and sea volume end of the market. There are open air neolithic
temples on Malta and Gozo, and the subterranean temple or hypogeum at Hal
Saflieni, which are reputed to be among the oldest architectural monuments
in existence.
From later centuries there are many relics left by a succession of
conquerors including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs and
Normans, leading in 1530 to one of the richest periods in Malta's history,
when Emperor Charles V gave the islands to the Knights of St John after they
had been driven out of Jerusalem and then Rhodes.
The Knights of Malta constructed a wealth of fortifications, churches and
palaces in their 268-year rule, including Valletta, one of the world's great
fortified harbours. It became Malta's capital under the Knights, replacing
the wonderful 'silent city' of Mdina built by the Arabs.
Apart from the attractions of history, other high-spending visitors are
being sought in off-peak months with special events including flower
festivals, historic pageants, music and jazz festivals, a boat show and
power boat racing.
The government has banned the building of new hotels except those in the
five-star category because of a surfeit of lower and middle range
accommodation, and a big new yacht marina is being constructed. There is
also a proposal to transform the run-down Manoel Island in the centre of
Valletta's Grand Harbour into a tourist complex featuring hotels,
restaurants, possibly another marina, upmarket shops and a theatre.
The tourism industry has proved remarkably resilient during the recession in
Malta's chief markets, and despite the pressures caused by the growing
numbers of peak season visitors, other aspects of the government's strategy
are making progress.
An example is the big emphasis on the UK market which in 1980 provided Malta
with over 75 per cent of its tourists. This dependence was considered to be
commercially unhealthy, and efforts have been made to attract visitors from
other countries, particularly Germany, Italy, France and Scandinavia. These
efforts have begun to work.
As the tourist market has expanded, the increase in the number of visitors
from the UK has failed to keep pace. As a result, the UK share has been
falling slowly but steadily for a number of years with the sole exception of
1992 when the Queen visted Malta to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime
siege. The downward trend should continue as the forward currency rate for
British tour operators is phased out next year.
Last year, the UK represented 49 per cent of arrivals compared with 52 per
cent in 1992, and arrivals from continental Europe rose sharply, including
off-peak months. German tourists increased by 8.5 per cent and now represent
16 per cent of all arrivals, second only to the British. Arrivals from Italy
increased by over 12 per cent and should grow quickly following the
inauguration of Air Malta flights to Milan.
The airline and the national tourist office are to open an office in New
York to tap the lucrative US market which could be attracted by the history,
climate and universal use of English. However, a big handicap is that there
is no direct flight to Malta. One proposal is to link up with a big US
airline which would fly tourists to Europe from where Air Malta would
complete the journey at preferential rates.
The best news of all for the authorities last year was that the tactic of
trying to attract more upmarket tourists appears to be succeeding after a
hesitant start. Per capita spending by visitors increased by a healthy 18
per cent, thanks partly to increasing success in the cruise and conferences
market, Nevertheless, package tours will continue to be Malta's tourist
staple for some time to come.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (6): All quiet (almost) on the political
front - Labour faces a hard task after a second defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overwhelming impression of politics in Malta used to be one of
confrontation, partisanship and often violence. But a remarkable
transformation has taken place in recent years. The tension has gone and
party allegiance does not now dominate every issue, however small.
The change began in 1987 when the Nationalist government of Dr Eddie Fenech
Adami gained power after 16 years of turbulent rule by the Labour party
under the charismatic, abrasive Mr Dom Mintoff and his successor, Dr Carmelo
Mifsud Bonnici.
Politics at that time was conducted with the fierce intensity of a family
feud, with villages, factories and football teams deeply split by party
loyalties.
The Labour era of the 1970s and early 1980s was characterised by a shift in
international allegiances. The country that had obtained independence from
Britain in 1964 became a republic a decade later. British forces were forced
to leave in 1979 after 180 years, and pacts were signed with Libya, the
former Soviet Union, China and North Korea.
On the domestic front, policy focused on state enterprise, wage freezes,
strict credit regulations and severe import restrictions. It was as tightly
controlled an economy as any outside the old Soviet bloc.
Under the Nationalist government, re-elected with an increased majority two
years ago, the focus has changed dramatically. A pro-west, pro-European
Union membership ticket has proved a vote winner. The economy has been
transformed by liberal trade policies and the introduction of a private
enterprise culture.
Dr Fenech Adami became Nationalist leader in 1977 when he took over as a
relative unknown from Dr George Borg Olivier, the former premier, with the
task of reviving the limp fortunes of a demoralised party trounced at the
polls twice in five years by Dom Mintoff.
The keynote of his strategy since gaining power has been to reform by
stealth, and this has sometimes laid him open to criticism of fudging and
blurring issues that need to be faced. But Dr Fenech Adami insists he has to
perform a difficult balancing act to change the country's culture, and that
to go too fast would be fatal. His softly-softly approach has also puzzled
many of his own supporters who were initially longing for the perks that
power in Malta traditionally brings.
It has not been an easy political path for Labour, either. After 16
turbulent years in office its image as an ideologically militant socialist
party has been hard to shake off. At the last election Dr Mifsud Bonnici
failed to reassure the increasingly important bloc of floating voters that
Labour would not again unleash the disruptive passions and violence of the
past.
Labour reacted to its second defeat by changing its leader and cutting
formal links with the trade unions. Dr Alfred Sant, 46, is a writer and
intellectual, with a master's degree in physics from Malta and a doctorate
in business administration from Harvard. He has also served as a diplomat in
Brussels.
He admits his task has not been an easy one. 'After two election defeats,
morale was bound to dip. We are having to fight back by reviewing all
aspects of policy,' says Dr Sant in an interview at the party's Senglea
headquarters outside Valletta. His attitude is essentially pragmatic.
There is an acceptance that the economy has moved forward under the
Nationalists, partly through deficit financing, the impressive growth in
tourism, and buoyancy in the construction industry, and there is an
admission that the liberalisation of imports has worked in the government's
favour.
'More jobs have been created in services, and we did not sufficiently
appreciate the impact on employment of opening up Malta to more trade,' Dr
Sant says. However, he questions how permanent the growth in service
industry jobs will be and expresses anxiety about the lack of greenfield
investments in manufacturing.
His main task is to improve the party's image, which he admits needs
refurbishing. 'We have deliberately not developed the previous
confrontational style, which we think would be politically
counter-productive, and we are now formulating policies that would accept
the need for competition but would provide mechanisms that would give the
individual more rights,' he says.
Dr Sant is regarded as an able, practical leader who will not resurrect the
old partisan strategies or scare off potential foreign investors and
tourists, but he has yet to unite all his party behind him. There is still a
considerable 'old guard' in the Labour hierarchy who pine for the former
days of autocratic power and widespread patronage, and there are signs of a
damaging split with the powerful General Workers' Union led by Mr Angelo
Fenech.
To Dr Sant's frustration and anger, the union has allowed Mr Lorry Sant, a
militant ex-Labour minister suspended from the party four years ago, access
to its newspaper's columns. The GWU's decision represents the most public
and serious disagreement between party and union since formal links between
the two were dissolved after the last election.
There are also tensions between the party and union, and between the union
and government, over the cost of living and low wage awards. A series of
union protest marches have been held, but it is not clear whether these
herald a return to more confrontational policies or are merely shadow-boxing
as a new tripartite accord between government, union and employers is
discussed.
An issue that is certain to divide the parties over the next few years is
entry to the European Union. This is the Nationalist government's core
strategy and all legislation is being drafted with membership in view.
However, Labour argues that full membership could harm the country's
industry and agriculture, and would lead to foreign ownership instead of
foreign investment. Labour advocates a free trade area with Europe and
maintenance of Malta's policy of political non-alignment.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (4): Politics snarls up the tarmac
 -Why Hong Kong's new airport plans are running aground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's plans to build Asia's biggest integrated transport network,
complete with showpiece airport and railway link, have run aground over
disagreements over how to foot the HKDollars 160bn bill. The levels of
borrowing have proved to be a bone of contention between the colony's
existing government and China, which will inherit both the airport and its
debts.
The latest offer from the Hong Kong government, approved by the executive
council on February 1, sees it increasing its equity contribution by
HKDollars 15bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to HKDollars 60bn. This offer, facilitated by
the government's healthy financial position, slashes the amount of debt
needed to fund the airport and railway elements of the project to around
HKDollars 23bn.
China, which may be obliged to make concessions of its own, has yet to
respond to the offer
This comes at the end of a fraught fortnight, with China declaring that
legal and financial obligations not approved by Beijing would be invalid
after 1997 and claiming breaches by Britain of the Memorandum of
Understanding on the project. This showdown was followed by Chinese
accusations - denied by London - of secret deals over the financing.
With Sino-British relations already at a low point, the airport is a sitting
target for attack. It is also a source of vulnerability for the colony,
whose dependence on tourism, trade and servicing China business makes a big,
efficient airport far more than just a matter of national pride.
The need for a new airport is underscored by the congested existing facility
at Kai Tak. With 24.2m passengers a year, it is the world's fourth (some say
third) busiest airport and still growing, at 10 per cent last year.
According to Mr Tony Norman, acting airport general manager, virtually every
facility is now at or very close to its design capacity limit. The runway is
now hosting the current permitted limit of around 28 movements an hour.
Mr Steve Miller, managing director of aviation consultancy Trinity Aviation,
says: 'There are delays on almost every flight now on the ground. When you
get on an aircraft, even though it is ready to go, at least two out of three
flights are delayed for 30 minutes or more because of congestion on the
ground manoeuvring and also in the air.
'That's going to get worse. There will be massive congestion in Kai Tak.'
While the diplomats are ferrying offers to and fro, brokering compromises,
the delays are expensive both for Hong Kong itself, whose trade-oriented
economy is dependent upon efficient cargo points, and for the airline
companies. Airlines are squeezed on both sides - inflation and spiralling
wage costs are putting the pressure on profit margins and room for expansion
is severely curtailed.
'Airline companies are having serious problems. Even in slow times in Hong
Kong you can expect to grow at around 5 per cent a year, but there's just
not that flexibility at present in Hong Kong,' says Mr Murray Bailey,
research director at Travel Business Analyst.
Mr Simon Heale, chief operating officer of Dragonair - a carrier co-owned by
Cathay Pacific, Swire Pacific and Beijing controlled Citic Pacific
specialising in Hong Kong-China routes - says short-haul operators are
especially hit as they are unable to utilise night hours for flying.
'As an airport, Kai Tak is run incredibly efficiently, but no doubt it is
reaching saturation and it's becoming increasingly difficult to schedule
operations so you can make use of incremental aircraft.
'Short-haul operators can run only during the day, so relatively speaking
need more take-off and landing slots. But now you cannot go at the times you
want - there are just slots at times like 8am, and it's a real problem. We
are obviously less efficient which has a cost penalty.'
The political stand-off has prompted the government to proceed on a
piecemeal basis: seeking approval for funds from legislators as the need
arises. Most recently legislators gave the nod to a HKDollars 1.29bn tranche
of funds for the next stage of construction and an additional HKDollars 377m
for day-to-day costs.
Chinese officials have repeatedly said that they do not want the post-1997
government to inherit a mountain of debt from the construction of the
airport. The latest financing packages proposed for the airport and railway
projects follow three others which failed to win China's blessing.
Political wrangling apart, Trinity Aviation's Mr Miller reckons the
government must shoulder a fair share of the blame for the outcome: a new
airport which has been put back several times and may now not see the light
of day until the next century, and a horrifically congested existing
facility.
'The government really has to carry the can for this. Chek Lap Kok would not
have been built by 1997, anyway. The new airport should have been started 12
to 15 years ago. It was a complete lack of foresight by the government and
messing around over a period of 15 years, when hundred of millions of
dollars were spent on consultancies to do studies,' he says.
Analysts believe the hold-ups could cost Hong Kong both passengers and
cargo, with Shenzhen and Macao - whose new airport is due to come on line
this year - being the winners. However, a host of practical issues,
including visas, access and administration, make the alternative of Shenzhen
in particular less feasible: albeit it is closer to Hong Kong than Narita is
to Tokyo.
Aircraft maintenance company Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering says the delay
has had the effect of curtailing its expansion - indirectly hitting its
business by keeping a ceiling on the number of flights coming in and going
out - but the impact is not that significant.
The government has so far awarded 36 contracts worth a total of around
Dollars 32bn. This represents over 78 per cent of the value of government
airport core project contracts.
Mr Heale says: 'If you look at the progress to date, most major contracts
have been let so far on time and most of those contracts are on schedule or
already ahead of schedule.
'So the key thing is the major contracts still to be let: the terminal
itself, the baggage systems which are fundamental to airports, the internal
train for moving people and the airport railway.
'My understanding is that it is still theoretically possible to let these
first three in the next few months and possibly to get them done by June 30
1997.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (5): Younger brother's wings
clipped - William Dawkins on another setback for Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's unrealised ambition of creating a world-class aerospace industry has
just hit another setback, yet Tokyo's industrial planners are pursuing their
target with undimmed enthusiasm.
As soon as Japan's chaotic politics return to normal, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry will ask parliamentary approval to suspend
what used to be its main attempt at getting civil airliner manufacturing off
the ground.
Miti's decision to freeze a state-funded joint development project for a
150-seater aircraft, code-named YXX and led by Boeing of the US, is a
telling illustration of why Japan has failed to fulfil its ambitions - set
down in a 25-year-old Miti policy document - of turning aerospace into a
pillar of the economy.
The combined turnover of Japan's aircraft industry reached Y893bn (Pounds
5.67bn) in 1991, at the latest count by the Society of Japanese Aerospace
Companies, which is slightly less than the country's motorcycle production.
Among the constraints are Japan's dependence on foreign aerospace
technology, its competitors' desire to keep Japan as no more than a valued
subcontractor in the overcrowded world market for civil airliners, and the
minuscule government financial support Japan has devoted to aerospace by
comparison with the US and Europe.
Boeing precipitated Japan's decision to freeze the YXX by deciding to
develop a cheaper alternative, so leaving Japan's three-company consortium,
the junior partner, incapable of carrying on independently. The consortium,
called the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC), which includes
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, has neither the technology, nor the marketing clout to go it
alone.
This is not the first time Japanese aerospace aspirations have been
frustrated by reliance on US technology. It recalls the late 1980s battle
over the joint development of the FSX fighter - due to come into production
for the Japanese air force in 1996 or 1997 - in which both sides haggled
over transferring technology which might have been useful for civil
aviation.
So Miti plans to withdraw its backing, from April, for the eight Japanese
engineers on the YXX project and to concentrate instead on a smaller,
Japanese-led civil airliner, to be made with foreign partners, hopefully
from the US, Asia and Europe. Code-named the YSX, this is planned to be a 70
to 80 seat short-range carrier, to come into service at the end of this
decade or early in the next one.
A small project like the YSX, suitable for sale to regional airlines in the
US and Asia, is Japan's only chance of taking a leading role in a commercial
aircraft, industry experts believe. Bigger ideas are beyond its reach. 'The
YSX will definitely be realised. It is the essence of our civil aircraft
policy from now on,' says a defiant Mr Toshifumi Hirai, director of Miti's
aircraft and ordnance division.
One possible snag is that the members of the JADC industrial consortium,
which has just finished a Miti-funded feasibility study into the YSX, are
believed to be less enthusiastic about the next phase than Miti's planners.
Miti wants the YSX to have a Japanese engine, but the companies are unsure
whether they can justify the heavy investment, given that Japan is estimated
by industry experts to be 20 years behind the US in engine technology.
Miti, however, has placed the highest priority on getting the YSX off the
ground. Japan does not want to overtake the US and Europe in aerospace, Mr
Hirai stresses. But it does want to earn a place among, or at least only
slightly behind, the leaders.
'We are in a marathon race and our objective is to be able to keep the backs
of the first two runners in sight, but not overtake them. Lately, they have
been running too fast for us,' says Mr Hirai.
Other constraints on the Japanese aerospace industry include the small size
of its domestic market, its heavy dependence on imports - where Japan
Airlines prides itself on being the largest private sector buyer of US
equipment of any kind - and its negligible exports.
Four-fifths of Japanese aerospace companies' annual sales go to the
military, a higher proportion and hence greater temptation to marketing
complacency than is the case with European and US competitors. Moreover, the
air force is small and defence exports are legally banned, features of
Japan's pacifist constitution.
All this has made it impossible for Japanese aerospace companies to build up
the costly international marketing and technical maintenance networks that
international airline customers require.
That is why Japan's only two post-war home grown civil aircraft, the YS-11,
a 64-seat twin propeller airliner, and the Asuka, short take-off and landing
aircraft were commercial flops. 'Technically, the YS-11 was excellent, but
foreign airlines just didn't have the confidence to buy it. The lesson for
Miti was: never go it alone,' says Mr Paul Rubin, secretariat of the US
Aviation Industry Association in Japan.
The YS-11, a Japanese design - with 80 per cent imported parts - started to
roll off the production lines in the early 1960s, but only 182 were sold.
The Asuka managed a test flight four years ago but had so few potential
customers that it never went into production.
Yet where Japan did learn the lesson of the YS-11, and seek foreign
co-operation, it typically ended up as a junior partner with limited access
to technology. It has, for example, a respected record as a supplier to
Europe and the US, producing around 20 per cent of the parts for the Boeing
767-300 and 40 per cent of the 747 jumbo airframes. Yet these are generally
medium technology parts, such as wing flaps and lavatory modules.
'The US has always wanted the Japanese aerospace industry to be a good
younger brother. They don't want us to be an elder brother,' complains
Miti's Mr Hirai. But, as the US aviation association's Mr Rubin points out:
'Nobody goes into joint development of any kind and gives away more than
they have to.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (3): More hub action gets to Marsaxlokk -
Godfrey Grima on the development of the freeport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GODFREY GRIMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marin Hili, chief executive at Malta's freeport corporation, summons up
an impressive list of statistics to drive home Malta's success as a cargo
transhipment centre.
The Marsaxlokk terminal is now the third most active hub port in the
Mediterranean and ninth in the region's port traffic league. From a mere
7,788 containers handled in 1988, the terminal's throughput had leapt to
288,192 containers last year.
This year 400,000 containers are due to arrive from and leave to north-west
Europe, the US, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Far East and Asia, a
hefty increase in business over last year's figures. In terms of volume the
terminal is the world's 65th busiest port.
Even the notion of becoming the leading transhipment harbour in the
Mediterranean is not enough to satisfy Mr Hili's ambitions. 'This should
become a major hub terminal in Europe,' he insists. 'Everything points in
that direction.' Judged against the considerable gains that the sprawling
customs-free container terminal has made in recent years, the prediction
sounds plausible enough.
'The key is to remain efficient and reliable. Depressed international cargo
markets made no significant impact on our growth - if anything the recession
gave us a chance to compete and time to develop and equip ourselves. When
the world's major economies pick up again we shall be in a much stronger
position to offer rival ports stiff competition,' Mr Hili insists.
For centuries Malta's prosperity has been firmly latched to the fortunes of
the world's seafaring nations. Situated at the gateway to the eastern and
western Mediterranean and lying half way between Europe and Africa, Malta is
one of the world's oldest trading posts.
In developing a container terminal from where cargo could be shipped to its
final destination by smaller feeder vessels the Maltese have succeeded in
realising a notion that was first mooted by the Knights of Malta in the 16th
century. With shipping producers now depending on speed, efficiency and an
economy of scale for their profits the idea of a hub operation which is
relatively close to volume port destinations makes more sense.
What makes hub ports an attractive proposition are the many logistical gains
they offer: there is the advantage of cutting down on port calls; of
reducing voyage time; of netting shorter transit times by switching east and
west bound services over one port facility; of freeing fleets and providing
them with the opportunity to concentrate on profitable voyage legs; of
accessing into north European markets via Mediterranean ports and north
African markets by using relay services for small volumes. For example, a
switch of operations by a Far East - Northern Europe operator to divert
cargo through Mediterranean ports to Marsaxlokk would save up to 10 days on
each voyage.
The point is not lost on regional and round the world operators who have
come to accept the Malta terminal, built at Marsaxlokk, on the island's
south coast, as an efficient interface.
Malta's position on the Red Sea - Strait of Gibraltar sea lane axis makes it
cost-effective for cargo to be transhipped over Marsaxlokk. Maersk of
Denmark, P and O container line of the UK and Sealand, the US shipping
company, for example, currently operate a service from the US east coast to
the Middle East, transhipping North European bound cargo at Marsaxlokk
without diverting their voyages. Bulcon, the Bulgarian shipping line,
another regular client, runs a service from Varna, the Bulgarian port in the
Black Sea to the Middle East transhipping Europe-bound cargo from Malta.
Big shipping lines also find Malta a profitable base from which to organise
their transhipment operations. Norasia, the Swiss line, closed down its
Pireaus operations four years ago and came to Malta.
Malta's freeport terminal was conceived and partly built by the socialist
administration in the mid-1970s. On taking power in 1987, the Fenech Adami
administration set up a freeport corporation headed by Mr Hili, who left the
family shipping business. Quayside and stacking areas were upgraded and the
quay on terminal one was lengthened and equipped with efficient quayside and
landside cranes. As a result, the terminal now accommodates and handles any
size of vessel and takes 4,446 container slots.
Several support services were set up to make the terminal increasing
autonomous. A permanent training school for freeport employees was
established with the transport college of Rotterdam: a marine department
provides pilotage and safe navigation, tug boat and mooring services, and
keeps harbour traffic under control: another company is in charge of coastal
engineering works.
Equally successful has been the setting up of an oil terminal in which Oil
Tanking, one of the world's three largest oil storage organisations with
facilities in Europe, Houston and Singapore has a majority shareholding. The
outfit will this year double its oil storage, bunkering and blending
facilities to 175,000 cubic metres. What makes the terminal particularly
successful is the fact it is an independent terminal, is based close to
international shipping lines and can accept large volumes of liquid cargo.
Financially, the freeport nets Malta an appreciable Dollars 20m a year,
excluding income from the oil terminal. With cargo traffic in the
Mediterranean on the increase, plans have been drawn for a second
state-of-the-art terminal whose first phase is expected to be commissioned
by 1996. This will double the Marsaxlokk terminal's capacity to 1m
containers.
'The building of a second terminal shows how confident we are in our future.
We know the market: it is growing and we're going for it,' Mr Hili remarks.
His one elusive task remains convincing Japanese lines to start
transshipping at Malta. 'That's a difficult question to answer. But it is
not for lack of trying, he admits.
Malta's container terminal owes its success to several bold and wise
decisions. Investment, which in the end are likely to exceed Dollars 500m
appear to have been timely. Targets seem to be realistic. What also accounts
for the terminal's popularity is the long stretch of industrial peace that
Malta has enjoyed for decades. Mr Hili is first to admit that the unions'
support has helped guarantee that port workers are weaned away from outdated
port practices without trouble.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (4): A pivot in the strategy - Financial
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The development of Malta as an international financial and trading centre is
a pivotal element in the Nationalist government's strategy for economic
development.
Financial services are seen as an important new source of income and
employment, providing a qualitative change in the nature of the services
sector of the economy.
Legislation, due to be approved by parliament by the end of March, should
provide the necessary framework for expanding the modest financial services
structure set up in 1989. According to Mr John Dalli, the finance minister,
within five years financial services could account for 10 to 15 per cent of
GDP.
This sector could provide some 6,000 more jobs, becoming the single largest
outlet for graduate employment. Indeed, the upgrading of the islands' labour
skills is specifically tailored to the successful expansion of financial
services.
Malta is not the first small island economy to try to seek salvation by
developing financial services. If anything, it has come to the idea late in
the day when the supply of financial service centres outstrips demand,
making success that much tougher.
Mr Dalli has few illusions about the challenge. 'We have set ourselves a
tall order,' he says. However, the Maltese authorities have some important
selling points which make them quietly optimistic.
The present government has been slow but extremely methodical in preparing
the ground. This applies both to ensuring Malta possesses the right
educational levels to meet the demand for professional skills and to laying
the essential telecommunications and communications infrastructure.
High priority has been given to expanded university enrolment and improving
the nature of the courses available. The university this year has reached a
student population of 5,000. Within six years the government has achieved
its target of having 20 per cent of school-leavers opt for tertiary
education.
Infrastructural development has received a substantial injection of funds.
Thus the Malta telecoms authority now has in place state-of-the-art optic
fibre and satellite facilities capable of handling the sophisticated
telecommunications needs of the financial services business.
Parallel with these developments, the authorities have opted to begin in a
modest way. In 1989 the Maltese International Business Authority was set up
to supervise and administer fledgling offshore activities. 'We were not
looking for brass plate operations,' says Mr Dalli. 'We wanted to establish
our reputation as a serious centre, not as a tax haven.'
To critics who claim that relatively few international companies have used
this Maltese facility, he replies that Malta has been very careful in
vetting entries. During the past five years, the MIBA has registered 1,300
companies. However, no fewer than 5,000 applications have been rejected.
During this period, the MIBA also registered three onshore banks, three
insurance companies and 28 trusts; while 50 nominee companies have been
granted warrants to service offshore companies.
The 1988 white paper on International Business Activities stated that the
ultimate aim was virtually to eliminate the distinction between onshore and
offshore activities and be fully compatible with EU directives. The
government has now hired Peat Marwick, the international accountants, as
consultant for this new and complex phase.
The preparatory activity is over and legislation is now before parliament to
transform the MIBA into the Malta Financial Services Centre. The MFSC will
have the functions of the single financial services regulator for investment
business and insurance. By adopting a 'one-stop-shop' approach, the investor
service should be both more attractive and efficient.
At the same time, the government is harmonising and simplifying its tax
legislation, the biggest single fiscal shake-up since independence. A
special international unit is being set up in the Inland Revenue to deal
with the tax matters of international investors. Among the tax privileges
envisaged is special treatment for Maltese-registered holdings in overseas
companies.
Other elements of the legislative package underline just how much ground the
authorities have had to cover so as to create the right environment for the
MFSC. The legislation includes: the recognition of unit trusts governed by
foreign tax laws and managed in Malta, in accordance with the Hague
Convention on the Recognition of Trusts; a professional secrecy bill; an
insider trading bill; an investment services bill; companies and commercial
partnerships legislation; and a money laundering bill.
The latter bill boldly states: 'In opening its doors to the international
financial community, Malta does not want to become a conduit for money
derived from drug traffic and other serious crime.' The aim is to adopt
regulations in line with EU directives. With Malta so close to Sicily and
Calabria, the abuse of the system by Italian organised crime is a real
threat.
Who then is likely to make use of the MFSC? Mr Dalli believes existing
European onshore/offshore centres such as Luxembourg and the Channels
Islands are becoming too crowded and expensive, so there is scope to pick up
business. Peat Marwick sees Malta as having low-cost advantages relating to
wages and property. Property in particular is abundant and is priced below
the European norm; while the competitive edge in wage costs is important
given Malta's English-based multi-lingualism.
Malta could become an attractive alternative centre for fund administration.
It might prove competitive in some labour intensive aspects of banking. The
Maltese also hope for some spin-off on the financial services side from
existing activity in ship registrations. Malta currently has the world's
tenth largest shipping register.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (2): Back from the giddy heights - Godfrey
Grima on prospects for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GODFREY GRIMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malta's tiny economy is no longer generating wealth at a spectacular rate.
Gone are the giddy heights to which economic growth spiralled in the wake of
Dr Eddie Fenech Adami's electoral victory over the Socialists in 1987. Gone
are the two-digit growth rates.
The relatively large government spending programme has run its course.
Slowdown measures to stop the economy from overheating included a 10 per
cent devaluation in 1992. Even so, Mr John Dalli, the island's finance
minister, expects Malta to net a 4 per cent GDP increase this year, a bold
prediction given the depressed worldwide economic climate.
Malta's star has been rising for several years. Even as other European
economies have lurched in the grip of a seemingly endless recession, the
islands, as recently as 1992, netted an 8 per cent increase on GNP. Gross
profits rose and average take-home pay climbed to Lm54.41.
Malta owes its economic performance to two competitively priced activities:
tourism and light manufacturing industry. Both provide the Maltese with more
cash, jobs and development opportunities than ever before. Last year 1m
tourists - with Britons the biggest contingent - holidayed in Malta,
spending up to September a total of a Lm173.6m, which is Lm40m more than in
the 1992 comparative period.
With tourism booming, the island's national airline, Air Malta, whose fleet
of 12 Boeings flies to 29 destinations, placed a Dollars 100m order in
January for another four aircraft from Avro International Aerospace, the UK
company. Mr Joseph Tabone, Air Malta chairman, says: 'The task ahead is to
upgrade our tourism.'
Subsidies to British tour operators from the central bank in the form of
favourable forward buying exchange rates to help fill up some of Malta's
40,000 holiday beds were drastically cut in the summer.
Industrial development is another smart card through which Malta has
increased prosperity. Mr Dalli says: 'We are no longer marketing cheap
labour. There has been a steady process of upgrading human resources to fit
our new agenda. We have, for example, opened our university to some 5,000
students.'
There are now about 300 companies on industrial estates, employing 29,200
people, which last year shipped Lm366.4m worth of semi manufactures, an
increase of 1.6 per cent over the previous year's figure, mostly to European
clients.
Factories on a specially designed technopark built recently for electronics
companies have all been taken up. 'Investment goes to countries that are
successful, where the industrial and political climates are stable and
friendly. Once we join the European Union investments will increase
further,' Mr Dalli argues.
However, ship-repairing - one of Malta's oldest trades - and shipbuilding
are currently going through a difficult patch. Mr Albert Mizzi, one of
Malta's leading entrepreneurs who ran Air Malta for almost 20 years, says
shipbuilding on its own will never be profitable. Some 200 people working in
shipbuilding may soon be absorbed by the freeport corporation which sees a
profitable future in building wharfside cranes. 'The island's future lies in
service industry. Maltese exporters need levies and trade barriers to be
lifted before they can show their true mettle,' says Mr Mizzi who started
out in life as an importer.
By spearheading a relatively hefty spending programme, the Fenech Adami
administration has turned round a sluggish economy bequeathed by the
Socialists into one that consistently yields encouraging results: since
coming to power it has created 11,000 jobs, pushing the number of those
gainfully occupied to 134,052. Several infrastructural projects have came on
stream, including a power plant, an airport terminal, completion of the
freeport terminal, road networks and state-of-the-art telecommunications
facilities. All of this has been achieved while keeping the budget deficit
at below 3 per cent of GNP.
'In 1987 we had 25,000 people waiting for telephones. We are now heading
towards putting the service on demand. You can't begin to attract
investments and fulfil your social obligations unless you have modern
telecommunication facilities in place,' says Dr Frances Zammit Dimech,
Malta's transport and telecommunications minister.
Signs of sustained prosperity are not too hard to find. The Maltese save, on
average, 15 per cent of their income. There is as much as Lm347m in
circulation, almost Lm1,000 for every man, woman and child.
Investment opportunities tend to have a magnetic pull on the Maltese. One
guesstimate puts Maltese private reserves abroad, mostly in Britain, at
Lm2bn. The relatively small markets that are beginning to appear at home
have proved popular. A government decision to reduce its shareholding in
Bank of Valletta and Mid-Med Bank led to 18,000 people snapping up the
shares.
But the leading investment vehicle remains property, a key industry
temporarily dampened by the imposition of a capital gains tax.
An atavistic preference for brick and mortar probably explains Malta's
excellent rating among the best housed countries in Europe. Meanwhile,
Maltese commercial banks offer added investment openings by matching and
often improving on yields offered abroad. Bank of Valletta and Mid-Med Bank,
the island's two major commercial institutions currently woo investors with
a 7 per cent yield on sterling time deposits.
With exchange controls due to be lifted, Malta's relatively limited currency
and securities markets will need to maintain their high yields to stop
capital from taking flight.
Praiseworthy as Malta's recent economic achievements might appear, the
wellbeing of several economic activities, particularly those run by the
private sector, still depend heavily on the fortunes of the national
economy. This, basically, explains the government's firm commitment to
restructure the foundations of Malta's tiny economy and align its mechanics
with those found in the European Union.
As old structures give way to yet untried tools - the Maltese start paying
VAT next year - fresh challenges face the administration of Mr Fenech Adami.
Increased growth and wealth will in the years to come, need to keep up their
pace. The threat is that the quest for a modern welfare society will sow the
seeds of social dissent.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (2): Passenger aircraft on the
horizon - South Korea has ambitious plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean aerospace industry is entering an ambitious new phase as
the country's leading conglom- erates unveil plans to produce medium-sized
passenger aircraft in the next few years.
The main aerospace companies - Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries
and Korean Air - have existed until now primarily on the licensed production
of US military aircraft and the supply of airliner components to foreign
manufacturers. Annual turnover has reached Dollars 1bn.
But the government wants the country to develop an expertise in the design
and development of aircraft, instead of just assembling foreign models, and
transform Korea into one of the world's 10 leading aerospace manufacturers
by 2020.
To achieve this goal, the government plans to spend Dollars 2bn over the
next 10 years on research and development for aviation and space projects.
This includes Dollars 300m for the development of medium-sized commercial
aircraft, considered the first stage for Korea's eventual participation in
the international co-production of large passenger jets.
It is a difficult challenge. So far, Korea has developed only military
trainers and light aircraft.
A consortium of the country's three main aerospace companies is expected to
be formed by May under state direction to develop a commuter airliner with
50 to 100 seats, in co-operation with a foreign partner.
Korea's big business groups are already vying to lead the programme, with
three proposed joint venture projects with foreign partners for medium-sized
airliners being announced in the past few months.
Samsung Aerospace, Korea's largest aircraft manufacturer, last autumn signed
a memorandum of understanding with Aviation Industries of China (Avic), the
umbrella group for Chinese aerospace companies, to produce commuter aircraft
with 50 to 100 seats.
The programme, called Phoenix, will begin development this year, with
production scheduled to start in 1998. Development funding and engineering
will be largely provided by Samsung, while Avic will offer the aircraft
technology.
Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air, the country's main airline, have
also formed a venture with Avic to produce a medium-sized airliner by 1998.
Hindustan Airlines of India and Singapore Airlines are also expected to
participate in the Dollars 1bn project, called Asian Air Express. A basic
programme plan is scheduled to be issued in March. Daewoo has already
developed a 33-seat commuter airliner with Dornier of Germany.
But Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, a new entry into the aircraft industry,
may have stolen a march on its rivals by establishing a joint venture with
Yakovlev of Russia, which will design and develop passenger aircraft based
on the 150-seat Yak42H and the 30-seat Yak40H.
They will be assembled in Korea by Hyundai, which has a 51 per cent stake in
the joint venture and will also establish a worldwide marketing and
after-sales network. Hyundai Precision is a main producer of transport
equipment, such as railway cars and engines.
In return for tapping the superior design and technology capabilities of
China and Russia, the Korean companies can provide vital financing and
better production technology.
China and Russia have also proved more willing to transfer aircraft
technology to Korea than western aerospace companies, which possibly fear a
future competitive threat from Asia.
The new Korean projects are seen as part of a wider Asian attempt to reduce
the region's dependence on western aircraft manufacturers as air travel in
the area increases.
Weak domestic demand has been one main obstacle to the development of the
Korean civil aviation industry. But the Korea Aerospace Research Institute
estimates that the country may need 170 commuter aircraft within the next 15
years as small airports in the country are improved and expanded. Samsung is
also considering starting a domestic carrier to provide a market for its
aircraft.
The possible reunification of North and South Korea may increase sales since
air travel could partially overcome transportation problems caused by the
north's crumbling road and rail networks.
The manufacturing alliance with China will also provide a potentially large
market for the Korean companies.
Sales of the mid-sized airliners to the Asian market may reverse the losses
that the Korean aerospace industry is now suffering as exports of aircraft
components fall due to the downturn in the global aviation industry. The
government believes that Korea could capture 10 per cent of the global
commuter aircraft market by 2000, with sales of 70 aircraft a year.
In the meantime, the industry depends on military orders to boost sales.
Samsung Aerospace, with an estimated 1993 turnover of Dollars 395m in
aviation-related business, is the prime contractor in the Korea Fighter
Programme (KFP), which involves the assembling of 36 US-designed F-16
fighters and the licensed production of another 72, beginning in 1997.
Korean Air and Daewoo are KFP subcontractors.
Korean Air is the main supplier of helicopters to the Korean military, with
estimated 1993 sales of Dollars 358m in the aircraft sector. It has been
assembling American-designed UH-60 Black Hawk combat helicopters since 1990.
But Korean Air recently suffered a blow when the government ordered it to
transfer the technology and equipment for assembling the helicopter engines
to Samsung Aerospace, which is the most advanced among Korean manufacturers
in aero-engine technology.
Daewoo Heavy Industries, which had estimated aviation-related sales of
Dollars 123m in 1993, mainly serves as a subcontractor on military aerospace
programmes, though it has built training aircraft.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (3): Breakneck growth may slow as
attention turns to safety - China's aviation industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marred by a series of crashes in the last year, the breakneck growth of
China's aviation industry is likely to slow as the country seeks to reverse
its image as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly.
'Investment is being diverted to upgrading airports,' says a western
executive involved in the Chinese aviation business. 'They are concerned
about training and safety. That is why there is a slowdown.'
'There will be a period of consolidation,' adds another knowledgeable
western businessman. 'They ordered a lot of aircraft in 1993 and are taking
delivery in 1994. The rapid expansion in the number of airlines and number
of aircraft may have stretched their resources.'
Last year, passenger and cargo volume rose a record 25-30 per cent from
1992. This was the highest aviation industry growth rate in the world,
compared with 5-6 per cent in industrialised countries. Even with a
slowdown, China is still expected to remain the international leader.
In 1993, China bought 12 A300-600 aircraft worth Dollars 1.2bn from Airbus
Industrie, as well as 28 Boeings from its 737, 757 and 767 series,
altogether worth Dollars 1.35bn. The new purchases were designed to replace
ageing Russian aircraft as the number of new Chinese airliners grew to 35.
With a serious shortage of ground equipment, radar, navigation systems and
adequately trained pilots, the infrastructure has not kept pace with the
expansion.
This was one key reason for the country's appalling safety record, with at
least five known fatal accidents in the last year and a half, killing
hundreds of people.
In addition, 10 aircraft were hijacked last year from China to Taiwan,
further aggrav- ating security problems and disputes over sovereignty
between Beijing and Taipei.
But these were not the only reasons for the poor safety record. As more
civilian aircraft fly in narrow corridors allocated by the military, air
traffic control capability has also lagged behind. China lacks civilian
flight information regions which help guide pilots from one area of the
country to another.
'In the US, there are several flight information regions, but within China
there isn't such an animal,' a western executive says. 'After a pilot has
left an airport, he is probably not on a civil aviation control radar,
although the military is following it.'
Problems stemming from the military's continued control over air traffic
corridors are compounded by the increasing decentralisation of China's
aviation industry. As more independent airlines have been established, they
have been increasingly reluctant to give any of their profits to the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, the industry's supervisory agency and
owner of some of the country's increasingly autonomous airlines.
Without financial clout, analysts say CAAC's ability to compel airlines and
airports to improve their radar and ground facilities is limited.
Growth in passenger and cargo traffic this year is also likely to be
constrained by the country's moves away from subsidies and towards a market
economy. Ticket prices are currently artificially low.
'If they are really going this way, this will free the price,' a western
businessman says. 'If every airline has to cover its cost, they must raise
the ticket price.'
For example, a two and a half hour flight from Beijing to Guangzhou costs
less than Dollars 200 one way. In contrast, a flight of a similar distance
from New York to Chicago costs about Dollars 400.
In addition, Chinese airlines are likely to be hit by foreign exchange
fluctuations since the devaluation of the local currency, the renminbi.
Businessmen said fares are likely to increase to compensate for the more
expensive dollar to repay loans for aircraft purchases.
In an attempt to improve both safety and efficiency, the government has
reorganised CAAC. Chen Guangyi, former governor and communist party
secretary of China's coastal Fujian province, was appointed CAAC's director
general, replacing Zhang Zhuping.
Chen has had no previous background in aviation, although he is an engineer
by training. 'He has said his mandate is two-fold - to improve safety and
make the airlines do quality work serving the public,' a western diplomat
says. 'The State Council wanted a new person to shake up CAAC a little bit
and make it more focused on safety.'
Chen was also believed to be appointed because as governor of a prosperous
coastal province, he could bring his business knowledge to bear on China's
cumbersome state-run airlines.
There is speculation that Chen, who has vast business connections across the
Taiwan straits, might be able to accelerate the process of starting direct
flights to Taiwan and encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in China's
ailing airline industry.
Chinese authorities have also imposed tougher financial, technical and
operational restrictions for new airlines seeking to be established, warning
that criminal charges would be pressed against any airline staff if it could
be proved they were negligent in their duties in the course of an accident.
China has also agreed to allow the recent opening of a representative office
of the US Federal Aviation Authority in Beijing. The FAA's role is to assist
the Chinese in helping them develop and integrate their aviation system to
meet international safety standards.
An FAA investigation team was called in for the first time late last year to
help ascertain the cause of an accident in Urumqi in western Xinjiang
province involving a McDonnell Douglas jet.
In another positive move, the military has also agreed to turn control of
the vital and heavily travelled air route from Beijing to Guangzhou, the
capital of southern Guangdong province, to civilian authorities.
With the country expected to need at least 700 new pilots in the next few
years, a number that the main training centre in Chengdu, Sichuan province,
cannot turn out, the Chinese are also sending more of their pilots to the
west for training. Guangzhou-based China Southern Airlines has even bought
part of an Australian flight school to help train its pilots.
At the same time, Airbus Industrie and Boeing are each also considering the
possibility of establishing a flight training school for entry level pilots.
Although Chinese officials have publicly welcomed foreign investment in the
aviation industry, so far foreigners have seemed reluctant. A recent dispute
involving Air China, China Eastern and Evergreen, an American air cargo
carrier, provides one explanation why. The Chinese had blocked cargo
destined for the US from being loaded onto Evergreen planes in contravention
of a bilateral treaty. The dispute was resolved only after pressure from the
US government.
But businessmen say the handling of the affair demonstrates that Beijing
will protect Chinese aviation interests first, regardless of who may be
right.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (1): Islands start to talk big - Buoyant
growth has led the Maltese to embark on ambitious infrastructural projects
and seek membership of the European Union. But they may be kept waiting at
the door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maltese can be forgiven for being a trifle smug these days.
When much of Europe remains depressed by recession, Malta enjoys buoyant
growth and low unemployment. After seven years' annual average growth of 5
per cent, the Maltese boast a per capita income higher than that of Greece
and Portugal, and throughout the islands there is a pervasive air of genteel
prosperity.
The shops in Republic Street, Valletta, have smartened up. The stock of
ageing Bedford buses gleams with highly polished chrome. Even the old red
British telephone booths have been given a new coat of paint.
The Phoenicia Hotel, long the central meeting point in Valletta, has
reopened after refurbishment with an extra floor. The airport boasts a large
new terminal and there are now direct flights to such distant destinations
as Dubai and Montevideo. During the weekend, nearby Sliema is snarled up
with late-night traffic jams as crowds flock to the sea-front bars and
discos.
Businessmen are beginning to talk big. The most ambitious project is the
LM150m development of Manoel Island, the sprawling tongue of land with a
marina and dilapidated fortifications on the other side of Grand Harbour.
Attempts to develop this magnificent site have been in the air for ages but
for the first time a scheme stands a chance of getting off the ground.
Another sign of the times is the decision by the government to obtain an
international credit rating for the Republic of Malta. Mr John Dalli, the
finance minister, discussed the matter last month in the US with both
Moody's and Standard and Poor's, the ratings agencies.
'The Maltese at last have a smile back on their faces,' says Mr Maurice
Mizzi, one of the islands' leading businessmen.
By this, he means that Malta has put behind it the grey period of the 1970s
and early 1980s, when the government of Mr Dom Mintoff, then Labour prime
minister, dabbled in socialist rhetoric and courted a place in the third
world. In contrast to the days when Mr Mintoff fostered close ties, air
connections with Libya have been cut because of the United Nations Lockerbie
embargo and relations are at best correct, with an unresolved dispute over
territorial waters.
With the cold war buried, Malta is now looking firmly towards Europe and
seeking full membership of the European Union. Already fiscal reforms are in
hand and VAT will be introduced next year. The Nationalist government of Mr
Eddie Fenech Adami is also committed to meeting Brussels' economic
convergence criteria, which will involve a shake-up of long-standing
protectionist practices and a reduction in the overblown public sector.
Mr Fenech Adami has moved cautiously but always with a clear vision about
Malta's future. He wants to see Malta make the best of its strategic
location in the Mediterranean and achieve international credibility as a
full partner of the EU. His central idea for sustaining economic growth and
future prosperity is the development of Malta as a financial services
centre.
The premier believes tourism, the traditional cash mainstay, is close to
reaching saturation point and alternative sources of income and employment
have to be found. The three islands now host over 1m visitors a year. Even
if the authorities were willing to see more space on the cramped islands
covered by concrete, this would almost be counter-productive in terms of
attracting more tourists.
There are also infrastructural limits to the islands' welcoming more people
 -not least the question of water. Already 25 per cent of electricity is
generated to produce water. Furthermore, the population density is high,
with 1,130 inhabitants per square kilometre.
Tourist policy can move in only one direction: the industry must lessen its
dependence on the traditional 'fish-and-chips' end of the market and attract
higher spending brackets. Only in this way can the current LM200m earned
from tourism, almost a quarter of GDP, be boosted without a substantial
increase in overall numbers.
Equally, there are clear limits to Malta's manufacturing base. The
authorities do not wish to compete in manufacturing as a low wage economy;
but it is not easy to obtain added value when so many raw and semi-finished
materials are imported. The islands' size, plus constraints of space, also
limit the scale of industrial operations. As it is, the export-oriented
electronic components and textiles manufacturing will have to fight hard to
survive. The famous dockyards, despite their strategic location in the
Mediterranean, are struggling to stay competitive.
Maltese industry will thus be lucky to sustain its quarter-share of
employment in the future. Last year's slight rise in unemployment to 4.2 per
cent of the workforce, or 5,800 people, was primarily due to job losses in
this sector. Indeed, the impressive average growth rates since the late
1980s mask a slowing down in the past two years - precisely because both
manufacturing and tourism have been affected by recession in Europe.
The present government is ideologically disinclined to force-feed growth
through deficit spending. Even so, the public sector deficit has been
discreetly rising. That the deficit has remained below 4 per cent of GDP is
due in good measure to generous funding from Italy. Under the terms of the
third financial protocol with Italy, Rome will have provided LM35m in grants
and almost another LM10m in loans during the period 1992-94.
This Italian assistance has covered nearly a third of the budget deficit.
Although a fresh protocol is under negotiation, the Italians are unlikely to
be so generous in the future. Such deals reflected the largesse of the now
discredited Andreotti era. Thus, it is questionable whether the Nationalist
government will be able to sustain the current levels of spending without
either cuts in the public sector or raising new taxes - or raising the
borrowing requirement.
If the state payroll is pruned, even more pressure is placed on the services
sector as the main source of future jobs. Last year, for the first time,
employment in services overtook that of private direct production. The
government believes some 6,000 jobs can be created over the next five years
following the establishment of the Malta International Business Authority.
Legislation is due to be approved by parliament next month. It will
establish the regulatory framework and fiscal regime to transform the modest
four-year-old Malta Financial Services Centre into a fully developed
financial centre.
The prime minister and his advisers are convinced Malta can create a niche
for itself as a small but reputable financial centre. 'A good reputation is
vital,' says Mr Fenech Adami. On conservative estimates, financial services
could account for 10 per cent of GDP within five years.
Thus, much rides on the success of the plan, not least the fate of graduate
employment. University enrolment has been boosted so that the Maltese
economy can take advantage of upgraded educational levels. If the job
potential from financial services fails to materialise, there will be a lot
of disgruntled graduates.
The other central pillar of the government's strategy is to secure
membership of the EU. The avis (legal opinion) on Malta's application issued
by Brussels last October was encouraging. It recognised Malta's European
vocation and accepted the need to send a 'positive' signal to the Maltese,
indicating the EU's willingness to negotiate.
However, Brussels made it clear that many major reforms would be needed  -
from cutting state subsidies to removing protective tariffs and ending
monopolies. Because of Malta's size, these do not pose insurmountable
problems. The real problem is that the EU itself cannot seriously address
Maltese membership until the broader institutional issues of enlargement are
settled among existing Union countries. In crude terms, Malta risks being
kept waiting at the door.
Under these circumstances, Mr Fenech Adami will need to produce positive
results from the accession negotiations. The degree of progress could well
turn into a controversial issue at the next elections, scheduled for 1997.
The Labour party remains critical of the idea of membership; and if joining
the EU promises limited extra aid flows, places jobs at risk and exposes
many small Maltese companies to the fierce winds of competition, then
membership may not be such a popular option.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (1): Growth region ready for
take-off - Commercial aircraft manufacturers expect the area to outperform
other markets over the next 20 years, while defence contractors see it as
their top growth area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aerospace industry is gathering en masse in Singapore next week for what
promises to be the biggest Asian Aerospace show ever staged.
Although the industry is still in a state of turmoil because of the
financial losses of airlines and the deep defence cutbacks following the end
of the cold war, interest in what has become the world's third largest
international air show after Farnborough and Paris has continued to grow for
two fundamental reasons.
Commercial aircraft manufacturers expect the Asia-Pacific region to
outperform every single other air transport market during the next 20 years.
Boeing, the biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, forecasts that after
the turn of the century the region will overtake the US as the world's
largest commercial jet market with annual deliveries of new aircraft
averaging Dollars 16bn from 2001 to 2010. Japan and China are set to become
the two largest markets outside the US. And about 40 per cent of the future
requirement for the new generation of large widebody aircraft now under
development will come from the region.
Defence contractors are also stepping up their export drive in Asia,
especially at a time when defence sales to the Middle East appear to be
peaking. Asia-Pacific has now become the only area in the world where the
defence market is showing strong growth.
That reflects the size, diversity and political volatility of the entire
region, with its specific pockets of contention such as the Spratly Islands
in the South China seas and its broader areas of tension and concern
including North Korea, the overwhelming size of the Chinese armed forces,
the military power of India and the potential military resurgence of Japan.
Already by next year, British Aerospace, the UK defence contractor, which
has traditionally relied very heavily on the Middle East for its exports,
expects about 15 per cent of its defence sales to come from the region
compared with 6 per cent last year. Asia-Pacific has also become the UK
company's biggest export customer for Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft, with
Indonesia alone placing last year a Pounds 500m order for Hawks.
Competition for defence business has further intensified with increasing
efforts by Russia to penetrate Asian markets. Malaysia last year became the
first south-east Asian country to order Mig 29s from Russia.
The strong demand for civil and defence aerospace equipment has opened a
third related market in the region, providing the necessary aviation and
military infrastructure to support the growth of air travel and defence
sales.
Without heavy investment in new airport capacity and modern air traffic
control systems, the anticipated annual growth in air travel, which
according to the European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium is likely
to average around 8.6 per cent over each of the next 10 years, risks being
clipped.
'The big problem for the future of civil aviation in the region is
congestion at airports like Narita and Osaka in Japan, Hong Kong, and
Bangkok, to name but four. If congestion grows, it will hold back growth. It
is not a country issue nor a regional issue, but an international issue,'
warns Mr Kim Cheung, a Boeing project director for market research.
Infrastructure is an equally important component of defence sales. In some
cases, the provision of military infrastructure and services can account for
as much as and sometimes more than the value of the original export contract
for military aircraft or other defence equipment.
Overall, the potential market in Asia for civil and military infrastructure
is likely to become as big as the market for aircraft themselves. The
combination of this strong demand for civil and military aerospace equipment
as well as the necessary infrastructure to support this growth has also
encouraged the Asia-Pacific countries to invest in the development of
indigenous aerospace industries.
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan have
all sought to expand their presence in the aerospace industry through
increased collaboration with western airframe, aero-engine and components
and systems manufacturers as well as through their own programmes.
Established western aerospace groups have also been keen to seek new
collaborations and joint ventures with Asian partners to strengthen their
presence in the growing regional market for commercial and defence
equipment.
Interest has been particularly focused on China, the region's fastest
growing market, where domestic air travel has been showing astonishing 30
per cent annual growth rates during the past few years. China's aviation
industry has been growing at breakneck pace ever since the government eased
regulatory controls in the 1980s. China was Boeing's largest single customer
last year taking delivery of 47 aircraft. It has also been a big market for
Airbus and the US McDonnell Douglas group.
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are all proposing close industrial
co-operation projects with China, which is at the same time considering
joining in a regional project to set up what has become known as the 'Asian
Airbus'. This would involve collaboration modelled on the European Airbus
partnership system between China, South Korea and India, and possibly other
Asian partners to develop 50 or 100 seater regional aircraft.
Indonesia is also exploring possibilities with British Aerospace to develop
turbopropeller regional and commuter aircraft. However, BAe's efforts to
form a regional jet joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace now appear to have
collapsed.
Although China is now outstripping all the other Asian countries in terms of
growth, Japan is still expected to be the largest single customer outside
the US for commercial aircraft despite the country's current economic
difficulties. Since the beginning of jet travel, Japan has ordered more than
637 airliners worth about Dollars 44bn. Boeing expects the Japanese market
will absorb another Dollars 60bn worth of airliners between now and 2010.
Japanese aerospace companies have been working with Boeing for the past
three decades and have become important suppliers to the US company. The big
three Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki
Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, supply about 15 per cent of the
value of the Boeing 767 airframe and about 20 per cent of the airframe for
the 777, the new twin engine widebody that Boeing will roll out for the
first time in April.
However, Japanese aerospace ambitions suffered a setback this year when
Boeing decided to put on ice plans to develop a new 150 seater aircraft, the
7J7, in which the Japanese companies intended to take a 25 per cent equity
stake. Instead, Boeing has decided to develop a new version of its 737
family of narrowbody twin engine airliners. Negotiations are at present
taking place between Boeing and the Japanese companies over their possible
involvement in the new 737 programme.
The Japanese companies have also been approached by the European Airbus
consortium over possible collaboration on the development of a next
generation superjumbo airliner capable of seating 600 to 800 passengers. The
Airbus partners and Boeing are now studying the possibility of jointly
developing a superjumbo aircraft which is expected eventually to involve
collaboration with Asian manufacturers, especially the big three Japanese
companies.
Airbus considers the Asia-Pacific region as 'the major world collective
force in determining requirements for the future development of even larger
aircraft to match growth demand'. The European group says that Asia-Pacific
airlines accounted for seven out of 10 carriers surveyed by the consortium
on the possible development of an advanced technology superjumbo.
The region is also regarded as one of the main markets for a future second
generation supersonic airliner to replace Concorde in the next century.
Leading aircraft manufacturers have teamed up to study a new future
supersonic aircraft which would have double the range of Concorde and carry
three times as many passengers.
Although these projects are still very much at an early design stage, the
development and production of a superjumbo and a new generation supersonic
airliner represent the next big challenges for aerospace technology.
Asia-Pacific will not only be the main market for these advanced airliners,
but it is also likely to be very closely involved in the development of
these ambitious and costly programmes.

FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big profit inspires Glaxo rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, and JOEL KIBAZO.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits from Glaxo, the leading pharmaceuticals group, were above the top of
the range of analysts' forecasts and sent the bears scurrying for cover.
Accompanied by a higher than expected dividend, the figures prompted a sharp
bounce in the share price.
The shares, which have lagged behind the All-Share index along with the rest
of the badly mauled pharmaceuticals sector, bounced 22 to 697p.
Turnover of 20m shares was the heaviest since full-year results in
September. It was the larger than expected final dividend then that
impressed investors and marked the shift in perception of Glaxo from a
growth stock to a yield stock.
Yesterday the company announced a Pounds 1.001bn interim profit and a 9p
dividend. Analysts also commented on a very positive meeting with the
company at which the management demonstrated that it was dealing effectively
with the slowing down of Zantac sales growth.
There was no disagreement over the quality of the figures, and most analysts
upgraded their full-year estimates by around Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.95bn.
However, disparity over the progress of Zantac saw a divergence in the 1995
figures. Bullish Smith New Court predicts Pounds 2.15bn but Nomura reflected
the cautious stance with a forecast of Pounds 2.025bn.
Glaxo raced ahead 37 at best but slipped back when New York opened. US
investors have been long-term bears of the stock.

FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Dealers in the derivatives reported a volatile day in stock index futures,
in which a dull morning session was transformed by the surprise cut in
German interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
Initial firmness as March opened at 3,420, some 6 points ahead of its
previous close, soon faded as dealers decided on a bout of profit-taking. An
early feeling that there would be no reduction in German rates encouraged
further selling.
The move by the Bundesbank was completely unexpected. It brought a turnround
in the fortunes of March, helping to pull the underlying cash market higher.
Market participants said there were several opportunities to arbitrage in
both the morning and the afternoon, a factor said to have been responsible
for the volatility in the future's premium to cash.
March finished at 3,424, up 10 from its previous close and near parity with
the cash market but at a 5-point discount to its fair value premium of minus
5. Volume at the official close was 20,030 contracts.
Business in the FT-SE 100 option continued to dominate activity in the
traded options, ahead of today's expiry of the index options. It saw 26,169
lots dealt and the Euro FT-SE option 5,396 contracts. Total volume in the
sector was 48,814. Glaxo, reporting bumper profits, was the most active
stock option at 3,107 lots.

FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: German rate cut revives flagging UK
equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong two-way pull developed in London with a sharp downgrading of market
forecasts offset by a surprise half-percentage point reduction in German
interest rates and good economic news from the US.
The upshot of was that the FT-SE 100 index reversed a fairly harsh
mid-morning slide, made rapid progress on the German interest rate reduction
and good economic news from the US, then eased off to close a net 7.6 higher
at 3,425.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 ended the day 3.7 higher at 4,054.3.
Mr Nick Knight, market strategist at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker,
put paid to an early rise in the London equity market. Opening around six
points higher in the wake of Wall Street's overnight rise and a better
showing by the Hong Kong market, the FT-SE 100 index began to falter as news
filtered into the market that the Nomura strategist had cut his 1994 FT-SE
100 year-end forecast by 500 points to 3,500.
Mr Knight caused flurries of uncertainty across most markets at the end of
last week after forecasting a bout of short-term turbulence across global
markets.
The Nomura stockbroker said yesterday that he felt investors in UK equities
should sell into strength, forecasting deterioration in UK inflation, the
trade deficit, sterling and both short- and long-term interest rates.
As the Nomura story spread throughout the market, the FT-SE 100 retreated to
a session low of 3,404.5, a fall of 13.2 in mid-morning.
However, the market embarked on a good rally and staged a strong upwards
move during lunchtime after the Bundesbank wrong-footed many market
observers and cut its discount rate by half a percentage point to 5.25 per
cent, the first cut since last October.
The German move encouraged London dealers who said the decision could hasten
another reduction in UK rates. Shortly afterwards there was good economic
news from the US where inflation was unchanged in January, heading off fears
that US interest rates may have needed to rise again in the short term.
At its best the FT-SE 100 was almost 20 points higher, at 3,437.6, but it
later subsided in the face of some determined profit-taking to close well
off the day's best levels.
Mr Edmond Warner, equity market strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the
integrated securities house, said he viewed the German rate cut and the US
economic news as providing a good short-term buying opportunity in the UK
market.
The key, Mr Warner said, was to buy the market after a correction. He said
the corporate results season so far has provided plenty of good news.
Mr Ian Harnett, market strategist at Strauss Turnbull, said the German cut
was a pleasant surprise for the market and there was now scope for further
UK cuts later in the year. He cautioned, however, that the market was still
waiting for news of a sustained earnings revival and was tending to move
sideways.
The German news was seen as encouraging for the likes of Redland and RMC,
building groups with a big exposure to Germany. There were also hints that
big activity in options and via the inter-dealer broker screens could herald
strategic stake-building or even full-scale takeover activity in Blue
Circle.
Turnover in equities was a disappointing 701m shares, while customer
business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 1.62bn.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Conflicting inflation signals
depress Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices finished moderately lower after joining bonds on a
rollercoaster ride powered by conflicting signals on inflation, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.63 down at 3,922.64, after
see-sawing between a 19-point gain and a 30-point loss during the session.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 followed the blue chips, losing
2.45 at 470.34. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped
0.86 to 474.46 and the Nasdaq composite shed 2.38 to 790.24. NYSE volume, at
340m shares, was heavy.
The session began on a bright note. The Labor Department said its consumer
price index was unchanged last month, and its core index, excluding the
volatile food and energy sectors, showed a tame 0.1 per cent increase.
Forecasts had centred around a 0.3 per cent rise for both figures.
Furthermore, the Commerce Department said the US trade deficit narrowed in
December largely because of increased exports. For stocks, the overall
picture was the best of both worlds - low inflation and solid manufacturing
growth. The bellwether blue chip Dow index shot up, aided by the Treasury
market's favourable response to the CPI report.
But bonds gave back most of their gains when the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve's February business outlook survey suggested that prices paid by
manufacturers in the region were on the rise. The downturn accelerated in
the afternoon as investors perceived the leading nature of the Philadelphia
price data as probable cause for a further tightening of interest rates by
the Federal Reserve.
In response the Dow took a nose-dive, dropping 32 points in as many minutes,
before stabilising and climbing part of the way back late in the day.
Caterpillar outperformed the market, adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 108 3/4
, while most blue chips showed weakness. 3M receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
108, General Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 7/8 and IBM Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 52 3/4 .
In defence-related issues, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas continued to benefit
from the previous day's announcement of a Dollars 6bn aircraft order by
Saudi Arabia. Boeing added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and McDonnell
Douglas Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 119 7/8 .
Raytheon fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 62 on news that the US army passed
over a missile interceptor developed by the company. Loral, which won the
contract, put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 41.
In medical technology, US Surgical dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 18 5/8
after revealing that it was renegotiating loan agreements with its banks.
On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development surged Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 66 1/2 on a
report that the software concern may enter into a joint venture with AT&amp;T.
Canada
Morning gains in Toronto gave way to afternoon declines in response to a
similar performance in New York. The TSE 300 index ended 16.8 off at 4,407.3
and falls led rises by 457 to 373 after volume of 83.4m shares valued at
some CDollars 990m.
Greyhound Lines of Canada jumped CDollars 3 1/4 to CDollars 22 3/4 . The
company declared a special dividend of CDollars 5 a share.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lifted by Bundesbank
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate lifted bourses around
Europe, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, said
that the move was 'very positive', reflecting the Buba's emphasis on the
reducing trend in German inflation, and on the distortions in the trend of
money supply growth.
He said that the cut should be particularly important to equities in
countries suffering from an excessively tight monetary policy: 'That really
is France at the moment,' he maintained, although Spain should be another
winner.
Conversely, he said, Germany and the Netherlands are not so interest rate
sensitive, and the move should be less beneficial for them.
FRANKFURT, yesterday afternoon, was not listening to the pragmatists.
Sentiment took over and, after a fall of 7.89 to 2,128.72 in the Dax index
before the Buba news emerged, the Ibis-indicated index closed at 2,162.29.
Turnover was virtually level at DM8.5bn. Afternoon gains were broadly based
and relatively even: Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Bayer all put up
rises in the 2 to 2 1/2 per cent area.
BMW fell behind the afternoon pace, up DM8 to DM867, but it had already
climbed DM31.50 on the official session, said Mr Nigel Longley at
Commerzbank, leaving it 4.8 per cent up on the day following a US report
that the carmaker expected profits to rise by 20 to 30 per cent this year.
PARIS initially reacted with undisguised satisfaction at the news from
Germany, sending the CAC-40 index to a session high of 2,305.62.
However, the market eased back on the likelihood that the Bank of France
would not move to cut domestic rates until next week, closing the day up
16.86 at 2,281.18.
Ms Melissa Carrington, European strategist at Hoare Govett, said that the
fact that the Bundesbank had left the repo rate unchanged limited the French
authorities' room for manoeuvre, and could mean that they will not be able
to follow with a full 50 basis point cut.
Mr Anthony Thomas, an economist at Kleinwort Benson, noted that yesterday's
announcement meant that the trigger point for a switch out of cash and into
equities was coming nearer. French investors, he said, were sitting on a
mountain of cash which would provide the opportunity for market performance.
Saint-Gobain, up FFr15 to FFr685, benefited from the announcement that the
UK glass manufacturer, Pilkington, was to lift European prices by an average
of 10 per cent.
AMSTERDAM saw plenty of activity in Akzo with some investors looking ahead
to next week's results. The chemicals group advanced Fl 4.50 to Fl 213.70,
while the AEX index improved 1.30 to 432.91.
Hoogovens ended 40 cents higher at Fl 63.80. After the close it said that it
would make additional cuts in its aluminium output from next month.
MILAN enjoyed a positive session. BCI, for instance, broke through the
L6,000 level, finding support ahead of its planned privatisation in a few
weeks' time. The shares finished up L230 at L6,050.
Fiat was heavily bought for the second successive session, rising L276 to
L5,035, with further talks on the car group's planned restructuring package
scheduled for later last night.
Olivetti rose L154 to L2,490, helped by brokers' reports and expectations
that it will be awarded the country's second digital telephone network.
MADRID recovered from bond market pessimism and equity weakness to close
with the general index 1.91 higher at 347.98, after 342.91 at midday.
STOCKHOLM jumped 2 per cent in heavy trading, the Affarsvarlden General
index closing 31.4 higher at 1,589.0, supported by the Buba cut and the
dissolution of Volvo's cross-ownership agreement with Renault SA of France.
Volvo B rose SKr15 to SKr692.
ISTANBUL stretched its gains this week by another 8 per cent, leaving the
composite index up 1,449.68 at 19,131.00. Turnover rose from TL899bn to
TL1,540bn.
TEL AVIV's worries over a wide-ranging stock price manipulation scandal sent
the Mishtanim index down another 12.96, or 5.4 per cent to 227.42 yesterday,
writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. With the exchange closed today, the drop
on the week was 6 per cent, following one of 9 per cent last week.
Two portfolio investment managers were arrested last week by the securities
authority on suspicion of manipulating securities for the eight companies
they managed. And earlier this week Mr Amos Weiss, a leading portfolio
manager with about Shk1bn (some Dollars 335m) under management, was released
on bail after being questioned on suspicion of stock manipulation.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drifts lower in
absence of foreign buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Uncertainty over the yen's course against the dollar kept investors
sidelined, and share prices lost ground on small-lot selling in low volume,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was finally down 120.72 at 18,931.39 after opening at
a high for the day of 19,026.50 and falling to a low of 18,809.98 in the
afternoon. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 5.55 to
1,553.55, while the Nikkei 300 shed 0.59 to 287.06.
Arbitrage unwinding overwhelmed foreign buying, which has dwindled during
the past few days. Japanese investors were wary of US threats to impose
trade sanctions due to its closed mobile telephone market. The US
administration has announced that it plans to restrict imports of Japanese
communications equipment over Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral
cellular market accord.
In spite of fears that the dollar could fall below the Y100 level, the
foreign currency market had a quiet day. The dollar closed Y0.38 up at
Y103.48 after moving around the Y103 mark. But traders remain worried about
the impact of the yen's strength on the expected economic recovery, which
has supported recent buying.
Volume was 300m shares, against 372m. Declines led advances by 696 to 293,
with 176 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.46 to
1,282.41.
Nitsuko, a telephone manufacturer belonging to the NEC group, was the most
actively traded issue, declining Y180 to Y1,280. NEC fell Y3 to Y968 and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y12,000 to Y886,000.
Other export oriented high-technology issues were also lower. Sony lost Y60
to Y5,800 and Canon declined Y10 to Y1,580.
However, some car stocks were higher on bargain hunting: Toyota Motor gained
Y10 to Y1,900 and Honda Motor advanced Y40 to Y1,620.
Drug issues lost ground on profit-taking with Takeda Chemical falling Y20 to
Y1,230 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical losing Y40 to Y2,110.
Short-term investors traded speculative favourites. Nippon Shokubai, which
was traded on the 'environmental theme' rose Y30 to Y1,050, but Takuma
declined Y40 to Y1,410 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 179.08 to 21,036.75 in volume of 59.2m
shares.
Roundup
Turnover in many of the region's markets continued to fall back or remain
below recent average levels.
HONG KONG ended a day of roller-coaster trade with the Hang Seng index
recovering 152.44, or 1.4 per cent to 10,786.58, after swinging between a
185-point gain and a 157-point loss. Turnover fell from HKDollars 6.48bn to
HKDollars 5.59bn.
Domestic professionals said that US speculators were playing futures,
destabilising the cash market. February futures closed at a big premium to
the spot market at 10,935, up 325, on heavy volume of 17,000 lots. The
contract gyrated in a 480-point range between 10,470 and 10,950.
TAIWAN, too, had higher share prices and lower activity, the weighted index
ending 42.86 up at 5,905.49 after an early low of 5,822, and turnover
falling from TDollars 58.31bn to TDollars 47.39bn.
The financial sector stabilised after recent sharp falls but domestic and
foreign institutions continued hunting for selected industrials. The paper
sector led gains after Long Cheng Paper said that profits rocketed in 1993,
and the shares rose TDollars 1.20 to TDollars 25.90.
BANGKOK's most active stock was Bangkok Bank, currently on a roadshow in
support of its Euroconvertible issue, up Bt3 at Bt200 as the SET index rose
16.09 to 1,445.20. Turnover was Bt12.3bn.
BOMBAY recovered on fresh buying by Indian financial institutions and mutual
funds, the BSE 30-share index closing up 59.97 at 3,867.39. Dealers said
that investors were anticipating another rally ahead of the Indian budget in
ten days' time.
AUSTRALIA took a late tumble and the All Ordinaries index, after rising 10
points during morning trade, ended 8.1 lower at 2,240.9. One broker said
that a fall in domestic bonds, and mixed company interim results had added
to the drop. Turnover was ADollars 553.7m.
NEW ZEALAND followed London and New York, the NZSE-40 index closing 12.98
higher at 2,324.91. Brierley sold 30m Skellerup shares, which rose 2 cents
to NZDollars 2.70, and the sale boosted market volume from NZDollars 57m to
NZDollars 135m.
KARACHI closed the last session before the two-day weekend break in a
cautious mood, with some investors unnerved by the possibility that the
coalition government in the North West Frontier Province might be voted out
of office. The KSE 100-share index shed 19.98 to 2,382.72.
COLOMBO continued its bull run with a further gain in the all-share index of
29.47 to 1,306.89. Turnover weakened from SLRs362m from SLRs398m.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Volatility is the new keynote in Zurich
 -Ian Rodger on the recent attack of nerves in the formerly placid Swiss
equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in the Swiss stock market have become accustomed to almost
automatic share price rises in the past couple of years.
The SPI all-share index climbed virtually without pause in 1993 and started
this year on much the same trend, with a brisk advance of 6.4 per cent in
January.
But the party finally came to an abrupt end last week.
While most world stock markets sagged slightly following the rise in US
interest rates and then recovered, the Swiss market dropped more sharply
than it had in over a year. In six sessions from February 7, the SPI shed
more than 6 per cent of its value, while the SMI index of 18 leading shares
tumbled 8.9 per cent.
Suddenly, the adjective on every analyst's lips is 'volatile'. 'We are now
in a period of nervousness,' says Mr Serge Ledermann, head of Swiss equity
research at Geneva bankers Lombard, Odier.
In spite of this week's recovery, with the SPI and the SMI up by 3.5 and 4.3
per cent respectively since Monday evening, few believe the market will
return to its placid rising pattern in the near future. 'We do not expect
any new highs in the next few months,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz of Credit
Suisse in Zurich.
As might be expected following an interest rate rise, the main victims of
last week's correction were bank shares. The banking sub-index of the SPI
fell 6.4 per cent over the six sessions to Tuesday.
The important chemical and pharmaceutical sector was on trend with a 6.2 per
cent setback, as was the Nestle-dominated food sector.
On the other hand, the cyclical machinery group declined only 3.7 per cent,
indicating the increasing attention paid to these shares as the prospects of
economic recovery in Europe improve.
Analysts point out that the correction was in many respects overdue. The
Swiss market, which is perhaps valued at 15 times expected 1994 earnings,
has been look-ing expensive relative to other European markets for several
weeks. It is widely known that many international portfolio managers have
recently reduced their Swiss weightings.
Thus, as Mr Ledermann suggests, the correction was logical even though the
event that provoked it was neither unexpected nor directly damaging.
There is also a feeling that a longer term structural shift is taking place.
In the past two years, Swiss equities have been driven by the strong
downward interest rate trend and the reassessment of earnings following much
improved disclosure by most Swiss companies.
From now on, says Mr Ledermann, the focus will be much more on individual
companies' profit performance. This is already most clearly evident in the
pharmaceuticals sector, where Roche shares continue significantly to
outperform those of its local rivals, Ciba and Sandoz.
Roche non-voting shares are up 12.4 per cent since the beginning of the year
to SFr7,050, while Sandoz bearers are off 6.0 per cent and Ciba registered
down 1 per cent.
Similarly, among the big banks, Union Bank of Switzerland bearers are 8.4
per cent higher since the end of December, while bearers of CS Holding, the
group built around Credit Suisse, are down nearly 2 per cent.
It is probably no coincidence that, in both of these cases, Mr Martin
Ebner's influential BZ Bank group in Zurich has made clear its preferences
for UBS and Roche. BK Vision and Pharma Vision, investment companies
controlled by BZ, have indicated in the past few weeks that they would
probably sell off their large holdings in Ciba and CS Holding.
Some analysts have also pointed to BZ as the source of an unusually high
level of activity in the shares of Nestle in the past few weeks. Nearly
SFr3.8bn in the food group's shares were traded in January, more than double
the monthly average last year. The price, at SFr1,367 yesterday, is up by
nearly 7 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Food Vision, anyone?

FT  18 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Buba relaxes policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday surprised the market by announcing a 0.5 per cent
cut in the discount rate, confirming the outlook of lower interest rates in
Europe, writes Philip Gawith.
Although initially received with euphoria, the market later took a more
cautious stance with the manner of the rate move raising the prospect of a
fairly slow fall in rates. Although the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
5.25 per cent, it left its key repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent.
The effect of this is to improve the climate in Europe for the easing of
monetary policy, without offering much indication as to the pace at which
this will take place.
The German example was followed by the Dutch and Belgian central banks,
which both eased policy without making substantial cuts in rates.
The D-Mark weakened across the board in Europe. It closed in London at
FFr3.394 compared to FFr3.407 on Wednesday, and at L968.7 against the
Italian lira from L974.1. Sterling finished in London nearly a pfennig
higher at DM2.5559, from DM2.5471.
The dollar was relatively unaffected yesterday by the German rate reduction
and the release of a raft of promising economic data. It ended in London at
DM1.734, a pfennig up from Wednesday's DM1.7219 close. It also rose against
the yen, to Y104.325 from Y103.550. In New York, however, the dollar slipped
back to finish at DM1.7222 and Y104.20.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the
Bundesbank had been afforded a 'window of opportunity' to ease policy by
good inflation figures and the recent strength of the D-Mark. He argued,
however, that the decision had been predicated on a recent 'deterioration in
atmosphere in bund markets and in European bond markets in general'.
Investors were getting restless about the slow pace at which German monetary
policy was easing. Many had bought German bunds earlier this year in
anticipation of making capital gains as interest rates fell. If this were to
translate into large-scale selling, the result would be to drive up
long-term interest rates, an indicator the Bundesbank watches closely, and
jeopardise future investment plans.
Frustration in the bund market was threatening to spread into currencies
too. Mr Chertkow said that earlier in the week market movements had
resembled those of July last year, with the market being purely technical in
orientation and removed from economic fundamentals. He said yesterday's move
had probably averted this scenario.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
the Bundesbank had wanted to reassure markets that it had not departed from
its long-term path of lower rates, in spite of concern over the unresolved
IG Metall wage dispute and the expectation of poor January money supply
figures. He said the effect of cutting the discount rate was to put a floor
under the bond markets.
The market's reaction yesterday to the headline announcement - a rate cut -
was euph-oric. But when it later transpired that the repo rate had not been
changed, disappointment set in and some of the gains in the bond and futures
markets were given back.
In Europe, Belgium cut its equivalent of the repo rate by only 15 basis
points. The Dutch left their repo equivalent - the special advances rate -
unchanged, while trimming two other rates. Austria, which is not a member of
the ERM, cut its discount and Lombard rates by  1/4 percentage point.
The D-Mark maintained its strength fairly well against the dollar, although
it was weaker against European currencies. Mr Persaud predicted that the
dollar was likely to continue trading in a similar range against the D-Mark,
especially as weather-affected US data would probably inhibit the Federal
Reserve from tightening policy in the near term.
US consumer prices came in better than expected as they were unchanged in
January compared with market expectations of a 0.3 per cent increase. The
trade figures were also good, the deficit narrowing to Dollars 7.41bn in
December from Dollars 9.68bn in November. The deficit with Japan shrunk by
more than 7 per cent to Dollars 5.302bn.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at International Bank of Japan noted,
however, that the deficit was still a record size and that US politicians
would probably use this number to advantage.
Mr Chertkow said the dollar was still being driven by the US-Japan trade
dispute and predicted that it would remain weak against most currencies
until this had resolved itself. He said there was a perception in the US
that talking up the dollar was a 'free trade' in the sense that it was
unlikely to have any serious domestic repercussions.
Clarity about US/Japan relations is likely to come later this month as it is
sure to feature high up on the agenda for the G7 meeting on February 26.
Conditions in the UK money markets were fairly easy yesterday after the Bank
of England removed most of an estimated Pounds 2.1bn liquidity shortage in
an early round of dealing. The Bank put Pounds 1.75bn of liquidity into the
market through two repos at the prevailing interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent.
The shortage was later revised up to Pounds 2.2bn and the Bank put a further
Pounds 450m into the market.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand pushes wood pulp to
strong recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After almost four years in the doldrums, wood pulp prices are staging an
unexpectedly strong rebound.
Northern softwood bleached kraft pulp, the industry's benchmark product, is
changing hands in Europe and North America at the list price of USDollars
460 a tonne, compared with a deeply-discounted Dollars 390-400 at the start
of the year. And producers have announced another increase, to Dollars 510,
to take effect in March and April.
Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a
Massachusetts-based research firm, said yesterday that some business was
already being done at that level as paper-makers and users scramble to
rebuild depleted inventories. 'The demand side is running really hot right
now,' Mr Young said.
Observers doubt, however, whether the recent surge can be sustained. Mr Jaap
van der Geest, analyst at ABN-Amro in Amsterdam, described the jump in
prices as a 'hiccup'. He noted that growth in paper consumption was slow,
and that wood pulp was increasingly being replaced by recycled material.
The upturn in prices began in the hardwood pulp market last December when
birch log supplies to Scandinavian mills were disrupted by transport
bottlenecks in Russia. Since then, demand has been fuelled by factors
including the economic upswing, fears of a summer strike by British Columbia
pulp-mill workers and a delay in the construction of large pulp mills in
Indonesia.
The tightening trend was exacerbated by the low level of producer
inventories following shutdowns at many mills during 1993. According to the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian pulp mills, which make up
about a quarter of total world supplies, had 26 days' supply on hand last
December, compared with 31 days' a year earlier.
However, the recent rush for supplies has encouraged many producers to bring
moth-balled capacity back into operation.

tax burden

<TEXT>
Norwegian petroleum authorities have rejected calls made by a
government-appointed working group for an easing in the country's stringent
tax regime
The working group, established last May, warned that a major overhaul of
petroleum operations to cut industry costs by up to 50 per cent over a
five-year period would be necessary if Norway was to remain competitive with
other producing nations once crude oil production fell sharply in the
mid-1990s.
Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently produces about 2.4m
barrels of crude a day.
In a report delivered on Wednesday to Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and
energy minister, Mr Torleif Enger, leader of the group and an executive with
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest listed company, said it could already be
possible for oil companies operating in Norway to reduce costs by up to 30
per cent for fields now being developed by implementing measures such as
standardising equipment for field developments, improving cost analyses,
reducing documentation and duplication of engineering.
But the report said that current profitability of operations on the
Norwegian continental shelf was not sufficient to secure the competitive
position of the shelf internationally.
Mr Stoltenberg expected to respond to the report in a white paper on the
future of Norway's petroleum industry, due to be presented to the Storting
in a few weeks. But he said this would not address complaints about the tax
regime. The report said that while oil prices were significantly lower than
at the time the tax regime was established in 1975, the tax level was
significantly higher.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price steadies after
touching five-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil price oscillated sharply yesterday after hitting a new five-year low
of Dollars 12.92 late on Wednesday in New York.
At London's International Petroleum Exchange the April Brent crude contract
began trading at Dollars 12.96 a barrel, a new low for the IPE, though it
recovered to Dollars 13.20 in late afternoon. On the European physical
market Brent crude for April delivery also dipped below the Dollars 13 mark
before recovering to Dollars 13.36 a barrel in early evening, up 5 cents on
the day.
The new low represented, in real terms, the lowest price that oil had
reached since the first oil shock of 1973, according to analysts.
Traders said there were no particular developments to account for the latest
bout of volatility.
The markets still showed underlying weakness because of the failure of the
recent spell of exceptionally cold weather in the US to drive the price up.
However trading volumes were thin because of the absence of many traders at
this week's London meeting of the Petroleum Institute.
Mr Jeremy Hudson at Lehman Brothers said he believed the market could still
test a Dollars 12.50 low, though he expected the price to head back over
Dollars 15 later in the year because supplies might be constrained.
Mr Paul Gignoux of Smith Barney said that additional factors behind the
recent weakness were the conspicuous economic problems of certain members of
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, notably Iran and
Venezuela, which meant that it would be hard for producers to curb output.
An Opec official was quoted in London as saying that while the price fall
was alarming, the organisation had no plans to advance its next planned
ministerial meeting on March 25. It was the failure of Opec ministers to
come up with a convincing production plan at their last meeting in November
that began the latest slide.
Some Opec ministers repeated their calls yesterday for action by non-Opec
producers, particularly those operating in the North Sea, to curb their
production.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rice - the next generation /
Scientists are pinning their hopes on an entirely new variety that could
increase yields by 20-25 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the dramatic rise in the world price of rice - by almost 100 per cent
since last September - could stimulate increased production, scientists at
the Manila-based International Rice Research Institute are warning that
existing rice varieties are unlikely to yield more.
The high-yielding varieties developed in the late 1960s - under the so
called 'green revolution' - have peaked, the scientists say. 'Increases in
rice production have flowed dramatically since 1985 in the 10 countries that
account for 85 per cent of world production,' says IRRI economist Mr Mahabub
Hossain.
Nearly 90 per cent of all the world's rice is grown and eaten in Asia; about
60 per cent is under irrigation. Only about 3 per cent of global output is
traded internationally.
Scientists are now pinning their hopes on a completely new rice plant that
could yield 20-25 per cent more than existing irrigated varieties.
According to the IRRI's estimates, rice output will have to increase by 70
per cent in the next 25 years to keep up with demand. This means that an
extra 350m tonnes a year will have to be grown. But because of competing
demands on resources in the year 2020 rice will have to be grown on less
land, using less water.
Most rice in Asia grows standing in water, but it appears that the water
robs soil of oxygen and eventually erodes its fertility. IRRI scientists
estimate that in southern Asia alone, about 10m hectares of highly
productive rice land - 10 per cent of the global area under irrigated rice -
is showing signs of fatigue.
'Under submerged conditions, there appears to be a reduction in the amount
of nitrogen the soil can provide to the crop,' explains Mr Ken Cassman, head
of IRRI's agronomy, plant physiology and agroecology division.
The new rice could help solve this problem. To develop the variety IRRI
scientists searched the Institute's extensive collection of germplasm for
the characteristics they wanted in the new plant. Some samples, for example,
can make good use of naturally available nitrogen; some can produce a larger
number of grains per panicle - the part of the plant that carries the rice
grain; others have good resistance to pest and plant diseases.
By crossing these samples, scientists combined the traits to produce the
plant they wanted. This is now being tested in IRRI's fields and the crop is
due to be harvested this May.
IRRI's chief plant breeder, Mr Gurdev Khush, says that the new rice plant
'differs from existing varieties in several ways. It has fewer tillers
(stems) but larger panicles'. He hopes that the new plant will yield up to
12-12.5 tonnes a hectare under irrigated conditions.
Mr Khush admits there are several problems the new plant may face - taste,
for example. As taste preferences vary from country to country the new rice
will have to adapt to local requirements.
IRRI's deputy director-general in charge of research, Mr Ken Fischer,
believes that with more research the new rice could yield up to 15 tonnes a
hectare within a decade, half as much again as existing varieties.
There could be even larger gains from rain-fed lowland areas. Some 38m
hectares of lowland rice in Asia - 40 per cent of the total area under rice
 -have no irrigation. Rice production in most of Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Eastern India and Laos depends on the rain.
The 'green revolution' has bypassed farmers in these areas. They continue to
grow traditional varieties that yield only 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes a hectare. Poor
soils and adverse climate - sometimes both drought and floods in the same
cropping season - make for limited incomes, which means farmers cannot
afford to purchase inputs such as fertilisers. A variation of the new rice
plant is being developed for these areas.
Because local conditions vary a great deal, research for this plant has been
done by rice institutes in the countries where lowland rice is dominant. The
first plant will be tested later this year in Eastern India.
Mr Robert Zeigler, leader of IRRI's rain-fed lowland rice ecosystem
programme, says the rain-fed area plant will need to yield well, develop a
good root system, tolerate drought and submersion under water and be able to
cope with weeds.
'If we can develop the right traits,' he says, 'then farmers will be more
inclined to invest in fertiliser and increase their yields.' He believes
that the research could bring significant results within the next five years
and that yields from rain-fed lowlands could triple, to over 5 tonnes a
hectare.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals prices more volatile -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's rise in base metal markets continued yesterday but trading
became more active and markets more volatile as the higher levels brought in
trade and chart-based selling and profit-taking.
COPPER at one stage looked to be headed for a test of resistance around
Dollars 1,920 a tonne for three months delivery, which would have signalled
a run-up to this year's high near Dollars 1,940. But determined selling sent
the price back to Dollars 1,906 a tonne before it steadied in after hours
trading to Dollars 1,910, up Dollars 14 on the day and Dollars 64.50 on the
week so far.
The ALUMINIUM market was encouraged as VAW and Hoogovens became the latest
companies to contribute output cuts in line with the agreement reached by
world producers in Brussels last month. The three months price traded up
Dollars 28 to Dollars 1,315 a tonne before ending Dollars 1 below the peak.
ZINC continued to track copper and aluminium but was also encouraged by its
own constructive chart pattern. The three months price ended at Dollars 990
a tonne, up Dollars 13, after reaching Dollars 992 during the day.
Among the precious metals PLATINUM was fixed in the afternoon at a fresh
six-month high of Dollars 404.50 a troy ounce, Dollars 3.75 up from
Wednesday, as support continued to be derived from apprehension about
possible disruption during the South African elections. GOLD closed Dollars
2.50 up at Dollars 386 and ounce and cash SILVER gained 8 cents at Dollars
5.34 1/2 an ounce.
Gold's firmness was encouraged by the Bundesbank's half per cent discount
rate cut and news of only a 0.1 per cent January rise in the UC consumer
price index, compared with a forecast rise of 0.3 per cent. But some London
dealers thought it would be a 'false move' for gold to rally now as it had
not fully tested its apparently solid support under Dollars 380 an ounce.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ploughed higher in the
afternoon, boosted by a more buoyant New York market following Wednesday's
technically inspired setback. But the near May position encountered
difficulty in breaking through the previous high of Dollars 1,228 a tonne
where it peaked before closing Dollars 14 up at Dollars 1,227. COCOA futures
recovered after a weaker morning.

FT  18 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool sales held in the past week presented a mixed picture. Superfine
merinos were dearer at Australian sales which included limited offerings of
these categories. With future supplies this season negligible and little
held in stock competition was intense, even while demand for other merinos
tended to ebb a little. The overall Australian market indicator ended the
week at 523 cents, 23 cents below its peak earlier this month. Wool sold
well in New Zealand and South Africa meanwhile, and special circumstances
helped to underline strength in prices paid for British wool, already
considered relatively dear internationally. The trade in general is showing
reluctance to sell more cheaply or act on the assumption that wool prices
may not rise further soon.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Sharp reversal in long-dated US Treasury
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury prices went into free-fall yesterday afternoon in a
sharp reversal from the morning's activity, when a tame reading on consumer
prices sparked a short-lived rally.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond plunged by 1 5/32 to
96 1/16 , after climbing as high as 97 7/8 early in the session.
Significantly, yields breached the psychological 6.5 per cent barrier,
jumping almost 9 basis points to 6.546 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 3/32 , to yield 4.472 per cent.
Analysts said the turnround reflected the market's extreme sensitivity since
the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy two weeks ago.
At first, prices at the long end surged after the Labor Department revealed
that its consumer price index was unchanged last month, while prices
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up a mere 0.1 per cent.
The results were a pleasant surprise for the market, which had expected a
0.3 per cent rise in both statistics. The data were a powerful indication
that inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-rate securities,
remained well under control in January.
The jubilant mood, however, was short-lived, as contradictory evidence
surfaced during the morning.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said the prices paid by manufacturers in
the region had increased sharply, with the so-called prices-paid index in
its February business outlook survey climbing to 30.4 in February, from 25.7
the previous month.
The news caused the long bond to turn in its tracks and retreat to near its
opening level by midday. Later the decline accelerated as speculative
accounts and dealers scrambled to unload positions.
With the Fed leaning toward a second strike on rates, traders saw danger
signals in the Philadelphia report, which contained the kind of long-term
price data which may trigger further action.
Europe's government bond markets had a volatile day, rallying smartly on the
Deutsche Bundesbank's discount-rate cut and lower-than-expected US inflation
numbers, and then sliding back on a late bout of profit-taking.
Despite Wednesday's upbeat monthly report from the German central bank, most
bond dealers were not expecting a rate cut and were taken by surprise when
the bank announced it was lowering its discount rate by 1/2 point to 5.25
per cent while leaving its repo rate unchanged at a fixed 6 per cent.
The German rate cut was followed by similar moves in Austria, Belgium and
The Netherlands, fuelling hopes that Italy and France would follow suit
soon.
'The easing process is back on track,' said Mr Klaus Baader, senior
international economist at Lehman Brothers in London. He expects only one
week of fixed-rate repos in Germany, before a return to variable-rate repos
paves the way for lower money market rates. While he said bond markets could
weaken in the near term following yesterday's sharp gains, he said that
prospects for continued easing would keep prices underpinned in coming
weeks.
Others were less sanguine. 'I'm bearish for bonds, and feel the next move
will be down,' said Mr Steve Major, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais in
Paris. 'The repo rate is still 6 per cent and it still costs us the same to
carry bond positions.'
He felt that the main boost for Europe's markets came from US January CPI
numbers which prompted a sharp rally in US Treasuries. When that succumbed
to profit-taking, European bonds fell with it.
German bund futures soared on the rate cut news and the Liffe bund futures
contract, which had opened at 98.62, rallied to a high of 99.30. However,
the market fell back later and the contract touched a low of 98.38 before
ending the day at 98.50.
Traders said the bulk of trading took place in the futures pits, with cash
activity very limited. 'In these fast markets, most investors are afraid of
getting their fingers burnt,' said one trader.
UK gilts had a similarly volatile day, with cash bond prices ending steady
to slightly higher. Trading was largely futures-driven. The March long gilt
futures contract, which opened at 116.08, rose to a high of 117.01 and ended
the day at around 116.03.
The Italian bond market, which suffered the worst losses in recent days,
posted substantial gains on hopes for a near-term cut in interest rates.

A tame reading on consumer prices sparked a rally in the US Treasury market
early yesterday morning, but bonds gave back most of their gains when a
regional report on business activity suggested inflation was on the rise.
By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up just  1/32 at 97 1/4
, after climbing as high as 97 7/8 earlier in the session. The yield slipped
to 6.455 per cent.
At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year note was unchanged at 99
7/32 , with the yield holding at 4.404 per cent.
Prices at the long end of the curve surged after the Labor Department
revealed that its consumer price index was unchanged last month, while
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up a mere 0.1 per
cent.
The results were a pleasant surprise for the market, which was expected a
0.3 per cent rise in both statistics. The data was a powerful indication
that inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-rate securities, stayed
well under control in January.
The jubilant mood, however, was short-lived, as contradictory evidence on
inflation surfaced during mid-morning. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said
the prices paid by manufacturers in the region had increased sharply, with
the so-called prices-paid index in its February business outlook survey
climbing to 30.4 in February, from 25.7 the previous month.
The news caused the long bond to turn in its tracks and retreat to near its
opening level. The market apparently took no comfort in a slight decline in
overall business activity, nor in the possibility that harsh winter weather
could have introduced distortions into the data.
The sudden shift was partially explained by the failure of retail accounts
to re-enter the market after the favourable CPI data, as they had been
expected to do. Trading was confined to dealers and speculative accounts,
and the lack of liquidity appeared to have exaggerated the price swings.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: First African issue of US CP
from supranational bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PTA Bank, a supranational bank which promotes trade in eastern and southern
Africa, is set to become the first African issuer to enter the US commercial
paper (CP) market today when it issues around Dollars 13.7m worth of
asset-backed CPs.
PTA, whose full name is Eastern and Southern Africa Trade and Development
Bank, was set up in 1985 and has 14 shareholders including the African
Development Bank, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Burundi, where the
bank is located.
Today's issuance will be drawn from its Dollars 500m CP programme which is
fully backed by a cash collateral account held in Bermuda. The programme is
designed to protect CP holders from African risk, said Mr Francis Daniels, a
senior adviser at Aidoo Group, a New York-based financial advisory group
specialising in representing African governments and companies.
Although PTA Bank is unrated, the structure of the programme has enabled it
to secure a CP rating of A-1 plus from Standard &amp; Poor's and F-1 plus from
Fitch. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are the dealers for the programme.
The proceeds will be used to support the bank's trade loans.
The move towards democracy in South Africa has turned international investor
attention to Africa but the depth of interest is far from clear. Earlier
this year, a structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo intended to
raise Dollars 600m from international investors, had to be re-vamped and
relaunched due to lack of demand for the original deal.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Portuguese withholding tax
changes approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal yesterday approved changes to its fiscal system to enable
non-resident investors to receive an automatic refund of the 20 per cent
withholding tax which is levied on Portuguese government bonds.
Although Portugal has double-taxation treaties with most countries, many
foreigners have been deterred from buying Portuguese government bonds in the
past because of the lengthy procedure involved in reclaiming the tax which
is levied on the coupons.
The widely-expected fiscal reform, which will apply to around Dollars 6bn
worth of Portuguese government bonds listed on the Lisbon stock exchange, is
part of the government's efforts to develop its domestic capital markets and
attract more foreign investment.
Modelled on the Belgian system for refunding the tax to non-residents, the
changes should also improve secondary market trading in Portuguese
government bonds because dealers will be able to quote the coupons gross of,
rather than net of, the withholding tax. The system should come into
operation within a few weeks, once the decree is signed.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sony pre-tax profits rise 6.8%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A glimmer of hope that consumer confidence was on the upturn appeared in
third-quarter results from Sony, the consumer electronics company which
reported a 6.8 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits in the three
months to last December. However, at the net level, profits plunged 38 per
cent to Y16.8bn (Dollars 154m).
Sony said a rise in demand for new electronics products had helped it to
post better pre-tax profits of Y56.5bn compared with Y52.8bn in the previous
third quarter in spite of sluggish markets in Japan and Europe.
During an important quarter, when the company makes a large proportion of
its sales, Sony saw increased demand from consumers for many of its new
electronics products such as wide screen television, car navigation systems,
CD-ROM drives and MiniDiscs.
As a result, while overall sales were adversely affected by the strong rise
of the yen, falling 3.7 per cent to Y1,067bn the company saw increases in
unit sales of important products, including personal stereos, televisions
and CD players.
In Japan, Sony increased sales by 2.8 per cent as a result of greater demand
for new audio products.
Striking out currency fluctuations, Sony's consolidated sales would have
increased by about Y132bn in the third quarter, or 8.2 per cent, the company
said.
US sales of electronics rose 15 per cent while that of music rose 46 per
cent in dollar terms. However, its films division posted an 11 per cent
decline in sales.
Cost-cutting benefited Sony's operating profits, which rose 18.4 per cent to
Y70.19bn against Y59.29bn. But pre-tax income was depressed by a Y131m
foreign exchange loss as a result of the yen's weakening in the third
quarter. Net income was 38 per cent down to Y16.8bn compared with Y27.1bn.
Sony revised its consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March, up to
Y100bn from a forecast Y87bn due to expected stronger electronic sales.
However, net income is revised down to Y20bn from Y30bn.
Pioneer, the audio-visual company, suffered a 16.5 per cent drop in
consolidated sales for the third quarter to Y139.85bn, from Y167.48bn,
largely as a result of depressed demand in Japan and the yen's rise against
other currencies.
Pre-tax profits plunged 74 per cent to Y2.99bn against Y11.43bn and
operating profits were down 79 per cent to Y2.53bn.
The company revised downwards its profits forecast for the year to March
1994. Pioneer expects parent sales to be Y328bn rather than Y349bn as
forecast earlier and pre-tax profits to be Y1.4bn rather than Y7bn. Net
profit is revised down to Y600m from Y4.7bn.

National Australia Bank said it had sold its 4.5 per cent stake in local
rival Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), AP-DJ reports from
Melbourne.
National Australia said in a statement it sold 30.6m ordinary or common
shares at ADollars 5.635 each, representing about 2.3 per cent of ANZ's
issued shares. The bank has entered into a call option arrangement for the
sale of the balance of its ANZ stake.
National Australia bought its 50m shares in ANZ in 1989 as part of a
strategic link-up or possible merger between the two commercial banks.
However, in 1992 the Australian government declared it would oppose any
merger between the four leading local commercial banks in the interests of
maintaining competition in the financial sector.

Woolworths, the Australian retailer, is on line to match forecasts released
in the prospectus for its 1993 public float after a solid first-half sales
and earnings performance.
The company yesterday announced a net profit increase of 15.5 per cent to
ADollars 109.9m (USDollars 78.5m) from ADollars 95.2m in the 28 weeks to
January 9 on a 12 per cent sales rise to ADollars 6.15bn from ADollars
5.48bn.
Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said the company would pay a dividend
of 6 cents a share and was well positioned to match prospectus forecasts of
a ADollars 188m net profit and ADollars 310m gross profit for the full year.
The latest result was held back by a rise to ADollars 15.2m from ADollars
2.3m in net interest payments, reflecting the cost of refinancing in last
year's public float.
Tax provided was down to ADollars 55.3m from ADollars 62.5m because of a
lower corporate tax rate while depreciation rose to ADollars 62.5m from
ADollars 60.7m.
The bulk of the company's earnings continued to come from its supermarkets
where sales increased by 12.2 per cent to ADollars 5.21bn and gross earnings
rose 10.3 per cent to ADollars 168.5m.
The general merchandise division lifted sales by 8.5 per cent to ADollars
770.7m and gross earnings by 9.5 per cent to ADollars 38.1m while the
specialty retail group increased sales by 14.2 per cent to ADollars 168.9m
and gross profit by 26.4 per cent to ADollars 12.9m.
Ampolex, the Australian petroleum producer, has again passed the interim
dividend after lower crude oil prices cut into earnings in the six months to
December.
Net profit fell 10.5 per cent to ADollars 26.7m from ADollars 29.8m in the
period in spite of a 2.5 per cent increase in revenues to ADollars 187m from
ADollars 182.6m.
Interest expense rose to ADollars 18.2m from ADollars 15.5m and depreciation
was up to ADollars 71.4m from ADollars 51.9m. Tax provision was down to
ADollars 25.4m from ADollars 37.6m.

Burns Philp, the Australian food group, has expanded in Europe with the
purchase of Karl Ostmann, the German herbs and spices producer, for DM182m
(Dollars 107m) plus a working capital adjustment expected to be about DM20m.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, Burns Philp managing director, said yesterday Ostmann
had gross annual sales of DM190m, exported to 30 countries and controlled
subsidiaries in the UK and South Africa. Latest annual net profit was
DM5.5m.
The purchase would lift Burns Philp's herbs and spices sales by about 25 per
cent.
'Such benefits include synergies in raw materials sourcing and packaging,
sharing of manufacturing and marketing skills, increased distribution
efficiencies, an expanded customer network and optimal utilisation of
production facilities,' Mr Turnbull said.
Burns Philp entered the European market in 1982 and controls brands
including Fleischmanns, Euroma, Cornwells and Durkee.
Goodman Fielder, the Australian food group, had no comment to stock exchange
reports yesterday that it was negotiating to take a 15 per cent stake in
Bunge, the Dutch food group.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Germany halts plans to
upgrade bourse technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ambitious plans to upgrade share dealing technology on the German stock
exchanges have been put on ice, the chief executive of the Deutsche Borse
said yesterday.
Mr Werner Seifert, giving his first press briefing since he took over last
summer as chief executive of the the German stock-exchange, said the
priority for the current year would be to improve the exchange's operating
efficiency.
A decision on whether to replace open outcry stock markets with full-scale
electronic trading systems - as recommended by a consultants' report which
has been under consideration for at least 18 months - would not be taken
before the beginning of 1995 at the earliest, he said.
'We asked ourselves whether we should bet everything on the electronic
trading card, as London bet everything on Taurus (the failed electronic
settlement system),' Mr Seifert explained, 'and came to the conclusion that
we could have landed flat on our face.'
His remarks indicate a pause in the scale of investment in technology in the
German securities markets.
In the past three years, investment in equity dealing and settlement
technology has totalled DM100m (Dollars 59m) while a further DM150m has been
spent on the development of the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the screen-based
futures and options exchange which came into existence four years ago.
In a candid comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the stock markets
of London and Germany, he said that the German markets suffered because
turnover was split between eight different exchanges.
However, the perceived regulatory deficiencies in the German market would be
tackled by the introduction of the second Finanzmarktforderungs-gesetz - the
second financial markets promotion act - which is due to be enacted this
year. This will make insider dealing a criminal offence and introduce a
regulatory body for the German securities markets.
He said the exchange's main priority must be to ensure that dealing in
D-Mark related products must be conducted in Germany rather in London.
At present, Germany conducted 90 per cent of turnover in German equities, he
added, better than for some other continental European countries where
London's share was higher.
A full-scale strategy for the future of the Deutsche Borse would be
developed this year. At present, Mr Seifert explained, the priority was an
internal 'fitness cure' for the Deutsche Borse which was likely to mean
redundancies for some of the 1,200 staff.
The Deutsche Borse came into being at the beginning of last year. It is the
holding company for the Frankfurt stock exchange, which accounts for the
overwhelming bulk of German share trading, and the DTB as well as the
Kassen-verein settlement agency. The other seven regional stock exchanges
own a stake in the Deutsche Borse but retain their status as independent
organisations.

with shake-up

<TEXT>
Mr Barry Diller, chairman of television shopping group QVC Network,
yesterday shrugged off his defeat on Monday in the Dollars 10bn takeover
battle for Paramount Communications, and announced a wide-ranging shake-up
of management structure and senior staff.
He named Mr Douglas Briggs, a direct marketing expert and a key player in
QVC's development as a cable-TV home shopping network, to the new position
of president, QVC electronic retailing.
Mr Briggs said since its launch seven years ago, QVC had operated primarily
as a single-channel television shopping service. It now planned to evolve
into a multi-line business which would 'fill the multimedia spectrum with
services'.
Mr Michael Boyd, president of QVC and a co-founder of the company, is
retiring. His position will not be filled. Mr Diller said Mr Boyd had wanted
to step down some time ago, but was persuaded to stay on while QVC pursued
Paramount.
The group, which is shortening its name to QVC Inc, said its new lifestyle
shopping channel, Q2, would begin operating on weekends in May. It was also
establishing a new division, QDirect, to produce direct response television
advertisements and 30-minute advertising programmes.
QDirect would explore joint ventures with other cable and broadcast
networks.
Fitch Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said yesterday Viacom's
success in the Paramount takeover continued to raise uncertainty over its
ability to retain its Triple-B-Minus senior debt rating.
Factors affecting the rating included the new entity's ability to generate
cashflow to reduce post-merger debt leverage within 12 months; its ability
to integrate the diverse operations; and uncertainly over Viacom's proposed
bid for Blockbuster Entertainment.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong demand helps Navistar
stay in the black
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for trucks and diesel engines carried Navistar International
into the black for a second consecutive quarter.
The Chicago-based manufacturer, formerly known as International Harvester,
yesterday revealed net income of Dollars 16m, or 12 cents a share, in the
first quarter to the end of January.
The result reverses a Dollars 228m deficit in the corresponding first
quarter of 1992-93. Excluding the effect of accounting changes, the company
realised earnings of Dollars 2m in the year-earlier quarter.
Consolidated sales jumped 9 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn, against Dollars
1.04bn last year, as Navistar continued to benefit from the sharpest upturn
in the US truck market for over a decade.
Retail deliveries for 19,200 heavy and medium-duty trucks and school-bus
chassis climbed 14 per cent in the quarter, while shipments of diesel
engines were 17 per cent ahead of 1992-93 levels.
The results extended a string of encouraging performances which began last
spring, when Navistar edged back in profitability after 10 consecutive
quarterly losses.
The red ink resurfaced in the three months to the end of July, but the
Dollars 312m loss reflected a one-time charge relating to a pivotal
agreement with union members to reduce post-retirement benefits.
In the quarter to end-October, the company surprised analysts with net
income of Dollars 22m, or 22 cents a share.
Yesterday Wall Street marked the stock up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 .
The company's recent financial restructuring, part of the benefit
settlement, made earnings forecasts and comparisons difficult.
With demand showing no signs of flagging in the current quarter, the company
lifted its forecasts for the 1993-94 fiscal year.
Industry sales of trucks weighing more than 33,000lbs are expected to reach
185,000, up from the company's previous estimate of 160,000. The figure
would represent an 11 per cent increase on fiscal 1992-93, when 166,000
units were sold.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Losses cut at Gulf Canada
Resources

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gulf Canada Resources, 70 per cent controlled by its lenders for the past
two years, reduced losses sharply in 1993 while maintaining oil and gas
production at high levels.
Gulf Canada was acquired by the Reichmann family as a property
diversification in the mid-1980s, but after the failure of their Olympia &amp;
York Developments, the banks took control. The Reichmanns had pledged their
Gulf Canada shares as collateral for USDollars 2.5bn in loans.
The company has since been restructured through asset sales and heavy cuts
in manning, but has retained some international projects, especially in
south-east Asia. The 1993 loss was CDollars 31m (USDollars 23m) or 37 cents
a share, compared with a deficit of CDollars 252m, or CDollars 1.85, after
special charges in 1992. Revenues were CDollars 702m, against CDollars 827m.
Net debt was reduced 28 per cent to CDollars 947m. A USDollars 300m 10-year
subordinated debenture issue was completed this January to continue the debt
reduction programme.
The lenders' shares in Gulf Canada are held through A&amp;G Resources, a company
formed by a group of O&amp;Y lenders, and will eventually be sold.
The sharp fall in oil prices is, however, the latest challenge to Gulf
Canada's recovery.

Neiman Marcus, the US fashion retailer, lifted net profits by 22 per cent to
Dollars 21.5m in its second quarter to January 29. The group was helped by
strong sales in its Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores and its NM
Direct catalogue division.
It said the stores and catalogue had a particularly good Christmas, but
there were disappointing performances from the Contempo Casuals and Pastille
units, both of which increased losses.
Store closings due to the Californian earthquake hindered their performance.
Turnover rose to Dollars 650.7m from Dollars 617.2m and earnings per share
to 37 cents from 27 cents. For the first half, net income rose to Dollars
36.7m from Dollars 33.7m and earnings per share to 58 cents from 51 cents.
Mr Robert Tarr, president and chief executive, said the company expected the
usual net loss in the second half.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Thirst quencher with a European
appetite - Cott Corporation is bringing its private-label colas across the
Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European shoppers will soon be able to slake their thirst with new
private-label colas from the supermarkets, courtesy of Cott Corporation, a
Canadian group which has taken the North American market by storm.
Its soft-drink brands are likely to be cheaper than Coca-Cola or Pepsi and
offer retailers a more generous profit margin. The products mark the
European debut of Cott, a Toronto-based company whose private-label drinks
have been enthusiastically received in Australia and South Africa as well as
North America.
Cott has gained a toe-hold in Europe through two recent deals.
Cadbury-Schweppes, hitherto a sworn enemy of private labels, surprised the
industry by making capacity available to Cott at under-utilised bottling
plants on the Continent. In the UK, Cott has bought control of the canning
operations of Benjamin Shaw &amp; Sons, the soft-drinks subsidiary of Rutland
Trust.
Mr Simon Lester, a former Schweppes consultant who now heads Cott's European
operations, hopes Cott products will win a 5 per cent to 10 per cent share
of the UK market within two years. Talks with one supermarket chain,
rumoured to be J. Sainsbury, are at an 'advanced stage'.
'Once we get to the market,' he says, 'they will make more money on their
private labels and they'll make more money from the national brands.'
He predicts that Coke, Pepsi and other brand-name bottlers will be forced to
offer wider margins to retailers if they want to keep their shelf space.
To its fans, Cott is clear proof the new generation of retailer-controlled
grocery brands has the established brand names on the run. The company's
sales have rocketed from CDollars 43m (USDollars 32m) in the fiscal year to
January 27 1990 to around CDollars 700m in the past 12 months. Cott's market
value is CDollars 2.3bn, and its shares are trading at more than 80 times
projected 1994 earnings. A CDollars 1,000 investment in Cott shares just
three years ago would now be worth a tidy CDollars 119,000, including a
12-fold stock split.
'Among beverages, cola was most sheltered from imitators because they never
solved the problem of taste,' says Mr George Rosenbaum, president of Leo
Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago-based market research company. 'Cott has
succeeded in doing this much better than anyone else.'
Buoyed by its success in the soft drinks market, Cott has expanded into
private-label beer and snack foods. Mr Howard Penney, analyst at Morgan
Stanley in New York, forecasts Cott's earnings will jump from 47 cents per
share in fiscal 1994 to 92 cents next year. 'There's still significant
growth in the US and tremendous potential internationally,' he says.
But there are also sceptics. Ms Jennifer Solomon, analyst at Mabon
Securities in New York, last month advised her clients to take profits. Coke
and Pepsi are fighting back, especially in Cott's key Ontario market, by
boosting retailers' margins and offering other incentives. Ms Solomon says
Cott has nudged analysts several times in recent months to lower their
earnings estimates.
Cott's critics are also unsettled by aspects of the company's background.
Its chairman, Mr Gerry Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a
Canadian trust and loan company - ended in a messy failure. Some analysts
question Cott's aggressive accounting practices, and, according to reports
to the Ontario Securities Commission, senior Cott executives have been heavy
sellers of the company's shares in recent months.
Cott's products, most of which appear under names chosen by its retailer
customers, are now sold in more than half of North America's top 100
supermarket chains, including Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer.
But Cott is more a marketer than a manufacturer. Although it owns a handful
of factories in North America, most of its output is contracted out to about
50 independent bottlers with spare capacity.
Cott's skill lies in working with retailers to produce a low-cost,
high-quality product tailored to their specific markets. For example, the
Cott cola sold through Wal-Mart carries the name Sam's American Choice Cola;
the label used for the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores is Classic
Selection.
A design subsidiary produces names and packaging for Cott beverages, as well
as for a variety of other retailer-controlled brands.
Ms Heather Reisman, Cott's president, says ebulliently the biggest risk is
that Cott will over-stretch by chasing too many of the opportunities now
available to it. 'A lot of people have seen what we're doing and want to be
involved in it,' she says.
But other threats cannot be overlooked. Ms Solomon notes that companies such
as Coke and Pepsi have dramatically narrowed the gap between brand-name and
private-label retail margins. She says store owners now have less incentive
than before to promote private-label products at the expense of national
brands.
Ms Reisman disagrees. 'I don't believe that (the brand-name companies) can
sustain some of the more aggressive activity on a long-term basis with the
cost structures that they have,' she says.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bond issue by Turkish telephone
group

<TEXT>
Turkey has mandated a group of international banks to issue Dollars 2bn
worth of convertible bonds in the state telephone monopoly PTT to overcome
legal obstacles preventing its privatisation.
The move, which bankers describe as a pre-funding for the privatisation, is
evidence of the urgency being given to Turkey's sell-off programme, as the
government seeks to narrow the budget deficit.
Earlier proposals separating the PTT into its post and telephone arms, the
first step to selling the telecommunications company, were blocked by the
courts on appeal from opposition politicians.
The newly appointed privatisation chief, Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, unveiled an
ambitious target to sell Dollars 20bn worth of government companies before
the end of 1995.
S. G. Warburg and Morgan Stanley were appointed joint global co-ordinators
for the PTT convertible issue, while IndoSuez, the French bank, and Lehman
Bros, of the US are co-lead managers.
The bonds will be convertible into shares in the company only after the
privatisation. They will provide immediate budget revenues but will also
represent a liability for the government when Turkey faces foreign public
and private debt put at Dollars 64bn.
Bankers expect the issue to target risk-averse investors looking for high
yield paper rather than capital growth - hitherto the main attraction of
emerging markets like Turkey's. Some economists remain sceptical of the
benefits of the convertible, which could limit the scope of any future
privatisation of PTT.
In a further indication of the impetus being given to the programme, the
Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling state
asset sales, this week dusted off a three-year-old mandate agreed with
Credit Suisse First Boston to sell the government's estimated 51 per cent
stake in Eregli Demir Celik (Erdemir), the Black Sea-based iron and steel
works listed on the Istanbul exchange.
Erdemir, Turkey's only flat rolled steel producer, is investing Dollars 2bn
in a modernisation programme. The disposal, worth an estimated Dollars 500m,
could be complete by mid-1994.
A full registration with the New York Securities and Exchange Commission is
envisaged. CSFB is enlisting Turkish brokers to handle the secondary
offering on the local Istanbul market.

Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor, overcame the recession and
regional price Wars in Canada to post a 17 per cent gain in profits for the
fiscal year ended January 1 1994.
Loblaw, controlled by the George Weston Group, reported net profit for the
year of CDollars 93.4m (USDollars 69.2m), or CDollars 1.07 a share, up from
CDollars 79.8m, or 88 cents, a year earlier. Consolidated sales rose 1 per
cent to CDollars 9.36bn. At the operating level, the results were strong in
both eastern and western Canada.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 26.1m, or 31 cents, down from CDollars
28.8m, or 33 cents, on sales of CDollars 2.2bn, a decline of 8 per cent.
The impact of a long strike in the US supermarket unit was taken mostly in
the fourth quarter. Cineplex, a North American cinema operator and film
distributor controlled by the Montreal Bronfmans, reported its first annual
operating profit since 1987.
However, after a special charge of USDollars 7.3m, there was a final loss of
Dollars 7.4m, or 7 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 41.3m, or 48
cents, in 1992, on sales of Dollars 546m, against Dollars 519m.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alliances still in the wind at
revamped SAS - Chief executive elect Jan Stenberg shares his vision for the
airline with Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jan Stenberg, who takes over shortly as chief executive at Scandinavian
Airlines System, is anxious to dispel the impression that the company is
retreating to its home base. He wants to kill the notion that it has
returned to lick the wounds inflicted by the collapse of Alcazar, the failed
four-way pan-European merger.
The lofty ambitions of Mr Jan Carlzon, whose 12 years as SAS chief crashed
with the Alcazar plan, have been scaled down due to 'the economic situation'
facing the loss-making airline. SAS is busy shedding non-core operations,
such as its travel agencies, credit card subsidiary and hotel ownership,
built up under the Carlzon vision of a 'global travel service system'.
However, Mr Stenberg, a senior executive at the telecommunications group
Ericsson, who will take over from Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's stop-gap
successor, on April 1, said SAS still wanted to be more than a small
regional airline. It planned to build through alliances.
Mr Carlzon's message - that SAS faces a tough battle if it is to survive and
thrive in an era of growing deregulation and competition, remains valid -
and is recognised by a new chief executive who has experienced similar
pressures in the telecommunications industry.
The scenario SAS and its advisers sketched out before launching the Alcazar
negotiations - that a stand-alone future for the airline could mean its
collapse within a decade - still holds. Equally, a merger with a large
carrier such as Lufthansa could be an option in the long term, Mr Stenberg
says.
However, his preference is for collaboration with 'a similarly-sized
company'. Initially, he wants to see if SAS's so-called 'European quality
alliance' co-operation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines - which, with KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines were partners in the doomed Alcazar enterprise - can be
'widened and deepened'. He says he has been invited for talks by both
airlines.
'In talks with other airlines, including those involved in the Alcazar
negotiations, I think we should work on a pattern of collaboration that will
make SAS associated in a bigger network than it is today,' he said.
Mr Stenberg is also keen to develop ties with British Midland Airways. SAS
owns 35 per cent of British Midland's parent company, and will increase its
stake to 40 per cent this year.
An eventual takeover of British Midland is not on the agenda for now, but is
'worthwhile to consider', Mr Stenberg says. 'With my background in the
tele-communications industry, I can see how interested PTTs are to go across
borders and buy into smaller companies, take over their telephone services
and integrate them. I think we'll see that trend also in the airline
industry.'
However, Mr Stenberg leaves no doubt about his aversion to any revival of
Alcazar-style merger schemes. 'To start up again now the discussion of a
physical merger - that would be a serious mistake,' he says.
As one of SAS's most frequent flyers - he has clocked up almost 250,000 SAS
bonus points over the past year - Mr Stenberg has been in a good position to
tune into the feelings of airline staff.
'I talk to people in this organisation - cabin attendants and so on - and
they tell me that for a long time they were questioned by passengers about
what they thought of Alcazar. They said they just didn't know what to say
because they could not imagine what Alcazar really meant.
'What I look for is how a collaboration can be established where the parties
can have joint financial interests in something which is not merged in the
physical or organisational meaning.'
Forging strategic partnerships is not the most urgent priority, however. Top
of the list, says Mr Stenberg, is returning SAS to profitability after four
straight years of losses.
The Scandinavian media has cast him as a hard man brought in to push through
a tough cost-cutting plan drawn up by Mr Reinas. The plan will mean SAS's
20,000-strong workforce being cut by 2,900 by the middle of next year,
saving SKr3bn (Dollars 375m) in costs.
Mr Stenberg insists the tough-guy image is exaggerated. However, he
pointedly refuses to endorse Mr Reinas's prediction that SAS will be back in
profit in 1994, and cannot be sure that further cost-cutting measures will
not be needed.
He is also gearing up for a radical restructuring within SAS, intended to
reduce duplication of functions in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. That could
unleash national political tensions that have always lurked behind the
serene Scandinavian image SAS projects to the world.
SAS is owned by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish companies, with an element of
state ownership in each. However, the siting of its headquarters in
Stockholm has often caused resentment in the other two countries. This could
intensify with a further concentration in the Swedish capital.
'Some people say SAS stands for Swedish All Swedish. That is an unfair view
if you look at how employment is now distributed between the three
countries,' Mr Stenberg says.
However, he insists that from now on economic efficiency only will dictate
how the operation is run. There will be no more 'trebling the functions in
order to build up a little castle in each country'.

Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing group, is bullish about prospects for
1994, Reuter reports from Chicago.
'Improving economies in the US and Europe, the availability of a number of
new products, low inventories at both the retail and distributor levels, and
an aggressive advertising and marketing campaign should allow us to reach
our sales objective,' said Mr William Farley, chairman.
He said the fourth-quarter results, with operating net income of 81 cents a
share, compared with 64 cents, were generally in line with expectations.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
M6, the French television station, will be floated on the Paris stock market
within the next few months, according to Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of
Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utility group which is its main shareholder.
Mr Monod, speaking on French radio, also voiced support for Mr Andre
Rousselet, who resigned on Monday as chairman of the Canal Plus television
group, in protest at the formation of a concert party by its largest
shareholders, Havas, Societe Generale and Lyonnaise. Mr Rousselet has since
been replaced as chairman by Mr Pierre Lescure, chief executive.
'It was an ambush,' said the Lyonnaise chairman, referring to a row that
erupted at an Havas board meeting last week when Mr Rousselet was told about
the deal. 'Mr Rousselet was right to lobby so strongly, and to say that he
had been betrayed and rejected.'
He said he had been discussing the concert party confidentially with Mr
Pierre Dauzier, chairman of Havas, and had not expected the announcement to
be made so soon. 'Why was there such a hurry?' he asked. He said: 'Canal
Plus has lost a great deal of its independence.'
The reshuffling of the Canal Plus stake and the M6 flotation form part of a
general restructuring of Lyonnaise's media interests. M6, in which Lyonnaise
has a 25 per cent holding, is set to join the stock market in the first half
of this year, although the details of the flotation have not yet been fixed.
Mr Monod said M6, which made net profits of FFr105m (Dollars 17.9m) on
turnover of FFr1.2bn in 1992, was a business whose ownership 'could be and
should be open to public'.
Lyonnaise also plans to launch cable channels. It is teaming up with France
Telecom on one project and plans to develop a home shopping format with TF1,
the biggest French terrestrial channel.

CS First Boston, the New York-based investment bank which underwent
significant management changes and a heavy structural reorganisation last
year, showed yesterday that the upheavals had little impact on
profitability.
The bank unveiled record annual net income of Dollars 328m for 1993. The
final result was a big improvement on the previous year, when CS First
Boston, a unit of the Swiss banking group CS Holdings, earned a
disappointing Dollars 175m.
Pre-tax income also rose sharply last year, climbing to Dollars 440m from
Dollars 277m in 1992. The firm said its return on common equity, a key
measure of profitability, was 32.1 per cent in 1993, and its capital rose 54
per cent to Dollars 4.65bn.
Like every other big Wall Street investment bank, CS First Boston benefited
greatly last year from low US interest rates, active domestic and
international stock and bond markets, and heavy demand from corporations
worldwide for underwriting and other investment banking services.
The firm said the largest contribution to profits came from the trading and
sales of fixed-income and derivative securities. Strong results from
underwriting debt and equity issues, especially those of newly-privatised
companies, also played a big part in the improvement in earnings.
Last year was marked by considerable change at CS First Boston. After years
of struggling to overcome the rivalries and confused corporate identity
created by having three separate units in New York, London and Tokyo, the
firm decided to reorganise its businesses on product, rather than
geographic, lines, and unify the global operations under a single name: CS
First Boston.
Also, there was change at the top of the firm when Mr Archibald Cox, head of
the New York unit, resigned following a spate of defections by top
investment bankers unhappy with their annual bonuses.
After Mr Cox's departure, CS First Boston appointed Mr Allen Wheat, who had
previously run the Tokyo operation and, later, the firm's highly-profitable
derivatives business, as its new president and chief operating officer.
He now reports to Mr John Hennessy, the chief executive.

The rush by many US homeowners to refinance their mortgages last year
fuelled a rise in net income at Transamerica, the San Francisco-based
financial services group, in the final quarter. The rush was driven by a
fall in long-term interest rates.
The refinancing wave boosted net income in the group's real estate services
operation to Dollars 23.2m, from Dollars 17.9m the year before.
This accounted for much of the rise in income from continuing operations in
the quarter, which was up at Dollars 95.9m from Dollars 86.9m the year
before.
Transamerica also said its life insurance business had performed strongly,
reporting net income (before investment gains) of Dollars 215.7m during 1993
as a whole, up from Dollars 190.8m.
The growth came on the back of a larger asset base, the company said. He
said it maintained its investment spreads in all product lines.
Other operations reported falls in net income. Consumer lending was held
back in part by a rise in credit losses, which climbed from 1.21 per cent of
receivables to 1.69 per cent during the year.
Commercial lending, although experiencing higher operating income, ended the
year with a net loss of Dollars 4m after writing down some assets. Leasing,
although slightly ahead at the operating level, recorded an 8 per cent fall
in net income due to the US tax changes.
For the fourth quarter, Transamerica's net income rose to Dollars 22.8m, or
24 cents a share, from Dollars 11.9m, or 6 cents, the year before. Included
in this was a charge of Dollars 23m for early retirement of debt, together
with a loss from discontinued operations of Dollars 50m, against Dollars 75m
the year before.
For the year as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 377.4m, or Dollars 4.51,
from Dollars 243.2m, or Dollars 2.83, in 1992. Income from continuing
operations, before investment results, was up 17 per cent on the year, to
Dollars 425.2m.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Barbarians knock at the gates of
the future of broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance it looks crazy that TeleCommunications Inc, the world's
largest cable television company, should want to buy a 20 per cent stake in
a modest ITV company broadcasting to Wales and the west of England.
After all, TCI of Denver is about to become a Dollars 60bn (Pounds 41bn)
concern through its merger with the Bell Atlantic telephone company, while
HTV was fighting for survival last year with pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.5m.
By coincidence the loss matched the annual bid the company made to see off
three rivals in the ITV franchise contest.
The deal involves Pounds 27m - a pittance compared with the hundreds of
millions being spent by ITV companies taking each other over. Yet the closer
you look, the more sense the deal makes.
'ITV is like a lake full of old pike eating each other. This is a completely
new additive. It is not cannibalism,' said Mr Adam Singer, vice president
international of TCI.
He said it was the first time in British commercial television that two
companies would be 'interacting across the whole spectrum of broadcasting,'
from conventional television to cable and satellite television.
The stake in HTV is being acquired by Flextech, the former oil services
company which Mr Roger Luard has transformed into a media group. Ironically
Flextech, the European investment vehicle for TCI, was an unsuccessful
bidder for the Wales and the West ITV licence.
Flextech through United Artists European Holdings, a wholly owned TCI
subsidiary, either controls or has an interest in 11 cable and satellite
channels, including The Children's Channel, Bravo, the classic films channel
and Discovery, the factual and documentary channel.
For HTV the advantages of the tie-up are enormous. At a stroke the company's
debt, now at a seasonal low of Pounds 19m, is virtually wiped out and there
is the chance of making programmes for the developing media market. If any
old ITV pike are circling, HTV would now prove an indigestible and expensive
bite.
But more important, as Mr Louis Sherman, the HTV chairman said yesterday, it
will help achieve the goal of 'forging alliances which will allow our
television business to grow beyond the limits of the ITV franchise'.
For Flextech the 20 per cent stake - the maximum permissible for a satellite
channel owner under existing rules - gives a first link with a conventional
broadcaster.
'We are terribly pleased as Visigoths to be allowed in to tour Rome for a
day,' commented Mr Singer. Apart from securing two seats on the board, the
'barbarians' of the new media have their eyes on HTV's production and
transmission facilities.
It is likely that some Flextech satellite channels will be packaged and
transmitted from Bristol or Cardiff. Local news programmes for cable
networks are also a possibility. TCI has a 50 per cent stake in Telewest,
the largest cable television group in the UK with 3.3m homes under franchise
including the Bristol area.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks to get final
audit data on Monday

<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks on Monday will receive the final version of an
investigative audit of the troubled leisure group's finances from KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm, and will then call a meeting with Euro Disney
to begin negotiations over its emergency financial restructuring.
Next week's meeting will follow a formal meeting in Paris earlier this week
in which the banks discussed preliminary proposals for the restructuring
with senior executives of Euro Disney and Walt Disney, the US entertainment
company that owns 49 per cent of its equity.
However, the banks had on Monday only seen a draft version of the KPMG
report, which analyses Euro Disney's current financial position and future
capital requirements. As a result they were not able to begin full-scale
discussions with the Disney camp.
KPMG yesterday confirmed that all Euro Disney's 60 banks will receive the
final audit on Monday thereby enabling them to begin formal negotiations at
a meeting later in the week.
The banks have formed a steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris
and Banque Indosuez, to negotiate directly with Euro Disney, advised by S.
G. Warburg in London, and Walt Disney, advised by Lazard Freres in New York.
Walt Disney has asked the banks to agree to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
(Dollars 3.39bn) debt through the combination of a rights issue and
debt-for-equity swap. However, the preliminary findings of the KPMG audit
suggest that Euro Disney will require a higher capital injection of between
FFr12bn and FFr13bn.
The banks are keen to ensure that the US group plays a larger part in the
restructuring. They plan to press Walt Disney to make concessions such as
reducing its royalty payments from Euro Disney which were worth FFr262m last
year.
The banks have also asked KPMG to scrutinise Euro Disney's corporate
strategy to assess whether there should be changes in senior personnel and
operating policy. KPMG declined to comment on whether it would be presenting
its corporate analysis on Monday alongside the financial audit.

Losses at Swedbank, the Nordic region's largest bank in asset terms,
narrowed sharply last year, helped by tough cost-cutting and reduced credit
losses.
Operating losses amounted to SKr3.66bn (Dollars 456m), SKr300m better than
forecast and SKr8.1bn lower than 1992's SKr11.75bn deficit.
Mr Goran Collert, chief executive, said the performance signalled the bank
was on the road to recovery, with good prospects of a positive result in
1994. He said Swedbank would be seeking a stock market listing in the spring
of 1995, subject to market conditions.
The main reason for the improved result was a sharp reduction in loan losses
to SKr11.7bn, or 3 per cent of group lending, from SKr18.5bn a year earlier.
The corporate sector remained the chief source of problems, accounting for
87 per cent of total write-offs.
A 2 per cent increase in revenues to SKr16.3bn and an 11 per cent drop in
expenses to SKr8.3bn also contributed to the recovery. Costs have been cut
by SKr1.5bn since 1991, following heavy reductions in personnel. Last year
the bank cut the number of full-time jobs by 1,330.
Net problem loans were also easing, the bank said. During 1993 they fell 20
per cent to end the year at SKr18.8bn, or 4.7 per cent of lending.
The bank will soon launch a SKr2.2bn share issue as part of plans to rebuild
its capital base without state support.
The stock exchange listing is designed to broaden the group's ownership
structure, while reducing the dominance of the 11 savings bank foundations
which are currently its main shareholders.
The long-term aim is for the savings bank sector and Swedish/foreign
institutions each to own 40 per cent of the bank's shares and customers the
remaining 20 per cent.

to raise NKr1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, has returned to the
black with net profits of NKr260m (Dollars 35m) in 1993 against losses of
NKr937.2m in the previous year. The bank also disclosed plans to raise up to
NKr1bn in fresh equity capital.
Crippled by massive losses, Fokus collapsed into the hands of the state in
1991 during Norway's biggest banking crisis since world war two which also
saw Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the country's two biggest
commercial banks, also forced to rely on state cash-injections to avoid
insolvency.
Fokus said that 1993 was the first year it had achieved a full-year profit
since 1989 when net profits were NKr165m. Mr Leif Klevan, group managing
director, said he had presented a capital expansion plan to the bank's board
in which Fokus would seek to raise up to NKr500m through the issue of new
shares and another NKr500m in the form of subordinated loans in domestic and
foreign capital markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kvaerner, one of Norway's biggest publicly quoted companies, yesterday
announced record pre-tax profits for 1993, helped mainly by solid advances
in the diversified group's shipbuilding and oil and gas activities.
Last year pre-tax profits rose 41.5 per cent to NKr1.32bn (Dollars 177m)
from NKr932m in 1992 as sales increased 23 per cent to NKr24.58bn from
NKr20bn with advances made in all five of the group's business areas.
The result was better than domestic analysts' forecasts and Kvaerner has
proposed lifting the 1993 dividend payment to NKr5.50 a share from NKr5.
Kvaerner expects the group in 1994 to show a profit, before unrealised
foreign exchange items, matching that achieved in 1993. Group operating
costs rose to NKr22.4bn in 1993 from NKr18.35bn in 1992, mostly due to
acquisitions.
Accounts were charged with net financial items of NKr36m - including gains
on securities of NKr79m against losses of NKr65m in 1992 - compared with
NKr14m in 1992.

partners

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, France's loss-making computer group, is holding talks with
potential industry partners which could take a stake of up to 20 per cent in
the state-owned company as part of its privatisation, Mr Jean-Marie
Descarpentries, the chairman, said yesterday.
In his first briefing since taking over at Bull last October, Mr
Descarpentries said he was seeking to prepare the company for privatisation
as quickly as possible and that the French state's 76 per cent stake could
be brought below 50 per cent this year.
The Bull chairman also spelt out a restructuring and cost-cutting plan aimed
at returning the computer group to profit during 1995. The French group has
lost more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.5bn) over the past four years, as a result
of depressed markets, high costs and inefficient production.
Mr Descarpentries said his recovery plan would be presented to the European
Commission by the beginning of March. The Commission has ordered a freeze of
a FFr2.5bn injection of state aid to the company pending the presentation of
a recovery plan and is also investigating a FFr7bn allocation made last
year.
Mr Descarpentries described the capital injections as a 'one time, last
time' event. He said that he had been given two years by the French
government to prepare the group for sale and spelt out a strategy of
privatisation through industrial partnerships and employee participation
rather than a public offer for Bull shares.
The search for industrial investors could bring a substantial foreign
computer group into the capital of the French group.
'The criteria for the first partner will be speed not nationality,' said the
Bull chairman. He declined to specify the companies with which discussions
were being held, but Bull already has alliances with other international
computer groups, including NEC of Japan. NEC holds 4.43 per cent of Bull's
shares and has a strategic alliance in several areas.
Mr Descarpentries said a return to profit would be achieved through a
reorganisation of the group into separate profit centres, tighter reporting
and the implementation of cost-cutting measures. An existing plan to cut
6,500 jobs between 1993 and the end of 1994 has been accelerated.
But priority is to be given to cutting non-salary costs. A reduction in the
group's Paris sites, from 24 to two, for example, should bring annual
savings of FFr530m.

FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bayer buys stake in US generic
drugs group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German chemicals group, is making a move into the fast-growing US
generics drugs sector with the acquisition of a 28.3 per cent stake in
Schein Pharmaceutical, a privately owned generics company based in Florham
Park, New Jersey.
Bayer, which signalled last month that a deal with a US generics company was
likely to be sealed before the end of March, is paying Dollars 310m for the
stake. The size of the holding may be increased gradually following a
proposed listing of Schein's shares, Bayer said.
The acquisition follows the purchase by Hoechst, Bayer's German rival, last
autumn. Hoechst paid Dollars 546m for a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a
generic and over-the-counter drugs manufacturer. Generic drugs are
out-of-patent products, sold over the counter.
Analysts noted yesterday that Bayer appeared to have done the better deal.
Schein is four times bigger than Copley but the companies are both valued at
DM1.1bn (Dollars 639m). Schein's turnover last year was Dollars 400m
compared with DM52m at Copley.
There was no indication of Schein's profitability other than a comment that
returns on sales of leading manufacturers of generic drug manufacturers
currently range between 10 and 20 per cent. Schein employs 1,700 people and
produces 350 products.
'Our strategy is to safeguard and expand our position as one of the world's
leading pharmaceuticals companies,' said Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chief
executive. 'We must therefore also become a force in the generics market,
which has above average growth rates, especially in the US.
'Together we can not only greatly increase our presence in the market but we
can also meet the challenges inherent in the changing healthcare market,' he
added, 'at the same time offering the patients a comprehensive range of
medicines.'

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Operating strength lifts A McAlpine shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and MARC JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Alfred McAlpine jumped by 35p to 329p yesterday after the
construction group announced a better than expected operating performance
for the year to October 31.
As expected, provisions of Pounds 6.5m were made to cover potential losses
on a housing joint venture, construction contracts, reorganisation, and a
Pounds 500,000 loss on disposals.
These reduced pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.17m, against Pounds 3.39m restated
for FRS 3. Turnover rose from Pounds 560.7m to Pounds 620.7m.
Before exceptional items, profits rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 7.7m. This
was after an interest bill of Pounds 3.33m (Pounds 2.66m).
The improvement was led by the housing division, which after interest more
than doubled profits to Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 2.58m).
Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said the recovery in the UK housing
market had seen higher sales and improved margins and was 'unlikely to be
upset by higher tax bills due to take effect in April'.
Earnings per share before exceptional items increased to 9.6p (7.3p). After
taking account of provisions, earnings fell from to 4.8p to 0.7p. The final
dividend is maintained at 3.5p, for a same-again total of 6.5p.
The number of homes completed rose by a fifth to 1,521. The average price
remained static at Pounds 79,400. Mr Whitehead expected prices to rise over
the next 12 months to Pounds 90,000.
Profits from contracting rose marginally to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 2.9m) in
spite of an 8 per cent rise in construction turnover to Pounds 371.5m,
reflecting low margins. UK aggregate profits fell from Pounds 1.86m to
Pounds 1.19m.
In the US, profits from contracting and building materials were lower than
expected at Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.84m).
The group is changing its year end to December 31.
COMMENT
The fillip in McAlpine's share price had as much to do with optimism about
the company's prospects as with market satisfaction over a better than
expected operating performance. Margins on housing are rising
satisfactorily, without some of the big write-downs announced by other
builders. This means the company has more to gain as it uses up expensive
land acquired in the late 1980s. Management also appears to have a tight
grip on the construction business and is confident that it will avoid
serious problems on low margin contracts caused by rising building material
prices. The US business remains strong and the group should be capable of
making Pounds 13m in the current year and up to Pounds 19m in 1994-95. This
would put McAlpine on a prospective p/e of 14 times earnings two years on,
making the shares still look reasonably attractive in a sector which is at a
substantial premium to the rest of the market.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Beer cask demand behind 17% rise to Pounds 4.4m at Alumasc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for beer casks enabled Alumasc, the containers, components and
building products group, to announce a 17 per cent increase in half-year
profits.
Growing orders from leading breweries pushed pre-tax profits up to Pounds
4.41m (Pounds 3.77m) in the six months to December 31.
Welcoming the results, Mr John McCall, chairman, said: 'We've been surprised
by demand for casks, it goes against the trend of declining beer
consumption.'
The half year figures also benefited from a three-month contribution by MR
Holdings, the privately-owned wall insulation company which Alumasc acquired
for Pounds 6.4m last autumn.
MR contributed Pounds 1.62m to group turnover, which increased 12 per cent
to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 24.3m).
At the operating level, the new subsidiary played a less significant role -
adding Pounds 253,000 to profits of Pounds 4.04m.
Mr McCall said demand for insulation had been affected by declining local
authority spending on council house refurbishments.
Alumasc's six other building product businesses, ranging from drainage to
roofing, had performed well despite subdued construction activity, Mr McCall
added. The contribution, however, of the precision components division was
held back by commissioning costs associated with new dies.
Earnings per share, adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 share split last October,
rose to 9.53p (8.25p). The interim dividend is 2.05p, an 11 per cent
increase over last time's 1.85p.

<TEXT>
Intercare Group, the USM-quoted healthcare products supplier, has acquired
the minority 25 per cent of Montis Medical, the Netherlands-based mobility
products maker.
The acquisition was completed through the exercise of the option granted to
Intercare in the acquisition agreement in September 1991.
Intercare has raised Pounds 1.75m before expenses by an issue of 1.25m
shares (4.77 per cent of the existing issued capital) at 140p each. Some
Pounds 1.05m will be used for the purchase, with the balance utilised to
reduce gearing, strengthen the balance sheet and for small in-fill
acquisitions.
The shares have been unconditionally placed with institutional investors of
UBS and Wise Speke. Certain Intercare directors have also sold 677,500
shares at 140p each.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Flotation set to put Pounds 200m tag on MIN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, the regional publisher, is likely have a
market value of close to Pounds 200m when it comes to market next month.
Analysts were yesterday speculating that it would float on a prospective
multiple of about 21-22 times.
MIN has been compared with Trinity International and Johnston Press, both of
which have multiples of about 24.5. Last year, MIN made operating profits of
Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 13.4m) on sales of Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 66.6m).
The group was bullish about its prospects yesterday as it published the
pathfinder prospectus ahead of the float which will reduce the debt incurred
in the management buy-out in 1991. It said classified recruitment
advertising, the highest yielding category, had risen by 20 per cent, year
on year, in the second half of 1993. Costs had been cut by Pounds 4.5m,
while operating margins jumped from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent in
1993.
The prospectus highlighted the litigation launched earlier this week against
Mr David Sullivan, owner of Birmingham City Football Club, and Ms Karren
Brady, its managing director. The two are being sued for libel in connection
with the distribution of an anonymous letter making certain allegations
regarding the group, its titles and the listing.
Ms Brady said she had met with MIN executives this week and both parties had
agreed 'this has gone too far. We hope to have a meeting soon'.

announced the acquisition of Yewlands Engineering from Carlton
Communications and a placing and open offer to raise about Pounds 4.1m.
Consideration for Yewlands is Pounds 2.66m in cash on completion and, under
the terms of a subscription agreement, Carlton has agreed to pay Quadrant
Pounds 2.16m in cash on completion. Some Pounds 1.6m of that will be by way
of a non-interest bearing loan note, repayable in March 1996. The balance,
of Pounds 560,000, will be by way of subscription for 1.6m new shares in
Quadrant at 35p, which Carlton will hold for at least two years.
The placing and open offer, underwritten by Hambros, is of up to 11.7m new
ordinary shares on a 1-for-2 basis at 35p. Proceeds will be used for the
acquisition and to reduce indebtedness of the enlarged group.
Yewlands is a maker of precision engineered components mainly for the
aerospace industry. It made profits of Pounds 800,000 pre-tax on turnover of
Pounds 10.9m in the year to September 30.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tring Int places 49.9% with ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the recording company which faces legal action from
several larger competitors, yesterday announced that the placing of 49.9 per
cent of its enlarged share capital had been substantially oversubscribed.
The shares were priced at 118p, giving the company a market capitalisation
of Pounds 50.2m. It expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.1m for the year to
March 31. Expected earnings per share of 8.42p put the shares on a
prospective multiple of 14 at their placing price. Dealings begin next
Wednesday.
Mr Philip Keane, finance director, accepted that some potential investors
might be wary because of the copyright litigation Tring faced, but he
thought the shares had been priced realistically.
Tring is being sued by MCA, PolyGram and K-Tel International for alleged
copyright infringement. Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI
Music, which had sued it for breach of copyright.
The company has said it does not expect the litigation to have a significant
financial impact. Mr Philip Robinson, joint chief executive, said none of
Tring's 800 album titles represented more than 1.5 per cent of sales.
Mr Mark Frey, the other joint chief executive, said the litigation affected
70 musical tracks out of more than 8,000 in the company's catalogue.
Mr Robinson said that the company had indemnities from its licensors,
ensuring that Tring would be reimbursed for damages paid and the
complainants' legal costs if licences proved to be invalid.
The company also said yesterday that it was issuing 2.5m new shares, raising
Pounds 1.4m net of expenses. Mr Frey and Mr Robinson were receiving Pounds
3.7m each from the placing, although each will retain a 12.37 per cent stake
in the company. The remaining shares which were not placed yesterday are
held by other directors and investors.
Tring said that it would have paid a net dividend of 3.8p if it had been
listed throughout the current financial year, giving a notional gross yield
of 4 per cent at the placing price.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough valued at Pounds 74.5m in
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldsborough Healthcare was given a market value of Pounds 74.5m yesterday
when its flotation was priced at 170p a share.
The shares are on a pro forma historic p/e for the year to October 3 of
18.6, and the indicated notional yield for the current year is 2.4 per cent.
The float will enable Kunick, the leisure group, to sell its entire holding
of 12.6m shares in Goldsborough, and have loans repaid, giving it gross
proceeds of Pounds 24.8m and an exceptional profit on the sale of Pounds
2.2m.
NatWest Ventures, which took a stake in Goldsborough in October 1992, will
sell 5.8m shares, cutting its stake to 9.9 per cent.
Management is increasing its stake to 2.4 per cent with Mr Graham Smith,
chief executive, investing Pounds 249,000 to take his stake to 1.6 per cent.
On the flotation Mr Smith will have a new three-year, fixed-service contract
at Pounds 130,000 a year.
Goldsborough, which operates nursing and residential homes, acute hospitals
and homecare services, will also raise Pounds 29m through the issue of 18.2m
new shares. This will cut net debt to Pounds 7.8m, 15.4 per cent of pro
forma shareholders' funds.
A total of 36.6m shares are being sold, 83.6 per cent of the company. Of
these 65 per cent - 23.8m shares - have been placed firm and the balance is
being offered to the public.
Goldsborough said the current year had started well with 95 per cent
occupancy in the homes and a 29 per cent rise in care hours provided by the
homecare division. Profits would benefit from acquisitions last year.
Mr Smith said he expected growth to be both organic and through acquisition.
Gearing could rise to more than 50 per cent in two to three years but would
not exceed 100 per cent.
Applications close on February 24, with dealings due to start on March 4.
COMMENT
This float smacks a little too much of a desire by Kunick to sell. Rumblings
over the placing suggest the pricing is perhaps a few pence too greedy.
While most other nursing home groups have come to market with net cash,
allowing a fair period before a rights issue is required, Goldsborough is
coming with net debt. It can point to its diversity of activities as a
strength, although three quarters of profits still come from the care homes
division where it is a long way short of market leadership. On a forecast of
pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 4.3m) the prospective p/e
is 14.8, which may be just enough of a discount to get the issue away.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ICD mounts sharp recovery to Pounds 0.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Communications and Data, the marketing services group subject
to a recent unwelcome bid, recovered from a Pounds 1.17m loss to report a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 191,000 in the six months to November 30.
Mr David Cicurel, chairman, attributed the improvement to a strong
performance by ICD Marketing Services, the elimination of losses and the
near-halving of central costs and interest.
He hit out at PSB Group, the direct marketing concern, which he said 'had
attempted to obtain backdoor management control of ICD without making an
offer to all shareholders.'
Resolutions put forward by PSB, which claims to control 23.6 per cent of
ICD's voting rights, were defeated at an EGM in December. PSB had sought the
removal of the majority of ICD's existing directors and their replacement by
PSB nominees.
Mr Cicurel said that associates of PSB had since indicated that they were
considering making an offer for the company. 'If this were to take place at
a fair price it would be a successful outcome to the upheavals of last
autumn,' he added.
In December PSB launched a counter bid for ICD, after IMC Industries, in
which Mr Cicurel is a large shareholder, was forced into a mandatory bid
after exercising a share option.
The USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure company said it did not wish to gain
ICD, however, and pitched its offer at the lowest price permitted under the
takeover code.
ICD received Pounds 486,000 from the share option. This gave IMC a 10.6 per
cent stake in ICD and with its supporters, IMC now claims to hold about 40
per cent.
The defence costs of the PSB bid amounted to Pounds 110,000 and were charged
as an exceptional item against the half year profit.
Turnover on continuing operations came to Pounds 2.91m (Pounds 2.44m), while
earnings per share were 0.34p (2.05p losses).

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Confidence borne of a successful year -
John Gapper asks whether the upbeat mood at Kleinwort Benson can be
sustained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the 200 years of Kleinwort Benson's history, few can have been more
eventful than 1993. The investment bank suffered uncertainty while it looked
for a new chief executive to help rebuild its past pre-eminence, yet doubled
profits to record levels because of buoyant financial markets.
Not only was it a tumultuous year - culminating in the decision not to hire
a chief executive from outside - but yesterday's results told the story more
clearly than in the past. They included previously-hidden details of income
and the balance sheet to comply with an EU directive.
Lord Rockley, Kleinwort's executive chairman, decided in December to appoint
two heads of investment banking under him and Mr Simon Robertson, deputy
chairman, rather than hiring a chief executive to follow Mr Jonathan Agnew.
He said he had confirmed his view that it had 'a lot of good people'.
Quite a few of them earned a lot of money, with the bulk of a Pounds 72m
rise in expenses coming from bonuses. The question is whether they will earn
as much this year. That would require Kleinwort truly to have improved the
quality of earnings rather than just gaining windfall profits last year.
The new management has a substantial task. It has to put an end to the
historic tension between its corporate finance and securities operations
which dogged it in the late 1980s. It also has to show that Kleinwort can
compete internationally with global investment banks, notably US ones.
Some have argued that Kleinwort sits uncomfortably in the middle range of
merchant banks, neither being a small niche player nor of sufficient size to
compete with SG Warburg. The bank has also been vulnerable to the charge
that its earnings are too vulnerable to market volatility.
Mr Robertson emphasised yesterday that the bank's work on more than 200
international equity issues and placings last year had required co-operation
between its primary and secondary sides. 'Our success in bought deals was
proof positive that the two sides work together well,' he said.
The bank carved out a niche in privatisation - such as those of electricity
utilities - working on 45 such initiatives in 16 countries. Lord Rockley
said that showed there was 'a place for a European merchant bank as opposed
to the world being dominated by international investment banks'.
Yet the bank believes its capacity to place securities in all markets needs
to grow. Lord Rockley pointed to successes such as placing Carrefour's FFr
2.04bn stake in Castorama in 17 countries last March, but said that one
priority was to 'increase our international distribution capability'.
Apart from reinforcing its international presence, the main task is to
ensure earnings are sustained. One difficulty is that it benefited heavily
from a rise in dealing profits from Pounds 61.9m to Pounds 120.8m, which are
unlikely to be repeated in more subdued treasury and capital markets this
year.
Kleinwort has tried to build up earnings from investment management to
stabilise income. But although funds managed by its asset management arm
rose from Pounds 8.9bn to Pounds 11.1bn, profits from investment management
rose 3 per cent to Pounds 26.4m, compared with a 290 per cent rise in
investment banking profits.
This was one reason for a fall in its shares yesterday despite large
profits. 'I am slightly left with the impression that the quality of
earnings is not good enough, although it is fair enough that they took
advantage of strong markets,' said Mr Philip Gibbs, an analyst at Barclays
de Zoete Wedd.
In response, the bank points to a number of aspects of its figures to
illustrate their strength. One is that it claims to be less aggressive than
US banks, and even UK ones such as Warburg in boosting profits by using its
own capital to trade. This would make it less susceptible to a downturn.
'Some banks get big profits, but there are big risks as well,' said Mr Rob
Jeens, finance director. He also emphasised the 67 per cent rise in fee and
commission income to Pounds 239m, against a 12 per cent fall in net interest
income. Kleinwort argues that such income is more sustainable.
The bank has also tried to make its cost base more flexible by shifting away
from basic salaries to bonuses. 'The greatest mistake in a cyclical business
is to have a high fixed cost base,' said Lord Rockley.
The atmosphere at Kleinwort was cheerful yesterday. 'There is a lot more
confidence around here that I do not think was there two or three years
ago,' said Mr Robertson. The test will be whether such confidence can be
sustained in a year that is likely to be less kind, and less exciting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Relyon Group, the beds and furniture manufacturer, warned
yesterday that its annual results would be adversely affected by
non-recurring costs.
They estimated that pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 would
be reduced by some Pounds 700,000 by the items, which include costs of
withdrawal from its French operation and redundancy payments following
reorganisation.
The bottom line would also suffer from a higher than expected tax charge,
following payment of a tax liability dating back to 1984-85.
They emphasised, however, that the underlying trading performance was in
line with expectations and that the current year had started well.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English &amp; Overseas Properties yesterday announced a return to profitability
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 312,000 for 1993.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 707,000, struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 982,000.
Mr Jim Clark, chairman, said the company hoped to be able to aggressively
expand its existing investment and development portfolio during the current
year.
EOP plans to move away from the consultancy work which saw it through the
recession and into property investments, where it can add value through
intensive management.
Turnover rose to Pounds 5.98m (Pounds 986,000), primarily due to
contributions from acquisitions and recently-completed development
properties.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 1.11p, against losses of 2.86p, and
the company returned to the dividend list with a final of of 0.5p.
During the year, the company gained court approval to transfer Pounds 1.5m
from capital reserves to distributable reserves.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund lifts target to Dollars 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first specialist Israeli investment trust has increased its size
after heavy demand during the placing stage.
The dollar-denominated Israel Fund, to be managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
was originally aiming to raise the equivalent of Pounds 100m in total. That
has been upped to a maximum of Dollars 200m (Pounds 136.9m), Dollars 140.6m
of which has already been raised from the placing, which closed earlier this
week.
The public offer opened yesterday and closes on March 3. First dealings are
expected on March 17. Shares are being offered at Dollars 1, with one
warrant attached to five ordinary shares. The fund will invest in Israeli
companies listed in Tel Aviv or elsewhere, principally on Nasdaq. Up to 10
per cent can be invested in unquoted companies.
The managers believe that a number of factors give Israel strong capital
growth potential. These include continuing immigration, particularly of
highly-qualified Russians, the easing of the Arab boycott, shrinking defence
expenditure, a large privatisation programme, and a growing tourist
industry.
The main Tel Aviv index rose by 27 per cent last year, after a rise of 75
per cent in 1992. The fund's promoters are stressing that Israel is a mature
rather than emerging market, but its economy is growing at rates comparable
to emerging markets, greater than those of European countries.
However, recent events in the Israeli stock market may have unsettled some
potential investors. The arrest last week of a number of portfolio managers
on suspicion of share price manipulation hit the market after a series of
falls prompted by other factors, such as the US interest rate cut and a
general correction of a developing 'bubble'.
Mr Roger Hornett, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities, sponsors
of the Fund, said that the arrests demonstrated that the regulatory
authorities took a firm view of irregularities, detecting them even in
high-volume trading, and as such gave an encouraging sign to international
investors.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester rises to Pounds
202m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth largest, yesterday
reported a 55 per cent rise to Pounds 202m in pre-tax profits for the year
to end-December.
The results benefited from a sharp fall in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts to Pounds 75.9m.
For 1992 profits and provisions were affected by the acquisition of the
Portsmouth building society in 1991. At the pre-tax level they fell to
Pounds 130.6m with bad debt provisions nearly tripling to Pounds 210.7m.
For the year under review, total assets rose from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds
17.7m, with Pounds 870,000 of the increase coming from the takeover of the
Heart of England building society.
While mortgage advances fell slightly to Pounds 2.2bn (Pounds 2.3bn), C&amp;G
still increased its share of the UK mortgage market from 3.88 per cent to
4.08 per cent.
The society said that without the acquisition of Heart of England there
would have been a 'modest increase' in market share.
Net retail inflow was Pounds 125m (Pounds 474m) but as C&amp;G's wholesale funds
did not rise during the year, its non-retail funds fell to 22.8 per cent (24
per cent) as a percentage of shares and deposits.
The society said that in the absence of greater mortgage demand there was no
need to attract more retail funds, but that it would respond to any increase
in demand.
Net interest receivable and other income and charges both fell back from
1992 at Pounds 330.6m (Pounds 377.2m) and Pounds 59.5m (Pounds 60.9m)
respectively.
Cost/income ratio rose to 26.4 per cent(22.1 per cent) ,but is still below
the sector average.
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 103.1m (Pounds 96.8m) reflecting
factors such as the refurbishment of about 21 HoE branches and the opening
of three new branches.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said the society was considering
opening 12 branches in the coming year, and looking to expand in the north
of England, though he would expect the overall size of the branch network to
remain the same.
A conversion to plc status remained a possibility, he said, if continuing
under the regulatory regime for societies prevented C&amp;G from competing
effectively in the mortgage and retail deposit markets.
He emphasised the society's possibilities for growth, despite the static
nature of the housing market at present and fierce competition from banks,
by increasing its share of the building societies' share of the mortgage
market.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Clinical Computing at 173p in first day
dealings
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Clinical Computing, the medical software group which came to
market via a placing with institutional investors, jumped to a 40 per cent
premium on their first day of trading.
The shares closed at 173p yesterday, compared with the price of 124p set by
Keith, Bayley, Rogers, which sponsored the issue of 4.05m shares
representing 25 per cent of the enlarged capital.
Demand for the shares was buoyed by the New Issue Register, which launched a
scheme for private investors last year and applied for 815,300 shares. It
received 550,000 shares on behalf of 319 applicants.
The flotation was designed to raise a net Pounds 3.1m in new funds for the
London-based group and enable development of its Proton suite of software
packages which help doctors and other healthcare workers store, manage and
analyse clinical information.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Guangdong Fund to begin trading after
raising Dollars 91m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Guangdong Development Fund, a China direct investment fund co-managed by
the investment arm of the Guangdong Provincial Government, will start
trading on the London stock market on Wednesday, after raising Dollars 91m
(Pounds 62.3m).
The fund was targeted to raise between Dollars 75m and Dollars 100m, but it
can raise a further Dollars 9m within the coming weeks, to take it up to the
maximum limit.
The fund will focus on direct investments in Guangdong Province, which
borders Hong Kong and has become the most affluent of China's provinces
since Deng Xiaoping launched his Open Door Policy in 1979.
The managers, Guangdong Capital and First Eastern - a company controlled by
Mr Victor Chu - have already signed letters of intent on five investments,
which would cost Dollars 26.5m.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: In Shops' shares rise 30p on bid from
Birkby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birkby, the managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment credit company,
yesterday announced the proposed takeover of In Shops, a listed retail space
management company.
In Shops' share price rose 30p to 113p on the news.
The acquisition will double the issued share capital of Birkby, which is
confident it can achieve significant rationalisation benefits, and reduce
vacancy rates at the 66 retail centres managed by In Shops.
Birkby, which is advised by Charterhouse Tilney, is offering 5 new shares
for every 12 In Shops shares, valuing the target company at Pounds 58m,
based on Wednesday's closing share price. This represented a 33 per cent
premium to its market value.
There is a part cash alternative, whereby shareholders can accept 3 shares
plus 480p cash, for every 12 In Shops shares. The deal would result in the
issue of 21.8m new Birkby shares, giving it a market capitalisation of more
than Pounds 120m.
In Shops' management has unanimously supported the offer, and Birkby has
received irrevocable acceptances from shareholders representing 19.4 of the
company.
Birkby was formed through the reverse takeover of listed shell company
Finlan in August 1992, when it had a market capitalisation of Pounds 13m.
It has built up a portfolio of low cost properties, primarily redundant
textile mills, and converted these into light industrial business centres,
with small low cost units.
It has also expanded commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit
businesses, aimed primarily at servicing the workspace customer base.
Birkby weathered the recession with occupancy rates above 90 per cent, and
minimal bad debts.
The company is forecasting pre-tax profit for the year to March 1994 of at
least Pounds 3m (excluding discontinued operations).
COMMENT
Birkby has expanded at a breathtaking pace, but its management has yet to
put a foot wrong, achieving 20 per cent annual returns on new premises
acquired. Based on official forecasts for the current year, it is trading on
a p/e of 18. The takeover is expected to succeed, and the enlarged Birkby
would have to achieve profits of about Pounds 8m to equal this figure in
1995. This represents the combined forecasts for the two companies, plus
about Pounds 800,000 rationalisation benefits. This should be easily
exceeded and the shares should have further to go in the longer-term.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GKN increases pace in Westland bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle for control of Westland moved up a gear yesterday when GKN, the
engineering and industrial services group, sought to justify the terms of
its hostile bid for the helicopter manufacturer.
Announcing the distribution of its formal offer to shareholders, GKN claimed
its 290p bid for ordinary and preferred shares - valuing Westland at Pounds
497m - was equivalent to more than 25 times its fully diluted 1993 earnings.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said: 'United Technologies Corporation which
owns Sikorsky, one of the world's largest helicopter manufacturers, has
agreed to accept the offers and believes that GKN's price is fair.'
Sikorsky's US parent company has agreed to sell its 18.7 per cent stake to
GKN, taking the group's fully diluted holding to 45 per cent.
Sir David also said Westland's share price had been boosted by bid
speculation and last year's Pounds 385m damages award against the Arab
Organisation for Industrialisation.
Westland, meanwhile, disclosed at its AGM that it had received Pounds 25m
following the ruling, which relates to an abandoned helicopter contract in
the Middle East.
Mr Alan Jones, who yesterday succeeded Sir Leslie Fletcher as chairman, said
the company had also obtained orders in Europe and the US restraining banks
from releasing deposits held by the AOI. He urged shareholders to resist
GKN's overtures and said Westland would soon issue a detailed defence
document.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Roxspur poised to buy Brearley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roxspur, the maker of steel furniture and playgroup equipment, yesterday
announced plans to acquire Brearley Group, a Sheffield-based maker of
temperature sensors, from a subsidiary of Anglo United for about Pounds
4.72m cash.
The acquisition is to be funded via a placing and open offer of 25.7m shares
at 21p to raise Pounds 5.04m. The placing is subject to clawback by
shareholders on a 10-for-9 basis.
Holders of 37.9 per cent of the capital have undertaken not to take up their
entitlement, which has been placed conditionally with institutions.
The exact purchase price is subject to adjustment if net assets of Brearley
at completion fail to meet the warranted Pounds 1.57m.
In the nine months to December 31, Brearley achieved pre-tax profits of
Pounds 334,000 on sales of Pounds 2.68m.
Shareholders' approval for the deal and for a capital reduction will be
sought at an extraordinary meeting on March 14.
Mr Ian Orrock, Roxspur chairman, said yesterday that the purchase fitted
'perfectly in our strategy of building an electro-mechanical group.'
Roxspur also announced increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 433,000 (Pounds
343,000) for the six months to November 30, which it attributed mainly to
reduced gross margins due to price competition, lower sales and completion
of certain works.
Sales fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.95m) as bad weather
delayed work. Operating loss on continuing operations came to Pounds 397,000
(Pounds 190,000) and interest charges took Pounds 36,000 (Pounds 59,000).
Per share, the deficit came to 1.9p (6.7p).

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: QMH seeks investors' approval to raise
borrowing powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group whose shares have been suspended since
last April, yesterday called a special meeting to confirm an increase in its
borrowing powers to Pounds 2bn.
The board has also reappointed Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, as a
director.
Without the confirmation of the borrowing powers, the circular warns
investors, the directors doubt whether QMH would be able to continue to
trade.
Resolutions to lift the debt ceiling and the re-election of Mr Coppel were
passed at the annual meeting last summer, but proved invalid when the
company found that one class of preference shareholders had not been given
the chance to vote. The meeting will be held on March 8.
QMH said that some other resolutions passed since 1989, including one to
increase the authorised share capital, had also been found to be invalid.
These would be dealt with at the same time as proposals for the Pounds 1.3bn
refinancing were submitted to shareholders.
Approval for Mr Coppel's appointment will be sought at the next annual
meeting.
QMH has succeeded in re-acquiring 11 Holiday Inns in Germany, which were
disposed of under a sale and leaseback deal struck at midnight on December
31 1992, the last day of that financial year.
The company said it had no comment to make about putting 14 provincial
hotels, including its original hotel in Brentwood, Essex, up for sale. It
has also put seven of its Dutch hotels on the market.
Mr Coppel said the group was under no pressure from its banks to sell
hotels, and that it would not be in the best interests of shareholders or
creditors if a lot of hotels were sold in the short term.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo's rise masks weak areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo's achievement in breaking the Pounds 1bn barrier for six months' worth
of pre-tax profit hides wide variations in performance between countries and
products.
Zantac, the world's biggest selling drug, accounts for 43 per cent of
Glaxo's turnover. Sales in the six months to December 31 rose by 5 per cent
in constant currency terms to Pounds 1.2bn and by 11 per cent in the US. In
Germany, however, sales fell by 21 per cent as healthcare reforms cut
doctors' prescribing powers.
Sales in Italy, where the scheme under which the state contribution to the
cost of drugs is being reformed, fell by 6 per cent.
In the UK the sales fall was 9 per cent, exacerbated by cheaper imports from
France and Spain.
Parallel exports to the UK helped boost sales in France and Spain, but the
overall effect was not enough to prevent Zantac's share of the world market
falling from 38 per cent to 36 per cent in 1993.
The biggest gain in market share was by Losec, made by the Swedish company
Astra. This drug is now Glaxo's main competitor in ulcer treatments.
Glaxo's second most important treatment area is in respiratory drugs, mostly
for asthma sufferers. Ventolin increased sales by 8 per cent in constant
currency terms to Pounds 272m.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, said that even though the drug was no
longer under patent protection, potential competitors were finding it
difficult to deliver the active ingredient via inhalers safely into the
lungs of asthma sufferers. Sales of a new asthma drug, Serevent, jumped by
more than half to Pounds 46m and the product is to be launched in the US in
April.
Sir Richard blamed the fall in Ventolin's market share from 14 per cent to
12 per cent, on the strong sales of Serevent.
Glaxo has the anti-migraine market to itself and its product, Imigran
(Imitrex in the UK), saw six month sales jump from Pounds 35m to Pounds
113m. With the tablet version likely to be approved in the US shortly the
company has launched a 'Migraine disease awareness programme' there.
The other main new product, Zofran, which controls nausea in chemotherapy
patients and after operations, increased sales by 17 per cent in constant
currency terms to Pounds 207m. The sharpest growth was in the US. European
sales fell by 3 per cent. Sir Richard blamed cost pressures, lower doses and
sampling by doctors of newer products, for the decline.
The final product area, antibiotics, saw steady growth of 7 per cent in
constant currency terms to Pounds 431m. Market share increased by one point
to 14 per cent.

Proteus International, the USM-traded computer drug design company, has

its Z-sorb calf scour product.
Proteus, which had previously predicted it would not make sales of any
product until the middle of 1995, said that Z-sorb would be launched later
this year.
H&amp;C, the animal health and feed additives company within the ConAgra group
of Nebraska, which has annual sales of Dollars 21bn (Pounds 14bn), will

Z-sorb is an anti-diarrhoeal oral suspension and is effective against both

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wickes jumps to Pounds 18m and plans more
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, said yesterday it would open 25 stores
in each of the next three years, as it announced a five-fold increase in
full-year profits before tax to Pounds 17.8m from a restated Pounds 3.46m
last year.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the chain would expand from 82 stores to
150 by 1996.
Some 19 stores will open in the UK this year, and 6 in France, Belgium and
the Netherlands. Mr Sweetbaum said he hoped to increase the number of
openings outside the UK.
Wickes has cut prices on 1,000 of its 3,700 lines with the aim of increasing
volumes. Mr Sweetbaum said like-for-like sales increases for the last 8
weeks that were 'comfortably into double figures' suggested the strategy was
working and consumer confidence was improving.
Group turnover for the 1993 year increased from Pounds 548.4m to Pounds
608.5m; operating profits rose from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 25.8m.
Figures for the individual businesses will be published in the annual report
next week, but Mr Sweetbaum said turnover in UK retailing increased 13 per
cent, and pre-tax profits 19 per cent.
Sales were up 10 per cent at Hunter Timber, which cut its loss to about
Pounds 1.5m before interest. But Malden, Wickes' other timber business,
continued to be squeezed by a weak market among small builders, and its
deficit showed little change at about Pounds 4.5m.
Wickes is merging the managements of the two businesses to cut costs and to
develop a joint marketing strategy.
Group borrowing has fallen from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 10.1m, cutting
gearing to 7 per cent, thanks to last year's Pounds 58.1m rights issue and a
net cash inflow of Pounds 5m.
Earnings rose from 0.8p to 4.2p, and the final dividend - reinstated after a
two-year absence - is 0.8p, making a total of 1p.
COMMENT
Police had to be called to cope with the traffic as Wickes opened its second
store in France yesterday - testimony, perhaps, to the strength of its
format. With a limited, all own-label range, it has developed a loyal
following among DIY enthusiasts and trade customers, and is sufficiently
different from its competitors to be planning expansion in what is usually
considered a saturated market. The timber operations, whose acquisition
almost sunk the business three years ago, remain a concern, but the pick-up
in the housing market and Wickes' cost-cutting efforts could bring an
improvement this year. Current-year forecasts of about Pounds 32m put the
shares on a multiple of 20 - a 15 per cent premium to the market, but one
justified by Wickes' status as a strong recovery stock.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me wins support for Pounds 38m French
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders at Photo-Me International have approved the picture booth
manufacturer and operator's move into France with the Pounds 38m purchase of
KIS.
The proposal to acquire KIS, which has developed a booth using digital
electronic technology, was passed by a unanimous show of hands at
yesterday's extraordinary general meeting held in Surrey.
About 35 investors attended the meeting.
Mr David Miller, managing director, said the acquisition was expected to be
dilutive in the current year as it would be included for just three or four
months. KIS would, however, be earnings enhancing next year.
A dispute over the intellectual copyright to the technology used by KIS 'was
not material', said Mr Miller, and had not been put to shareholders at the
meeting.
Round Point Trading has claimed that it would be able to hinder the use of
the KIS photo booth for up to two years after exercising options in a third
company.
Mr Miller said Photo-Me had taken advice from solicitors and Round Point's
claims were considered to be without foundation.

FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Heavy weather delays Hartstone sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone was well and truly snowed under yesterday as the freak cold
weather threatened to put the skids on the refinancing being negotiated by
the hosiery and handbags group.
News that the roof had caved in under the weight of heavy snow at a French
hosiery factory on Monday caused Courtaulds Textiles to call for a delay in
its proposed Pounds 45.4m purchase of Cogetex, the French company acquired
by Hartstone in 1991. The disposal is a fundamental part of the refinancing
package which was due to be completed earlier this week.
Courtaulds Textiles has the right to withdraw from the transaction if the
damage to the factory's packaging and storage premises exceeds the insurance
cover by Pounds 4.5m. Hartstone is understood to be covered for damage of up
to Pounds 50m.
Hartstone is currently operating without a standstill arrangement, which
expired on January 16, as it had believed medium-term financing arrangements
would have been in place by the end of this month. These are now likely to
be delayed by at least two to three weeks.
Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman who has sought to turn round the struggling
group for the last eight months, said yesterday he felt this was merely 'one
more aggravation to add to all the others'.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Volvo and Renault separate as alliance is terminated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, and Renault of France yesterday agreed
to scrap their three-year-old strategic alliance following the collapse last
December of their plans to merge.
In a move against a trend of consolidation and co-operation in the
hard-pressed motor industry, the two groups said they were terminating the
web of cross-shareholdings and agreements on technical and industrial
co-operation they established in 1990 as a first step towards merger.
The divorce came less than three months after Volvo, facing a shareholder
revolt, tore up an agreement to merge its car and truck operations with the
state-owned French company. Almost all that will remain of the alliance will
be existing projects for the supply of engines and gearboxes and joint
marketing of cars in some markets. The companies said the separation gave
them the freedom to act independently.
Renault called it the logical conclusion to the failure of the merger. For
the French government, the unwinding of the cross-investments was seen as a
necessary step to facilitate Renault's privatisation, scheduled for the
second half of this year.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the Swedish group was in a
position to plot a new long-term strategy - expected to include the search
for a new partner. 'We now have the freedom to plan and work out our own
future in Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Truck Corporation. The positive
cash flows being generated by these operations can now be fully utilised.'
Under the separation pact, the parent AB Volvo will swap its 45 per cent
holding in RVI, Renault's car and truck operations, for Renault's 25 per
cent holding in Volvo's car corporation. No payment will be made by either
side, although no details were given of the valuation of the swap.
Volvo will buy back Renault's 45 per cent holding in Volvo trucks with 60
per cent of its 20 per cent holding in the Renault parent company when
Renault is privatised. If the privatisation is delayed, Volvo is obliged to
buy the truck holding for FFr4.5bn (Dollars 763m), a provision that suggests
for the first time a valuation of Renault of about FFr37bn.
Renault holds a 3.45 per cent stake in AB Volvo and Volvo will hold an 8 per
cent share in the Renault parent, but neither holding will have strategic
significance.
The Swedish group will pay Renault FFr1bn as the last tranche of a
price-adjustment agreement linked to the 1990 accord. Volvo said it would
write off SKr3.6bn in goodwill and make a provision of SKr1.6bn related to
the exchange of shares against 1993 income.
In Paris, the deal was seen as positive financially for Renault. It was
welcomed in Stockholm where Volvo's most-traded B shares rose SKr14 to close
at SKr692 on the Stockholm bourse. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the architect of
the Renault merger who quit as Volvo chairman in December, said Volvo was
left in the dangerous position of being without a partner for the future.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Glaxo passes the Pounds 1bn barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powerful growth in the US for Glaxo, Europe's biggest pharmaceuticals
company, outweighed troubles in continental markets and took first-half
pre-tax profits past Pounds 1bn for the first time.
Turnover rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn from Pounds 2.3bn, helped by a
strengthening of the dollar. Pre-tax profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 1bn
from Pounds 819m.
With the dollar effect stripped out, growth rates in turnover and at the
pre-tax level were about 15 per cent.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, also confirmed that the company intended
to cement one or more US alliances by the end of the year. In an attack on
the effects of the purchase last year by Merck, the biggest US drugs
company, of Medco, one of its customers, Sir Richard, said that the US
pharmaceuticals business would only be fair if drugs buyers had a free
choice of suppliers.
'We understand what needs to be done,' he said. Glaxo's search for partners
would include looking at distribution companies as well as other drugs
makers.
The dividend was raised 29 per cent to 9p, from 7p, near the top of
analysts' forecasts. The company has a policy of paying out about a third of
the year's dividend at the interim stage. The share price rose 22p to 697p.
The company's ulcer drug, Zantac, consolidated its position as the world's
biggest selling prescription medicine with 5 per cent sales growth, in
constant currency terms, to Pounds 1.2bn.
The effects of European health spending controls made themselves felt, and
Zantac sales fell in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sir Richard said he believed
these market would 'turn around'.
Spending on research and development continued to rise sharply, up 24 per
cent in the first six months to Pounds 417m. In March the company will open
its Pounds 700m research and development centre in Hertfordshire.
The company's net cash climbed from Pounds 1.5bn in December 1992 to Pounds
2.01bn. But falling interest rates meant that investment income fell from
Pounds 79m to Pounds 73m.
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 23.4p from 19.4p. In American
Depository Receipt (ADR) terms, the form in which the shares are held in the
US, earnings rose 3 per cent to 70 cents, affected by currency translation.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Prices warm up despite cold reality of high stocks: Kenneth
Gooding assesses new trends in the metals markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange things are happening in the metals markets. Take this example.
Although western world aluminium stocks are at a record 5m tonnes - enough
to keep the world's consumers happy for nearly four months - buyers wanting
metal for June and July from London Metal Exchange warehouses recently had
to pay a premium to be sure of delivery.
Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc stocks are also overflowing from LME
warehouses, and there seems little chance of a return to more reasonable
levels until the end of this year. Yet LME prices, a reference point for
nearly all metals contracts worldwide, burst upwards in January. Even zinc,
the worst-performing base metal, ended the month 17 per cent above its
lowest point in the present economic cycle, while nickel and lead were 49
and 42 per cent above their lows.
The metal markets' aberrant behaviour can be traced to the arrival of new
players - financial institutions and investment funds forced by low interest
rates to widen their search for profitable ways to deploy their cash. The
influx has provided welcome liquidity, but it might also have a negative
impact, according to Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's
biggest mining company. By pushing LME prices up more rapidly than is
justified by the fundamentals, it might delay actions - such as closure of
out-dated capacity - necessary to bring the market back into balance.
Also, Mr Crowson points out, because it does not take much money to move
these markets, the funds' heavy reliance on chart-based technical trading
makes prices more volatile.
Mr David King, LME chief executive, suggests that fund activity on the
exchange so far is well under 10 per cent of the Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds
2.39bn) daily turnover. But it would not be healthy if the weight of fund
money pushed prices 'up or down substantially as they moved in or out of the
market'.
The potential for volatility has been well illustrated this month. After the
Federal Reserve Board eased US interest rates upwards, the funds immediately
reduced their exposure to metals and LME prices fell. But in the past few
days most metals prices have recovered and seem determined to defy gravity.
Those who believe in fundamental-historical analysis insist that stock
levels give the best indication of the health of metals markets. And metals
stocks are sky high. LME warehouses around the world contain about 4.6m
tonnes of metal valued at more than Dollars 6bn, representing 55-60 per cent
of the western world's surplus metals stocks. This is a big change from the
previous trough in 1982, when only 14 per cent of stocks were held on the
LME.
This change helps explain why today's stock figures are sending out
confusing signals. Traders suggest a great deal of LME stock has been
'neutralised' by long-term financing deals. According to a December survey
by Mr Alan Heap, of County Natwest Securities Australia, about 45 per cent
of total LME stocks was held by financial institutions, either as collateral
against loans to producers and consumers or as a speculative investment.
This follows a shift in the LME's membership over the past 10 years: far
more banks and financial institutions now operate on the exchange. 'You only
have to name a few names to get the feel of this financial muscle -
Barclays, Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,'
says Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch.
Some of these banks have a new activity - holding metals to earn the
contango (or the premium over the cash price) which reflects the cash price,
storage and insurance fees and interest costs during a contract period.
Banks have been using their financial power to improve their earnings from
the contango. They get better terms from warehouses, for example, by
guaranteeing to leave metal in storage for one or two years. Mr Arnold
suggests institutions have been earning a 6.45 per cent annual return,
attractive business at a time of low interest and low inflation. The
aluminium market has been a prime target for this 'financialisation' of
stock.
Traders also warn that some organisations are not content just to earn the
contango, they want to make capital gains as well. This could drive up
prices rapidly as demand improves, in spite of stocks remaining high.
However, Mr Arnold points out: 'This strategy would backfire because
excessively high prices would encourage producers to reactivate capacity
much more quickly and they would deliver the extra production directly into
LME warehouses.'
Mr Crowson suggests that disappointment looms for those expecting a rapid
and solid upswing in metals prices as the world's economic health improves.
Managed commodity funds alone have Dollars 26bn to find a home for and if a
bullish or bearish trend emerges, the funds will tend to reinforce it. 'It
will be a rollercoaster,' he says.

FT  18 FEB 94 / IBM to withdraw Ambra PCs in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is withdrawing its Ambra range of low-cost
personal computers in Europe and closing Individual Computer Products
International (ICPI), the subsidiary it set up to market Ambra products. It
intends to concentrate on its own brands of low-cost PCs.
Industry experts said the move underlined consumer preference for well-known
brands of PC over less well-known ones, ucts, where there is little price
difference.
Competitors, including Compaq of the US which is vying with IBM for global
leadership in PCs, said it removed an aggressive competitor at the lower end
of the market. They were concerned, however, that IBM's own brands would
prove stiffer rivals.
IBM said 64 jobs would go at ICPI, but most were fixed contract or agency
staff.
It said that its own low-cost branded products had proved so successful that
it made no sense to maintain two competing lines. ICPI has sold some 140,000
computers and gained 1 per cent share of the European PC market since it was
launched in June 1992. According to Dataquest, a US marketing consultancy,
IBM has 14.7 per cent of that market.
Mr Bill McCracken, head of European operations for the IBM PC Company, said
changes in the structure of the market forced the closure: 'It is clear we
can optimise both our customer offerings and financial returns by focusing
on our IBM branded products.'
The closure of ICPI ends one of IBM's more unusual European marketing
strategies. Its market share had been under attack from 'clone'
manufacturers, which build PCs to IBM designs but at much lower cost.
IBM's strategy through the 1980s had been to build premium products at
premium prices. The clones undercut this as customers realised there was
little difference in quality between low-cost clones and expensive premium
machines.
IBM launched the Ambra range - IBM clones without IBM's name - as an interim
measure in Europe and Canada while it developed its low-cost ValuePoint,
PS/1 and ThinkPad ranges.
Dixons, the high-street retailer, sells Ambra computers under its Advent
brand. It said yesterday it intended to continue selling the Advent range
and was selecting a new supplier, with IBM as a possibility.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Bonuses soar as Kleinwort doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson yesterday confirmed high expectations for the results of UK
investment banks by disclosing that its 1993 pre-tax profits more than
doubled to Pounds 111.7m, compared with Pounds 45.1m the previous year.
Kleinwort's 2,770 employees also gained heavily from the strong trading
conditions in financial markets, and a rise in underwriting and advisory
work. It said that 'the bulk' of a Pounds 72m rise in expenses was due to
increased bonuses.
After excluding a Pounds 9.2m profit from selling Sharps Pixley, its bullion
and metals business, earnings per share rose to 56.4p, compared with 26p,
and the pre-tax return on equity rose to 26 per cent from 11 per cent.
Although profits were higher than expected, shares closed 20p down at 632p,
partly because of concerns about whether Kleinwort's earnings could be
sustained this year. Some Pounds 121m of income came from dealing profits,
against Pounds 61.9m.
The final dividend was 12.5p, creating a 15.6 per cent rise in the total
payout to 18.5p. Lord Rockley, chairman, said dividends had 'not progressed
much in the past few years, but we are hoping to embark on a period of
growth'.
Lord Rockley said Kleinwort had strengthened its position in advisory work
and equity underwriting. It had worked with governments on 45 privatisations
in 16 countries.
Fees and commissions rose by 67 per cent to Pounds 239m. Lord Rockley said
this showed Kleinwort had stabilised earnings by diversifying away from
volatile net interest income.
Profits from investment banking, including treasury and capital markets
operations, rose 290 per cent to Pounds 76.1m, while investment management
profits rose only 3 per cent to Pounds 26.4m.
Kleinwort said investments in new ventures in India, Japan and the US, had
depressed investment management profits. Lord Rockley said the figures
'disguise a substantial change in the business' which would help earnings
this year.
It disclosed new details of its sources of income to comply with an EU
directive. It gained from a net release of bad and doubtful debt provisions
of Pounds 700,000, against provisions of Pounds 7.6m in 1992.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Pension transfer hope for state workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of public sector workers who transferred into private pension
plans could find it easier to be readmitted to their old schemes under a
possible change in the law being considered by the government.
The move, which follows widespread concern about potential mis-selling of
pension transfers, would be directed at former members of statute-based
occupational schemes, such as that in the National Health Service.
Public sector pension schemes offer some of the best benefits in the UK,
including inflation-linked pension payments and early retirement provisions.
However, members of some schemes were targeted by insurance agents who sold
them private plans.
Some schemes, such as the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, are already allowing
former members back in, though they will be reinstated in full only if they
bring an amount to cover their missing contributions. Other large
occupational schemes have said they will not consider re-admission.
The government is likely to reject suggestions from some regulators and
parts of the life insurance industry that legislation should be used to
encourage private sector schemes to re-admit former members. But any change
in the law would be intended to put pressure on public and private sector
schemes to accept back former members who suffered as a result of poor
advice and wished to rejoin.
The most likely prospect for legislation would be a provision in a bill on
the recommendations of the Goode committee on occupational pensions, which
the Department of Social Security hopes will be included in the 1994-95
parliamentary session.
A working group set up by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
City regulator, is expected in July to report how the industry should
recompense customers who have suffered.
Unease about the selling of pension transfers surfaced late last year after
a study by the accountancy firm, KPMG Peat Marwick, suggested that in nine
out of 10 cases, regulators' standards had not been met.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Nordic and Alpine countries may pay less to join EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four Nordic and Alpine countries now in final talks on entry to the
European Union are likely to pay much less than expected for membership.
Figures put on the negotiating table by the European Commission for the
first time this week show that Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway would
together contribute Ecu6.1bn (Pounds 4.62bn) into the EU's Ecu70bn budget,
and together take out Ecu4.4bn.
Previously, informal Commission calculations had suggested that the four
applicant countries - all richer per capita than the EU average - would
together make a net contribution two to three times higher than the net
contribution now on the table.
The Commission's figures show that Finland, against all forecasts, would be
a small net beneficiary from the Brussels kitty, partly because it is
emerging from a three-year contraction in national output of nearly 15 per
cent. It would in its first year of membership receive a net Ecu119m from
the EU budget, paying in Ecu982m and receiving Ecu1.1bn.
Austria would pay in nearly Ecu2.1bn and receive Ecu1.3bn, contributing a
net Ecu752m. Sweden's balance would be an Ecu765m net contribution. Norway
would pay about Ecu1.1bn, receiving from Brussels Ecu701m - a net payment of
Ecu362m.
The Commission's figures are being examined by EU member states, and may
alter after talks starting next week on agriculture and regional aid
subsidies.
The figures could strengthen public support for membership in the applicant
countries, but poorer member states, led by Spain, are determined that the
northern countries should pay an entry fee to the EU club which reflects
their comparative wealth.
Sweden accepted it would ultimately be a net contributor to the EU. But the
finance ministry said that the EU's calculation for Sweden's gross
contribution next year of around Ecu2.2bn amounted to 1.2 per cent of gross
domestic product.
The finance ministry said it could not afford a net contribution in 1995
because of Sweden's large budget deficit. Sweden would demand that its
budget contribution did not exceed receipts from the EU for the first year.
Sweden proposed that its contribution would increase over the next four
years, ultimately reaching the Commission's figures.
Finnish officials were cautious about the Commission's figures. Finland's
estimated contributions were similar to the Commission's but Mr Tapio
Mutikainen, a senior budget official at the finance ministry, said
'contributions are easier to estimate than our receipts'.

FT  18 FEB 94 / S African right seeks improved ANC offer: Buthelezi attacks
concessions as 'cheap politicking'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The African National Congress was last night preparing to give more details
of its proposed constitutional concessions in an effort to avert a violent
boycott of South Africa's all-race elections in April.
Although rightwing leaders initially rejected the ANC offer as a 'publicity
stunt', they appeared to keep open the possibility of further talks.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party,
condemned the proposals unveiled on Wednesday night, saying they represented
no more than 'cheap politicking on life and death issues'.
However, he said later he would take part in elections if the ANC 'walks the
extra mile' to improve its offer. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, and
President FW de Klerk said they did not believe Chief Buthelezi's comments
were a final rejection.
The ANC is offering stronger powers for the country's provinces, and
separate ballots to elect provincial and national representatives. Mr
Mandela said it might give further concessions in an attempt to persuade
Chief Buthelezi and white rightwing leaders to drop their threat to boycott
the elections.
Speaking in The Hague before talks with Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime
minister, he took a conciliatory line. 'In a case where you are trying to
build a new country there can be no last concessions,' he said. 'We want an
inclusive process and we will do everything in our power to ensure that
everybody participates.'
Inkatha's main objection to the proposals is that they do not go far enough
to strengthen the powers of provincial governments, although they do
guarantee that the powers set out in the 1993 constitution will be protected
against future interference by an ANC-dominated constituent assembly.
The ANC was last night still drawing up detailed proposals, making it
difficult to judge the exact extent of the concessions offered. But
government and ANC officials admitted that Inkatha's demand for strengthened
provincial powers was only partly dealt with.
Political analysts said they believed the ANC was making a genuine effort to
accommodate Inkatha and the white right, but without compromising its
primary goal of ensuring that a strong central government is able to enforce
its economic plans throughout the country.
ANC officials hope that, even if Chief Buthelezi rejects the offer, they may
split the right and persuade moderate rightwingers, such as Gen Constand
Viljoen, an Afrikaner leader, to participate. Gen Viljoen has agreed to meet
the ANC today.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, said the South African economy could grow 3
to 4 per cent this year, after 1.1 per cent growth last year ended a
four-year recession.

FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Renault
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The haste with which Volvo and Renault have gone their separate ways is
quite revealing. Renault and the French government were doubtless keen to
unravel the cross holdings quickly to simplify the privatisation process.
Volvo had been left in little doubt by its shareholders that rapid action
was required. Even so, such a quickie divorce implies that the operational
relationship was hardly close.
The two companies now face complementary problems. Neither truck business is
large enough to stand alone, but Renault's perennially loss-making business
is the harder challenge. In cars, Renault is better placed with new models
and the volume to fund development. Yet it is essentially a European company
and does not have the brand recognition elsewhere which Volvo could have
provided. Volvo may be a world brand, but its lower volumes must limit its
longer term independence. Still, it is difficult to see a potential partner
in Europe. Finding one with Honda or Mitsubishi in Japan may also be hard
now it has wrapped itself in the Swedish flag and Rover has proved how
perfidious Europe can be.

FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an air of unreality about GKN's bid for Westland. While technically
a hostile offer, it has been couched in very conciliatory terms. Sir David
Lees, GKN's chairman, clearly hoped that a recommendation might be
forthcoming, and the company seems slightly embarrassed that it is attacking
a board whose non-executives include a GKN appointee. Equally, Westland's
remarks, while urging no action, have been cautiously neutral. GKN's 45 per
cent holding also lends a certain inevitability to proceedings.
The phoney war may be about to hot up. Westland's resolve to fight seems to
be hardening as it reviews its prospects. Its chances of survival will hinge
on persuading investors that some large potential orders for the EH101
helicopter will be translated into sales. That might just paint a
sufficiently attractive prospect to put Westland's shares above the price
GKN was prepared to pay. There is also the ticklish question for the
Takeover Panel of what exactly would be required for GKN to claim control,
since the exercise of convertible rights could dilute GKN's stake down to 40
per cent over the next year.
On the other side, GKN will have to work hard to persuade investors of the
industrial logic of its argument. It must also convince Westland
shareholders to accept its cash because prospects are uncertain, while
hoping its shareholders will take up the rights issue because Westland is
attractive. The gentlemanly conduct of debate so far has been a credit to
both sides. With the complex issues far from settled, the combatants will do
well if they can keep it that way.

FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, the Bundesbank has shown a capacity to surprise. Having failed
to cut the discount rate at its meeting two weeks ago, it duly lopped half a
point off the rate yesterday although not much, at least domestically, has
changed in between. The trend in consumer prices and the weakness of the
economy certainly justify lower rates, but January money supply growth will
again be well outside the target range and the outcome of the metal workers'
pay negotiations remains uncertain.
The big difference is that the US tightening, which the Bundesbank must have
expected two weeks ago, has been and gone without any serious disruption to
the exchange markets. Indeed, at just below DM1.73, the dollar is a pfennig
weaker than it was two weeks ago.
The Bundesbank's move could thus be taken as confirmation that tighter US
money need not impede European rate cuts. But in cutting its discount rate,
the Bundesbank has simply created room to edge down its securities
repurchase rate which actually sets the tone for the money markets. The
repurchase rate was left unchanged at 6 per cent, indicating that the
Bundesbank intends to use its newly-created headroom cautiously.
Perhaps more important, the excitement in bond markets around Europe was
short-lived. They fell back after the New York market had second thoughts
about the latest US inflation figures. The exchange market may have regained
its composure, but even the prospect of lower short-term rates is not
enough, it seems, to allow European bond markets to decouple from the
transatlantic trend. Unless that happens, the Bundesbank may become still
more cautious about the speed with which it allows money market rates to
fall.

FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo's sweeter pill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo delighted its fans yesterday by flexing its financial muscles. Its 29
per cent interim dividend increase comes on the back of Pounds 1bn of
interim profits and makes it all the harder to understand why Glaxo's shares
have underperformed the market by 19 per cent over the past year, moving to
a substantial yield premium. It takes an extraordinarily dim view of the
world to believe Glaxo is not capable of sustaining above-average dividend
growth for the foreseeable future. With Pounds 2bn in the bank to fund any
strategic moves, Glaxo could afford to divert almost all its free cash flow
into shareholders' pockets, promising a cash bonanza.
Glaxo's underlying business is certainly demonstrating resilience in trying
times. Zantac still produced a 5 per cent sales increase at constant
exchange rates - although that growth may finally slow this year. New
products, though, are performing well with Imigran, in particular, beginning
to deliver on its promises.
Despite the successes, Glaxo cannot conclusively counter the doubters who
believe industry margins are about to change for good. As yet, such doubts
are unanswerable. It may be that Glaxo's worrying sales falls in Germany and
Italy merely reflect local difficulties and cyclical influences. Then again,
they may really presage deeper structural changes. Glaxo appreciates the
need to adapt fast in the US where Merck's merger with Medco threatens to
transform the marketplace. Glaxo boasts the financial strength to
contemplate any number of options. But the expectation of such moves may
limit any bounce in Glaxo's shares in the meantime.

An explanation arises for the number of large unwieldy sub-committees and
interminable meetings held at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales. A 'biscuit memo' is doing the rounds at Moorgate Place,
the institute's London bastion. It decrees no coffee for meetings that last
less than two hours, and no biscuits at all unless outside volunteers are in
attendance. Shaken rather than stirred, seems the bean-counters' response.

It is not often that British Aerospace is held up as a role model. However,
its speedy choice of a new chairman to replace John Cahill may help Fokker,
the loss-making Dutch aircraft maker, narrow its search for a successor to
Erik Jan Nederkoorn.
Nederkoorn, who seems to have been even more unpopular with some of his
troops than Cahill, quit Fokker after failing to get the board to agree to
his restructuring plans. However, the Dutch are still smarting over last
year's sale of a 51 per cent stake in Fokker to Germany's Dasa, so it's
extremely unlikely that the controlling shareholder dare parachute in a
German, at least at this early stage. On the other hand, Dasa is thought to
be reluctant to hand over the helm to yet another prickly and emotional
Dutchman.
Fokker's headhunters, Egon Zehnder, could do worse than follow BAe's lead
and suggest a chairman from a neutral country. BAe does not expect any
difficulty getting its articles of association changed so that it can
accommodate America's Bob Bauman.

James Elles, 44, the Old Etonian son of Baroness Elles, has dreamt up a
spiffing way of getting free air tickets across the Atlantic for him and his
chums in the European Parliament. The Tory MEP for Oxford and
Buckinghamshire has set up something called the Transatlantic Policy
Network.
Its aims - strengthening the US-European alliance now that the cold war is
over - sound pretty grandiose. But Elles has persuaded US Democratic party
big-wig Bob Strauss and Gatt director Peter Sutherland to climb aboard as
honorary presidents - so he should be able to drum up plenty of support on
both sides of the Atlantic.
Who knows, it could prove a nice little bolthole for Elles if, heaven
forbid, he loses his seat in the forthcoming European elections.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a lot to stop the printing presses at the Banque de France.
France's central bank had printed 200m crisp FFr50 notes before someone
spotted a spelling mistake the other day.
The note, which bears a portrait of the late writer, Antoine de
Saint-Exupery, mis-spelled his surname by adding an extraneous acute accent
on the capital 'E'. The bank said it was not a device to catch forgers but
an old-fashioned, low-tech printing error which had since been rectified.
Coming only days after another defect was discovered - the note shrinks in
the wash and loses its foolproof magnetic codes - it's a big blow to French
monetary pride.
When the Bank of England got George Stephenson's birthday wrong on its
Pounds 5 notes, it spotted the mistake before they went into circulation.
By contrast, there are now 200m flawed French banknotes in circulation and,
with no plans to withdraw them, there is no chance of their becoming
collectors' items.
Perhaps the Banque de France's printing works should be added to the
privatisation list?

Some interest rate-watchers swear by the money supply figures; others watch
the exchange rate. But Midland Bank's Alison Cottrell, 29, who has lived far
too long in Roger Bootle's shadow, prefers to check the calendar of
international events. Yesterday's cut in the Bundesbank discount rate
suggests she may be on to something.
Cottrell has been counting the number of times that the Bundesbank fiddles
with its interest rates just before a big economic happening. 'It's like sun
spots. You know they don't mean anything but they sometimes work,' says
Cottrell. When she heard that the next G7 finance ministers' meeting was to
be in Frankfurt on February 26, she let everyone know she smelt an interest
rate cut.
What next? Cottrell has put red rings round the Bundesbank meetings on April
28, a few days after the IMF's spring bash in Washington, and May 26, a few
days before the OECD's annual jamboree. 'Correlation is not causation, but
who cares?' says Cottrell. Sound thinking.

<TEXT>
South Africa's constitutional chicken is coming home to roost. Unless the
country's political leaders return to the negotiating table and tackle
unfinished business, April's election will unleash hostilities that could
even trigger a civil war.
The constitutional agreement reached last November was a remarkable
achievement, but it had one fundamental flaw. It gave the central government
executive, in which the African National Congress is almost certain to be
the leading player, overriding powers over almost all areas of provincial
government. This issue, exacerbated by a dangerous mix of ethnic
differences, party rivalries and personality clashes, is at the heart of the
increasingly bitter dispute between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha
leader whose stronghold is Natal province, and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC
president.
Mr Mandela has attempted to defuse the growing crisis by offering
concessions on the constitution. The ANC has dropped its opposition to
provincial balloting in April, thus allowing regional leaders to prove the
substantial support they claim to enjoy on their home turf. But this will be
of little consequence unless it is made clearer just what power regional
leaders can exercise through the provincial assemblies.
Mr Mandela should make more substantial concessions in an effort to meet
Chief Buthelezi's concerns. Otherwise, they might have little impact on the
crisis. Nevertheless, Chief Buthelezi should also make the most of Mr
Mandela's overture. A door that seemed closed is now ajar. The Inkatha
leader boycotted the final rounds of the constitutional talks, arguing that
the alliance between the ANC and the government allowed them to steamroller
their constitutional model through the conference.
At this critical stage in South Africa's history he should join in, putting
his case and setting out minimum terms for ending his boycott of the April
poll. For his part, Mr Mandela must give more substance to the existing
constitutional blueprint and dispel suspicions that the ANC pays only lip
service to the principle of decentralisation. Western countries keen to
foster free elections in South Africa could help by making clear that those
elections can only succeed if governed by a constitution that provides a
sound foundation for democracy.
An unbridgeable gap may remain at the end of the day. The ANC and the
National party, having gone as far as they think they can towards meeting
Chief Buthelezi's legitimate concerns, may still have to proceed without him
 -facing him with the choice between conceding, in the interests of a stable
South Africa, and pursuing his threat to disrupt the elections, in the name
of democracy. Chief Buthelezi must now grasp what may be the last
opportunity to reconcile these dangerous and deep-rooted differences
peacefully.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Greek disgrace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Convention requires that the state holding the presidency of the European
Union show restraint in pushing its national views and interests where these
are at odds with those of its partners.
Greece gave some sign of observing that convention last week when it allowed
the EU and Nato to adopt resolutions threatening air strikes against the
Bosnian Serbs. But on Tuesday it threw presidentialism to the winds by
banning the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from using the Greek port
of Thessaloniki, which had become its main lifeline since war and sanctions
cut off access to the Adriatic.
Such unilateral interference with the EU's external trade by a member state
is of dubious legality, and should be challenged in the European Court of
Justice. Politically, it is an affront to Greece's partners, which are
unanimous in wanting to help Macedonia, and thoroughly misguided even from
the point of view of Greek national interests - as indeed Greek policy has
been ever since Macedonia declared its independence two years ago.
Greece insists on seeing the use by a neighbouring state of the name
'Macedonia' and of symbols derived from ancient Macedon as a threat to its
territorial integrity. Unlike Bulgaria (which has much better reason to feel
unnerved by the emergence of a state whose national 'language' is in fact a
dialect of Bulgarian, spoken by a significant minority of the Bulgarian
population), Greece has failed to see that the stabilisation of Macedonia is
very much a Greek interest, since its collapse would bring the war of
Yugoslav succession right up to Greece's borders.
Such a collapse is by no means a purely theoretical danger. Macedonia has a
large and discontented Albanian minority, so far represented within the
coalition government but coming increasingly under radical leadership
manipulated from the Albanian capital, Tirana, while threatened by the
equally radical Macedonian nationalist opposition. A much smaller Serb
minority had settled its grievances with the government last August, only to
see its leader resign after a visit to Belgrade, whereupon a new leader
(born in Serbia) repudiated the agreement and produced a new set of demands.
Serbia's President Milosevic weeps crocodile tears over the dangers of
Albanian separatism. 'If such processes continue, I am afraid that there
will be nothing for Greece to recognise,' he told the Greek foreign minister
last November.
To resist such pressures, Macedonia badly needs political and economic
support. In depriving it of its last main trade route, Mr Papandreou is
pursuing domestic political advantage, at the risk of a wider Balkan war.
His compatriots should realise, if he does not, that in so doing he adds to
the intense irritation with Greece already felt by many of its EU partners.
That can hardly be a wise policy for a country so heavily dependent on EU
funds.

FT  18 FEB 94 / Desert kingdom's flight of fancy: Saudi Arabia's Dollars 6bn
aircraft order might be the last flourish of a bygone era

The timing of Saudi Arabia's announcement that it is to spend Dollars 6bn on
purchasing a fleet of passenger aircraft for its domestic carrier could
hardly have been less auspicious. For while President Bill Clinton sought to
reap domestic political benefit from this latest success of the US aircraft
industry, Saudi Arabians were watching the price of crude oil plunge below
Dollars 13 a barrel for the first time in five years.
It will not be surprising if the financing details and delivery dates for
the deal take some time to work out. US and western interest in Saudi Arabia
for the past year has focused primarily on the government's worsening
economic plight, caused by the 20 per cent decline in oil prices. The main
question waiting to be answered was where the spending axe would fall, not
where the next large contracts would be placed. Although the US appears now
to have tied up the kingdom's aerospace market for the next decade or more,
the Dollars 6bn order may yet be remembered as the last flourish of a bygone
era, rather than a reliable guide to the future.
Saudi Arabia is, of course, no stranger to wild fluctuations in annual oil
revenues. It chose for one year in the early 1980s to accept a Dollars 100bn
fall in income. But it appears to have no strategy for reversing the present
slide in prices, and has only very modest financial reserves to cushion the
impact. One senior banker in Riyadh is already forecasting a 5 per cent
contraction in the economy this year.
If the economic trend is clear, the political response to it remains in some
doubt. At the beginning of the year the government announced that it was
slashing budget expenditure by 20 per cent, while in Washington, Prince
Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador, negotiated a slowdown in payments
to several of America's biggest defence contractors. For the first time in
its modern history, the government is also having to consider measures that
will nibble at the unwritten pact between the ruling family and the rest of
the population: no representation equals no taxation.
Changes to the political side of the equation have already been made, albeit
with the caution inherent in deeply conservative regimes. In January, after
a gestation period of three decades, King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz finally gave
birth to the idea of creating a 60-man majlis al-shura, or consultative
council, whose task is to advise him and the government on selected policy
issues. From a western perspective it scarcely heralds the dawn of Saudi
democracy, but within the local context it was widely viewed as an important
step towards popular participation in government.
The council can only advise, and then solely on issues selected by the king.
But with two-thirds of the members holding advanced degrees from western
universities, they could inject a fresh approach and perhaps a hint of
urgency into the way Saudi Arabia faces up to the longer-term consequences
of its descent from sudden, enormous wealth to that of a middle-income
country with a per capita gross national product less than half that of the
UK.
President Saddam Hussein can claim responsibility for having stripped away
the financial safety net with which Saudi Arabia protected itself from
previous sharp falls in oil revenues. The estimated Dollars 55bn-Dollars
60bn which it cost the kingdom to fund the international military effort
required to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait forced Saudi Arabia into
borrowing Dollars 4.5bn, its first international loan. Reserves immediately
available to the government now stand at little more than Dollars 6bn. Net
official foreign reserves are closer to Dollars 70bn, but more than 80 per
cent of that accounts for statutory cover for the currency, amounts held
against letters of credit, liabilities to the commercial banks, and loans
which will never be repaid.
The loss of reserves lends greater weight to the arguments of those calling
for more emphatic official action to reduce the substantial budgetary and
current account deficits. A report nine months ago by the International
Monetary Fund warned: 'The medium-term outlook is for growing budgetary and
external current account deficits because current expenditure growth, even
if modest, is not expected to be matched by an increase in oil receipts.
Such developments would be unsustainable and could cause damage to the
economy.'
Since then the forecasts on which the IMF based its assessments have
worsened significantly, mainly because of the fall in the oil price, but
also because the government is unlikely to have stayed within the spending
limits it set itself for 1993. In 1992 it had set out with the intention of
lopping some 28 per cent off spending, but in the event expenditure of about
Dollars 55bn was some Dollars 11bn over target. The overall budget deficit
expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product was about 10 per cent,
some three times greater than forecast, and more than double that of the US.
Further efforts last year to trim spending are likely to have been more than
offset by the decline in oil revenues, leaving the deficit/GDP ratio still
stuck obstinately in double figures.
Against this background it was no longer credible for the government to
announce, once again, that it was merely planning to cut expenditure. It was
already obvious that government spending would have to decline in line with
oil revenues, just to avoid the deficit worsening. On present oil price
trends, and assuming a continuing Saudi output of 8m barrels a day, revenues
this year might not top Dollars 30bn.
This would suggest total budget receipts of about Dollars 38bn, compared
with the Dollars 53.6bn forecast by the IMF in its last report. This
possible shortfall of Dollars 15bn is partially acknowledged in the scant
details released of the 1994 budget, which has set spending at Dollars
42.7bn, a claimed reduction of some 20 per cent. Saudi Arabia is thus left
in the uncomfortable position of having to cut deeply, but without any
assurance that it can reduce the domestic borrowings needed to fund the
budget deficit.
The IMF has already warned that even if the authorities kept to their
targets, in 1993 total debt would rise from 56 per cent of GDP to 60 per
cent, and unless further stringent measures were adopted would rise to 80
per cent in 1997. The budgetary implications of a mounting debt-servicing
requirement are clear, but what is also of concern to the private sector is
the extent to which increased government borrowing will squeeze funds
available for non-official projects. The repatriation of funds since the end
of the Gulf war has been sufficient to ensure plentiful banking liquidity,
even after government borrowing, but bankers admit that it is not a trend
that is guaranteed.
Those flows and the slowdown in fulfilling arms contracts should also help
ease the country's balance of payments problems, which have mirrored those
of the budget. The Dollars 19.4bn current account deficit in 1992 was more
than Dollars 8bn over forecast, and the 12 per cent fall in the value of
imports during the first half of last year is likely to have been more than
offset by the subsequent decline in oil revenues. Further international
borrowing, although probably not directly by the government, therefore seems
inevitable.
The good news for Saudi Arabians, except for the princely few pocketing
hefty commissions, is that cutting some of the fat from the budget is not a
very onerous task. After the start of the Gulf war, the government went on a
Dollars 30bn arms spending spree, in part to thank its allies for their
help. But some military advisers in Riyadh claim that little of the new
equipment is required to ensure the defence of the kingdom against present
known threats, especially as the US personnel can swiftly make operational
the equipment left behind after the war in Kuwait.
The first modest attempt to address the situation has been the rescheduling
of Dollars 6bn out the Dollars 9bn in payments due to US companies over the
next two years for the purchase of F-15 fighter aircraft. That may have
provided some official justification for the decision to go ahead with the
civil aircraft order. Other delays in payments, agreed with defence
contractors, are likely to follow, with the possibility of outright
cancellations held in reserve.
A similarly modest start has also begun on reducing planned increases in
domestic capital spending, with Saudi Aramco, the national oil company,
scaling down or cancelling projects, including a new Dollars 100m head
office, and the heaviest spending ministries reviewing their plans for the
year.
The astonishing Dollars 2.1bn spent on subsidising wheat production in 1992
 -making the desert kingdom the world's sixth largest exporter - was due to
have been cut last year by Dollars 700m. The crop also absorbs an estimated
90 per cent of the nation's annual water consumption, a commodity that on
present rates of extraction has a lower life expectancy than oil, which
would seem to make the argument for further sharp subsidy cuts not just
financially sensible but imperative for the nation's long-term viability.
But the ripest target of all is still not discussed publicly in the kingdom.
As the IMF team was told by officials last year: 'Political and social
considerations preclude a reduction in subsidies or an increase in fees or
charges.' In other words, hands off one of the world's most comprehensive
welfare states, which guarantees its citizens a virtually tax-free
environment and provides many basic services at no, or little, cost.
It is that issue which, for the senior members of the House of Saud, appears
to lie at the heart of maintaining unchallenged political power. But it is
equally an issue that will not go away, with the indigenous population
having officially topped 12m and growing at about 3.5 per cent annually, one
of the highest rates in the world.
The burden of recurrent and infrastructure spending on items such as
education, healthcare and housing is certain to mount for the rest of the
decade and beyond. Unless the balance of world oil supply and demand
confounds most present predictions, which includes the assumption that at
some point Iraq will resume exports, the government will have to supplement
budget spending cuts with revenue-raising measures and find more ways of
channelling individual wealth into the national exchequer.
One of the long-held tenets among professional Saudi watchers is that the
greatest threat to the stability of the regime would come from a serious
breakdown in the cohesion of the extended royal family. If social equity was
to play any part in the government's future revenue-raising plans, it is
precisely that group of people who would be expected to contribute most.
This is possibly where the newly formed consultative council will eventually
find its niche: as the cautious proponent of ideas which are commonplace
among nations with similar income levels, but still politically incorrect in
Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, the government will continue to count its blessings, foremost
among them 25 per cent of the world's known oil reserves and the possibility
of being able to continue producing 8m barrels a day for at least the next
100 years. Saudi Arabia can also derive some satisfaction that its two
greatest potential external threats, Iraq and Iran, are mired in their own
domestic problems, while continuing peace efforts are defusing the threat of
further Arab-Israeli conflicts. The decision to press ahead with the Dollars
6bn aircraft order serves in part to underline those strengths.
It also reinforces the government's desire not to rock the domestic boat
more than absolutely necessary, which is, as ever, likely to prove the best
guide to future Saudi policy. Even so, there is little prospect this year of
much cheering news to offset the country's more sombre economic long-term
prospects. More than a passing thought should be spared for the
responsibility resting on the shoulders of the national soccer team on June
20, when they take the field for their first World Cup match, against
Holland, in Washington. A win, even a goal, might be worth more politically
to the House of Saud than a dollar on the price of oil.
