FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Restructure planned at Boise
Cascade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boise Cascade is the latest North American forest products company to
restructure, with a plan to spin off the bulk of its newsprint and uncoated
groundwood paper business to its Canadian subsidiary.
The wholly-owned Canadian unit will also be given greater autonomy,
including the ability to fund its own capital needs. A recapitalisation and
a sale of equity to outsiders are being considered.
Idaho-based Boise said it would now concentrate on its white paper,
containerboard, building products and office products distribution
businesses.
Proceeds from the deal with the Canadian subsidiary will be used to reduce
debt and for general corporate purposes.
Terms of the spin-off have yet to be settled, but the enlarged Canadian
company is expected to have annual sales of about USDollars 350m.
The main addition will be a pulp and paper mill in West Tacoma, Washington,
which produces up to 190,000 tons of recycled-content newsprint a year.
The Canadian company will also take over the marketing of up to 420,000 tons
of newsprint a year produced at Boise's big wood-products complex in
DeRidder, Louisiana.
Boise Cascade Canada operates two pulp and paper mills in Ontario, one of
which is being expanded to include a recycling facility.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines drops
first-class seats

<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest US carrier, and its European partner
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday joined the growing number of
international airlines to abolish first-class travel.
Passengers using the two airlines will now have a choice between only two
classes of service: economy class, and a premium service called world
business class, an upgraded version of the old business class service.
The main feature of the service will be a seat pitch (the distance between
seats) of 48 inches, giving passengers about 25 per cent more legroom than
other airlines offer in conventional business class cabins. The usual
business class seat pitch is 38 - 40 inches.
The only airlines offering more room to business class passengers will be
those that have already abolished first-class travel - Virgin Atlantic of
the UK and Continental Airlines of the US, both of which have seat pitches
of 55 inches.
Airlines are moving towards the abolition of first-class accommodation
because of the proportion of fare-paying passengers using it has declined in
the cost-conscious 1990s. Many people occupying first-class seats are
airline employees or passengers enjoying complimentary upgrades.
Carriers believe they can make more money from their aircraft by merging
first class with business class and filling the space with passengers
attracted by higher levels of comfort and service.

<TEXT>
Zenith Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, has reported
a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 5m, despite strong television
sales.
The total fourth-quarter loss, including a previously announced Dollars 31m
restructuring charge, was Dollars 36m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, against a
net loss of Dollars 20.3m, or 67 cents, in last year's fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter sales fell to Dollars 361m compared with Dollars 385m in the
same quarter last year.
Zenith recorded its fifth consecutive full-year loss, at Dollars 97m, or
Dollars 3.01, against a loss of Dollars 105.9m, or Dollars 3.59, in 1992.
The 1992 figures included restructuring charges of Dollars 48m and tax
credits of Dollars 16m. Full-year sales were little changed from 1992, at
Dollars 1.2bn.
The 1993 losses came in the face of a record year for the US television
industry, where more than 25m sets were sold. Zenith said dollar sales of
colour televisions rose substantially in the fourth quarter.
However, strong television sales were offset by declines in other core
businesses, particularly picture tubes sold to other manufacturers. Zenith
said it also had a Dollars 26m drop in fourth-quarter sales from its
non-core businesses, which include magnetics and computer monitors.
The company said it expected its latest restructuring to reduce operating
costs by about Dollars 50m in 1994.

Microsoft, the big US software group, is buying Canada's leading animation
software company in a deal worth USDollars 130m.
Softimage, based in Montreal, is best known internationally for the
animation technology that helped to create the lifelike dinosaur scenes in
Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park film.
Its range of software products is used by film studios, editing houses,
broadcasters, graphic artists and product designers in North America, Europe
and Asia.
Microsoft is acquiring Softimage in a share exchange deal which, with
adjustments, values Softimage shares at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 24.
Its stock traded in New York on Monday at around Dollars 15.
Daniel Langlois, who owns about 25 per cent of the company, and the rest of
the board have accepted the Microsoft offer and urge other shareholders to
do the same.
Microsoft said Softimage will continue to be autonomous. It will develop
specialised software for the creation of high quality digital content for
multimedia services.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Limited, the US clothing retailer that has been struggling to counter
poor sales of women's fashions, reported a 20 per cent fall in net profits
to Dollars 196m from Dollars 244m for its fourth quarter.
Turnover rose from Dollars 2.3bn to Dollars 2.4bn, partly because Victoria's
Secret and other specialty retailing subsidiaries did well and partly
because the group opened more stores, but this was not enough to outweigh
the sharp decline in profit margins at the group's The Limited and Lerner
New York chains. Earnings per share fell from 67 cents to 54 cents.
The final quarter's poor performance produced a decline for the full year,
pulling net income down to Dollars 391m from Dollars 455m and earnings per
share to Dollars 1.08 from Dollars 1.25 - although turnover rose to Dollars
7.2bn from Dollars 6.7bn.
The company's shares rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 , just off their
12-month low of Dollars 16 5/8 .
The Limited said it opened 322 stores last year, remodelled 239 and closed
124, producing a net addition of 198 stores and 1.57m sq ft of selling
space.
This year, the company plans to add 400 stores, remodel 200 and close 100
for a net addition of 300 stores and 2.1m sq ft of space.
Mr Leslie Werner, chairman and chief executive, said he believed the group
was well positioned to take advantage of the current year's emerging fashion
trends.

Salmond Smith Biolab (SSB), of New Zealand, said it had agreed with
Rhone-Poulenc Australia, a unit of the French Rhone-Poulenc chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group, to buy the Australian and New Zealand business of
Rhone Poulenc Laboratory Products Australia for an undisclosed sum, Reuter
reports from Wellington.
Rhone-Poulenc Laboratory Products is a specialist marketing agency for
laboratory chemicals and plasticware and scientific instruments with annual
sales of more than NZDollars 6m (USDollars 3.4m).
Salmond Smith said the acquisition would be effective from March 1 pending
due diligence and the gaining of regulatory consent. The New Zealand company
said the purchase was consistent with its focus on being an international
food company. The Rhone-Poulenc company's operations mirrored SSB's
scientific group's activities.
SSB's scientific group had sales of over Dollars 33m in the year ending June
1993 and the company said the purchase would give impetus to its moves to
increase market share in Australia and New Zealand.

asset base grows

<TEXT>
Standard Bank Investment Corporation, South Africa's second largest banking
group, yesterday announced a 12 per cent advance in pre-tax profit to
R1.23bn (Dollars 357m) in the year to end-December from R1.09bn in 1992.
The group shrugged off harsh domestic trading conditions through the
benefits of continued growth in its asset base, good contributions from its
UK and African banking operations, as well as a reduction in its effective
tax rate and a R62.5m tax credit which flattered the bottom line.
Distributable income jumped by one-third to R844.4m from R637.5m but was
diluted by a larger number of shares in issue to the equivalent of 696 cents
a share, 17 per cent better than the previous year's 593 cents. A total
dividend of 219 cents was declared, against 187 cents.
The group's asset base rose to R62.7bn from R58bn, including a sharp rise in
its home loan portfolio, up 33 per cent to R16.2m, as well as increases in
UK and African assets and the contribution from rights issue proceeds.
Mr Harry Shaw, general manager of financial services, said four years of
domestic recession had taken its toll on new demand for credit and led to
increasing bad debts, which worsened to 0.83 per cent from 0.73 per cent of
advances. The level of bad debts, up at R477m from R380.5m, was
'uncomfortably high'.
Net interest income rose by nearly one-fifth to R3.1bn from R2.62bn before
the increase in debt provisions, higher operating expenses and a flat R467m
tax bill left after-tax profit, before the one-off tax credit, 32 per cent
higher at R759m against R622.9m.
Mr Shaw said the group was budgeting for improved earnings in 1994 but the
rate of increase would slow, with improvements in trading conditions as
dependent on politics as the economy.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Land, Thailand's largest property developer, reported an 8.5 per
cent rise in third-quarter consolidated net profits to Bt1.35bn (Dollars
53m), which was roughly in line with brokers' expectations.
Analysts are particularly keen to examine the balance sheet, which should be
available within the next few days, for evidence that property buyers are
paying promised cash instalments which could show that the company's core
project, the huge Muang Thong Thani new town project on the outskirts of
Bangkok, is viable.
Firm signs that potentially crippling accounts receivables are being
honoured could bolster the chances of Bangkok Land completing a planned
Dollars 600m Euroconvertible. The proposed issue - which would be Thailand's
largest - would fund the construction of an elevated urban railway for
Bangkok.
Nine-month consolidated net profits rose 21 per cent to Bt4.26bn. Earnings
per share improved 8.7 per cent to Bt2.26 in the third quarter and rose 21
per cent at Bt7.11 for the nine months.
TPI Polene, the cement and plastics maker, reported net income down 34 per
cent in the first quarter to Bt287m. Brokers, however, say that foreign
exchange gains of Bt346m inflated the first quarter 1993 figures resulting
in the year-on-year drop.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petrogal privatisation shudders
to a standstill - The Portuguese oil group desperately needs an injection of
fresh capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Petrogal, the Portuguese oil company, had high ideals.
It was to provide the country's biggest commercial enterprise with
entrepreneurial management and fresh capital to compete with world players
in a rapidly deregulating market.
But the denationalisation process has shuddered to a halt less than two
years after it began without a representative from a private shareholder on
the executive board and the company in desperate need of capital to ease a
debt burden fast approaching Es330bn (Dollars 1.88bn).
Private shareholders who bought 25 per cent of the company in July 1992 were
expected to take up an option to purchase a further 26 per cent of the
equity by March 1993. But they have held back, contesting valuations of the
stock and apparently unable to raise the necessary cash. Recently, the group
threatened to pull out of the company altogether if the terms of the
privatisation were not rewritten.
Unless the private shareholders, dominated by Total, the French oil company,
commit themselves to buying the additional 26 per cent, to be used to
increase Petrogal's capital, the government also refuses to inject fresh
money. The result is a damaging stalemate that contributed to a net loss of
Es16bn last year, despite an operating profit, as debt servicing costs rose
to Es26bn. Total owns 48 per cent of the capital in private hands.
'We urgently need fresh capital to reduce our heavy debt burden,' said a
Petrogal executive. 'Our debt to equity ratio is 4.2. This is clearly
abysmal when compared to a company such as Elf Aquitaine of France which has
a ratio of 0.48 or British Petroleum which has a ratio of 0.8.' However, the
company hopes to reduce the debt to equity ratio to below 3 this year.
Given the reluctance of either private or state shareholders to provide
fresh capital, Petrogal's government-appointed management has turned to the
money market to raise what cash it can. It recently raised Es25bn through an
issue of participation titles, a bond and equity hybrid, and plans to issue
commercial paper worth Es20bn and Es30bn in March and April.
The commercial paper issues will be in escudos to help reduce the foreign
exchange exposure of the debt, half of which is in foreign currencies. This
year Petrogal hopes to eliminate foreign exchange losses that cost the
company Es10bn in 1993. Some Es270bn of Petrogal's accumulated debt is
placed with banks.
Despite these efforts, executives estimate that the company needs a further
capital injection of Es50bn to Es60bn this year to reduce indebtedness and
prevent financial costs from eating away profits. No decision has been taken
on how to raise the money.
But an option the government may have to consider is a renegotiation of the
privatisation process that would bring new private shareholders into the
company, even if they were not immediately given voting rights.
Petrogal's private shareholders, grouped together in the holding company
Petrocontrol, have until July 1995 to acquire the additional 26 per cent
before a penalty clause requires them to forfeit 6 of the 25 per cent they
already own.
They were expected to take up the option on the outstanding 26 per cent by
March 1993 because from that date the price of the equity began to climb,
according to an index taken from Portuguese public debt rates. What would
have cost Petrocontrol Es41bn will now cost Es47bn and the price is rising
all the time.
'The logical moment for Petrocontrol to buy the additional equity and take
over control of the company was in March 1993,' said one market analyst.
'Their failure to make a move then shows that they either don't want a
majority holding in Petrogal or that they can't afford it.'
In addition to the stalemate over raising more capital, the course
Petrogal's privatisation has taken could raise further problems. Portuguese
law prohibits foreign investors from directly or indirectly holding a
majority of the company's privately-owned capital. Total holds only 48 per
cent of Petrocontrol directly. But another company, Petromadeira, has
subsequently acquired 25 per cent of Petrocontrol, reportedly using a
financing guarantee from Total to do so.
'Petrogal faces important challenges from maintaining its share of a
liberalised market to completing investments in modernisation to
internationalisation,' said Mr Jose Viana Baptista, Petrogal president. 'The
sooner we can resolve the issues of privatisation and capital the more
successful we will be in meeting these challenges.'

Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, has appointed IBJ Securities, the

The issue, one of three tranches totalling Y60bn, will be the first led by a
securities house affiliated to a bank, established last year, when Japan's
ministry of finance partially eased barriers between the banking and
securities industries.
While Nissan said it had chosen IBJ from its past underwriting record and
information gathering ability, it has designated Nikko Securities and
Yamaichi Securities to lead manage the other two tranches to 'hedge risks'.
Japanese companies have traditionally divided their financing into small
lots to maintain favourable relationships with several securities houses.
Although foreign houses point out such practices hamper cost efficient fund
raising, companies have not been able to break away from the relationship
based financing.
Nissan hopes to launch the issues in late February or early March. IBJ's
tranche will have a maturity of five to six years, Nikko's Y20bn is expected
to have a six or seven-year maturity, while Yamaichi's issue a four-year
maturity.
Since it was set up in July last year, IBJ has lead managed two samurai
issues and managed 17 domestic straight bond issues, while participating in
six underwriting syndicates.

Huhtamaki, the Finnish group whose interests range from chewing gum to
contraceptives, yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to FM506m (Dollars 92m) in 1993, from FM399 in 1992.
The improvement was driven by a 64 per cent increase in earnings by the
Leiras pharmaceuticals division which returned operating profits of FM243m,
helping to offset a 34 per cent slump in operating profits by the Leaf
confectionery business to FM207m. Overall group sales rose 21 per cent to
FM7.93bn, helped by the continued fall during 1993 in the value of the
Finnish markka.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said the pattern of 1993 would shift this
year as a recovery in profitability at Leaf, the world's 10th-largest
confectionery company, was balanced by slower earnings growth for Leiras
which would be held back by clinical trials.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Grand patron exits from
boardroom drama - Andre Rousselet's resignation from Canal Plus ends an era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andre Rousselet will today mark the end of an era when he formally offers
his resignation as chairman of Canal Plus, the dynamic French television
company that he founded 10 years ago, to a board meeting at its modernist
headquarters beside the River Seine in Paris.
Last Thursday afternoon, Mr Rousselet, 72, attended another board meeting at
Havas, the powerful leisure group where he was once chairman and which is
the largest shareholder in Canal Plus. He stormed out of that meeting to
announce his resignation from Havas's board in protest against its decision
to merge its Canal Plus stake with those of Generale des Eaux, the French
utilities group, and Societe Generale, the bank.
However, the sub-plot to the boardroom drama, and the real reason for Mr
Rousselet's departure, is his long-running feud with France Telecom, which
has for years been trying to use Canal Plus as a pawn in its own media
strategy. France Telecom plans to take a minority stake in Havas thereby
posing a serious threat to Mr Rousselet's vision of Canal Plus as an
independent force in European media arena.
Canal Plus faces the challenge of trying to repair its relationship with its
largest shareholders at a critical time when profits are under pressure and
it is renegotiating its franchise with the French government. The next few
months will be decisive in determining whether it can cling on to its
independence and fulfil its international aspirations - without Mr
Rousselet.
Mr Rousselet is a grand patron who had complete control over his company.
His charm is legendary - as is his temper. He has considerable political
clout thanks to Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president who is a
close friend and regular golfing partner. The success of Canal Plus's
original pay-TV channel enabled Mr Rousselet to turn the company into a
stock market star and to establish himself as a force on the European media
scene.
His chosen successor is Mr Pierre Lescure, 48, a former radio reporter who
is Canal Plus's chief executive. He has for some time been regarded as Mr
Rousselet's heir apparent and has a high profile in French media circles:
not least as a former boyfriend of the actress, Ms Catherine Deneuve. If the
board backs his candidature Mr Lescure will today be endorsed as chairman
and will then have to get to grips with Canal Plus's problems.
At the top of the new chairman's agenda will be the negotiations for Canal
Plus's new pay-TV franchise. The existing franchise, which expires at the
end of the year, was agreed before Canal Plus's launch when no one, not even
Mr Rousselet, realised how successful it would be. The new agreement will
undoubtedly be more onerous particularly in the level of Canal Plus's
support for France's heavily loss-making cable television network.
The government is pressing Canal Plus to invest about FFr450m (Dollars
76.3m) in cable TV. The company has argued that it can not afford such a
heavy investment at a time when profits are declining. It has warned of a
fall in net profits to about FFr1bn for 1994 from FFr1.2bn in 1993.
Yet Canal Plus's room for manoeuvre in the negotiations could be constrained
by the extended power of its main shareholders. Last week's deal means that
Havas, Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale collectively control 48.7 per
cent of the company thereby scuppering Mr Rousselet's old divide-and-rule
approach to investor relations.
Generale des Eaux has substantial investments in French cable: as has France
Telecom, which is about to take a minority stake in Havas thereby becoming
its main multimedia partner.
These companies might prefer Canal Plus to comply with the government by
increasing its support for the cable system.
Similarly, France Telecom seems set to exert more influence over Canal
Plus's choice of technology. It has repeatedly clashed with Mr Rousselet
over his insistence that Canal Plus should be free to choose its own
satellite and decoding technology. His departure, coupled with the extension
of Havas's influence through the formation of the concert party, clears the
way for France Telecom to have a direct say in Canal Plus's future.
This raises the risk that Canal Plus will, as Mr Rousselet feared, be
relegated to a junior role as a bit-part player in the multimedia strategies
of Havas, France Telecom and Generale des Eaux rather than defining its own
niche in the international market place.
Mr Rousselet had attempted to avert such a scenario by bringing
international investors into Canal Plus thereby curbing the power of its
French shareholders. He is believed to have held talks with Time Warner, the
US media group. But his plan was thwarted last Thursday by the creation of
the Havas concert party.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Regulators lift strict
supervision of Citicorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp announced yesterday that federal banking authorities have agreed to
end their strict regulatory supervision of the large US banking group. The
decision is likely to pave the way for Citicorp to reinstate its dividend,
which has been suspended since late 1991.
The strict regulatory surveillance - known as a memorandum of understanding
 -was imposed on Citicorp by the New York Federal Reserve and the
Comptroller of the Currency in February 1992. At the time, the bank was
burdened with billions of dollars of bad loans, and Citicorp was one of
hundreds of, mostly smaller, US banks that had agreed to accept
exceptionally broad surveillance by industry regulators.
Among the restrictions imposed by the special agreement with regulators,
Citicorp was not allowed to make acquisitions or add to its assets without
the approval of the federal authorities. Also, the bank did not declare a
dividend while the agreement was in force.
The bank is expected to announce its first dividend payment on its common
stock to shareholders in 2 1/2 years. Analysts suggest this could happen as
early as the end of the current quarter.
Citicorp will be able to consider the acquisition of other banks. Although
the group is not believed to be planning any such moves in the immediate
future, Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, told employees that capital was
available for the bank's growth.
While the lifting of the memorandum of understanding will not effect the
day-to-day operations of the bank, it is a recognition that regulators are
satisfied with Citicorp's financial position.
In the past two years, the bank's management has worked hard to restore
Citicorp's health, slashing costs, beefing up its reserves, selling assets
and writing off bad loans. During that period the bank has benefited from
low domestic interest rates, which have widened the margin between the
interest it pays on its funds and the interest it earns on its loans, and an
improvement in the condition of the US commercial property market. The bank
is now considered well capitalised by regulators, and last month Citicorp
announced record annual profits of Dollars 2.2bn for 1993.

<TEXT>
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, reported its
third consecutive annual loss yesterday and said it was set to remain in the
red in 1994.
However, it said it was past the worst of its difficulties and should be
back in profit next year.
The 1993 pre-tax deficit fell to FM2.66bn (Dollars 484m) from FM3.66bn a
year earlier due to higher income and a drop in lending write-offs. The
group would have met its target of halving the 1992 loss but for a FM900m
provision to cover future risks in the Finnish corporate sector.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, Kop chief executive, warned there would be no instant
improvement in the bank's figures in 1994 because bad loan volumes were
still high. 'This year we cannot realistically expect a return to
profitability, but the situation is much more under control than last year,'
he stated.
The 1993 performance benefited from a 21 per cent increase in income to
FM4.89bn and a 32 per cent drop in credit losses to FM2.91bn.

FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Institutions pay FFr403 a share
for Elf

<TEXT>
Institutional investors in the privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the large
majority of which are European, will pay FFr403 (Dollars 68.3m) a share in
the oil group, according to the French economy ministry.
The price, determined through a process of book-building, is largely in line
with market expectations. It compares with FFr385 for the public issue and
yesterday's closing price of FFr424.
As with the public issue, which was three times subscribed, the tranche
allocated to institutional investors received strong demand, according to Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister.
However, the imposition of a clawback option meant that the 27m Elf shares
originally allocated to institutional investors were reduced by 20 per cent.
Of the institutional tranche, about 26 per cent of the shares will go to
French groups and 45 per cent will go to other European investors. US
institutions will receive about 22 per cent of the shares. Combining the
institutional and the public offer, about 73 per cent of Elf's shares sold
on the market will be in French hands.
The total proceeds to the state, including the market issues, the sale of
shares to a group of long-term stable investors and the tranche for Elf
employees, is expected to bring receipts of about FFr35bn. Mr Alphandery
said the smooth sale of most of its 51 per cent stake in Elf, which is due
to be followed by the sale of Union des Assurances de Paris, put the
government well on course to achieve its target of FFr55bn from
privatisation receipts this year.
With the exercise of the clawback option, individual investors will receive
a total of 38.6m shares, although most will be still be alloted fewer than
they ordered. Applicants for between 10 and 30 shares will receive the first
10 shares ordered and some extra shares in line with the amount requested.

<TEXT>
Pharma Vision 2000, the Swiss pharmaceutical shares investment company, has
arranged to sell its SFr410m (Dollars 283m) stake in Ciba-Geigy because it
disagrees with the Basle-based group's policy to remain diversified in
chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
This decision could have some impact on Ciba shares in the next few days.
Moves by Pharma Vision and other investment vehicles controlled by Mr Martin
Ebner's BZ Bank group are closely watched in Swiss equity markets.
Two weeks ago, BK Vision, another investment company controlled by Mr Ebner
and his associates, revealed it was running down its stake in CS Holding,
the financial group built around Credit Suisse. Since then, CS shares have
been weaker than the Swiss banking sector as a whole.
Mr Christoph Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision, said in his annual
statement that the company reduced its Ciba holding last year because Ciba
was 'sticking to its strategy of diversification rather than focusing on the
pharmaceutical sector'.

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is to spend DM250m (Dollars 147m) on
buying up convertible securities in Grundig, its 31.6 per cent-owned German
consumer electronics company, from a consortium of German and Swiss banks.
The transaction, expected on March 14, follows a decision by the three banks
 -Dresdner Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Union Bank of Switzerland - to
exercise their 10-year-old option to sell the securities to Philips.
Philips said it had no immediate wish to convert the securities into
ordinary shares, which would raise its stake in Grundig to just over 50 per
cent.
Instead, the group is negotiating with Grundig and the Grundig family
foundation to extend the life of the securities.
The convertible debentures currently carry a coupon of 9 per cent, but if
the negotiations are successful, this level is expected to be lowered to
bring the coupon more into line with prevailing interest rates.
Although Philips owns less than one-third of Grundig's ordinary shares, it
already has complete management control over the company and fully
consolidates the Grundig results in its own accounts.
Continued losses at Grundig, which is currently undergoing a restructuring
programme, have helped keep the results of Philips' consumer electronics
division in the red.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Mersey Docks improves 38% to
Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mersey Docks and Harbour, which last September acquired the Medway ports of
Chatham and Sheerness to become the UK's second-largest port group, made
profits of Pounds 20.9m before tax in 1993, a rise of 38 per cent.
Medway's profits contribution was Pounds 1.27m for November and December
only. This means Port of Liverpool profits were still a record Pounds 19.6m,
against Pounds 15.2m in the previous year, restated from Pounds 16.4m under
FRS 3.
Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive, said Medway's operating profits last
year were Pounds 10.6m, compared with Pounds 10.1m forecast at the time of
the takeover. Growth in trade is continuing in both the Medway and the
Mersey.
Total turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 98.4m (Pounds 86.4m), with Port of
Liverpool cargo up 5 per cent to 29.3m tonnes. This, the best throughput for
three decades, was achieved with only 400 dockers. Throughput broke the 10m
tonnes barrier in 1987 and passed 20m tonnes in 1989.
Break-bulk general cargo was up 21 per cent, grain ahead 16 per cent, and
containers up 3 per cent, despite tight competition on North Atlantic
routes. Scrap metal cargoes were 1.4m tonnes, making Liverpool the
second-largest in Europe after Rotterdam.
Liverpool's assault on Irish Sea markets continued. Mr Furlong now claims a
third of total cargoes and 60 per cent of unitised or container traffic
between Dublin and the UK. He believes Liverpool's position near the centre
of Britain's motorway network gives it an edge over the more remote ports of
Stranraer and Holyhead because of tachograph restrictions on truck drivers.
With its own terminals at Dublin and Belfast, the group plans faster
turnround of Irish Sea roll-on-roll-off ships by building a Pounds 10m
floating berth at Birkenhead to save locking in and out of port.
The project is stalled because Merseyside Development Corporation, a
government agency, wants a mixed retail, commercial and residential property
complex where the group wants the floating berth's container terminal.
Last year's 2-for-5 rights issue, which was used to largely fund the Medway
purchase, raised Pounds 79m, compared with a budgeted Pounds 75.6m. The
group has invested in a Pounds 500,000 extension to Sheerness's quayside
storage facilities.
With earnings per share up 33 per cent from an adjusted 15.05p to 19.96p, a
proposed final dividend of 6.15p lifts the total 20 per cent to 9p (7.5p).
Mr Furlong said the group would continue to search for suitable,
complementary acquisitions. The government, which still owns a 20 per cent
stake from the financial rescue of the defaulting Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board in 1970, has said it has no intention to sell in the current financial
year.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen at Pounds 3.5m and expects growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at St Modwen Properties doubled to Pounds 3.5m in the year
to November 30, compared with Pounds 1.71m.
Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said that in the present year demand was
buoyant for attractive properties and development profits were already ahead
of the Pounds 890,000 (Pounds 1.45m) for the whole of 1992-93.
He added that despite general sluggishness in tenant demand investment
income surplus continued to grow.
However, the shares slipped 3p yesterday, ending the day at 57p.
The result was achieved in line with the company's policy of increasing
investment income, which at Pounds 7.82m (Pounds 6.75m) now exceeds
overheads, dividends and related tax.
The annual rent roll rose 29 per cent to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.5m) following
the purchase of two substantial retail properties in west and south-east
London and progress in letting empty properties.
Turnover fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 17m as a result of a fall in
property development to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds 10.7m). Rental income, however,
was higher at Pounds 8.33m (Pounds 7.11m).
The pre-tax figure was helped by Pounds 758,000 (Pounds 415,000) profit on
sale of investment properties. There was also a fall of Pounds 1.07m in the
interest charge to Pounds 3.82m.
Net assets per share improved from 35p to 39p over the year. There was an
increase of Pounds 3.44m in the investment property portfolio following a
valuation.
Earnings per share doubled to 2.2p (1.1p). A final dividend of 0.7p is
recommended for an increased total of 1p (0.6p).

Shares in Armitage Brothers, the pet products manufacturer, yesterday rose
35p to 215p as the company reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 715,000 to Pounds 810,000 for the 28 weeks to December 12.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds
13.4m which was, said Mr Russell Taylor, chief executive, the result of new
business rather than sales price increases.
He said that while the economic situation remained fragile the company was
continuing to put money into marketing and product development in the UK and
overseas, hoping to build on the successes of the past few years.
Earnings per share came out at 13.5p (11.9p).
The interim dividend is raised from 2.6p to 2.7p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Hartstone Group have approved resolutions regarding the sale
of Cogetex in France and part of the UK hosiery business, which includes
Bear Brand, to Courtaulds Textiles for Pounds 45.4m.
Hartstone breached its banking covenants last summer and its current
standstill agreement with its lenders expired yesterday.
The company said no further formal standstill arrangement had been put in
place because it believed conditional medium term facilities, which would
extend until January 1996, would be forthcoming within the next ten days.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Inoco in the black with Pounds 2.56m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inoco, the USM-quoted property group, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.56m in 1993, compared with losses of Pounds 4.47m, restated in accordance
with FRS 3. There were profits of Pounds 834,000 at the halfway stage.
The turnround was largely the result of a reduction in interest charges from
Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 4.4m, reflecting net repayment of Pounds 11.9m of bank
loans and lower bank base rates. In addition, the 1992 figures included
exceptional losses of Pounds 4.1m on trading stocks and fixed assets.
Turnover, being gross rents received, improved to Pounds 9.97m (Pounds
9.46m) and operating profits rose from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 6.81m.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.21p (2.14p losses).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Howard Holdings yesterday firmed 4p to 29p, after the property
development and plant hire group returned to the black at the interim stage.
On turnover of Pounds 3m, which compared with sales of Pounds 1.47m last
time and almost matched the Pounds 3.07m achieved in the group's last full
year, pre-tax profits for the six months to end-October amounted to Pounds
37,370, against a Pounds 197,771 loss.
The outcome also reflected reduced interest charges of Pounds 152,739
(Pounds 212,072).
Mr John Howard, chairman, said the property development side 'now appears to
be reaping the financial benefit of a change in emphasis from building flats
to houses'.
After a nil tax charge, earnings per share emerged at 0.15p (losses of
0.75p).

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stripped down and on the recovery road -
Paul Cheeseright on the progress at Leyland Daf Vans since its MBO last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leyland Daf Vans, which went into receivership a year ago and is now the
largest UK-owned automotive manufacturer, will shortly announce 1993 profits
which will reflect both the recovery in its corporate fortunes and a limited
revival of the panel van market.
The company, operating from its plant at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, has
been profitable since the first day of the Pounds 40m management buy-out
from the receivers in April 1993. Sales in the eight months since then have
been about Pounds 80m. The turnover target for 1994 is Pounds 150m.
'We have achieved all of the commitments we gave to the institutions,' said
Mr Allan Amey, chief executive. The main equity investor in the company is
3i, the venture capital group. Financing came from the Royal Bank of
Scotland and United Dominions Trust.
Last March, when the company was in receivership following the failure of
Daf, its Dutch parent, its market share of the UK panel van market slipped
to 6 per cent. Once production had resumed and the new company had sorted
out its dealership arrangements, market share started to rise, averaging
13.3 per cent a month for April to December 1993.
Last December Leyland Daf's market share was 19 per cent and the company
calculates it is now running at about 16 per cent.
Mr Amey said that last August the total size of its market was 5 per cent
smaller than a year before, but since then it had been between 10 and 15 per
cent larger. In the second half of 1993 smaller businesses and smaller local
authorities, which had been delaying purchase decisions, came back into the
market. Fleet purchases remained steady.
'I'm not saying the market is buoyant but we can see more activity in the
last four months,' said Mr Amey.
Yet, he added, and this is characteristic of the motor sector, 'margins have
been very, very tight, because to a large degree we've been suffering from
what's going on in Europe.' That is, declining markets are encouraging
competitors like Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen to push into the UK market.
However, this has not stopped expansion at Leyland Daf, which has just
announced plans to raise production from 200 to 250 vans a week and to take
on 50 people. During the receivership, the workforce fell by 800 to about
1,000.
Rather, the response to the margins pressure has been, as elsewhere in the
sector, to bear down on the cost base. 'The break-even point is at least 30
per cent lower than it was in the old organisation,' Mr Amey calculated. The
new company has stripped away overheads associated with its old parent,
consolidated all its activities at Washwood Heath and introduced zero-based
budgeting.
Although the new company's re-established position in the panel van market
has defied the fears expressed at the time of the buy-out that the company
would be too small to survive, there are problems it is being forced to deal
with.
First, its press shop, one of the largest in Europe, which contributes 12
per cent of total turnover and half of whose activities are supplying
outside customers like Land Rover and Leyland Trucks, is only working at 60
per cent of capacity. It needs more customers.
Second, the future of the company depends on the development of the 200 and
400 series of vans, its staple output. Some Pounds 8m of a Pounds 30m
development plan has already been committed. Meanwhile, Leyland Daf is
seeking to consolidate its market position by offering customer-specified
variants of its basic models.
Third, Mr Amey noted that the company must strengthen its relations with its
key component suppliers. It is trying to halve the number of suppliers with
whom it must deal to about 200. Leyland Daf needs the expertise of its
systems suppliers in the development of new models, but it is not large
enough to coerce co-operation. It will have to forge partnerships rather
than force them as has happened in parts of the car industry.
Finally, Leyland Daf needs to strengthen a dealer network which was thrown
into confusion by the receivership and which in any case tends to handle the
vans as one of a number of franchises. Leyland Daf wants the dealers both to
sell the vans and market the company.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Union Discount back in the black with
Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Discount, one of the City's leading discount houses, yesterday
reported a return to profitability after two years of heavy losses and
announced the end of a costly restructuring programme.
It has also securitised Pounds 42m worth of leases issued by its two
remaining leasing subsidiaries, raising Pounds 38.2m.
Mr Ian Martin, managing director, said this gave the company 'breathing
space to reduce our involvement on a measured basis'.
The company, which is to be renamed Union to reflect its broader spread of
businesses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.5m for the 1993 year. That
compared with losses of Pounds 23.5m and Pounds 16m in 1991 and 1992
respectively. It celebrated the turnround with a dividend of 3p, its first
for two years. Earnings of 11.5p per share compared with losses of 78.2p.
A profit of Pounds 6.5m from the disposal of Winterflood Securities was
matched by Pounds 6.7m of exceptional losses from Union's withdrawal from
its disastrous 1980's push into term financing.
Mr George Blunden, the chief executive who has instigated a radical
clean-out since his appointment in June 1992, said the process was almost
complete.
The only remaining non-core activity is its Sales Aid Leasing businesses,
which contributed Pounds 1.8m to operating profit last year, but is likely
to be sold in the longer-term.
The securitisation of leases from this business is in the form of Pounds
32.5m of senior notes, expected to have a AAA rating, and Pounds 5.7m of
Mezzanine notes issued by Union's Sabre Leasing subsidiary which are
expected to have an A2 rating.
Continuing operations contributed Pounds 4.37m before exceptional items. The
management is confident that this represents a profitable core, with upside
potential from various new businesses.
Union intends to build up Aitken Campbell, its marketmaking arm, and its
derivatives business.
COMMENT
In a short period of time, new management has brought Union Discount back
from the brink and it is once more in a position to focus on its money
market skills, where it has more than a century of expertise. With capital
tied up in lossmaking leasing businesses, its money market activities have
been restricted, as have a growing range of related businesses where it can
build on its existing client base. Analysts expect pre-tax profit to
increase to Pounds 5.5m in the current year. At a share price of 202p, the
shares are trading on a prospective p/e of about 10.4, and a premium to net
asset value per share of 197p. Given its stage of recovery, further upward
movement will be an act of faith in the management, but it has gone some way
to earn this.

<TEXT>
London &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based and London-quoted shipping
company, reported income before tax of Dollars 795,000 (Pounds 545,000) for
the three months to December 31, against Dollars 547,000.
Mr Miles Kulukundis, chief executive officer, said the result was achieved
in difficult trading and came despite the London Enterprise suffering a
particularly poor three months of charters and one-off costs of the office
move of the London subsidiary.
Gross revenue doubled to Dollars 7.64m (Dollars 3.97m) as a result of
increased charter rates and the inclusion of the London Pride. The figures
took the nine-month profit to Dollars 2.36m (Dollars 372,000) on revenue of
Dollars 20.3m (Dollars 13m).
The company also announced the completion of its investment programme. It is
now having two new tankers built, with the second to be delivered towards
the end of 1995.
The three-month profit was after a net interest charge of Dollars 1.19m
(Dollars 135,000). Earnings per share fell to 2 cents (2.3 cents) following
the issue of 50m shares in December.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington to reduce debt via Australian
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington, the glass maker, is to float a 49 per cent stake in its
Australasian operations on the Australian stock exchange.
The sale will help Pilkington cut borrowings, which stood at Pounds 1.02bn,
giving 87 per cent gearing, at its September half year end - before the
Pounds 200m disposal of Sola, its spectacle lens business. Pilkington aims
to cut gearing to 50 per cent by 1995, helped by disposals.
The timing for a float is considered good, and profits of the business are
recovering. However, Pilkington is not expected to recoup the Pounds 103m it
spent in 1988 to acquire 50.3 per cent of the Australasian business from BTR
Nylex.
The flotation is expected to take place in mid-1994. Keeping a 51 per cent
stake will enable Pilkington to consolidate 100 per cent of the Australasian
subsidiary's profits, taking a minority charge after tax.
Since 1988 Pilkington has taken severe action to improve its Australasian
operations, which now include two float tanks and significant downstream
operations such as glass toughening and automotive glass making.
Heavy extraordinary losses were caused by the closure of a lossmaking
curtain walling operation and the New Zealand sheet glass plant which was
falling into losses. It is the only float glass maker in Australasia and has
70 per cent of the market.
Profits in recent years had also been under pressure from recession and
cheap imports from China and other parts of Asia. However, economic recovery
and action to stop dumping have led to a recent revival in profits.
Turnover of the Australasian business was ADollars 384m (Pounds 189m) in
1992-93, from which it is thought pre-interest profits were about ADollars
20m.
Mr Geoff Marshall, chief executive of Pilkington Australasia, said the group
would come to the market with 'a commercially viable balance sheet'.
Potter Warburg, the stockbrokers, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand are advising
Pilkington on the float.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Key shareholder gives Butte Mining poll win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change of mind by a key shareholder helped management of Butte Mining to a
resounding win in the poll called for at the annual meeting three weeks ago,
Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, reported last night.
More than 90m votes were cast in favour of the board's five resolutions
while about 20m were against, he said. Butte's main activity is prosecuting
US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from
former managers and promoters - and most of the votes against were cast by
defendants, he added.
A block of 18.9m shares, representing 7.9 per cent of the issued capital,
that was voted against the resolutions at the meeting was switched in the
poll to favour the board. This block was once owned by Mr Clive Smith, who
was the promoter and a former director of Butte, but was taken by Societe
Banquaire de Paris, apparently when he fell behind with loan payments. In
August the shares were sold to a Swiss company, Oeri Finanz.
Mr Lloyd-Jacob said that 'after we had friendly discussions with them (Oeri)
they concluded that they should have voted yes.' He said most of the Oeri
stake had now been sold on the open market - 'which is probably why the
Butte share price has been rather weak recently.'
Another sizeable block of Butte shares, 7 per cent, is controlled by
Edinburgh-based Waverley Mining Finance. Mr Willie McLucas, Waverley's
managing director, said this stake was not voted. He said: 'If the board was
defeated, what would I have achieved? Waverley has other, positive,
constructive things to concentrate on at the moment.' However, he made it
clear that he remained unhappy. 'The board believes in its strategy but that
strategy is crucifying the ordinary shareholders.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TR Pacific net assets surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value per share of TR Pacific Investment Trust rose from 114.6p to
242.4p over the 1993 year.
Net revenue declined from Pounds 490,000 to Pounds 475,000, equal to
earnings of 0.709p (0.731p) per share. A same-again single dividend of 0.35p
is recommended. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.
The trust's investment policy is targeted towards capital growth and
revenues are normally low. A 14 per cent improvement in gross revenue to
Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.04m) was more than offset by higher costs - interest
charges increased to Pounds 547,000 (Pounds 282,000).
Directors said the rise in Pacific stock markets was 'broadly based with
strong gains achieved across the region'. Hong Kong remains the trust's
largest investment area.
They added that the outlook for economic growth and company profits
'continues to be encouraging in most countries and . . . long term, the
prospects for the region and its stock markets continue to be excellent'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers of Speyhawk, the developer that collapsed last May, have sold part
of its portfolio to Scottish Amicable.
The price paid was a fraction of the Pounds 110m loan that was secured on
the portfolio. The value of Speyhawk's properties was hit extremely hard
during the property downturn, because the properties included development
sites and buildings only partly let.
The portfolio included Prospect West, an office building in Croydon, The
Corn Exchange, a shopping centre in Tunbridge Wells, the Bradley Stoke
District Centre in Bristol and Weymouth Town Centre. Some properties in
Brighton and some residential units financed using the loan were excluded.
Mr Peter Spratt of Price Waterhouse said the sales had secured the long-term
future of key developments.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 5p off Argyll shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll, the supermarket group, warned yesterday that fierce competition in
the grocery market would reduce its profits this year, but announced a
smaller underlying sales fall for the past four months than the City was
expecting.
The group, which includes Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost, said the outcome for
the year to April 2 would be 'slightly below last year', due to a fall in
gross margins and like-for-like sales. That was before the effect of new
depreciation policies, which will knock Pounds 40m off profits.
The grocery sector faces looming saturation and the rapid growth of
cut-price discounters, and has been rocked in recent weeks by statements
from Argyll's rivals, Tesco and J Sainsbury.
Tesco said it was cutting its expansion programme, while Sainsbury revealed
a 1 per cent fall in underlying sales - leading to the biggest-ever one-day
fall in its share price.
But yesterday's news from Argyll knocked only 5p off its shares, which
closed at 256p.
Some analysts suggested that Argyll's comments about a recent recovery in
margins, together with its rivals' insistence that they expected to hold
margins at their new levels, indicated the market was stabilising.
Sir Alistair Grant, Argyll chairman, said he privately agreed with the
Sainsbury chairman, Mr David Sainsbury, that the 'hottest' period of price
competition had passed, although further price cuts could not be ruled out.
'There have been no real winners in this recent period of competitive
activity,' he said. 'But we are running our business on the basis that this
is a very competitive market and we cannot be out of line with our
competitors.'
Total sales for the 16 weeks to February 5 were up 10.7 per cent. New stores
added 11.1 per cent, while sales from existing stores fell 0.4 per cent -
beating analysts' forecasts of a fall of 1 per cent or more.
The decline resulted from 'exceptionally low inflation', including a fall in
grocery prices in December, as well as trading down by customers to cheaper
products and a fall in margins as Safeway responded to price-cutting by its
rivals.
Sir Alistair said Argyll's gross margin had fallen almost one percentage
point. But it had recovered slightly in recent weeks as customers were
buying more own-label products, with a higher margin, and increasing volumes
had enabled Safeway to negotiate better terms with its suppliers.
In spite of the profits fall, Argyll anticipates a final dividend of 7.75p,
lifting the total from 10.9p to 11.5p, but said future increases would match
earnings growth.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Float values Mithras at Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mithras Investment Trust, a provider of mezzanine finance to unquoted
companies, is to come to the market through a placing which values the group
at Pounds 20m.
The company was formed in 1990 by Legal &amp; General Ventures - which remains
the investment manager - Pricoa and Banque Indosuez. It has investments in
10 unquoted companies and Anglian Group, which floated in 1992.
By floating and gaining investment trust status, Mithras will be able to
avoid capital gains tax on the sale of its Anglian shares and other
companies that may float.
NM Rothschild and Warburg Securities yesterday placed 10m Mithras shares at
50p, raising Pounds 4.25m. The company had net assets of Pounds 15m, or
49.9p a share, at end-1993.
The flotation comes less than a month after Postel, the UK's largest fund
manager, bought a 20 per cent stake in Intermediate Capital Group.
ICG is one of the few groups still providing mezzanine finance - a form of
capital that is riskier and higher yielding than bank debt but is not
generally classed as equity and is not usually as risky.
Many banks entered the mezzanine market in the late 1980s but withdrew in
the early 1990s after losing money on overly leveraged buy-outs such as
Isosceles.
The prospectus warns that Mithras's principal investments are in loans to
unquoted companies with high levels of gearing.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MIN may sue over football club dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writs are expected to fly today in the feud between Birmingham City Football
Club and Midland Independent Newspapers, the publishing group which is set
to float next month.
MIN is expected to sue either Mr David Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday
Sport and majority owner of the football club, or Ms Karren Brady,
Birmingham City's managing director, for libel.
The action arises from anonymous documents which have been circulated
raising questions over the readerships of individual newspapers and company
transactions with directors.
The dispute is likely to be included as a contingent liability in MIN's
prospectus, following comments from Ms Brady and Mr Sullivan that they would
seek a boycott of the group's papers from the 28,000 fans on the club's
mailing list.
The feud began last month when Ms Brady wrote to Mr Christopher Oakley,
MIN's chief executive, demanding greater financial support of the club.
After further exchanges, Ms Brady suggested that a boycott of the paper by
Birmingham City fans could knock 10 per cent off the circulation of the
Birmingham Post &amp; Mail.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unclear route ahead for transport leaser -
Andrew Bolger looks at Tiphook's proposed disposal of its container
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will Tiphook, the transport leasing company, have any future after it has
sold off its main asset to reduce a crippling debt burden?
That is the question which shareholders and US bondholders were wrestling
with yesterday, as they considered long-awaited details of the proposed
disposal of Tiphook's container business to Transamerica, the US financial
services group.
The answer is by no means clear. The group's current debts of Pounds 1.1bn
will be substantially reduced by the proceeds of the sale, even although the
price has fallen from the surprisingly high Pounds 830m first announced in
November to the latest figure: a minimum of Pounds 690m. A further Pounds
44m will be placed in an escrow account, but that will be subject to further
claims by Transamerica.
Even the sale is not yet certain, since it is subject to approval by
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on March 10. In reality, they have
little choice: the accompanying circular makes it clear that should the
disposal be blocked, the group would be forced into liquidation - leaving
investors with nothing.
The group's main banks - led by National Westminster and Commerzbank of
Germany - have decided to soldier on, although some of the smaller and more
restive banks have had their loans paid off.
One analyst said: 'The big lenders realise that if any one of them puts the
company into receivership, it would just cause a financial meltdown.'
A greater threat comes from US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars
700m (Pounds 479m) and as unsecured lenders are in a more exposed position.
Seeking to deflect the bondholders' anger, Tiphook has proposed that up to
Pounds 193m of the sale proceeds be used to purchase 40 per cent of the US
bonds at par.
The tender offer is more than some bondholders had expected at this stage,
but the group still faces litigation in the US from bondholders claiming to
have been misled by over-confident assertions about Tiphook's prospects.
The group's debt was downgraded to so-called junk-bond status within months
of issue last year.
Tiphook's circular warns that a class action launched by US bondholders
could, if successful, make the group liable to the full Dollars 700m raised
in the US. One analyst said: 'If they were to lose anything like that sort
of amount, it would all be over.'
Even assuming shareholder approval for the container sale and the avoidance
of a doomsday judgment in the US courts, Tiphook's future looks precarious.
After the disposal, Tiphook will still have debts of about Pounds 500m and
shareholders funds will fall to about Pounds 40m, minus whatever the company
loses in the second half to April. A refinancing will therefore be necessary
sooner rather than later.
The circular says plans for the remaining group rest on a number of key
assumptions:
There will be a general economic recovery throughout Europe, particularly in
the UK and Germany, and trading performance would improve in line with
improved conditions;
The group will reduce its overheads significantly, and improve working
capital management;
The group will realise Pounds 25m from the disposal of surplus and obsolete
portions of its fleet and excess properties;
About half of the Pounds 44m placed in escrow for the containers will be
released in due course to the group.
The document further emphasises that the group has commitments to buy Pounds
160m worth of trailers in 1996, for which it will have to find finance. It
could also suffer material losses from its currency exposure, since it will
have dollar-denominated debt unmatched by significant dollar assets or
income.
One analyst estimated that the reduced trailer and rail rental business
employs about Pounds 500m of capital and should be able to make operating
profits of at least Pounds 60m. Assuming interest payments of Pounds 40m,
that would yield pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m.
Observers have also been struck by the extent of the boardroom clear-out.
Apart from Mr Rupert Hambro, who joined in 1990 and will become
non-executive chairman, and the resilient founder, Mr Robert Montague, only
two members of the board survive. Mr Andrew Chandler, 37, joined the board
last August as finance director, while Mr Kenneth Dick, 81, has been a
non-executive since 1986.
Legal reasons concerning the group's new arrangements with the banks were
cited as the case for the resignations of two non-executives - Sir Charles
Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who is also a
non-executive director of National Westminster, and Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
chairman of Commerzbank.
Tiphook will appoint a new permanent chairman and will also seek further
non-executives. Given the huge financial and trading uncertainties which the
group still faces, these may not prove easy jobs to fill.
One analyst said: 'Tiphook will have a big credibility problem for the
foreseeable future.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Xenova to seek first listing in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xenova, a pharmaceutical research company, is planning to go public in the
US rather than join the growing number of biotechnology companies listed in
London.
It is hoping to raise about Dollars 45m (Pounds 31m) from a public offering
of American Depositary Shares, valuing its enlarged equity at up to Dollars
175m, and is applying for a quotation on the Nasdaq market.
The company declined to comment on the move, citing US Securities and
Exchange Commission rules, but it has previously said that it was likely to
float first in the US.
It already has a strong base of shareholders in the US after a Dollars 30m
private placement of equity a year ago.
Xenova has filed with the SEC a registration statement covering an initial
public offering representing 3m ordinary shares at an expected price range
of Dollars 13 to Dollars 15. Of these, 1m will be offered internationally.
Following the relaxation of the London Stock Exchange's listing requirements
for research-based companies there have been a series of biotechnology
flotations in the UK.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pay-off for former Saatchi chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former US chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide,
part of the heavily indebted Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group, is to receive a
pay-off believed to be worth about Dollars 6m (Pounds 4.1m) after just one
year in the job.
Mr Bob Kennedy, who had spent a large part of his career with the company,
said last month that he was leaving to pursue other interests. He was paid
about Dollars 800,000 last year, said Saatchi. The company refused to
disclose the length of his contract, but said the compensation to be paid
was 'the minimum under the terms of his contract'. The money will not be
paid as a lump sum.
It is widely believed that Mr Kennedy had disagreements with Mr Charles
Scott, the recently-appointed chief executive of the group. Mr Scott has
been taking a firm line with the US operation because of its poor
performance.
In December Saatchi &amp; Saatchi issued a profits warning and analysts reduced
their forecasts for 1993 pre-tax profits, which had stood at some Pounds 24m
to Pounds 29m, by about Pounds 6m. Results are due next month. A
presentation to analysts by Mr Scott in the US recently suggested that the
group's average net debt now stands at between Pounds 130m and Pounds 135m.
The profits warning followed the loss of two large accounts in the US, worth
Pounds 30m in revenue for 1994, plus pessimism about client spending in the
US and Europe.
Mr Scott has been trying to shake up the group's three agency networks in
the US and attempting to introduce a media-buying operation along the lines
of Zenith, Saatchi's European media-buying arm. However, he has been meeting
resistance to the plan from some senior agency personnel.

FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: CRSG rights issue to fund acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, the property surveying and estate agency,
yesterday announced the acquisition of two London office buildings for
Pounds 21.1m to be funded by a 1-for-1 rights issue.
At the same time the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000 for
the half year to November 30 compared with losses of Pounds 260,000.
The rights issue price is 42p, against yesterday's close of 58p. It will
raise a total of Pounds 24.2m.
The acquisition is designed to reduce sharply CRSG's fixed overheads, since
the buildings will be primarily utilised by the company. It will also lock
into asset values which offer potential for appreciation.
Following the acquisition, the company will have net assets of about Pounds
30m, a net cash position, and a market capitalisation of about Pounds 54m.
CRSG was formed last May by the merger of Sinclair Goldsmith, the listed
property agency, with Conrad Ritblat. The two companies operated in
different segments of the market, and the merger aimed to provide synergies
and a stronger position in the chartered surveying market.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, is chairman and leading
shareholder, with a 9.7 per cent holding in the enlarged company.
One property, at 9, Marylebone Lane, is being purchased for Pounds 10.1m
from Pleiad, a consortium of four Swedish insurance and pension companies
and Volvo. Pleiad acquired the property on a sale and lease-back basis from
Rosehaugh for Pounds 23.5m in 1990.
CRSG will relocate most of its staff from its West End operations in
Manchester Square, with 40 per cent of the new building being leased out on
short leases to allow for further expansion.
St Michael's House is an office development due to be completed in spring
1995. CRSG is paying Barclays Pounds 11m, under an agreement whereby
Barclays will be responsible for completing the property.
It is also planned that the lease on CRSG's offices in Finsbury Circus will
be ended in March 1996.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 1.18m). Earnings per
share amounted to 7p (losses 2.03p). There is no interim dividend but the
directors expect to recommend a final of not less than 0.33p.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Viacom wins Paramount fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Viacom, the cable television group, yesterday emerged victorious in the
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) struggle for control of Paramount
Communications, owner of the US's last big independent film and television
production company.
Viacom announced that 74.6 per cent of Paramount's shareholders had accepted
its cash-and-securities offer, in preference to a bid from QVC Network, a
home shopping group.
Viacom extended its offer to March 1 to allow all Paramount shareholders to
accept the bid, while QVC conceded defeat.
The deal marks the end of a five-month battle by Mr Sumner Redstone,
chairman of Viacom, to combine Paramount's television and production
operations with his group's cable TV network.
Yesterday, Mr Redstone denied that he had paid too much for Paramount.
However, Viacom's non-voting B shares fell another Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
28, or less than half their value when Mr Redstone first bid.
Viacom faces a further battle to persuade shareholders in Blockbuster, the
video rental company, to approve the terms of a merger which would also
bring it into the Viacom/Paramount group.
If completed, the three-way merger would create an entertainment group with
annual revenues of Dollars 26bn and businesses stretching from cable
television and film production to book publishing and video rentals.
Pointing to the proposed grouping's 'diversified and formidable assets', Mr
Redstone said the three would 'create a global media powerhouse of
unparalleled proportions'. The scale of its businesses would put it on a par
with Time Warner, the entertainment giant created by one of the 1980s'
biggest takeovers.
The acquisition of Blockbuster, which has strong earnings and little debt,
is seen as an important element in creating a sound financial footing for
Viacom/Paramount. Viacom faces opposition from the company's shareholders.
Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom and of the enlarged company
formed by the Paramount takeover, conceded that Blockbuster shareholders had
'mixed reactions' to the planned merger.
Although initially favouring an agreed merger with Viacom, Paramount
chairman Mr Martin Davis was forced by the Delaware courts to put his
company up for auction to the highest bidder. As a result, Mr Davis, who had
negotiated a role as number two to Mr Redstone, faces an uncertain future.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Coal strike and interest costs mar Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First quarter results from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, appeared
disappointing, with pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 236m to Pounds 173m.
However, once one-off items and a first-time contribution from Quantum
Chemical, are excluded, there was underlying growth in pre-interest profits
of 8 per cent. The shares were unchanged at 283 1/2 p.
Lord Hanson, chairman, reiterated recent comments made at the annual
meeting, saying: 'The industrial sun is beginning to rise both in the UK and
US.' There was no increase in the quarterly dividend of 2.85p.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said signs of recovery had appeared in
building materials and other construction-related activities, such as
Cavenham Forest Industries and Hanson Lighting in the US, the aggregates
business in the US and UK, and Butterly Brick in the UK.
However, titanium dioxide prices had not improved significantly.
Imperial Tobacco gained from the UK budget being brought forward, but this
could be reversed in the second quarter when the budget used to take place.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 2.89bn, including Pounds
402m from Quantum, acquired on September 30, the last day of the financial
year. Lord Hanson said the integration of Quantum, bought for Pounds 2.9bn,
was on track.
Profits before exceptional items and interest were Pounds 163m, down from
Pounds 187m, but this was after the Pounds 67m cost of the now-settled US
coal strike. A further Pounds 13m cost will fall in the second half. Quantum
contributed Pounds 25m.
If exchange rates had been unchanged, the previous year's profits would have
been Pounds 2m higher, Mr Taylor said.
Exceptional profits totalled Pounds 68m, up from Pounds 20m, reflecting
profits on the Pounds 56m sale of the Axelson oil industry equipment
business and the Pounds 90m disposal of 11 UK subsidiaries. Profits in the
second quarter will come from the Pounds 110m sale of the office products
business and the flotation of Beazer Homes in the UK and US.
First-quarter interest costs amounted to Pounds 58m, an Pounds 87m reversal
from interest receivable of Pounds 29m. This is part of the Pounds 275m
negative swing on interest expected in 1993-94, which Hanson warned
shareholders about in December.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 3.5p to 2.5p.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Tiphook offers Montague consolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Montague, the controversial founder of Tiphook, has been offered
share options and a bonus scheme to continue working with the debt-laden UK
transport leasing group as chief executive.
The shares fell 9p to 58p yesterday after Tiphook revealed interim pre-tax
losses of Pounds 180m and warned that its survival was dependent on the
successful disposal of the group's largest asset. Tiphook, which has debts
of Pounds 1.1bn, has agreed to sell its container business to Transamerica,
the US financial services group, for a minimum of Pounds 690m.
Mr Montague, 46, was on a base salary of Pounds 816,000 as executive
chairman, but will receive only Pounds 200,000 in his new role. Partly to
compensate for this drop, he will be granted options over 2m ordinary shares
at an exercise price of 20p per share, and a further option over 500,000
shares at 65p per share.
Mr Montague will also receive an annual bonus of 1 per cent of the group's
pre-tax profits, subject to an agreed aggregate total of Pounds 250,000
during the next five years. To compensate for signing a five-year agreement
not to compete with Transamerica in containers, he will be paid Pounds
250,000 after 18 months.
Touche Ross, the group's accountants, did not audit the figures for the six
months to October 31, which it said had been prepared on a 'going concern'
basis, which was dependent on the completion of the sale to Transamerica.
They added: 'In the event that the sale is not completed, there is
substantial uncertainty as to the availability of future financing such as
to allow the group to operate as a going concern. If such financing is not
available, the group would be forced into either administration or
receivership.'
The pre-tax loss was principally caused by exceptional costs and writeoffs
totalling Pounds 117m. The costs included Pounds 13.5m in professional and
bankers' fees. When the Transamerica deal is completed, Tiphook's financial
advisers will also receive a success fee of Pounds 11m.
In the US, Tiphook bond prices rose after the market responded favourably to
Tiphook's plan to use part of the sale proceeds to repurchase at par 40 per
cent of the Dollars 700m in US bonds issued the group.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Adjusting to the flip-side of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almighty the dollar may have threatened to be this year, but whatever its
performance against the puny European currencies it has been retreating
during the past few days against a resurgent yen.
The Japanese economy, therefore, faces a renewed threat from deflation, in
which prices on average show persistent declines. Officially Japanese
consumer prices are still crawling up by about 1 per cent a year, but this
may be deceptive, and in any case a determined attempt by the Americans to
force the yen higher in order to attack the Japanese trade surplus would
have negative implications for prices.
In Europe we may also have cause to watch out for a period of deflation in
France. Inflation there is dipping below 2 per cent and broad money,
normally regarded as providing an early warning signal, is running about 4
per cent less than a year ago. Prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur has had to
cope with angry demonstrations from fishermen over seafood deflation, and
the problem could spread inland.
In the UK the government has at times proclaimed the virtues of zero
inflation (although its central target is for a positive inflation rate of
about 2 1/2 per cent). To achieve a long-run zero-inflation objective in a
fluctuating world you would have to accept periods of falling prices to
offset rises at other times. This was the pattern in the 19th century and in
the 1920s and 1930s, when long-run stability was ensured by the gold
standard.
Most of the leading bond markets have backed away in the past few weeks from
the possibility of deflation. Japanese bond yields have jumped more than
half a percentage point since the beginning of the year in the face of the
economic stimulus package. However, even in the more buoyant economies, such
as those of the US and UK, the producer price indices published in the past
few days have shown that inflation is very subdued. For investors (and
company executives) these are unfamiliar conditions and conventional wisdom
may not represent commonsense any more.
We have seen the share prices of British supermarket chains tumbling by 30
per cent over the past year, for instance, against a buoyant stock market
trend. Food price inflation used to pump liquidity into supermarket balance
sheets, because customers paid at the checkouts weeks before the suppliers'
invoices were settled, and premises were not depreciated because, well,
property prices could only go up. But times have changed.
In the absence of a coherent system of current cost accounting, British
companies have tended to apply rapid depreciation rates and high rate of
return targets on new investment to counter the tendency for inflation to
lead to low real rates of return. But with inflation so low, this may mean
that attractive opportunities are being spurned.
In Japan the pressures are even more extreme. As Kleinwort Benson's Tokyo
unit points out in its current strategy quarterly, deflation implies that
Japanese companies are overdepreciating their plants. Their factories will
cost less to replace in future and so their profits are being understated
against a current cost yardstick. Given that depreciation is in present
depressed circumstances much greater than residual net profits in Japan this
is an important point.
However, another question to be asked in the context of a rising yen is
whether it will ever be economically worthwhile to replace many of the
factories in Japan.
A further cut in Japanese short-term interest rates, at present just over 2
per cent, would be a logical response to a renewed upsurge in the yen. The
idea would be to discourage saving and encourage spending.
The curse of deflation, however, is that the real interest rate may remain
quite high even though the nominal interest rate is little more than zero.
Long wave theorists postulate that Japan is directly in the path of the kind
of depression that plagued the US and Europe 60 years ago. In the UK, for
instance, the cost of living was falling at about 5 per cent a year in the
early 1930s so if you had money to spend it made sense to wait until prices
came down.
Japanese consumers of American goods may feel that there is no hurry to buy.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Threefold rise for BA as main markets pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday reported a threefold increase in third-quarter
profits on the back of a recovery in first and business class traffic, and a
continuing cost-cutting drive.
Pre-tax profits for the three months to December 31 rose to Pounds 65m from
Pounds 20m. For the first nine months pre-tax profits increased 21.5 per
cent to Pounds 300m.
Although the latest figures confirm BA's position as one of the world's most
profitable international carriers, BA shares dipped 1p to close at 473p
because third-quarter earnings were at the lower end of City expectations.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said the results reflected economic
improvement in the airline's two biggest markets, the UK and the US, and a
recovery in premium traffic. The outlook remained encouraging, with economic
recovery in several main markets enabling the airline to maintain traffic
growth consistent with increases in capacity.
After making cost savings of about Pounds 450m in the past two years, the
airline was on target to cut another Pounds 150m this year, Sir Colin said.
However, excess capacity in the industry continued to put pressure on
scheduled passenger yields. These increased by 1.3 per cent in the third
quarter because of favourable currency fluctuations. In local currency
terms, the yield would have declined by 2 per cent. BA said this still
reflected an improvement after a 6 per cent decline in the first quarter and
a 4 per cent decline in the second quarter.
The airline also dismissed fears over its Air Miles frequent flyer
programme. The programme continued 'to generate valuable incremental revenue
with redemptions utilising seats which would otherwise be empty', Sir Colin
said. The outstanding Air Miles issued since the programme was launched five
years ago accounted for 10 per cent of one year's surplus capacity.
However, BA confirmed it was in negotiations over the future direction of
the Air Miles company with the other shareholder, Mills Cowdrey Management.
BA, which owns 51 per cent of Air Miles, is understood to be discussing
increasing its share or taking full control.
Third-quarter turnover rose 11.9 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn with 8.6 per cent
more passengers and 15.6 per cent more cargo carried. For the first nine
months, turnover rose 13.4 per cent to Pounds 4.83bn. Third-quarter
operating profit rose 38.6 per cent to Pounds 97m and 31.6 per cent to
Pounds 441m for the nine months. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 6.1
per cent to 5.2p in the quarter and by 0.8 per cent to 25.6p in the nine
months.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Britain may develop ballistic missile defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain took the first step towards developing a ballistic missile defence
system by launching a two-year study for the defence industry yesterday.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the proliferation of ballistic
missiles in the post-cold war world might emerge as a 'significant threat to
deployed forces'.
While only missiles based in the former Soviet Union are currently capable
of reaching the UK, Mr Rifkind pointed out that the technology to produce
them was not confined to Britain's traditional enemies.
In response, the government had set aside money from the annual Pounds 22bn
defence budget for a national programme of studies to assess technical
options, costs, and the performance of systems likely to be available.
It will decide whether the UK needs a ballistic missile defence capability
on the basis of the study, which will be worth about Pounds 3m to the
successful bidder. Any contract for developing and manufacturing such a
weapons systems, however, is likely to run into billions of pounds.
Competitors for the early study, which include British Aerospace and
GEC-Marconi, welcomed one of the first signs that the government might add
to its defence capabilities since the 1990 Options For Change reforms.
But BAe, which said it would be competing for the study with a team of other
companies - not necessarily all British - immediately raised doubts over the
affordability of the ballistic missile defence programme at a time when the
Ministry of Defence was making cuts.
The manufacturers are well aware that an off-the-shelf ballistic missile
defence system already exists in the form of the US Patriot - and that the
government might decide to buy that if the early studies persuade it to
acquire such a defence capability.
Mr Brian Lowe, of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, welcomed the fact
that the government was trying to keep pace with technological advances.
The Labour party said the launch of the review was long overdue, as the
government had scrapped the surface-to-air Bloodhound missile four years ago
and not replaced it.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Bank seeks control over share settlement system: Crest would
be offered to market participants later
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England proposed yesterday that it should own and control the
Crest system for UK share settlement for its first few years of operation.
Shares in the system, which is estimated to cost Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m,
would then be offered to any market participant who used it, subject to
certain restrictions. It would be operated by a commercial provider selected
by the shareholders.
In a discussion document, the Bank appeared to rule out any controlling
interest in Crest by the Stock Exchange or any other organisation. However,
the exchange, which developed the failed Taurus system for paperless
settlements, could bid to become the operator or hold up to a 30 per cent
stake in Crest through its marketmaking members. 'Provisions will be needed
to prevent undue concentration of power through transfer of shares and
voting rights,' the Bank said.
'The wide ownership base is to insure against Crest's pricing policy,
operating regime or development plans giving undue advantage to any one
commercial interest or to any one community.'
Under the proposal, no one company or company group will be allowed to own
more than 10 per cent of the shares of Crestco - the system's holding
company - and not more than 30 per cent of shares can be held by any
sectoral group. Shares will be transferable, subject to the ownership
limits.
Finance for Crestco will be needed from May and there will have to be
arrangements for possibly adding further capital. It may be possible to
arrange borrowing facilities, the Bank said.
The paper said the Bank preferred to build the central part of the system
itself. It would use its existing computer agency staff suppliers with no
explicit promise of future work on the system.
The Bank added that the Crest project would be able to satisfy the request
of institutional fund managers that it should be able to designate share
registration in the names of individual clients. Pension funds view
designation as critical to the safety of their assets.
However, it said there would be difficulties in satisfying the demands of
marketmakers to keep their ownership of blocks of shares out of the public
domain. Legislation making that possible cannot be achieved in time,
although there are administrative measures that will go some way towards
satisfying their requests.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Worries over Yeltsin's health as keynote speech is put off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The health and ability to govern of Russian president Boris Yeltsin have
emerged again as an issue of serious concern in Moscow. He has postponed his
'state of the nation' address due on Friday because of what officials
yesterday described as a continuing 'bad cold'.
Mr Anatoly Krasikov, a press spokesmen, said it was obvious Mr Yeltsin was
unwell and this 'could be seen on TV' during a press conference with Mr John
Major, visiting British prime minister, in the Kremlin yesterday. Mr
Yeltsin, who made no opening speech, which he normally does, stood for about
20 minutes without support, but walked hesitantly and looked tired.
It was the president's first public appearance for two weeks, and the first
time he had answered journalists' questions since before Christmas.
The postponement of what has been billed as a crucial speech that will
define the Russian government's policy guidelines is the latest in a list of
incidents which are causing concern to foreign diplomats in Moscow and to
Russian observers.
Among recent examples of Mr Yeltsin's non-availability were:
A telephone call from President Bill Clinton to Mr Yeltsin could not be
received for three days for what were called 'technical reasons'. The
Russian authorities insisted Mr Yeltsin had waited for the call 'as long as
decency allowed', but that it had not come through.
Mr James Collins, a US special ambassador to the former Soviet states,
attempted to talk to Mr Yeltsin and other senior Russian officials on the
Bosnian question last week. However, a Moscow newspaper report said Mr
Collins only met low-ranking diplomats.
Dr Gert Haller, state secretary at the German finance ministry and the
country's 'sherpa' who prepares the ground for meetings of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations, was also refused a meeting with Mr Yeltsin
recently, after having been told several times that he would see the Russian
president.
Diplomats from several countries say attempts to pass high-level messages to
Mr Yeltsin from their heads of state or governments are often met with the
response that he is unavailable.
The Russian Information Agency, quoting presidential sources, said last
night the state of the nation address had been postponed until February 24.
RIA's sources gave the formal reason for the delay not as illness but the
'lack of preparedness of the Marble Hall in the Kremlin'.
Philip Stephens in Moscow adds: Mr Major said last night it was clear Mr
Yeltsin was suffering from a bad chest cold. But the prime minister said he
was not aware his host was suffering from any more serious ailment.

Viacom would hardly have paid such an absurd price for Paramount if it had
been forced to pay the entire sum in cash. As it is, investors' willingness
to accept non-voting B shares as part of the deal could see its grand epic
turn into a horror movie. The terms are all the more dilutive in that B
shares may need to be issued like confetti to compensate investors for
Viacom's falling share price. That could upset the separate merger with
Blockbuster Entertainment, which is an integral part of the overall
strategy. The enlarged Viacom will have debts of Dollars 10bn, which should
be easily serviced out of cash flow of around Dollars 2bn. But Blockbuster
brings a disproportionate share of the cash flow and only Dollars 500m of
the debt.

<TEXT>
The partial flotation of Pilkington's Australian business will help the
company's belated drive to reduce debt. Yet Pilkington may still struggle to
reach its target of reducing gearing to 50 per cent by 1995, despite cutting
capital expenditure and squeezing working capital hard. That suggests
further disposals or partial flotations may follow.
Pilkington has encouraged Nippon Sheet Glass to take minority stakes in
various operations. But the group clearly believes it can raise more from a
flotation than a trade sale of a minority stake. Australian investors have
certainly been taking a similarly benign view about the building materials
sector's recovery prospects as their UK counterparts. Pilkington will
doubtless appreciate such long-term thinking.

<TEXT>
BA's 39 per cent increase in third quarter operating profits on turnover
just 12 per cent higher demonstrates the magical effect of operational
gearing in the airline world. But considering BA's shares have outperformed
the market by 43 per cent over the past year, investors clearly expect
nothing less. Rather less impressive is the progress further down the profit
and loss account, where BA's earnings rose by just 6 per cent largely as a
result of its dilutive rights issue. BA's long-term strategic investments
are being bought at a short-term cost.
Qantas's seasonal strength resulted in a positive contribution from BA's
collected trade investments. TAT still appears to be suffering dreadfully in
the French market although Deutsche BA is cutting its losses. Still, such
concerns will pale if the strong growth in BA's premium traffic continues.
This resurgence has helped dispel the worst fears that high-spending
passengers would not return after recession. But BA's rather disappointing
yield figures suggest such traffic still has to be bought with discounts.
Although BA's shares appear temporarily to have flown ahead of reality, they
must have further to travel as recovery strengthens in the UK and US. The
longer term issue is what rating BA should attract as it approaches its next
earnings peak. Its current premium rating should then subside to a discount
given the inherent volatility of its earnings stream.

FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is starting to look as though last week's UK rate cut may have been
justified after all. Today's retail price figures will give a better
indication. But yesterday's disappointing data on industrial production and
the Confederation of British Industry's lukewarm retail trends survey
suggest the economy might not be in quite such a strong position to
withstand April's tax increases. Yesterday's 30 point gain shows the equity
market is certainly fired up by the prospect of more base rate cuts. Gilts
might be too, if they were not still fretting about how the forthcoming
auction will be received amid turbulence on international bond markets.
It does not help gilts that sterling is weakening further in the backwash of
the dollar's fall against the yen, and on fears that German rate cuts may be
further delayed. That will deter foreign investors, which may explain why
the Bank of England yesterday set the amount of the auction at only Pounds
2.5bn and the maturity at the lower end of its proposed range.
Equities, of course, are helped by a falling exchange rate. The paradox is
that at this stage they should be registering some disappointment at the
thought that the recovery may be weaker than expected, while gilts should
benefit from conditions which encourage rate cuts. If the economic data
continues to point in this direction, gilts' current weakness could turn out
a buying opportunity, however the auction goes.

FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: SIB's regulated progress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board discussion paper on equity trading is
full of good questions. It would be nice if some of the answers were found
in reasonably short order. Several of the issues which the document raises
have been causing concern for years - including the familiar problem of
controlling the derivatives markets. On several of the detailed points,
action could be forthcoming. Markets could, for instance, be made more
transparent by reporting information faster and allowing investors to use
the professional broking market. But institutions who press for such changes
risk removing the incentive for anyone to act as market makers. Greater
transparency may thus reduce liquidity. The easiest changes may be the least
necessary.
More serious is the widely perceived failure of the criminal law, civil
action or the Financial Services Act to rein in crooks, incompetents and
market manipulators. At the risk of being churlish, the fact that the SIB is
consulting about these issues only throws into stark relief how slow
progress has been thus far.
Given that investors have had to wait for the current review of equity
trading, it is surprising that its tone is so leisurely. The debate also
seems to accept that the current regulatory framework is more than adequate
to deal with any problems. That view is questionable.
The government may well be reluctant to introduce new legislation to reform
financial services regulation. But it does not follow that there is no need
for fundamental change. The SIB devalues its arguments if it appears to hide
from the more difficult problems it faces.

FT  16 FEB 94 / A sorry spectacle in Tokyo: Robert Thomson and William
Dawkins examine the effects on companies and consumers of the yen's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacle makers of Sabae, in western Japan, have their own index for
foreign exchange fluctuations. At Y110 to the dollar, they are competitive
in medium-quality frames, while at Y105 they must retreat to the top end of
the market, and at Y100 they are making spectacles at a loss.
Sabae's scale applies to many Japanese manufacturers, which are reeling from
the yen's rise on the foreign exchange markets over the past two trading
days.
The yen stood at a just about acceptable Y108.30 to the dollar as Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flew to Washington for a summit with President
Bill Clinton on Friday. Their failure to agree on a trade accord sent the
yen shooting up to Y101.9 at one point in Tokyo yesterday, to close at
Y102.02 to the dollar, pushing Sabae's spectacle makers close to making a
loss.
The hard evidence that the US wants to push the yen higher is thin.
President Clinton did refer to 'the exchange rate factor' twice at his press
conference with Mr Hosokawa. But on both occasions he cited it only as one
of the 'objective criteria' that the US was seeking to judge progress in
opening Japanese markets over a period of years.
However, the apparently non-judgmental reference to the currency was
otherwise construed by the foreign exchange traders late on Friday and again
by the broader markets on Monday. This prompted the Treasury on Monday to
issue a statement timed for the opening of the Tokyo markets yesterday that
'we do not believe in artificially manipulating exchange rates'.
Nowhere in the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released
on Monday, is there a single word on the desired value of the yen. Indeed US
officials point out that a higher yen will tend further to deflate the
Japanese economy, whereas the general thrust of US policy is to encourage
Japan to cut taxes and thus stimulate growth. If anything, they say,
currently weak Japanese economic fundamentals ought to push the currency
lower.
On the other side of the equation, the US accepts that the yen's strength
has aided US car and semiconductor makers, which are gaining world market
share at the expense of Japanese competitors. The Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association says Japan will lose its position as the world's
largest car producer to the US this year, for the first time since 1979.
Yen appreciation is still the big worry in Japanese boardrooms, from Sabae's
small companies to Tokyo's multinationals. Nomura Research Institute
estimates that the Y10 rise in the currency's rate against the dollar since
early January has wiped 6 per cent off companies' average operating profits.
If the yen stays this high, it could destroy corporate Japan's chance of
pulling out of a four-year profits decline in 1994, warns the institute.
Japanese consumers are, of course, helped by the yen's increase - but only
in the short term. A stronger yen has meant some cheaper imported goods.
This, plus the slowdown in economic activity, will help wholesale prices
fall by 1 per cent in the year to the end of March, forecasts indicate. This
does not always show up in retail prices, because the complex distribution
system, with layer-upon-layer of wholesalers and distributors, soaks up most
of the benefits. Even so, Tokyo shops this winter are full of discount
sales.
Over the long term, the yen's strength is encouraging two trends: the shift
of production outside Japan, which has increased fears about rising
unemployment and hence depressed consumer spending; and the weakening of
traditionally close links between retailers and manufacturers.
Investment in China is gathering pace among manufacturers looking for
cheaper east Asian production sites. China is increasingly the preferred
investment site for Japanese manufacturers, as it offers an expanding home
market and a relatively cheap base for exports, according to the
Export-Import Bank of Japan. Japanese direct investment overseas will fall
by 6.4 per cent in the year from April, but investment in east Asia has been
'spurred by the abrupt appreciation' of the yen, says the bank.
A strong yen is one extra, unwanted cost for Japanese manufacturers, already
attempting to cope with a long-term decline in their profitability. Falling
sales at home have put pressure on companies to find new ways of hiding
excess employees in affiliates.
But the common response to the profits decline, investing abroad, means that
capital spending flows to, say, the northern Chinese city of Dalian, instead
of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. New factories established in
Hokkaido fell from 277 in 1989 to 170 in 1992, and only 48 were commissioned
in the first half of last year.
In northern China, the statistics are more impressive. Mr Suehiro Ohba,
general manager of a Japanese-run industrial park in Dalian, presided over
the signing of four contracts in a week late last year. 'The labour here is
cheap. As long as you have control over the venture, there is not much
difference in the production quality between Dalian and Japan, but there is
a big difference in the cost.'
The Japan Research Institute - Sumitomo Bank's research unit - estimates
that over the next five years the transfer of production from Japan will
cost 1.1m jobs. Most markets observers expect the yen's strength to ensure
double-digit growth in Japan's foreign investment for the next few years.
For example, Japan's imports of audio-visual electronics were 37 per cent
higher in November, compared with the same month in 1992, with most of this
equipment carrying a Japanese brand-mark from the makers' east Asian
factories. Japan became a net importer of televisions last year, for the
first time since the second world war.
Offshore production of consumer electronics in Asia has not necessarily
meant cheaper prices in Japan: the Fair Trade Commission, an anti-monopoly
body, has warned makers against forming industry agreements, common until
last year, to restrict discounts and cushion margins.
However, the second main long-term effect of the higher yen - the impact on
retailing - has resulted in some clearer benefits for consumers. It has
spurred the development of stores operating outside the usual distribution
system, which are able to pass on the savings created both by their own
lower costs and by the yen's effect on imports.
In the consumer electronics industry, manufacturers rely on the loyalty of
small retailers tied to their own group, through Japan's networks of
cross-shareholdings and exclusive dealerships. But these mainly small corner
stores are under pressure from independent retailers willing to cut prices
to attract business.
A similar trend is emerging in the food and clothing industries. Mr Takashi
Shirayama, of Shirayama Corporation, an Osaka-based investment company, has
plans for at least five retail outlets, the first likely to open in March,
which he said could undercut supermarkets by 20-30 per cent. 'If you have
five stores, you have more import buying power,' Mr Shirayama said.
It is harder, however, to get around the reluctance of power utilities to
pass on the savings from the fall in the cost of energy, most of which is
imported. The utilities still calculate energy costs at rates similar to
those set in 1989, when the yen was Y124 to the dollar, the currency in
which oil is priced. Tokyo Electric Power and the other regional utilities
reduced rates in November after complaints from consumers and pressure from
the government, but the average Tokyo household is still saving only Y111 on
a Y7,010 monthly electricity bill.
The result has been increasing numbers of Japanese worried that there are so
few gains from a high yen. Their disappointment with derisory cuts in
electricity bills may have been been offset by the attraction of cheaper
holidays abroad: record crowds at Narita airport over the new year holiday
were no doubt delighted with the chance of a cheap sunshine break. But on
balance, the yen's rise is a further constraint on the recovery of an
economy already in the grip of deflation.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Obstacles to Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be tempting for world leaders, and especially President Bill
Clinton, to believe that a peace settlement in the Middle East is only a
matter of time.
The portents have been undeniably positive. The Madrid conference in October
1991 brought all the warring parties to the negotiating table on the
internationally agreed basis of UN security council resolutions 242 and 338,
which call for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in return
for a full peace. Then, just over five months ago, Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation went a step further by signing a declaration of
principles, designed to chart a course towards some form of Palestinian
self-determination.
The handshake between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, on the lawn of the White House symbolised a
widespread assumption that, whatever the subsequent setbacks, the two sides
had accepted that there was no alternative to a negotiated settlement.
The assumption may still be valid, but it would be dangerous for western
leaders to become too persuaded by symbolism when, on the ground in the
Middle East, virtually nothing has changed in the past 2 1/2 years. The
Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has not been
eased, Jewish settlements continue to expand, violent clashes continue, and
popular support for the peace process is being relentlessly eroded on both
sides of the divide.
No 'sacred dates'
According to the agreement signed in Washington, Israel was supposed to have
begun withdrawing its forces from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho on
December 13. Not only has it felt unable to do so, but Mr Rabin has chosen
to state, repeatedly, that for him there are no 'sacred dates' for
implementing the timetable set out in the Washington accord. He would prefer
a belated implementation to an accord in which there was still room for
differing interpretations, especially on any issues relating to security.
Mr Arafat, for his part, has been anxious to acquire whatever symbols he
can, however minor, to demonstrate to his critics that he remains pledged to
the goal of an independent Palestinian state. While progress has been made,
the fundamentally different objectives of the two negotiating teams, and the
deliberate ambiguities of the Washington agreement, have led to
time-consuming haggling over the smallest details, such as whether the
Palestinian flag at border crossing points should be fixed to a wall or
flown from a pole. As both sides would acknowledge, the possibilities for
further prevarication are almost endless. And with perceived prevarication
comes the suspicion that one side or the other is less fully committed to
the peace process than had been assumed.
Lost momentum
Those suspicions, particularly strongly felt in the occupied territories,
need to be urgently checked if lost momentum is to be restored. Israel,
while justifiably concerned about its security, is negotiating from a
position of considerable strength. Mr Rabin, whether he intends it or not,
is increasingly seen by Palestinian leaders as less enthusiastic about the
Washington agreement than Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, who
negotiated it.
While Mr Rabin may fairly argue that it is not his role to sustain the
leader of the PLO, he must also recognise that Mr Arafat was probably the
only Palestinian who could have made the Washington agreement and, whatever
his shortcomings, the only one who is politically capable of overseeing its
implementation. Israeli leaders have only to listen to the mounting chorus
of criticism faced by Mr Arafat from within the Palestinian community to
appreciate how much more difficult it would be to negotiate a settlement
with any likely combination of successors.
President Clinton and European leaders, having welcomed Mr Arafat to their
capitals after shunning him for so long, should not repeat the mistake. Like
him or loathe him, Mr Arafat is the only Palestinian leader who might
currently be able to deliver the sort of Middle East peace they desire. A
strong word in Mr Rabin's ear would not go amiss.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Flank left to fester: The west's policy on southern
ex-Soviet Union republics needs rethinking, argue Gillian Tett and Steve
LeVine

President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan had reason to feel pleased
after his meeting this week with US President Bill Clinton.
In exchange for indicating a willingness to dismantle Kazakhstan's nuclear
weapons, Mr Nazarbayev won not only a pledge of US aid worth Dollars 396m,
but praise from US officials for his efforts to introduce market reforms and
attract western investment.
Low down the meeting's agenda, however, was Kazakhstan's less than
impressive attempts at reforming its political system, which remains
dominated by an all-powerful president.
Though such diplomatic reticence may seem unremarkable, it highlights a
discrepancy emerging in western policy towards the former Soviet Union.
Western leaders have responded in recent months to signs that Russia or the
Baltic states might be moving towards fascism. But they have largely ignored
the political dictatorships that remain entrenched along Russia's sensitive
southern flank.
As European institutions such as Nato expand eastwards, this omission is
sending dangerous signals to the swathe of countries between Turkey and
Estonia, on Europe's outer fringe.
The chief victim of this policy so far has been the Conference for Security
and Co-operation in Europe - Europe's 52-nation quasi United Nations,
founded in 1972 to promote political democracy and collective security
between western democracies and the eastern bloc.
Two years ago, the CSCE became one of the first European institutions to
welcome ex-Soviet republics into its ranks. Since then, however, most of the
central Asian and Caucasian republics have acted against CSCE principles on
human rights.
In Tajikistan, for example, which for the past 18 months has witnessed civil
war between regional Tajik groups, ethnic cleansing and political detention
have been widespread. In Transcaucasia, nationalist conflicts have produced
other abuses: most recently, in October, Armenian forces expelled about
60,000 civilians from south-western Azerbaijan.
Supposedly free elections in Turkmenistan last month saw Mr Sapurmurat
Niyazov elected as president until 2004 with 99.99 per cent of the vote. The
regime in Uzbekistan remains similarly authoritarian. The only republic with
proper opposition political parties is tiny Kyrgyzstan, on the Chinese
border.
'Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are unique in actually moving backwards to
Soviet-style politics,' says one western diplomat in Uzbekistan. 'No one
expects them to become western-style democracies overnight - but when they
move backwards there can be little chance of meeting CSCE standards.'
In public, at least, CSCE officials deny that the issue is undermining the
institution's credibility, and say efforts are being made to explain to the
central Asian states their new European CSCE commitments. 'You have to look
at this in an evolutionary perspective,' says Mr Nils Eliasson, CSCE
director, who points out that, throughout the CSCE's history, there has been
a steady improvement in the human rights record of formerly authoritarian
members, such as Romania.
But the CSCE's problem is that it lacks diplomatic muscle: it has no clear
mechanism for expelling members. Most central Asian governments have
shrugged off its protests, retorting that the west is ignoring their
regional problems.
Some US officials have raised human rights concerns. But there is little
co-ordinated western pressure. One reason may be western concern that
political instability could unleash the region's radical Islamic opposition
groups - a fear propounded in particular by Russian diplomats. Another is
cultural, with many diplomats privately admitting it is unrealistic to
expect the same democratic standards from the 60m Moslem central Asians as
from the Russians or Balts.
The priority for central Asia now, these diplomats argue, is to avoid
economic collapse. So far Dollars 10bn worth of foreign investment has been
pledged to the region, according to East European Investment magazine. As
that increases, western businesses are likely to have a corresponding
interest in maintaining stability. Kazakhstan is believed to have as much
oil as Russia, Turkmenistan is the world's fourth-largest gas producer, and
Uzbekistan has rich gold reserves.
But the problem with this approach, as many CSCE officials agree in private,
is that it makes a mockery of the CSCE. 'It is double standards - one
standard of human rights for the Slavic states and the Baltics and another
for central Asians,' says one senior diplomat closely involved with the
CSCE.
Since few people outside the diplomatic circuit have heard of the CSCE, this
in itself might not seem significant. But recent suggestions that the
Russian peacekeeping forces currently operating in the former Soviet Union
could operate under the CSCE's mandate seem likely to throw the institution
 -and such contradictions - into the spotlight.
If this happens, the CSCE will have to rethink its role and mandate. In the
meantime, though, the west needs to clarify its own policy towards the
region, if other European institutions looking eastwards are to avoid the
CSCE's dilemma.

<TEXT>
Viacom's Sumner Redstone marked his victory in the Dollars 10bn battle for
Paramount Communications by declaring that the combined group would become a
'global media powerhouse of unparalleled proportions'. Are these the
extravagant remarks of an empire builder who has overpaid? The visions of a
far-sighted entrepreneur? Or the unhealthy ambitions of a would-be
monopolist? The answer is probably a bit of all three.
It is not hard to make the case that Viacom has overpaid. The Dollars 10bn
price tag was only achieved after a fierce auction which pitted Mr Redstone
against QVC's equally determined Barry Diller. Paramount's financial
performance has been lacklustre. There is also Wall Street's verdict:
Viacom's shares have tumbled since the battle began in September.
The glamour of owning a Hollywood studio is certainly part of the story. But
this is not a classic case of managerial capitalism run wild. Mr Redstone is
Viacom's majority shareholder, so it is largely his own fortune at risk.
That also gives him the incentive to apply his undoubted drive to make the
takeover pay.
Enthusiasts say the potential synergies are huge. Paramount's principal
expertise is in film production. Viacom's is the ability to package and
market entertainment globally. Add to these Blockbuster, the video retailer
which is subject to a related Dollars 8.4bn merger with Viacom, and you have
a killer combination.
Joining forces
The key is to maximise the value of each 'software property' by distributing
it in as many different formats, channels and markets as possible. Brands
such as Paramount's Star Trek or Viacom's Beavis and Butthead can be
exploited in cinemas, videos, TV programmes, video games, theme parks and
upcoming multi-media formats. When packaged with other brands as cable TV
channels, they can be sold from Budapest to Bombay.
Paramount and Viacom are already doing some of these things. But, say
enthusiasts, they will be able to get a much bigger bang for their buck by
joining forces. Booz Allen, a management consultancy group hired by
Paramount, estimates earnings could rise by Dollars 280m a year.
The tale is seductive. It clearly makes sense to sell the same product in as
many different ways as possible. But why is vertical integration necessary
to achieve this? Wouldn't Viacom do better to pick the best software from a
range of producers? Wouldn't Paramount benefit from choosing the best
distributor for each market?
Integrated group
There are two answers. One is that the full benefits of marketing through
multiple channels cannot be achieved by arm's-length relationships. To
maximise their returns from a particular property, companies must be able to
control the timing of its release in each format and co-ordinate the
marketing through different channels. This is only possible with an
integrated group.
Set against this is the fact that large integrated organisations have their
own bureaucratic problems. Putting two businesses together within the same
organisation does not guarantee successful co-operation. One only has to
look at another mega-media merger, Time Warner, to see that much talked-of
synergies often come to little. It remains to be seen whether
Viacom-Paramount-Blockbuster will be more dynamic.
The second explanation for integration is that entertainment companies do
not have the luxury to buy products or distribution channels on the open
market. Hollywood has long been an oligopoly. This is because the large
studios control access to cinemas. As a result, the many independent
producers have little option but to deal with the big players. Now, the
theory goes, this oligopolistic structure is migrating to other media. In
addition to Viacom and Time Warner, there are Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation and Japan's Sony and Matsushita, which all own Hollywood
studios. Commercial power comes from being within such integrated
structures.
While such an oligopoly would be cause for concern, it may never emerge. New
technologies are altering the economics of entertainment all along the value
chain from production to distribution. Mr Redstone's empire may not last as
long as he would like.

The boardroom row at Middlesex's Northwood Golf Club reminds Observer of the
old tale of the husband whose wife was always beating him at golf.
Having lost his ball in the rough, he trips over a lamp. A genie dutifully
appears and offers our hero three wishes - the only condition is that the
wife must get double.
The golfer's first wish is to be the best player in the club. 'Fine,' says
the genie, 'but you realise this means that your wife will be twice as
good?' 'No problem,' says the golfer. 'My wife is in the ladies section, and
that doesn't count.'
His second wish is to be a millionaire. Once again the genie mentions the
condition. The golfer explains that he loves his wife dearly so her extra
wealth would be no obstacle.
'And your final wish?' asks the genie. 'A mild heart attack,' replies the
golfer.

Ruth Dudley Edwards' conclusion, in her history of The Economist, that
'nobody ever got the last word in a debate with Andrew Knight', is spot on.
The executive chairman of News International had been asked, along with
several other former editors of The Economist, to sign the frontispiece of a
first edition of Edwards' history, one of several books, including an uncut
first edition of Pope's Rape of the Lock from Mary Moore, which have been
donated to a fund-raiser for St Anne's College, Oxford. Jeffrey Archer bangs
the gavel at Middle Temple Hall on February 23.
But whereas Sir Alastair Burnet, Rupert Pennant-Rea and Bill Emmott just
signed their names, the self-made millionaire has glued copies of both his
reviews of Edwards' book inside the front cover.

</HEADLINE>

If John Major has difficulty finding out what is really going on in Russia,
it's not for the want of specialist advice. His comparatively small press
and private offices are now bulging with Russian hands, exiled from the
Foreign Office.
Observer has already commented on Chris Meyer, the PM's new press secretary,
who has shown his true colours by adorning his office with framed copies of
Pravda, the once all-powerful organ of the Soviet Communist party. Meyer was
in Moscow in the late 1960s. Major's private secretary for foreign affairs,
Roderic Lyne, headed the FO's Soviet department for four years until he
moved to No 10 and he has just taken delivery of a deputy, Philippa
Leslie-Jones, who has hardly had time to shake Moscow's snow off her boots.
Another sign, perhaps, that the Thatcherite cold war between the FCO and
Number 10 is finally over?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Davis may have won the battle to merge the company he chairs,
Paramount Communications, with his chosen partner, Viacom. But it could
prove a mixed personal victory.
Last summer, when a friendly deal was first announced, Davis, 66, was lined
up to become number two to Viacom boss Sumner Redstone. The Delaware courts
quickly put a stop to that cosy deal, though, forcing Davis to auction the
company he has led for more than a decade to the highest bidder.
What can Davis expect now? 'We really haven't crossed that bridge yet,' says
Frank Biondi, Viacom's number two, chief executive-designate of the merged
group.
Viacom's boardroom is looking increasingly crowded. Redstone has promised to
make Wayne Huinzego, head of Blockbuster, a vice-chairman, provided
shareholders of the video rental group can be persuaded to back a merger.
Then there's Nynex, which maybe deserves a seat at the top table after
putting more than Dollars 1bn behind Redstone's bid.
It will be ironic if Davis walks away as empty-handed as Barry Diller, the
former Paramount executive with whom he fell out in 1984, and the man behind
the rival QVC bid for Paramount.
The last word yesterday, though, went to Diller's QVC. Having just lost one
of the US's biggest takeover battles, it issued a statement that should
serve as a model of brevity for companies everywhere: 'We lost. They won.
Next.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Modesty could mean success: Kevin Brown assesses the triple
election trial facing the UK government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midterm by-elections are always difficult, even for governments not mired in
real or imagined scandal. But the Eastleigh poll, following the death of
Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan, matters more than most for UK prime
minister Mr John Major: it will be accompanied - probably on May 5 - by
elections for two Labour-held Commons seats and thousands of local
government seats and, in June, for 84
Taken together, the various elections amount to a three-part referendum on
the government's standing - the biggest electoral test for the Conservatives
since Mr Major pulled off an unexpected victory in the 1992 general
election.
Officially, only the parliamentary elections will be fought on national
issues. A variety of local issues is already emerging in the council
elections, and the Maastricht treaty will be central to the European
campaign.
But the results will be analysed with a single criterion in mind: can the
Conservatives recover enough ground over the next three years to win another
general election, or are they in so much trouble that only a change of
leader can save them?
It will not be a clean fight. The focus of Labour's campaign is allegations
of 'Tory sleaze' and incompetence, much of which arises from the recent
spate of disclosures about the private lives of Conservative MPs.
Senior Tories accuse Labour of running a smear campaign. Conservative
officials have already released details of seven alleged Labour smears; they
threaten to publish further details from a 'lies file' held at Central
Office.
Both main parties allege policy differences between Liberal Democrat
candidates in various parts of the country, and point to the party's
disciplinary problems in east London, where members have been accused of
racism.
While the parties agree the campaign is likely to be dirty, a fog of
disinformation is obscuring the battlefield as the campaign strategists play
down their parties' chances.
First, Eastleigh. The government is expected to try to minimise the impact
of the by-election by holding it on the same day as the local elections.
Conservative officials have little hope of holding the seat, which would
fall to the Liberal Democrats on a swing of 11.6 per cent - much less than
the swing they achieved in the Christchurch and Newbury by-elections last
year.
The Liberal Democrat leadership is playing down its chances on the grounds
that its relatively thin resources will be stretched by the local and
European campaigns. But it remains favourite to take the seat.
Paradoxically, Labour has given the government a glimmer of hope by opting
for a high-profile campaign, directed by the team that won Mid-Staffordshire
from the government in a by-election in 1990. Mr John Smith, Labour leader,
reasons that the government's problems have made Eastleigh a genuine
three-way marginal. He will campaign personally in the constituency, along
with other shadow cabinet ministers, in sharp contrast to the party's low
profile at last year's by-elections.
This strategy could go wrong if a split opposition vote allows the
Conservatives to hold the seat, or if Labour trails in third. If that
happens, Labour will console itself with inevitable victories in
by-elections at Barking and Rotherham, where it is the sitting party.
Second, the local elections. Early forecasts, based on Labour's lead in most
recent opinion polls of about 20 per cent, suggest the Tories could lose
dozens or hundreds of seats in metropolitan authority elections all over
Britain.
It may not be that simple. The Conservatives did so badly at the 1990
elections, when the seats at stake were last contested, that it would be
hard for them to do much worse. Indeed, Labour's public stance is that its
own party will do well to hold its ground.
'I am confident that our vote will go up, but we could be in the paradoxical
position of doing well but losing seats because we are fighting on the 1990
results, which were spectacularly good for us,' says Mr Jack Straw, Labour's
campaign organiser.
Labour's problem is that it already controls most big authorities where the
seats are being contested. In some, such as Hull, it holds every city
council seat. In others, such as Birmingham, it is defending a tiny majority
achieved on a flood tide of Labour votes.
One important test will be London, where Labour did relatively badly in
1990. The party is playing down expectations of gains in Westminster and
Wandsworth, the two flagship Conservative authorities tainted by allegations
of gerrymandering. Privately, party strategists expect gains in both
boroughs. There are also hopes of outright victory in outer London boroughs,
such as Croydon and Ealing, which remained loyal to the Conservatives in
1990.
However, Labour could lose seats to the Liberals in the south London
boroughs of Southwark - part of which is a Liberal stronghold - and Lambeth,
where Labour councillors face corruption allegations.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is playing down expectations
of a big breakthrough. But Liberal Democrat strategists will be disappointed
if the party fails to consolidate its successes across the south in the
county council elections last May.
Finally, Europe. Labour took 41 per cent of the vote in the last election in
1989, when it won 45 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared with 32 for
the Conservatives and one Scottish Nationalist. This time, on June 9, it
expects to pick up most of the 2m votes polled by the largely defunct Green
party in 1989.
No one will put a figure on Labour's target, but Ms Pauline Green, leader of
the party's European MPs, dismisses projections that it will win 56 to 69 of
the seats at stake. She concedes only that Labour is confident of doing
'very well', and expects to win more seats, including Herefordshire and
Shropshire, where Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Tory MEPs, is
standing.
Privately, however, party workers are less circumspect. One claimed 'there
is no such thing as a safe Conservative seat', and reported a Conservative
MEP lamenting that the party's delegation might soon fit into a Brussels
taxi.
The Liberal Democrats are playing down claims that they could win up to a
dozen seats. But officials admit that they are confident of taking three or
more seats in the south-west, and possibly one or two in the south.
If the government's worst fears in the three elections were realised, the
Conservatives could be left with less than a dozen seats in the European
parliament, severe losses in the local councils, and humiliating defeat in
Eastleigh. A bad result in one of the three polls would not necessarily
spell the end of Mr Major's premiership. Disaster in all three might.
The key, however, is what would constitute disaster. The thinking in Downing
Street is that mediocre results in the elections will seem a triumph if a
rout of Conservative candidates is expected.
For this reason, Conservative strategists are doing little to counter media
speculation of a Tory collapse. It is a strategy that infuriates Mr Straw,
who accuses the Conservatives of 'laying trails suggesting they are going to
do extremely badly'.
But a similar approach worked well in the last comparable round of local
elections in 1990, when Mr Kenneth Baker, then environment secretary,
manoeuvred Labour into targeting the Tories' London strongholds of
Westminster and Wandsworth.
Labour polled strongly across the country, but failed to extract full
benefit from its performance because it did not take the two Tory flagships.
The Conservatives are laying a similar trap this year. This time, Labour
thinks it has the government's measure.

<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK's foreign secretary, has called on the country's
ruling Conservative party to unite round a common manifesto for the European
parliament elections in June, and not to refight last year's battles over
the Maastricht treaty. He urged Conservatives to stand as 'the party of
Europe', confident that the UK government's vision of a loose, free-trading
European Union was now becoming the new orthodoxy in Europe.
Mr Hurd's anxiety is as understandable as it is acute. In the ordinary
course of events, the European parliament election campaign would be likely
to be fought as a plebiscite on the government's domestic record, not on the
future of the EU. Since the government is deeply unpopular, the elections
risk being a disaster for the Tories. But the disaster will be all the
greater if, in addition, the campaign becomes the scene for another virulent
slanging match over Europe between the two halves of the Tory party.
If Mr Hurd succeeds in papering over his party's split over Europe, he will
be lucky. Unfortunately, it is simply not true that the UK government's
vision of a loose EU is now the new orthodoxy in Europe. What is true is
that there is now no accepted orthodoxy on the future of the EU, because the
Union is in a state of profound political malaise.
The reason for this malaise is that the Union has been completely overtaken
by the speed and scale of events in the real world outside. When the
Maastricht treaty was put together, in the brief moment of ecstasy after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl thought they were concluding a grand Franco-German Euro-bargain for the
internal development of the EU, as a counterpart to German unification. They
did not foresee that their private deal might be ship-wrecked by the storms
on the world's foreign exchange markets, or by war in the Balkans.
In addition, the Union has lost credibility with the voters, and therefore
with politicians, because it has failed to exorcise recession or avert
rising structural unemployment. Once upon a time, Europe was sold on the
prospectus that economic integration would deliver growth, in spite of the
transitional pain of European economic liberalism. Today, Europe's workers
are being asked to accept that their jobs and the postwar European
socio-economic model may be thrown on the garbage heap, for the sake of a
global economic liberalism that bypasses anything decided in Brussels, or
indeed in any national capital.
As a result, the EU is now plunged into a gloom as deep as the phase of
Euro-pessimism of 10 years ago. Since that earlier pessimism then gave way
to an equally intense phase of Euro-phoria, with the Single European Act and
the collapse of communism, some may reasonably ask if the present depression
may not turn out to be just another passing phase.
It may. But there at least two reasons why it may not. The first lies in the
shortcomings of the Maastricht treaty. The plan for economic and monetary
union may not be dead, as the jeering Euro-sceptics would have us believe,
but its future is at best uncertain. The equally grand scheme for a common
foreign and security policy always looked over-ambitious; in the light of
events in former Yugoslavia, it now looks merely flatulent.
With hindsight it seems clear that the practical prescriptions contained in
the Maastricht treaty fell short of the stated objectives. If the member
states really want monetary union, they probably need to make a bigger
political commitment; if they want a common foreign policy, they obviously
have to make a much bigger political commitment. Right now the Union has a
treaty whose stated ambitions exceed its grasp; but there is no general
willingness to strengthen the treaty so as to make its aims attainable.
But the disagreement between the member states on where the EU is going, or
how to get there, is made much worse because they do not know how many
members it will have; and this is the second reason for gloom. The fall of
the Berlin Wall has released a flood of eager candidates: four members of
the European Free Trade Association are negotiating now, and there is a
platoon of other countries waiting to join. It should be obvious that a much
larger Union will be a very different Union. But the present member states
cannot resolve the problem of what such a large EU should look like, because
they are still impaled on the ideological argument between nationalists and
federalists.
This unresolved ideological argument is bound to cut across the question of
EU enlargement, and might conceivably prevent it. The European parliament,
which now has the power to ratify enlargement, said two years ago that it
would not agree to new members unless its own powers were strengthened; yet
it seems unlikely that members will renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, and
certainly not in the middle of negotiations with the Efta candidates. In the
event, parliament may hesitate to veto enlargement. But this week such a
threat came from Spain, which suggested that it might block the admission of
the rich Efta countries, without an increase in regional aid to the poorer
countries of the Mediterranean.
In other words, enlargement may yet become a negotiating pivot for the
Union's old ideological arguments. But these arguments cannot effectively be
addressed at least until France has a new president next year, and probably
not until the Maastricht review conference of 1996. The present phase of
Euro-gloom could be with us for a long time yet.

<TEXT>
Sir, In summarising the conclusions of a recent J P Morgan economic research
report on Latin American debt, the Financial Times headline said 'New debt
crisis may hit Latin America' (February 15).
In fact, the Morgan report did not suggest that a debt crisis might reoccur,
and pointed out that debt-servicing capacities of the major Latin American
economies have improved substantially since the early 1980s.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubtful benefits from tying UK
overseas aid to exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR MARTIN GRIFFITHS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A K Goldsmith (Letters, February 14) defends the use of overseas aid to
promote British exports. Three points needs to be made in the light of his
assertions.
First, the Overseas Development Administration stated in its 1993 review of
British aid that 'the aid programme's greatest priority is reducing
poverty'. When ODA minister Baroness Chalker outlined the seven goals of the
aid programme last year, promoting exports was not one of them.
Furthermore, only 10 per cent of MPs believe that promoting trade should be
a main aim of overseas aid, an Actionaid/Gallup opinion poll showed last
July. It is true that other governments tie their aid to the exports of
their own goods. Yet Britain ties 70 per cent of its bilateral aid, a higher
proportion than most donors.
Second, recent research contradicts Mr Goldsmith's claim that the aid and
trade provision (ATP) benefits the British economy. A 1992 study by experts
at the University of Bath noted that, while the ATP has created some
commercial benefits, 'this does not, however, imply that there has been a
net economic gain to the UK'. Regarding tied aid generally, the study
concluded that 'it is quite possible that the net economic effect on the UK
has been negative, or at least quite negligible'. A 1991 OECD study
concurred, noting that 'it is improbable that aid tying provides significant
macro-economic benefits to any donor's domestic employment or balance of
payments aggregates'.
Third, what taxpayers want from overseas aid is that it helps to reduce
poverty. An Actionaid/BMRB survey last July found that 73 per cent of the
public believe the government should increase aid to tackle global
environmental and development problems.
We share Mr Goldsmith's willingness to participate in a public debate on
these issues. But this should take account of the needs of the world's poor
rather than those of big business.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Still a threat of action on power
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR PETER ROST.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is refreshing to see your robust acknowledgement that privatising
electricity as a duopoly has proved a costly error ('Littlechild's power
gamble', February 14). As the energy select committee warned at the time,
the resulting uncompetitive market has stimulated an excessive and premature
'dash for gas', marginalised coal production and raised electricity prices
for large users.
However, you come down too hard on the efforts of Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to correct structural flaws. He was
handed a framework for which politicians were responsible, not he. Nor was
he given statutory powers to restructure the generators.
Consequently, his success in obtaining undertakings that 6,000MW of capacity
will be divested, is a significant arm-twisting achievement. As you suggest,
it may not be enough to develop genuine competition at the margin where it
matters. But Professor Littlechild has insisted on progress reports at six
monthly intervals on the disposal of plant and, significantly, he intends to
review the situation towards the end of the two-year transition period.
The implied threat that, if real competition has not developed by then,
further action can be expected, should not therefore be underestimated.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of narrowing output gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR GILES KEATING.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan ('The enigma of the UK output gap', February 14) writes
that 'whatever the output gap, it is narrowing smartly . . .we know this
from the combination of the unexpectedly sharp fall in unemployment and
other labour market indicators, and from business survey evidence'.
But the fall in unemployment has occurred because of a large increase in the
number of part-time jobs (up 190,000), and in the self-employed (up 79,000,
and some of these may be part-timers). The number of full-time employees has
continued to shrink (down 95,000). So the total number of hours of labour
services being used by the economy certainly hasn't risen much during the
recovery, and may well have continued to fall. (All data refer to the period
from March 1993, roughly when unemployment started to fall, up to September,
the latest available).
This is not evidence of a narrowing output gap. Instead, it is evidence that
the market is re-distributing a roughly unchanged amount of work around a
larger number of people. Labour market reforms over the past few years have
probably helped achieve this. Examples include the cut in the starting rates
of National Insurance contributions, and (during 1993) the abolition of the
minimum wage imposed by residual wages councils. On this interpretation, the
unemployment figures over-stated slack in the labour market a year ago,
because there was an inappropriate mix of full- and part-time jobs. It is
not the amount of slack that has fallen over the past year, but the the
degree of overstatement.
There is a clear message here for the government: beware of saving cash by
extending means-testing of medical and social security benefits. Means tests
act like very high marginal tax rates on low-income earners, and the more
they are imposed, the more damage is done to the reforms of the past decade
which are finally showing their worth in today's decline in unemployment.

Sir, I thought that fearing the Japanese was exclusively an American
characteristic. You surprise me with your 'Shoot-out in the DC corral'
(February 12/13) editorial.
What in effect you propose is a no-win situation. If the Americans will give
up in order to save Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's job as prime minister, they will
be accused of interfering with Japan's internal affairs. At the same time,
and for the umpteenth time, the Americans will come back unfairly empty
handed.
This is business and the Japanese will respect the Americans for it if, once
and for all, the Americans will be more focused, determined and strong.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Arts: Highest level of entertainment - Max Loppert enjoys
the Covent Garden premiere of Massenet's 'Cherubin'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In more than one sense, the score of Massenet's Cherubin is made of light
music. The tunes, the dances, the pot-pourri introductions to each of the
three acts, all state immediately their adherence to the musical category
that (for instance) Thomas Beecham used to explore with such light-fingered
elegance: dessert fare, quickly absorbed and digested, put together with a
degree of economy that guarantees its lingering effect on the palate.
But Cherubin is light in other ways as well. Light in texture: scored in dew
and gossamer (the impression that the bass-line instruments are being
allowed the night off is a constant, captivating illusion), and carried on
in rhythms whose flexibility and dramatic responsiveness are a direct
function of Massenet's word-setting gifts. And light in the radiance of
vocal sound that fills each unfolding sequence: again, this seems, but is
not, a three-act divertimento for high voices.
In all this lies, for me, the irresistible quality of Massenet's 27th opera
(1905), of which the Royal Opera has just given the belated British
premiere. It sets limits of unpretentious entertainment and then, with a
skill as effortless as it is self-concealing, surpasses them.
The notion of a Marriage of Figaro operatic pendant in which Cherubino is
the principal character (nothing to do with the third of Beaumarchais's
'Almaviva' plays, La Mere coupable: Massenet's librettists adapted Francis
de Croisset's 1901 comedy) is itself a civilised conceit. The opera's
Mozartian touches - the Count and Countess as minor characters, a wry
reference to Don Giovanni to counteract the happy-ever-after final curtain -
are deftly, not insistently made.
The purpose, rather, is to reflect in the most delicate of operatic glasses
the dizzier moments of youthful romantic emotion. Because the opera moves so
fast and its substance appears so undemanding, it is only afterwards that
one realises it has said something rather interesting about the human
condition - about the maddening, delightful unpredictability of the human
heart.
By now it must be clear that I think Cherubin a worthwhile addition to the
Royal Opera repertory: a season containing Massenet's 'sung play' (according
to his own labelling) at the one end and Birtwistle's Gawain at the other is
admirably wide-ranging indeed] By and large the new production is a success,
more than perhaps might have been predicted, given its difficult birth
pangs: the dispute with the original conductor, Rozhdestvensky, meant that
Mario Bernardi - former Sadler's Wells chief and a very welcome returnee to
London opera - had probably little more than a week to chime his
interpretation in with that of the producers.
He has done so very well: the last word in fizz may be lacking in the
playing, but the pacing is excellently trim. The cast is firmly supported,
and its star, the American Susan Graham, encouraged to shine. In the title
role Miss Graham's mint-fresh high mezzo (which revives memories of the
young Yvonne Minton) gives pleasure of the most rewarding kind: the use of
the voice is subtle, not showy, and Massenet's principal-boy conception
takes on the richness I suspect it has by no means always displayed.
Angela Gheorghiu's Nina is full of dusky fragrance, sometimes a touch sharp
in pitch. The showpiece soprano role, the dancer L'Ensoleillad, finds Maria
Bayo bright-toned but mostly rather impersonal in her inflections. Robert
Lloyd's Philosopher - idealised parent-figure, wise and humane - is
wonderfully sympathetic. Minor roles are tidily assigned, with generally a
higher standard of French delivery than usual in this house: Ryland Davies,
another welcome house returnee, stands out as the Duke.
Tim Albery (producer) and Anthony McDonald (designer) have found a palatably
modern-accented approach to Massenet which for many people will increase the
evening's attractions. The manner is at once quirky and pretty-pretty, with
heavy reliance on storybook colours and patterns, and infusions of dance
beyond the basic needs of the plot; the comic scenes are turned into lightly
mechanised farce.
For my taste the show is over-designed to the point of archness, and
correspondingly too often short on simplicity. The addition of actors
playing Susanna and Figaro, who simultaneously translate the many patches of
French spoken dialogue, is a Bad Idea, even if one sees how and why it came
about. In the end, the freshness of the principals, the unassuming mastery
of the conductor and the beauty of the work itself come through with room to
spare.

Who would bring crazy new music like this to the regions if the Arts Council
ever dissolved the Contemporary Music Network? Could the people of Leeds
reasonably expect to see American musicians blowing down the wrong end of
trombones, without Arts Council funding? Is it right that Brighton be
exposed to 'shifting grids of sand . . . film scores without films' at all?
Winters have been warmed by the sublime and sometimes ridiculous sands of
half-hinged modernists, often bringing with them to the regions lectures and
workshops, courtesy of the Arts Council since 1971. But for how much longer?
The Arts Council is reorganising its touring department and until hard
decisions are made in March, the future of CMN beyond next year is
uncertain.
Drummer Bobby Previte and his Empty Suits, whose UK tour closed at The
Junction in Cambridge on Sunday, are the kind of musicians whose mad,
passionate work is the hallmark of a CMN programme. With scores which create
a dense but ordered background to searing improvisation, this earth-moving
quintet's music alternately bludgeons and caresses to bewildering effect.
Two keyboards gurgle subterranean style, the icy tones of muted pocket
trumpet are exchanged for valve trombone (whose operator shouts into the
bell end sometimes) and the drip-drip of electric rhythm guitar explodes
into wah-wah heat.
Shifting from hard bop sounds to heavy rock, Previte lifting and lowering
the dynamic as much by facial expression as by his playing, it is
challenging and funny music. It is tight, too, and the musicians are all
working hard from charts. Some of the work was commissioned for the Moscow
State Circus and alludes to tangoing white rats and unsmiling clowns. Later,
a metal barnstorm evolves from Ravel-inspired piano work, penny whistles
confusing the atmosphere.
To reduce the availability of esoteric and expensive music like Previte's
(why is experimental and minimalist music usually made by large ensembles?)
might seem a painless way of reducing the touring budget. But CMN is like a
travelling oasis for regions starved of well-organised cutting-edge art,
especially now the regional arts boards have been trimmed. To a point,
London can look after itself, but what other major promoter would take Glenn
Branca's Symphony No 10 for massed electric guitars to Cardiff or Bracknell,
for example?
The CMN spring programme continues with tours from Glenn Branca at the end
of this month; London Brass at the end of March (new pieces including
Michael Nyman's tribute to John Cage) and the Northern Sinfonia in May (a
new cello concerto by Poul Ruders).

FT  16 FEB 94 / Arts: Picasso unexplored - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tate Gallery exhibition Picasso: Sculptor/Painter opens today and BBC2
is in the middle of a season of programmes designed to complement the event.
This is remarkable for two reasons: first because there are few television
channels in the world which would even consider such a season. Britain has
two; it is easy to imagine Channel 4 doing something similar. Given the
worldwide tendency for television to concentrate more and more on such
derivative and childish trash as Don't Forget Your Toothbrush (which,
ironically, was launched on Saturday by Channel 4), we in Britain should
count ourselves fortunate indeed to have two channels still willing to treat
the audience like grown ups.
However, the season is remarkable secondly because there seems to be a
vacuum at its centre. Picasso is the primary representative in the public
imagination of 'Modern Art'; and 'Modern Art' is treated with suspicion,
hostility or contempt by, I would guess, a considerable majority of the
population. So, given the obsession with the 'mass' aspect of television as
a mass medium, you might think that the controller of BBC2, Michael Jackson,
and BBC television's head of music and arts, Kim Evans, would see the Tate
exhibition and their own season as the occasion to take the bull - that one
made out of a bicycle saddle and handlebars if you like - by the horns and
take the Modern Art debate to the public.
Instead they are behaving as though they are unaware that there ever was any
controversy over Modernism. In this entire season, beginning on Saturday and
spreading across two weeks, with 12 proper programmes and 20 amusing little
90-second inserts called Talking Picasso, there are just two occasions when
the central debate might be heard. The first is Picasso v. Matisse which is
transmitted tonight. The programme starts with the twee idea that there is
only room in heaven for one more artist, and St Peter (black of course,
though surprisingly not a woman) has to choose. Which should it be?
Unfortunately, though it touches on the contrasts between Matisse as the
decorative colourist and Picasso as the intellectual master of form, the
programme rapidly reverts to the main preoccupation of this series:
Picasso's sexuality and the role of his models and mistresses. But there is
a moment when we are shown a painting of a cream rectangle against a dark
background and the commentary remarks that after looking at this it is
easier to go back and look at one of Matisse's late groups of dancers and
ignore what the dancers are doing and instead see how they fill the space
and how the paint fills them. In other words painting is not about dancing
or sunshine or joy, it is merely about painting.
This, surely, is where television should start the big debate. It is the
concentration on just such closed-shop talk, full of internal references to
the world of painting rather than the world of ordinary people's experience,
which ordinary people find most pretentious about the world of Modern Art.
To outsiders it looks like a comfy little world of artists reacting to one
another's latest weird passions, dealers egging them on, a few people with
more money than sense buying art in the hope that it will out-perform the
Footsie 100, and an army of academics and critics arguing the toss over all
this in a secret language.
However, the opportunity is missed and the programme moves back to discuss
Picasso's bafflement at Matisse's ability to paint from nude models since
Picasso found that, faced with a naked woman, he invariably became more
interested in going to bed with her than painting her. Hence his habit of
painting the female form clothed or from memory.
Apart from the last in the season, all the other programmes are devoted
either to Picasso's life, as with the opening offering, Yo Picasso, a
documentary which uneasily mixed conventional and drama techniques to tell
the story of his female companions; to some highly detailed aspect of his
work as in Sunday's Picasso In Concrete which showed how Carl Nesjar
translated Picasso's cardboard maquettes into pre-stressed concrete; or to
the specialised reactions in Talking Picasso where, for instance,
greengrocers criticise the fruit in a Picasso still life and a plastic
surgeon muses on the possibility of rebuilding the head of a woman in which
both eyes appear on one side of the nose.
Ho ho. It is healthy not always to take art too seriously, and practically
all these programmes are entertaining, informative, and well made - though
some of the foreground music in the Richardson On Picasso trio was
irritating, and in Yo Picasso loud enough to drown the dialogue. Nor is this
season free of television's most infuriating habit in the coverage of art:
using the camera to comment on paintings in a way that expresses the TV
producer's sensibilities at the cost of the artist's. No artist ever
intended you to see his work by starting in big close-up on an eyebrow
before zooming out to the whole canvas. Moreover, repeating Clouzot's Le
Mystere Picasso this coming Friday risks embarrassing comparisons. Nearly 40
years old, this extraordinary exercise in which Picasso painted on glass as
cameras filmed from the rear is the most powerful piece of work in the
season.
The main point remains, however: Picasso is the ideal artist to exemplify
the debate about the Modern movement because he showed with the pictures in
his early Blue and Rose Periods that he was capable of creating hugely
impressive and popular work in conventional styles, yet he chose to move
into cubism and other unconventional styles. Why?
Occasionally we get a hint, as in John Richardson's Monday programme with
its details about early analytic cubism in Picasso's sketches from a Spanish
hotel window. But within the larger consideration of Modernism these are
trifles. What you would never gather from this Picasso season is any sense
that figurative and non-Modern art is now moving back into the vanguard, and
that it begins to look as though the entire Modern movement will be seen
with hindsight, perhaps quite soon, as an eccentric detour within the larger
history of art.
Of course there is still the last programme in the season which it has been
impossible to preview: The Late Show on Thursday February 24. We are told
that this will tackle such questions as Picasso's place in the Modern
movement, and how far he can be held responsible for 'the alienating trends
of the present' in the art world. However, it sounds as though the chief
concern will be the position of sculpture in the work of the painter,
precisely the point implied by the title of the Tate exhibition.
Television arts departments in general, and The Late Show in particular,
appear to believe unswervingly in Modernism and are thus out of kilter with
non-metropolitan public opinion. So it would be astonishing if The Late Show
did mount a debate which managed to stand outside the enchanted village of
Modernism and seriously question its creed.
Yet in the mass medium of television that, surely, is one of the most
important things that any proper season on Picasso ought to do.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Off on the wrong foot -
Bronwen Maddox reports on the row brewing over the funding of Britain's
Energy Saving Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Energy efficiency, one of the most innocuous-sounding parts of the UK
government's environmental policy, is shaping up to be a political
minefield.
Last month John Major, the prime minister, announced that the government's
plans for combatting the threat of global warming rested heavily on the
Energy Saving Trust, whose mission is to encourage households to use fuel
more efficiently.
But giving that much prominence to the trust may prove a misjudgment. One of
the commitments in the 1992 election manifesto, the trust has been slow to
get off the ground. The government now needs urgently to sort out regulatory
conflicts and political controversies that are threatening to cripple the
trust before it has begun to act.
One of the most serious emerged within hours of Major's speech. Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, told a
parliamentary select committee that she was reluctant to allow the trust to
pass the costs of its projects on to gas customers. Without that means of
funding, the trust's activity could be severely curtailed. Eoin Lees, its'
chief executive, says her remarks were 'a bombshell'.
Even if that is navigated, the trust presents ministers with a tough
dilemma. If the trust fails to meet targets for cutting emissions of carbon
dioxide, the UK could find it hard to fulfil its pledges at the 1992 Rio
Earth Summit. But if the trust succeeds, it could become unpopular by
pushing up household fuel bills across the country.
The purpose of the trust - in fact a company limited by guarantee - is to
search out investments for British Gas or the 12 regional electricity
companies that will help their customers use energy more efficiently.
The heart of the trust's problem is that although energy efficiency schemes
often sound like something for nothing, the initial investment needed is
high. It has also become clear in the past year that the government's
targets for the trust are demanding.
According to figures published by the Department of the Environment after
last year's spring Budget, the government wants the trust's schemes to curb
emissions of carbon dioxide by 2.5m tonnes of carbon a year. That is around
a quarter of the cuts that the UK needs to make by the end of the decade to
meet its Rio commitments.
To meet that goal, the trust will need to be investing between Pounds 300m
and Pounds 400m a year by the last years of the decade, according to DoE
reports.
But although the trust was formally set up 18 months ago when Lord John
Moore, the former cabinet minister, was appointed chairman, it is a long way
short of those goals. In the year to March 1994 the trust will have invested
only about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in a handful of pilot projects.
The largest of these provides grants of around Pounds 200 to encourage
householders to install gas-condensing boilers, which typically cost more
than Pounds 1,000. The trust has also backed combined heat and power
generators for large blocks of flats and offices; long-life light bulbs; and
new local energy advice centres.
It is now at a turning point. Next year it wants to spend between Pounds 25m
and Pounds 30m, much of this on a nationwide survey of energy efficiency.
Equipped with that data, it wants to invest more than Pounds 100m the next
year, and some Pounds 350m a year by 1997-98.
'After the pilot projects are complete, we would move to the real big
spend,' says Ian Fraser, the newly appointed finance director.
But to make that leap, the trust will have to overcome the barrier that
Spottiswoode has suddenly erected (Offer, the electricity regulator, has
shown less anxiety about the trust's funding). She told the select committee
on trade and industry that she did not believe that a regulator should
impose levies on customers that were tantamount to 'regressive' taxes -
falling proportionally harder on less well-off families.
Her concern is that all households, even those that have not benefited from
the trust's work, will pay a share of its' costs. But those who have
benefited are likely to be comparatively well-off, as they can afford to
install gas-condensing boilers.
That is a sensitive point for the government, according to Andrew Warren,
director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy. The DoE's own
figures suggest that if the trust met its targets in full by the end of the
decade, and if its costs were fully passed on to customers, annual average
energy bills might rise by between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.
Those increases would come on top of the value added tax at 17.5 per cent
imposed in last year's spring Budget, which provoked one of last year's
fiercest political rows.
Labour, which has made much of the VAT uproar, has now homed in on the
trust's potential impact on fuel bills. Chris Smith, Labour environment
spokesman, said: 'We support the concept of the trust, as so little is being
done about energy efficiency. But we want the cost of the schemes to be
passed on to those properties which have benefited from improvements.'
The trust says that these concerns about its future are unwarranted. Its
directors argue that if it is successful, energy savings will mean that for
many people the rise in household bills would not be as big as DoE figures
suggest. They say, too, that many projects planned for the next few years,
notably one dubbed 'Affordable Warmth', are targeted at poorer households.
Their confidence, however, assumes that the government can persuade its
critics that households should foot the bill for energy efficiency. Urgent
talks have now begun between Ofgas, the Department of Trade and Industry and
the DoE to work out whether the trust's brief is compatible with the
regulators' present powers, or whether new regulation might be needed.
Those are still formidable hurdles for the trust to overcome before it
fulfils the central role in UK environmental policy that Major has awarded
it.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Openness helps nuclear
mediator - David Buchan on French interest in radioactive waste research
labs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to imagine anyone in most of northern Europe volunteering, even
lobbying, to have a nuclear waste research laboratory built underneath them.
Yet that is what some 30 French local authorities did, and a shortlist of
four has just been chosen by France's 'nuclear mediator', Christian
Bataille.
On the shortlist presented by Bataille to the government last month are two
sites in the east (Meuse and Haute Marne), one in the west (Vienne) and one
in the south (Gard). After studying their geology for two years, the
government will choose two in which to sink underground research labs,
costing around FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) each, a step towards a possible
decision around 2006 on an eventual nuclear waste storage site.
The 56 reactors that generate nearly 80 per cent of France's electricity
also produce more than 4,000 cu m of waste a year, of which 200 cu m (about
the size of the average private swimming pool) is of long-lived and high
radioactivity. At present, this is piling up in a temporary silo at the Cap
La Hague reprocessing plant near Cherbourg.
The French Greens have recently unveiled their 'Nuclear - Let's Get Out of
It' campaign, which will particularly target the four possible waste
research sites. But, overall, Bataille's shortlist decision has attracted
nothing like the outcry accompanying similar moves in the 1980s. Then the
experts of France's Agence Nationale pour les Dechets Radioactifs (Andra)
drew up a list of 28 possible sites on purely geological grounds and then
selected four. There was such opposition that by 1990 the government halted
the plan.
The problem was passed to parliament where Bataille, a socialist deputy, in
alliance with parliament's Scientific and Technical Evaluation Office, was
instrumental in the passage of France's first nuclear waste law in 1991,
covering research into elimination and storage of waste.
Bataille was subsequently named 'nuclear mediator' in the quest to choose
the two underground lab sites. He tried a novel approach: 'We put out a
tender for anyone who wanted such a laboratory in their area, and we got
positive replies from 30 local authorities,' says Bataille. He was most
surprised by the interest from Roubaix, a heavily populated town near Lille
in northern France. Why was the reaction in 1993 so different from that in
the late 1980s, given broadly unchanged public support for nuclear power?
Bataille admits that one reason was money; the 1991 law rewards any
community hosting one of the underground labs with FFr60m a year in aid over
15 years. But this, he says, is not an enormous sum, amounting to the cost
of a few kilometres of highway. More important was the fact that any storage
decision is now clearly for the next century. Earlier, communities were
given the impression that if they accepted a laboratory they would probably
end up with a permanent waste storage site on the same spot.
In the event, Roubaix and 19 other local authorities failed the necessary
geological test of having 'soil that is compact, impermeable and without
flaws'. In choosing the final four, Bataille said he was largely guided by
the fact that their Conseils Regionaux voted unanimously for the
laboratories. But this political consensus was not shared by all at a more
local level.
Nonetheless, Bataille claims his open method of public consultation has
vastly improved the climate of opinion. 'What frightens people are decisions
taken secretly,' he says, 'and until recently the French nuclear industry
has been secretive, particularly the chief regulatory body, the Commission a
l'Energie Atomique with its military origins.' By contrast, he commends the
country's nuclear power operator, Electricite de France, for its openness.
Bataille is considered a nuclear stooge by the Greens. 'I certainly believe
that nuclear power is important in giving cheap electricity to France, just
as gas is a strategic interest to Russia or oil to the Middle East,' he
says. 'But I don't represent any lobby.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Sludge on your cereal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that your breakfast cereal or toast began life being fertilised
with sewage sludge may not be very appealing. But it seems this will
increasingly be the case.
Some 42 per cent of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in the UK each
year is already applied to cereal and industrial crops and to grassland. The
quantity is expected to rise sharply in the next 12 years as European Union
regulations on effluent treatment double the amount of sludge produced.
Sludge will also need a new home when dumping at sea is banned in 1998.
UK farmers could save between Pounds 15m and Pounds 22m a year on chemical
fertilisers, and obtain similar results, by opting for sludge, says Mark
Aitken, environmental scientist at the Scottish Agricultural College.
Aitken will tell local authority and water company representatives at the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow today that sludge
contains nitrogen and phosphorus - important plant nutrients - and organic
matter, which improves the soil's ability to hold water.
But he will emphasise the need for careful analysis since it can also
contain heavy metals and organisms that cause salmonella and other diseases.
Fields must be tested, too, for suitability for sludge application.
Sewage sludge is not used to grow fruit and vegetables in case any bacteria
splash on to the crop and are not washed off.
But it is safe for cereals because it is applied when plants are young,
before the edible ears have grown. 'The plant is also quite discriminating
and doesn't transmit any contaminants to the edible portion,' says Aitken.
The prospect of more sludge being recycled free of charge on fields is
likely to worry fertiliser manufacturers. Aitken admits it may also be
resisted by farmers preferring an inorganic fertiliser which they have used
successfully for 20 years to 'some nasty brown stuff'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Symonds, a distant relative of the founder of Symonds Engineering, has
been appointed group chief executive of the Cheshunt-based precision
engineer with immediate effect.
Symonds joined the board of the company only last February as a
non-executive director, and became production director in June. Before
joining Symonds he was the manufacturing director at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
where he worked for 26 years.
The change at the top follows the appointment in July of Rod Ackrill as
chairman, replacing Jim Ruggles who remained md. Now Ruggles is resigning
from the board and as md after 39 years with the company, pending his early
retirement on April 1.
Ackrill says he is confident that Jim Symonds would be instrumental in
developing the group into a broadly-based engineering company.
In December, the company reported that its pre-tax losses halved from Pounds
256,000 to Pounds 126,000 in the six months ended September 30, because of
improved margins and cost-cutting.

<TEXT>
Bob Gibson, managing director of ESN Securities Investment Management, is to
succeed Michael Cannan as chief executive when he retires.
ESN Pension Management Group is the fund management company formed out of
the in-house pension scheme manager for the now-privatised electricity
supply companies. Under a unique structure, the companies would keep their
pension assets with ESN, buying 'units' in the fund. Although the companies
have the option to move their assets after a few years, almost all the funds
have remained.
ESN, which offers administrative services to other pension schemes, has said
it would like to expand its investment skills 'to a wider audience'. But
officials there say privately that despite its strong performance record, it
has difficulty attracting new clients because it has no name-brand
recognition. Therefore it would be interested in acquiring a smaller outfit
with a high public profile.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Walker, 47, who was deputy managing director of Standard Chartered's
Scimitar fund management operation when it was taken over by Royal Bank of
Scotland in 1992, has been appointed chief operating officer and group
finance director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, the fund management
group.
Michael Hart, chairman of F &amp; C Fund Management, said that the group had
been growing at a 'tremendous rate' over the past few years and it made
sense to bring in someone from outside with administrative skills to help
plan and control the growth.
The group is jointly owned by Hypo Bank, Germany's fifth-biggest bank, and
five London investment trusts, and its funds under management have grown
from Pounds 1.4bn in 1985 to Pounds 10.3bn currently.
Walker, who trained as an accountant with Thomson McLintock, spent much of
his early career with the Wardley merchant banking group in Hong Kong before
joining Thomson McKinnon Securities in 1986 as regional vice-president for
Europe. In 1989 he was made deputy managing director of Standard Chartered
Equitor and in November 1992 he switched to Capital House.

FT  16 FEB 94 / People: Richard Lutyens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Lutyens, who died at the age of 45 last Saturday, first came to
attention in the City as one of Sir Siegmund Warburg's bright young men. He
joined Warburg in 1972 and had been made a director before he was 30 - a
distinction shared with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's current chairman and
John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell.
A great nephew of Edwin Lutyens, the British architect, Lutyens was
recruited to Warburg by Bernard Kelly and quickly caught Sir Siegmund's eye.
Ron Chernow notes in his book, The Warburgs: a family saga, how Rothschilds
tried to exclude SG Warburg from a Eurobond issue for an American client.
Sir Siegmund, who prided himself on his memorandums, ordered his young
employee to search the archives for a memorandum covering a verbal agreement
he had made with Rothschilds 15 years before. Lutyens found it and
Rothschilds backed down.
Lutyens' diligence was soon rewarded with a seat on the Warburg board.
However, he quit Warburg in 1982 and after spells with the United Gulf
Investment Company and Goldman Sachs, he was made a managing director of
Merrill Lynch Europe and helped build its European equity business.
After three years with Merrill, he went off to establish a small merchant
banking boutique, with John Campbell and Bill Dacombe, two merchant bankers
who had once worked together at NM Rothschild. Lutyens used his strong
connections on the continent to persuade Mercapital, the Spanish merchant
bank, to take a stake in Campbell Lutyens Hudson in 1990, and he remained
non-executive chairman of the 16-strong firm until his death. His funeral is
on Friday at 10am at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street,
London W1.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: Use the system, win shelf space - Not all
companies find the Japanese market daunting. Michiyo Nakamoto talks to two
that have cracked it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of last weekend's trade talks in Washington will only confirm
impressions that the Japanese market is a hard one for foreign companies to
crack. Countless explanations, from the complexities of the Japanese
distribution system to the peculiarities of Japanese corporate purchasing
practices - which are often dictated by business ties rather than price -
have been given. One US argument is that the Japanese somehow behave
differently from people in other industrialised nations.
But foreign success stories suggest that while the differences are real, the
system does not necessarily work against foreign companies per se. On the
contrary, success is often linked to a company's ability to use the system
to its advantage.
Warner-Lambert, the consumer products group, and Borden, which has a
well-known ice cream brand in Japan, are two US examples.
Warner-Lambert's Schick brand of razor blades has a 70 per cent share of
Japan's market for wet shave products - as opposed to dry, electric shavers
 -despite competition from two Japanese brands. It has been more successful
in Japan than Gillette, which it lags in the US and many other markets.
What helped Schick to build such a strong position? Ken Hill, marketing
director of the consumer health products group at Warner-Lambert in Tokyo,
points to a solid understanding of the country's distribution system, a
focus on Japan as a priority market and aggressive marketing support.
On the first point, Warner-Lambert was fortunate in its tie-up with Hattori
Seiko, its Japanese distributor, through which it began selling Schick razor
blades in Japan in 1960. Hattori Seiko handles all importation, warehousing,
distribution. It also handled selling until last year when Warner-Lambert
set up its own sales force.
Understanding the complex distribution system with its layers of
wholesalers, and having the patience to deal with it, are crucial in Japan
because it is difficult to get products on to shelves by directly
approaching the retailer.
The system has considerable disadvantages. The number of wholesalers pushes
the retail price up several times against that in the US and often a listing
fee must be paid to ensure retailers make a profit. The system also
complicates communication between manufacturer and retailer. 'It was almost
like Hattori Seiko was considered the maker of Schick,' Hill says.
Nevertheless the tie-up proved invaluable for Schick in dealing with the
distribution system and motivating wholesalers and it got the company's
products on to shelves.
The second key to Warner-Lambert's success was its policy of positioning
Japan as a priority market and introducing the latest technology there, in
many cases earlier than its competitors. For example, Schick brought
stainless steel blades to Japan when its Japanese competitors were still
selling carbon blades. Strict attention was paid to packaging to ensure it
would be acceptable in a country where presentation is important.
But high-quality products and mindful distributors need to be supported with
aggressive marketing, Hill says. Hiroya Yano, representative director,
chairman and CEO of Borden Japan, agrees. His parent company's losses may be
mounting in the US but the appearance of Borden's Lady Borden brand of ice
creams in almost every supermarket in Japan is testimony to the company's
success in that market.
Like Warner-Lambert, Borden initially had a tie-up with a Japanese partner,
Meiji Milk Products. The 20-year partnership ended in 1990 when the US
company decided it needed a marketing and sales force that could respond
quickly and flexibly in Japan's increasingly competitive ice cream market.
It set up its own sales and marketing team and launched a strategy to sell
its traditional Lady Borden brand ice creams at competitive prices and to
position a new brand, Classy, in the premium ice cream category.
While the decision to discount the traditional brand paid off, increasing
the sales by about 30 per cent compared with a year ago, Borden's strategy
was really tested with the introduction of the Classy brand, which is sold
at convenience stores.
Under Yano's direction, the company adopted an aggressive marketing
strategy, using a popular and controversial actress in its advertising and
making sure that it won over retailers and wholesalers to its plan even
before the product was ready to go on shelves.
'There is an iron rule to success in Japan,' Yano says. High-quality
products at affordable prices must be backed by a strong marketing plan. The
ingredients to successful marketing, he says, are aggressive advertising and
close co-operation with wholesalers and retailers.
Intensive advertising, Japanese style, is essential not only to reach the
consumer but also to convince the wholesaler and the retail buyers that it
is worth carrying a specific product. In launching Classy, Borden hired
actress Rie Miyazawa, who was in the news at the time because of a broken
engagement with a famous sumo wrestler, at considerable expense. It also
secured a substantial number of advertising slots in the media.
The investment paid off. It made an impression on consumers and convinced
wholesalers and retailers that Borden was serious about Classy, Yano says.
The company had aimed for shelf space in 15,000 convenience stores but was
able to secure space in 32,000.
Securing shelf space is a particular challenge in Japan where each product
is listed precisely, competition is stiff and aggressive retailers may drop
products in three months, Yano says.
Equally important is bringing wholesalers and retailers into the marketing
plan early on. Months before Classy's launch, Yano visited convenience
stores to talk to buyers.
'If you do that buyers give you advice, you develop a relationship and the
shelf space is there before you ask for it,' he says.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: A new mindset for the manager - Christopher
Lorenz reports on the obstacles to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top management of a very large German company wanted to achieve the Holy
Grail of big business everywhere: to make its managers less bureaucratic,
more entrepreneurial, more empowered and empowering.
All that was needed to change their behaviour, it thought, was for their
beliefs and 'culture' to be altered. So it invited a professor, Heinz
Thanheiser, to help 'hammer the message into their heads' about the need for
change.
The fallacy that new beliefs - or 'culture change' - lead automatically to
new behaviour is just one of many basic mistakes that companies make when
trying to change, renew or 'transform' themselves. Others include lack of
sustained leadership of the change process, and too frequent modification of
the emphasis and content of the process, according to Thanheiser and Yves
Doz, a fellow professor at Insead, the business school near Paris.
Another common mistake is to underestimate the extent of the innate barriers
against change, which exist in most companies, Thanheiser and Doz argue in a
working paper* published under the aegis of Insead's Corporate Renewal
Initiative.
With few exceptions, big companies suffer a litany of barriers, claim the
academics: 'Internal distrust, poor communications, disenfranchised middle
management, a low level of employee motivation, stifling of entrepreneurial
spirit, slow decision-making, lack of collaboration across internal
boundaries, and inhibited learning.'
For change processes to succeed against such odds, three complementary steps
must be taken, say the academics. Managers need to identify the main
external challenge to the company's strategy. The 'organisational context'
within which decisions are taken, and the rules governing people's tasks,
roles and relationships, must also be altered. And the 'world view', or
'mindset', of managers needs changing by linking it to the company's new
strategic thrust.
The latter is an especially tough task. In spite of the 'modernisation' of
corporate structures and systems, the mindset of most managers appears to
have remained remarkably similar to the 'Taylorist' model developed at the
beginning of this century (by Frederick Taylor, the 'father' of so-called
'scientific management').
Few modern managers would advocate the exercising of authority in the
blatantly coercive ways that Taylor espoused - in order to control 'dumb and
lazy workmen', as he put it. But Thanheiser and Doz argue that even in
knowledge-intensive companies managers are still influenced by his
principles of hierarchical order, narrow specialisation and 'command and
control' systems - all of which were designed to achieve the compliance of
an uneducated workforce.
Modern bureaucracies may use subtler means for achieving compliance, say the
duo, but their highly educated managers and 'knowledge workers' are
nevertheless 'stifled rather than mobilised to contribute all their
intelligence and energy'.
This latent energy should be unleashed in almost revolutionary fashion in
the change process itself, advise Thanheiser and Doz. Faced with the
all-too-frequent barrier of conservatism among senior executives, they argue
that 'organisational renewal (often) benefits from the shared expectations,
collectively held change agenda, and peer pressure that middle managers can
bring'.
This is not to say that change processes can only be successful if they
start in the middle or near the bottom of an organisation, Thanheiser and
Doz emphasise. Unlike many other academics and consultants, they argue that
top-down - or 'programmatic' - change can also succeed in certain
circumstances.
*Regaining competitiveness: a process of organisational renewal.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: Share options for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are an executive in a British company you can expect to be given
share options. If you are a mere employee the best you can hope for is the
chance to save up for them through a sharesave scheme.
However, some companies are trying to narrow the gap. A small handful is
starting to introduce share option schemes for everyone modelled on the
schemes usually only available to executives.
The most recent example is Alpha Airports, which joined the stock market
last week. Alpha has decided to give each of its 6,500 employees the option
to buy 350 shares in three years' time at the issue price of 140p. So far
each one is showing a paper profit of around Pounds 100. While the scheme
makes no distinction between the lowliest employee and senior middle
management, a separate (more generous) option scheme also exists for senior
directors.
New Bridge Street Consultants, which advised Alpha on the all-employee
'executive-style' scheme, argues that it is more democratic than usual
sharesave schemes. Most of these are only taken up by 30-40 per cent of the
workforce, as the bulk of employees cannot afford the monthly contribution.
By contrast, the option scheme costs nothing until the options are exercised
(in three to 10 years' time).
Such schemes are likely to please institutional investors, which have become
increasingly concerned about executive option schemes. Last week, the
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants told its clients to vote down
new schemes that were not open to all.
However, employees offered share options are not necessarily being given a
ticket to the stars. In 1992, Wellcome granted all of its UK workers the
option to buy 500 shares each. From next year they will have the right to
take them up at Pounds 7.72, but at today's share price of Pounds 6.48, they
are hardly holding their breath.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Recruitment: As much back to the future as basics - Wanted,
a change of focus for recruitment advertising as the recession comes to an
end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What makes a good job advertisement? This question stems not just from a
voguish desire to get back to basics but is prompted by the mission set for
this column by my predecessor: to ensure that society's most important jobs
are filled by the people best able to do them. Some guidance might be
gleaned from the two premier UK recruitment advertisement awards currently
bestowing laurels on the best of last year's efforts.
The British Recruitment Advertising awards run by The Independent and
Personnel Today were held three weeks ago at a gala evening in Grosvenor
House, London. The rival Recruitment Industry Awards, given jointly by the
Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Institute of Personnel
Management are about to be judged ahead of the awards ceremony in April.
In the most recent crop Austin Knight UK, the recruitment advertising,
consulting and communications company, scooped the Advertisement of the Year
for its London Fire Brigade contribution.
The advertisement aimed at graduates and school leavers featured 'an ad
within an ad' as if someone had torn a vacancy from a newspaper and placed
it on a blank page. It said: 'Pounds 56K salary, generous leave, car loan
scheme, retirement at 55, excellent pension.' At the foot of the otherwise
blank page a statement read: 'We haven't mentioned the bit about saving
lives.' The real information came underneath, mentioning three salary tiers
and reminding prospective applicants that they were looking at a career with
'serious senior management' potential.
To give the gist, it said: 'That fifty six thousand is what you'd earn as an
Assistant Chief Fire Officer: take away 'assistant' and you're looking at
another Pounds 20K at least.' Then came the news that there were no short
cuts or soft options for graduates who would start as a firefighter on a
basic of Pounds 15,000.
The other 16 categories were dominated by Macmillan Davies, the recruitment
consultancy and advertising agency that was recently taken over by Omnicom,
the US communications group.
Macmillan Davies collected six awards and 15 commendations, including the
best campaign award for a series of advertisements for Norwich Union. They
depicted teams in tug-of-war, rowing and climbing, all pulling together in
the same direction.
A more mundane Norwich Union vacancy in these pages last week, looking for
an economist, still managed to stand out even though it was no more than
average sized. It was the only one that was not framed in a lined-box.
Another omission was the salary. The only figure quoted was the Pounds 30bn
and more that the Norwich controls in managed funds.
The debate about whether or not to include salaries continues to tax
recruiters. Richard Goldie, managing director of Macmillan Davies, says that
conventional wisdom holds that it is best to state the salary but employers
are sometimes chary about flagging up internal comparisons. 'If you know the
salary is competitive, I think it's best to state it,' he says.
A compromise could be to include a salary range or possibly an overall
package figure to give some scope for negotiation or the provision of a
'cafeteria' choice of reward.
A recurring grumble at the IPM Compensation Forum's annual conference in
London recently was about the lack of imagination in reward systems. Other
than the standard salary with perhaps a performance related bonus and a car,
there is often little to differentiate one form of benefits package from
another.
The cafeteria idea is to provide an overall figure against a list of
benefits to allow scope for bespoke tailoring of the salary package fitted
to individual preferences. Optional benefits might include medical
insurance, added pension contributions, child allowances or flexible hours.
The challenge to become more imaginative in reward packages and
advertisements will grow as the recruitment market becomes more competitive.
Awards judges are still looking for creativity within limited budgets. One
of the simplest but most effective advertisements in the BRA awards was in
the black and white category won by the J Walter Thompson agency. The ad,
seeking a pianist to play in an RAF band, used a logo of a fighter jet with
a music note as its wheel and undercarriage.
Good pianists are rare commodities but with some posts it might not pay to
be too clever. Tim Gibbon, UK chief executive of Austin Knight and chairman
of the IPA/IPM awards panel, believes that one effect of the recession has
been to suppress creativity in recruitment advertisements. When the most
ordinary advertisement and basic job description is likely to attract 200
applicants, he argues, it can be counter productive to entice thousands of
applicants that cost time and money to process.
Gibbon says: 'One of the challenges in a recession is to create ads to
reduce the number of replies because the response management side has become
a problem for our customers.'
While advertisers concede that the number of appointments is growing again,
there is still a limited budget for recruitment. A recruiter would expect to
spend between 5 and 10 per cent of the salary level on the vacancy
advertisement and would rarely book a repeat slot.
'It's not like selling a can of beans,' says Gibbon. 'Every job is
different. You are looking for the unique selling point that will prompt a
person to apply. It is often not the salary. It might be the challenge. If
you can say with a technical job, for example, that the company is offering
opportunities at the leading edge of technology, people will want to work
there.'
He believes the most important aspect of the recruitment advertisement is to
answer the question 'What's in it for me?' from the applicant. 'The idea is
to become tougher on the specifications. Take out the preferables and the
probables,' says Gibbon, but not without subtlety. 'One of the problems with
'Only the best will do' ads is that everybody wants to pick up on the
challenge.'
Bold, direct messages have become fashionable. One of the award winning
Norwich Union advertisements stated: 'The difference between Norwich Union
and others is simple: It's much harder to work for Norwich Union.' The
intention, says Goldie, was to be arrogant and aggressive. 'The theme was
that you had to be to be good enough to work for Norwich Union. The idea was
that by saying the Norwich job was harder to do you would be attracting the
people who think they are the best and most ambitious.'
The technique, called employee branding, adopts the same principles used in
creating product brand consciousness among customers. It creates a certain
employer status, in people's perception at least, and theoretically has a
broader impact on customers generally.
The advertisement is thus performing a dual function by appealing to job
seekers and by creating a general brand image. In this case, that the
Norwich is for toughies. The items in some newspapers last week about CV
bloomers collected by Accountemps, the Birmingham-based financial
recruitment consultants, made me wonder whether anyone has ever spotted any
glaring mistakes on CVs attached to the top jobs. The Accountemps collection
included the candidate who wrote that she had 'terminated herself' and one
who listed among his skills 'Excellent memory, strong mathematical aptitude,
excellent memory'. Does anyone have any similar gems?
A final thought. Prospective Norwich Union job applicants might want to list
a few sports in their CVs. What about tug-of-war, mountaineering and rowing?

An upturn in tenant demand last year pushed the availability of offices in
central London down by more than a fifth to stand at 14 per cent of the
total stock, say property advisers DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
The advisers say in a survey that last year 'provided clear evidence of the
market cycle turning'.
The availability decline stemmed from a 20 per cent rise in take-up,
principally from the banking and financial services industries, together
with a contraction of the development pipeline. About 500,000 sq ft of the
total take-up of 12.9m sq ft was directly attributable to the IRA's
Bishopsgate bomb last April.
Docklands registered a strong rise in take-up of more than 200 per cent as a
result of lettings by Mirror Group Newspapers, London Regional Transport and
of Tower Hamlets Borough Council.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe's report suggests that development activity will remain
at historically low levels this year, but will increase markedly in the next
two years.
The survey highlights sharp variations in the fortunes of different
locations and quality of buildings. Core areas of central London registered
a fall of 45 per cent in the volume of available new space and a fall of 12
per cent in the availability of second-hand units.
Fringe areas, however, including Docklands, fared less well, registering a
decline in the availability of new space of almost a fifth.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Du Pont closure costs 112 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Du Pont, the US-owned chemicals and energy company, yesterday announced a
plant closure with the loss of 112 jobs, and the sale of another smaller
unit.
The plant to be closed was bought from ICI in an international asset-swap
deal last July. Du Pont said the compounding plant at Billingham, Cleveland,
which makes nylon-based plastics, was being closed because of the tough
economic environment.
Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the TGWU general union which
represents most of the workers who lost their jobs, attacked both Du Pont
and ICI and said he felt a sense of betrayal over the closure.
The 112 job losses are the second tranche announced by Du Pont in plants
acquired when it took over ICI's European-based nylon business in return for
its own US acrylics business, plus about Pounds 235m.
Du Pont also said it had agreed to sell the Verton nylon long-fibre compound
business, also at Billingham, to LNP Plastics Nederland BV

FT  16 FEB 94 / Builders cautious despite 14% surge in orders last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction orders won by contractors last year rose for the first time
since 1990, the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
The value of orders in 1993 increased by almost 14 per cent compared with
the previous year to Pounds 19.93bn, the department's figures show.
It was also the highest total value of contracts since 1990, when the
industry won work worth Pounds 22.49bn.
The performance was welcomed by Mr Tony Baldry, the construction minister.
He said: 'The fall in output has halted, with the overall volume of work
still about one-sixth higher than it was in the mid-1980s.'
Order books peaked in 1989 when the industry won contracts worth Pounds
27.14bn, more than a third higher than last year's improved total.
Contractors remained concerned, however, about the low prices at which
contracts are being awarded, leaving little or no margin for profit.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, warned
last month that too many companies were charging suicidal prices. Recent
rises in building material prices mean that contracts won on wafer-thin
margins could become lossmaking.
There is also concern that reductions in public spending, announced in the
November Budget, could slow future increases in orders. Housebuilders are
worried that tax increases scheduled to take effect in April could damage
prospects for further recovery in the housing market.
The latest figures indicate that there was no slackening in the pace of
recovery in the final three months of last year. The department said total
orders, after allowing for seasonal variations and at constant 1985 prices,
were 12 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 34 per cent up
on the the fourth quarter of 1992.
Investment in construction slumped badly at the end of 1992 after Britain's
decision to quit the European exchange rate mechanism.
Private housing orders in the final three months of last year were 12 per
cent higher than the previous three months and 45 per cent higher than the
corresponding period in 1992.
Infrastructure orders were 72 per cent and 43 per cent higher respectively.
Private industrial orders were 8 per cent and 33 per cent higher while
private commercial orders, although 6 per cent lower than the previous three
months, were 28 per cent higher than the corresponding period in 1992.
Mr Baldry said: 'In the medium term at least, the (economic) climate has
rarely looked better and construction will benefit from that.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / MPs plot committee coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over Commons business was threatening to intensify last night, with
Conservative MPs on an influential select committee vowing to proceed with a
coup against the body's Labour chairman.
Tory members of the Commons trade and industry committee met to decide how
to proceed when the committee gathers this morning.
One of them, Mr Keith Hampson, MP for Leeds North West, said yesterday: 'We
have every intention of proceeding with a motion of no confidence (against
Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's chairman) until such time as the Labour
whips agree it is essential to the proper functioning of select committees
that we should pair.'
Last night's meeting came as Sir Terence Higgins, the senior Tory
backbencher who chairs the Commons liaison committee, pressed on with his
efforts to defuse the argument after the inconclusive outcome of his meeting
with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, on Monday night.
The immediate cause of the dispute is the Labour leadership's refusal to
allow its MPs on the trade and industry committee to go on a planned trip to
South Africa.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Overseas holiday sales to increase 'up to 20%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of overseas summer holidays are set to increase by between 14 per cent
and 20 per cent this year, the travel agency chain Lunn Poly said yesterday.
The travel industry had previously been forecasting an increase of between 5
per cent and 10 per cent.
Lunn Poly, which is the largest UK travel retailer, said the number of
summer 1994 holidays sold through agents was likely to be between 9m and
9.5m, compared with 7.9m last year. This year's figure is expected to break
the previous record of 8m, set in 1987.
Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said about 3.5m
holidays had been sold by travel agents by the end of January - 40 per cent
more than by the same time last year.
Mr Bowden-Doyle said Spain had captured 51 per cent of the UK summer holiday
market, compared with 36 per cent last year. Greece was in second place with
14 per cent, compared with 16 per cent last year. The big loser had been the
US, which had won 5 per cent of the market compared with 10 per cent last
year.
Lunn Poly said the fall was the result of extensive media coverage of
attacks on tourists in Florida and the strength of the dollar against the
pound. Bookings to Florida had fallen 20 per cent. But other US
destinations, including California, were still popular.
Spain's popularity and the fall in Florida bookings have changed the balance
between long-haul and short-haul holidays. Only 9 per cent of summer 1994
holidays booked so far have been for long-haul destinations, compared with
13 per cent by this stage last year.
The US remains the most popular long-haul destination, although its market
share has fallen to 52 per cent from 73 per cent. The Caribbean now accounts
for 30 per cent of long-haul holidays, compared with 15 per cent last year.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Lords blow to Tory police plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's Back to Basics campaign for a return to traditional values
was in trouble again last night after the Lords refused to accept a key
element of the government's law-and-order programme.
The latest blow, which follows repeated disclosures about the private lives
of Conservative MPs, came as the Lords debated compromise proposals from Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, on the troubled police and magistrates
courts bill.
The government believed it had neutralised Lords opposition earlier this
month when Mr Howard withdrew plans to take powers to appoint police
authority chairpersons, and agreed to greater flexibility in the size of
authorities.
The concessions, intended to nullify claims that the government was
undermining the independence of the authorities, would have allowed local
councillors to maintain a majority on most authorities.
The compromise was welcomed by Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime
minister, who emerged as the bill's most influential critic during its
second reading debate last month.
However, the government withdrew the compromise after it became clear during
yesterday's committee stage debate that enough Conservative rebels remained
to defeat the government if the proposals were put to a vote.
Peers on all sides said the home secretary's insistence on retaining the
power to appoint up to five police authority members would leave authorities
open to too much government intervention.
Mr Howard said he would 'reflect' on the renewed criticism in the Lords, but
indicated that he might try to reinstate the compromise proposals when the
bill moves to the Commons later this year.
'The House of Commons has not yet had an opportunity to have its say, and I
am confident that we will have its support,' he said.
The failure of the compromise is a serious blow to Mr Major, who has
identified law and order as a significant element of Back to Basics,
launched at the Conservative party conference last October.
But in Moscow last night Mr Major refused to allow the continuing Back to
Basics controversy to disrupt his Russian trip. At a press conference he
confined his answers to foreign policy issues.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the government's law-and-order
programme had 'descended into shambolic farce'.
In addition to the reverses on police authorities, the government has been
forced to water down changes to the appointments procedure and terms of
employment for magistrates' clerks.
Mr Howard's other law-and-order measure, the criminal justice bill, has also
been the target of criticism from Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Threat to miners' gala mounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of the Durham Miners Gala, Britain's biggest and most evocative
annual working-class rally, looked further in doubt yesterday after the
Durham Miners Association executive concluded that it could not afford to
finance the event this year.
Faced with the demise of the Durham coalfield and the consequent loss of
income, it is to appeal to the trade union and Labour movement to try to
stage this year's 110th gala.
The northern region executive of the Trades Union Congress will discuss the
appeal today.
Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of the association and the National Union
of Mineworkers' north-east area, said after yesterday's meeting that if this
year's gala were held, it would constitute a 'dignified end'.
At issue is not only the Pounds 20,000 needed to mount the Durham city event
but its identity as a socialist rally to the left of the present Labour
leadership. In earlier years it staunchly promoted Labour policy. But the
party leader has not attended since 1987.
In spite of the gala's emotional resonance, it looks improbable that other
unions will provide unconditional funding.
Mr Bob Howard, northern TUC secretary, said: 'If it was to be without
control of the mainstream TUC and Labour movement, it's unlikely that would
be acceptable.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Employers condemn recruits' illiteracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report that suggested 92 per cent of employers thought recruits did not
have a 'sufficient' command of English was yesterday described by the Labour
party as 'a damning indictment of 15 years of Tory education policies'.
The Queen's English Society found that 38 per cent of the 248 companies it
surveyed had had to spend money to bring their recruits' literacy up to
required standard. Others said they wished to do so, but did not have enough
funds.
Most recruits were 'poor' at writing reports, memoranda and minutes, and
giving presentations, according to the responses.
There were particular problems with application forms, with some applicants
unable to spell the titles of their GCSEs. Many recruits were unable to
spell words such as 'business' and 'separate'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that if the survey's
findings were true, even in part, 'the 16 to 18-year-olds referred to in
this survey have spent their entire school life under a Conservative
government'.
Mr Bernard Lamb, a lecturer in the biology department at Imperial College,
London, who compiled the report, called for more conservative teaching
methods, such as correcting errors in spoken English.
However, the working group of academics which is redrafting the English
national curriculum for England and Wales, has ruled this out.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said:
'Employers have always complained about standards of school leavers since
state education was introduced. In 1861 the Newcastle Commission complained
of low standards and payment by results was introduced. Apparently, that did
not succeed.'
The Confederation of British Industry said that other countries were in a
similar position, and that employers' needs had changed with 70 per cent of
recruits requiring 'cerebral' skills compared with only 30 per cent in 1950.
A shortage of good science and technology teachers is predicted today by the
independent National Commission on Education. It has found in a survey that
only 10 per cent of students expecting to earn a first-class degree had
applied for jobs in teaching, against 27 per cent in line for a third.

'dignified end'. He said: 'It wouldn't be the Durham Miners Gala without
Durham miners. 'I think the gala will be at an end. It won't be continuing
in its present form.'
At issue is not only the Pounds 20,000 needed to mount the Durham city event
but its identity as a socialist rally well to the left of the present Labour
party leadership.
Past gala speakers include some of Labour's most notable politicians, such
as Keir Hardie, Clement Atlee and Harold Wilson. In earlier years it
staunchly promoted Labour policy. The 1949 gala programme, for example,
urged miners to avoid strikes and 'irresponsible' wage claims to ensure a
Labour victory in the 1950 general election.
But the 1984-85 miners' strike and Labour's shift to the right have strained
that relationship. The party leader has not attended the gala since 1987.
Mr Dennis Skinner, leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover and one of the gala's
most popular and regular speakers, said yesterday: 'I would be talking, if I
were there this year, about drawing up a Labour manifesto to tax the rich.'
In spite of the gala's emotional resonance, it looks improbable that other
unions will provide unconditional funding.
Mr Bob Howard, northern TUC secretary, said: 'If it was to be without
control of the mainstream TUC and Labour movement it's unlikely that would

FT  16 FEB 94 / Teaching science is unpopular career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shortage of good science and technology teachers is predicted today by the
the independent National Commission on Education.
In a survey to be published next month the commission found that only 10 per
cent of students expecting to earn a first-class honours degree had applied
for jobs in teaching, compared with 27 per cent of those in line for
third-class honours.
Teaching was least popular among science students, with only 5 per cent of
engineering and technology students opting for education as a career.
Mr Josh Hillman, the report's author, said: ''Teaching is not popular among
those for whom there is the greatest need within the profession.'
He said the survey, which contacted 1,400 final-year students, raised
serious concerns about the types of students choosing to go into teaching,
although it did not yet indicate a crisis in overall numbers.
Although vacancies for teachers are at an all-time low, educationalists
believe there could be a teacher shortage when the economy emerges from
recession.
Insights into Education and Training will be published on March 2 by the
National Commission on Education.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Housing recovery aids NHS funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in the housing market has enabled health authorities to raise
additional funds by selling unwanted hospital sites to builders.
Barratt, Britain's third-largest housebuilder, and Watford-based Country &amp;
Metropolitan Homes yesterday announced a joint Pounds 100m development plan
at Highlands Hospital at Enfield, north London, which is to close. The
hospital services will be transferred over the next three years to the
nearby Chase Farm hospital.
The land has been bought by the developers from the New River Health
Authority.
Country &amp; Metropolitan said that outline planning permission to construct
about 1,000 homes and community facilities had been 'granted in principle'
by Enfield Borough Council.
As part of the agreement with the council the company has been asked to pay
Pounds 1.8m towards a new junior and infants school.
There are plans to refurbish some of the older Victorian hospital buildings
as private-sector flats and social housing for the Metropolitan Housing
Trust.
A rise in new-house sales last year prompted builders, which had run down
their stock of land during the recession, to resume buying development
sites.
Hospitals which have large tracts of unwanted land, due to a switch in
emphasis in the health service away from hospitals to community-based care,
have been natural targets for house-builders.
Commercial property developers are also expected to show interest in some of
the large city-centre hospitals earmarked for closure in London and
elsewhere.
Housing land prices in southern England, where a number of hospitals are
threatened with closure, have risen by up to a quarter since the beginning
of last year.

FT  16 FEB 94 / 112 jobs lost as Du Pont announces plant closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Du Pont, the US-owned chemicals and energy company, announced a plant
closure yesterday with the loss of 112 jobs, and the sale of another smaller
unit.
The plant is one it bought from ICI in an international asset-swap deal last
July. The company said its decision to close the compounding plant at
Billingham, Cleveland, which makes nylon-based plastics, was due to the
tough economic environment which had severely affected prices and made it
necessary to reduce excess capacity so as to remain competitive.
Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the TGWU general union which
represents most of the workers who lost their jobs, attacked both Du Pont
and ICI and said he felt a sense of betrayal over the closure.
He said there was a developing trend in the European chemicals industry in
which assets were concentrated on a few large producers, who then shut
plants to reduce overcapacity.
The 112 job losses are the second tranche announced by Du Pont in plants
acquired when it took over ICI's European-based nylon business in return for
its own US acrylics business, plus about Pounds 235m.
Three months after the deal was clinched in mid-1993 Du Pont announced it
was shedding 1,100 of the 5,300 ICI employees taken on under the transfer.
All but 150 of the 1,100 jobs lost were in the UK.
Du Pont also announced the sale of the Verton nylon long fibre compound
business yesterday, also at Billingham, to LNP Plastics Nederland BV, a
Dutch-based subsidiary of Kawasaki Steel Corporation.
A condition of the deal, which has yet to be concluded, is that the plant
and its 26 employees must be relocated off ICI's Billingham site. Du Pont
said it hoped the plant would move elsewhere in Teesside.
Du Pont is retaining its three other compounding plants in the Netherlands,
Belgium and Germany.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Training funding attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government funding policies have encouraged a dramatic fall in the number of
training places for the most disadvantaged, including the long-term
unemployed and people with disabilities, according to a study from the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations.
The charity, in a letter to Mr Michael Forsyth, minister of state at the
Department of Employment, has asked for a full-scale review of funding which
it says discriminates against the recruitment of the most disadvantaged on
to government-funded training programmes.
Training and enterprise councils, which administer government training
schemes including the scheme for adults, Training for Work, are being paid
according to the volume of qualifications their trainees attain. This can
encourage them to recruit on to schemes those who are likely to get
qualifications in the shortest period of time.
According to the charity the long-term unemployed made up 50 per cent of
those on Employment Training (now called Training for Work) in January 1990.
This had fallen to 37 per cent in September 1993. Entrants from ethnic
minority groups had fallen from 12 per cent of the total to 11 per cent
while disabled entrants had fallen from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. Cuts of
up to 10 per cent in budgets for Youth Training, the training scheme for
young people, are being forecast by some Tecs as they begin negotiations
with the Department of Employment.
Tecs had been aware of proposed cuts to the budgets of Training for Work but
the cuts in YT were not anticipated.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Heseltine raps engineers and CBI over 'turf battles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has stepped up his
campaign for more effective industrial and trade associations by criticising
the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Confederation of British
Industry for failing to merge their central functions.
Mr Heseltine, in a speech at the federation's biennial dinner in London last
night, said 'turf battles and power struggles' had overwhelmed the two
organisations.
The federation said earlier this year that plans for a merger of the two
organisations' central functions had been abandoned. But it is now
discussing a more limited arrangement that could produce an alliance with
the CBI's National Manufacturing Council in areas where they overlap.
Last year Mr Heseltine said his department wanted to talk to a limited
number of 'lead' associations that would represent wide areas of industry.
Last night he said he had been impressed by the number of trade associations
that had come forward to help address the key issues of Britain's
competitiveness. The DTI had to select the associations that could deliver
the ability to gauge competitiveness.
'We will not talk to those that can't,' he said.
Referring to similar attempts to forge unity in the engineering professions,
Mr Heseltine said Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council,
had 'spent an age' in an as yet unsuccessful quest to create unity from 45
institutions in an initiative to give the professions some clout.

FT  16 FEB 94 / SIB asks if market practice is sharp practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer investment bank SG Warburg outraged institutional investors when
it asked the Stock Exchange to prevent big shareholders driving down the
price of British Telecommunication shares just before it auctioned the
government's final stake in the company.
The Stock Exchange considered the request but backed down after institutions
accused it of helping to create a false market in BT shares.
The dispute illustrates the problems confronting regulators eight years
after the institution of benchmark legislation for the securities industry
and for investor protection.
Since then dramatic changes have overtaken the UK equity markets. There has
been explosive growth in the use of derivative instruments; new techniques
for raising equity finance have been adopted; foreign participants now play
a leading role in market making and new trading systems challenge the
traditional monopoly of the Stock Exchange.
Yesterday the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator,
released a discussion paper asking whether some market practices, while
aiding the profitability of some participants, were undermining the market.
In particular, SIB is asking whether there is enough transparency of
transaction for investors to know whether they are paying the right price
for shares. It also asks whether there is enough transparency for derivative
instruments based on those shares to reflect their value accurately.
The paper asks whether some of the exchange's potential competitors, such as
Tradepoint, benefit from the centralised market which it creates and ought
to be required to contribute to its costs.
Mr John Kemp-Welch, who will become chairman of the Stock Exchange in July,
has identified such competition as the single greatest challenge facing the
exchange.
SIB's paper asks whether the sort of short selling that institutional
investors engaged in before the BT3 offering is a form of market
manipulation and whether measures should be introduced to limit the practice
or make it more visible.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB's chairman, acknowledges that significant commercial
interests are at stake. For instance, marketmakers are not required to
disclose the prices at which they agree to buy and sell large blocks of
shares to each other via inter-dealer brokers' screens, to which access is
restricted.
Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at the London
Financial Futures Exchange, said SIB's suggestion that those screens should
no longer be restricted 'is the most important part of the SIB report'.
He said Liffe had pressed the Stock Exchange in recent months for access to
those prices. While the number of transactions made through the inter-dealer
brokers' screens was not great, the value was significant. Without access to
those prices, which tended to be inside the prices quoted on the exchange's
own Topic screen, derivatives could not accurately reflect the cash markets
they were intended to mimic.
Another Stock Exchange rule which allows marketmakers to obscure the true
value of securities is one which allows a 90-minute delay before the
publication of any transaction in any stock which is three times its 'normal
market size'.
Marketmakers have argued that they should be allowed to hide the prices for
the largest share purchases they undertake until they have reduced their
risk either by selling the shares to a third party or through the use of
derivatives.

FT  16 FEB 94 / MPs put financial regulation under the microscope: Roland
Rudd and David Wighton on the parliamentary probe into a system that is
supposed to protect investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first detailed parliamentary scrutiny of the regulation of financial
services since the establishment eight years ago of the Financial Services
Act begins today.
Against a background of controversy over the mis-selling of personal
pensions and home-income plans, MPs from the all-party Commons Treasury and
civil service committee believe the timing of their inquiry could not be
better.
During the next five months the committee will take evidence from the
existing self-regulating organisations, the fledgling Personal Investment
Authority, the Securities and Investments Board, and Treasury ministers
before compiling a report to be published before the summer recess.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Conservative member of the committee, says the MPs
involved begin the investigation with different, but strongly held
prejudices. 'Most of the Labour members believe that a good look at the
regulatory system will uncover the rottenness of the capitalist system.'
While not sharing such sentiments Mr Budgen, a rightwinger, will be probing
the witnesses to see whether existing regulations serve the market.
Mr John Watts, the Conservative chairman, has identified five main questions
that his committee will try to answer.
To what extent is self-regulation working? The decision of three leading
companies to oppose plans for the PIA, which is intended to act as the
self-regulating organisation for the retail financial sector, has infuriated
ministers.
Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life which has
withdrawn its support from the PIA, will argue that the present regulatory
structure was set up to accommodate self-regulation that has 'in practice
faded out of existence'. Mr Stretton, who is giving evidence to the
committee on March 9, says: 'I fear that in the short term the course of
regulation is set and that the PIA will come about. But I very much hope
that the committee will take the view that regulation has not reached its
long-term resting place.'
What is the cost of regulation? Mr Neil Hamilton, the DTI minister
responsible for de-regulation, has questioned whether the Financial Services
Act had not given rise to too much costly red tape.
For many Tory members this goes to the heart of the problem of trying to
roll back the boundaries of regulation without damaging the existing
regulatory structure.
Is it still appropriate for Lloyd's and the insurance industry to be
regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry? The Treasury has kept its
distance from this role for two main reasons.
First, the department did not want to 'take on more than it could chew', as
one official put it. Second, it has never liked the concept of being
directly responsible for regulation of an industry.
There is a strong body of opinion among some members of the committee that
the Treasury should take over responsibility for all regulation. For that
reason the MPs also question the Department of Social Security's
responsibility for pensions.
How will regulation on the Continent affect British consumers? Will
companies try to register in Luxembourg, for example, which has less
strenuous regulations than Britain, only to operate in the UK? Mr Watts says
his committee is concerned that there is no 'regulation arbitrage' in the
future.
Is the government co-ordinating regulation efficiently? The Home Income
Support Group, which is giving evidence today, has voiced its concern to Mr
Watts that there was no lead regulatory co-ordinator to turn to when people
lost out on investments.
Investment-linked home-income schemes were devised in the late 1980s as a
way for (mostly elderly) investors to unlock capital in their homes. Many of
the schemes were sold as 'safe' investments, with people unaware of the
risks.
'For all the Treasury's reluctance', says one senior member of the
committee, 'it would be surprising if it was not forced to take on an even
bigger regulatory role following our investigation.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / BT to test video supply system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications will officially confirm today that it is pushing
ahead with trials of its new video-on-demand system using ordinary telephone
lines.
BT will test the system, which sends television pictures down telephone
lines, in about 100 homes in Essex this spring.
Programmes are being provided for the experiment by organisations including
the BBC, London Weekend Television, retail group Kingfisher, and Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times.
Video-on-demand allows consumers to order programmes and films of their
choice from a central database.
If the spring experiment goes well BT will move to the next stage towards
the end of this year - a commercial experiment around Colchester, Essex,
which could involve as many as a quarter of a million homes.
The Advertising Standards Authority will today uphold a complaint by BT
about claims by its rival Mercury.
BT complained about two newspaper advertisements in which Mercury compared
call charges in 1982 and 1993.
One stated that by 1993 Mercury had become 'best known for driving down the
cost of everybody's long-distance and international calls by an average of
40 per cent'.
BT said the advertisement failed to acknowledge that other factors, such as
tighter government controls over BT's prices and changes in the regulation
of international calls, had played a part in the reduction of charges.
The ASA said Mercury 'went too far in implying that Mercury was the sole
reason for the reduction in BT's call charges'.

<TEXT>
The BBC is planning to take its World Service Television News and
Information channel into the US for the first time in what will be seen as a
further challenge to Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network.
Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director general, said yesterday the corporation
hoped to launch the service, already available in more than 140 countries,
on US cable networks either late this year or early next.
Apart from news, the 24-hours a day channel would carry documentaries and
other factual programmes.
'This service would report international news and current affairs from an
international perspective in a way that complements the existing US
services,' Mr Phillis told the FT Cable and Satellite conference in London.
He said that the BBC hoped to launch its news and information channel in
Europe before the end of this year to complement the existing European
entertainment service.
He also said the BBC was: close to finalising an agreement to launch an Arab
language version of the BBC's news and information channel.

aggressive commercial policy.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Rail companies to pay Pounds 2.2bn for track use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The private rail companies which take over the British Rail passenger
operations from next year can expect to pay about Pounds 2.2bn a year in
charges for the right to run their trains on the national rail network, the
government announced yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said these charges were 50 per cent
higher than the sums which BR charged in its own accounts, although BR did
not take into account items such as depreciation and a reasonable rate of
return.
The figures have been calculated on the assumption that Railtrack, the
company which will own and maintain rail track and signalling, will make a
5.6 per cent return on its assets, which have been valued at Pounds 6.5bn.
The Treasury requires the rate of return to rise to 8 per cent within four
years.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, said this return would be achieved by
improved efficiency and not by higher fares.
He added that higher track charges would not lead to any increase in fares,
reduction in services or the level of investment, currently Pounds 400m to
Pounds 500m a year, because they would be compensated for by an increase in
the public subsidy paid to the railway operators. The subsidy will rise from
Pounds 930m to Pounds 1.6bn. This would not lead to any increase in the
external financing limit of Pounds 1.26bn, Mr MacGregor said.
Increased corporation tax payments from Railtrack and BR and repayments of
government loans are to balance out the higher payments.
The level of track charges is a crucial element in the calculation that
potential bidders for rail franchises will make when assessing whether to
make a bid and the level of their bids.
Mr MacGregor said in answer to a parliamentary question: 'The new
arrangements establish for the first time the real cost of providing railway
infrastructure. Charges will be set in a transparent and commercially
realistic manner.'
But Labour yesterday warned that some services could be cut. Mr Brian
Wilson, opposition transport spokesman, said: 'What is the point of
massively hiking the track charges if the only result is that subsidy has to
be raised by a similar amount?'
Previously track costs could not be clearly identified from BR's accounts. A
precise calculation of costs based on the use of stations and electricity
and wear and tear of different services has made detailed figures possible.
Refinements in the figures will be made in the coming months, taking into
account possible changes in the levels of service provided by private rail
operators.

The report by Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says that in 1992-93 430
people died as a result of work-related accidents. Accidents cost industry
and individuals Pounds 10bn a year.
The NAO suggested that 132 of 331 health and safety assessments were still
incomplete when the report was researched.

<TEXT>
About 300 people marched in support of striking lecturers at City of Bath
College yesterday in a dispute over new working conditions.
Nearly 50 academic staff, who have refused to sign new contracts, started a
two-day strike on Monday. The dispute has the backing of Natfhe, the
lecturers' union. More strikes are planned for Friday and next Monday and
Tuesday.
The strike action is a sharp escalation of the contracts row between Natfhe
and college principals. The college has tried to introduce new contracts
since colleges were removed from local authority control last April.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Labour attacks BAe over sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace came under fire at Westminster yesterday with more than 70
Labour MPs - including several frontbench spokesmen - expressing concern
about the company's decision to pay Pounds 3.2m to its retiring chairman.
The MPs - headed by Mr Derek Fatchett, a frontbench trade and industry
spokesman - used a parliamentary early day motion to claim that the
company's handling of the sale of Rover to BMW of Germany raised 'issues of
public concern'.
The motion said: 'That this House expresses its concern at the business
practices of British Aerospace which, having recently sold Rover to BMW, and
having made nearly 2,000 aerospace workers redundant in the last few weeks,
has now agreed to pay Pounds 3.2m to John Cahill, its retiring chairman and
United Kingdom tax exile, for two years' work; feels that these practices
raise issues of public concern; and condemns the prime minister for refusing
to answer questions about British Aerospace.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / BT set for trials of video scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom will officially confirm for the first time today that it is
pushing ahead with trials of its new video-on-demand system using ordinary
telephone lines.
BT will test the system which sends television pictures down telephone lines
to around 100 homes in Essex this spring.
Programmes are being provided for the experiment from a group of
organisations including the BBC, London Weekend Television, Kingfisher, the
retail group and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Video-on-demand allows consumers to order programmes and films of their
choice from a central database. The extension of the system to the 24m homes
on BT's national telephone network would involve an investment of several
billion pounds.
If the spring experiment goes well BT will move to the next stage towards
the end of this year - a commercial experiment in the Colchester, Essex,
which could involve up to a quarter of a million homes.
At the same time BT plans to test video-on-demand with subscribers to
Westminster Cable, the telephone group's central London cable television
franchise.
The aim of the two experiments is to see whether there is a market for the
service before deciding on a national launch sometime next year.
The launch will probably be phased in over three or four years.
BT is confident after exploratory talks with most of the Hollywood studios
that it will be able to get access to the latest films. It hopes that the
studios will make films available for video-on-demand at the same time as
they become available in video shops.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Minister faces probe on pension advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons social security committee is to question Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, on April 27 about the quality of advice offered
to people to take out personal pensions, David Owen writes.
The committee's questions will focus on the advice given to people who
transferred out of the state earnings related pension scheme, or Serps.
MPs on the committee argue that figures which show that a considerable
number of these people are now unemployed or on low incomes give grounds for
believing the advice they were offered was inadequate.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Car part groups seek know-how from Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing directors, team leaders and production workers from a dozen UK
motor component suppliers are to spend time in Japanese factories as part of
an initiative by the Department of Trade and Industry - backed by Nissan,
Toyota and Honda - to boost the competitiveness of the UK industry.
The aim of the two-year 'Learning from Japan' initiative, which is being
backed by Rover Group, Unipart Industries and the Inchcape group, is to
upgrade the quality of nearly 10,000 smaller component-makers in the UK.
Known as second- or third-tier suppliers, their products are built into the
more complex components systems supplied directly to the carmakers'
production lines by the few hundred first-tier component-makers such as GKN
and Lucas.
Together, components-makers form one of the biggest elements in the UK's
manufacturing economy, with turnover estimated at Pounds 14.7bn a year,
nearly 150,000 employees and Pounds 3bn in direct exports.
Improving the smaller companies' competitiveness is seen throughout the
industry as a vital step if the current revival of the UK-based - if no
longer UK-owned - motor industry is to be sustained.
A warning that it is already being put at risk by hundreds of small
suppliers failing to improve quality and productivity standards was given
recently by Prof Dan Jones, the motor industry academic who has been
involved in benchmarking studies between the Japanese and UK components
industries.
Prof Jones and other leading industry figures such as Mr George Simpson,
chairman of Rover Group who is shortly to take over as chief executive of
Lucas Industries, say that many of the biggest first-tier component-makers
have already learned from the standard-setting Japanese industry. According
to Mr Simpson, unless the big companies pass on these lessons many of the
smaller companies could disappear.
A benchmarking exercise comparing Japanese and UK suppliers undertaken by
Andersen Consulting, Cardiff Business School and Cambridge University 18
months ago found a two-to-one gap in productivity and a 100-to-one gap in
quality performance between Japanese and British suppliers, with only
Unipart matching Japanese suppliers on quality.
Andersen is also a partner in the DTI initiative. It has helped the
participating companies identify weak performance areas and after the
Japanese visits will help them develop improvement programmes.
The 12 companies taking part in the initiative range from small
pressings-makers such as Hockley-based Frederick Woolley to
plastics-moulders such as the Stadium group.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Mercury rapped for advert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telephone price wars will take a new twist today as the Advertising
Standards Authority upholds a complaint by British Telecommunications about
Mercury claims.
BT complained about two newspaper advertisements in which Mercury compared
call charges in 1982 and 1993.
One stated that by 1993 Mercury had become 'best known for driving down the
cost of everybody's long distance and international calls by an average of
40 per cent'.
BT said the advertisement failed to acknowledge that other factors, such as
tighter government controls over BT's prices and changes in the regulation
of international calls, had played a part in the reduction of charges.
Mercury said only one ruling in 1991 by Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, concerning international calls, had directly affected BT's
charges.
The ASA said Mercury 'went too far in implying that Mercury was the sole
reason for the reduction in BT's call charges'.
The authority was happy, however, with the wording of another Mercury
advertisement which stated that the company 'is known by . . . businesses .
. . as the one who helped them reduce their phone bills'.
Mercury was also criticised by the ASA for failing to state clearly that the
price comparisons had been adjusted for inflation. Beecham Group has been
told by the ASA to state the sugar content of Ribena Sugar Free drink in
future advertisements. The authority upheld A complaint by the pressure
group Action and Information on Sugars about a poster for the drink which
read: 'Sugar Free. Out Now.'
Beecham argued that after dilution as directed, the product contained 0.476g
of sugar per 100ml, which counted as 'sugar-free' under a draft EC
directive.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Tories resist probe into auditing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, last night resisted
Labour demands for an inquiry into the auditing of companies.
Arguing against giving auditors a wider role in detecting fraud, he insisted
in a Commons debate that it would be wrong to turn them into 'snoopers and
narks'.
Mr Nelson stressed the importance of not undermining the relationship
between auditors and their clients, and of avoiding overlapping of the
responsibilities of auditors and the regulatory bodies in the financial
services sector.
MPs approved new regulations arising from the Bingham report on the events
leading to the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which
impose a statutory duty on auditors to report relevant information to the
Bank of England and the regulatory authorities for building societies and
the insurance industry.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Midland backs down over cheque clearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank, one of the big four UK clearing banks, yesterday announced
that it would cut the time for processing customers' cheques and standing
orders.
Its statement came a day after Labour stepped up its attack on the high
street banks for delays in crediting customers' accounts.
Labour said that banks were making Pounds 300m a year from delays in
clearing customers' cheques and almost Pounds 40m a year from time spent
processing standing orders.
Midland's move increases pressure on Lloyds and National Westminster banks
to follow suit. This could add to a longer-term shift towards more explicit
charges to customers for particular services, as the scope for 'implicit
charges' is reduced.
Both banks said that the clearing cycle should be seen as part of the
competitive package of services being offered to customers.
At present, Barclays bank is the only UK clearer to pay interest on retail
deposits three days after they are made.
Midland also said that from mid-1995 it would give its personal customers 14
days' advance notice of money to be deducted from their accounts as charges
and interest.
The requirement to introduce pre-notification of charges was part of the
revised code of banking practice that was published last week. Subscribers
have until the end of 1996 to introduce pre-notification.
Midland added that from March 28 any standing order between customers at
different branches would be given value on the same day as the bank received
it.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said Midland's
announcement vindicated his campaign 'to get banks to treat customers more
fairly'. At the same time he urged it to give back to customers what he
described as its 'ill-gotten gains'.
He said: 'I want to know what has changed from the situation a fortnight
ago, when the bank claimed that they had no need to amend their rules.'
Mr Griffiths called for an inquiry by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and
for the two other UK clearers to act in a similar way to Barclays and
Midland.
Bankers do not expect the speeding up of the clearing process to produce
significant gains for individuals.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Labour renews tax assault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday under increasing pressure to answer another
sensitive parliamentary question from Labour on the impact of the tax
increases announced in the last Budget.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, yesterday raised the issue of
the written question in the Commons, demanding that ministers 'come clean'
and reveal how much tax a typical family will pay in the financial year
1995-96.
The question was tabled three weeks ago by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief
secretary to the Treasury. Labour says the government is unwilling to drop a
political bombshell by answering the question.
Mrs Beckett told MPs that Mr Major's list of issues covered by the Back to
Basics campaign 'did not include the standard of telling the truth about
tax'.
She said: 'We know the government has the figures and the people of Britain
will have to pay that extra tax.'
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons who was deputising while Mr Major
is in Moscow, said that he and the prime minister would emphasise 'the
contribution which our tax policies are making to the economic strength and
improved standards of living of this country'.
Last month a question tabled by Ms Harman on the effect of the 1994-95 tax
increases on a typical family caused a storm of protest in both parliament
and the press.
The government revealed that a typical family would pay Pounds 12.50 a week
more in both direct and indirect taxation in 1994-95 as a result of the
Budget. It was also revealed that the typical family would pay 35 per cent
of gross income in taxation that year.
Labour believes that the 1995-96 figures will show a further increase in
payments of a typical family on those for the next financial year.

Manufacturing wage settlements edged up to 2.6 per cent for the three months
to January, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, Robert
Taylor writes.
This was a slight rise on the 2.2 per cent recorded for the three months to
December but lower than the 2.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier.
The CBI said the range of settlements continued to be wide. As many as 41.9
per cent of deals in manufacturing were worth 2.5 per cent or less, and just
8.1 per cent awarded pay rises of more than 4.5 per cent.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Supporting role for Mr Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every prime minister needs a Willie, the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher once
said in a comment that was as true as it was infelicitous. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, should pay heed to his predecessor's advice.
Lady Thatcher was referring to the pivotal role played by Lord Whitelaw
during her first two terms in Downing Street. As home secretary and
subsequently leader of the House of Lords and deputy prime minister, Lord
Whitelaw provided the countervailing common sense to her ideological drive.
His qualities have been well documented. In her memoirs Lady Thatcher
recounts that 'he could often sense my mood even before I had realised it
myself'.
More importantly he combined loyalty with acute political instincts. Lord
Whitelaw was the man who could tell Lady Thatcher when to stop.
In her account of the Downing Street years, however, she omits to say that
it was after his enforced departure through ill health in December 1987 that
her administration fell victim to the hubris which contributed to its
demise.
The later rows with her chancellor over the exchange rate, her unflinching
faith in the poll tax and the cabinet battles over Europe could all be
attributed in part to the absence of a steadying hand on the tiller.
Lord Whitelaw still has an influence. His opposition earlier this month to
some of the key provisions of the police bill forced an immediate government
retreat.
More importantly he is consulted by the Tory party's men in grey suits on
the state of the government and prospects for Mr Major's premiership.
Mr Major consults him less than he should. Lord Whitelaw's voice will be the
one to listen to most carefully if the results of the local and European
elections are as bad as many Tory MPs now fear.
The prime minister cannot re-engage Lord Whitelaw even though his wisdom
could prove a welcome addition to a cabinet hardly overflowing with
intellect and political instinct.
But Mr Major can do the next best thing. Without waiting for his planned
summer reshuffle, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, could be given the
additional title of deputy prime minister.
The title has no formal place in Britain's constitution, but it carries a
powerful message about relative authority of those in the cabinet.
By giving Mr Hurd power to act on his authority, Mr Major might considerably
strengthen his own embattled position.
The political advantages are obvious. The foreign secretary is a safe pair
of hands. He carries weight with all sections of the party. Like Lord
Whitelaw before, he was defeated by the incumbent of Number 10 in a
leadership election.
But his standing has risen rather than fallen in the intervening period.
In a cabinet of tacticians, Mr Hurd stands out as one of the few
strategists. As foreign secretary he spends much of his time fire-fighting.
But he has a concept of conservatism which stretches beyond tomorrow's
headlines.
The praise should not be overdone. Mr Hurd, travelling with the prime
minister in Moscow yesterday, could not fail to be reminded during talks at
the Kremlin of the mistakes he has made over Bosnia. More generally,
Britain's foreign policy is in some disarray. Tensions with Washington and
Tory animosity towards Brussels has left the government straddling an
awkward divide.
Mr Hurd is also a natural toff in a party led by a self-proclaimed champion
of meritocracy. But his brand of Toryism is close to the prime minister's.
He is an advocate of reform rather than revolution, the community as well as
the individual, of Europeanism rather than isolationism. He has the
rhetorical talents to give form to such concepts.
Mr Major might raise objections to promoting him, however. As foreign
secretary, Mr Hurd spends too much time travelling the globe to get to grips
with the squabbling in the cabinet over domestic policy. Promoting him now
might also be misunderstood. Mr Hurd would again be a principal contender
for the leadership if Mr Major were to fall.
But the prime minister is in trouble. For all his determination to ride out
the expected summer storms he needs to restore control over his cabinet, his
government and his party. In short, Mr Major needs a Douggie.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Seeboard cuts business prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeboard, the electricity distributor for south-east England, will be
cutting power prices for business customers by 0.1p a kilowatt hour from
April 1.
The move follows last week's agreement between the two large power
generators and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to
restrain prices in the pool, the wholesale market for electricity.
Seeboard's cut will apply to consumers of more than 100 kwh a year who have
signed long-term supply contracts. Seeboard will also be offering the lower
price to other potential customers in that bracket, all of whom will be free
to shop around for electricity from April 1.
Mr Stephen Gutteridge, the company's managing director of supply, said last
night that Seeboard was the first company to make this cut. He said Seeboard
wanted to demonstrate its loyalty to existing customers and sharpen its
ability to compete for the large segment of the market that had not yet
signed up for supply contracts.
Last week's agreement, which includes a commitment by National Power and
PowerGen to sell off several power stations, is supposed to reduce pool
prices by up to 7 per cent. Mr Gutteridge said this was expected to lead to
an average cut of 0.1p per kwh, and that Seeboard was passing on the full
price reduction.
Seeboard had already received several offers from generators to supply it
with electricity at the lower price.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Small traders dominate insolvencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses account for more than four-fifths of personal insolvencies,
says a survey by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading
trade body.
The self-employed, partners and sole traders comprised 81 per cent of
insolvencies against individuals, while the propor-tion who are unemployed
has fallen in recent years to less than 6 per cent of the total.
The figures are based on a survey of 1,217 insolvency cases handled by 120
members of the society during the period January to June last year.
They highlight the trends in bankruptcies and individual voluntary
arrangements (IVAs) reached between people and their creditors, which were
introduced under the 1986 insolvency act and are becoming increasingly
popular.
These accounted for one-third of personal insolvencies, showing the
procedure was gradually replacing the more stigmatised process of
bankruptcy.
More than three-quarters of insolvencies were attributed primarily to
business factors and 23 per cent to domestic reasons.
In domestic insolvencies, consumer credit has declined as the principal
reason from 80 per cent in 1991 to 54 per cent last year.
The single largest cause, at nearly 30 per cent, was guarantee liabilities -
the outstanding obligations normally imposed by banks on people who run
businesses.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Output fall sparks fears for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disappointing decline in manufacturing output in December yesterday raised
fears about the strength of the UK recovery.
Manufacturing output dropped 0.5 per cent between November and December
while industrial production as a whole fell 0.6 per cent, according to the
Central Statistical Office.
Both figures were much lower than analysts' forecasts. The CSO reduced its
estimate of the trend of annual growth in manufacturing output from 1.5 per
cent to 1 per cent.
However, the Treasury pointed out that the quarterly figures showed a
continuing upward trend.
Manufacturing output in the fourth quarter of last year was 0.5 per cent
higher than in the third quarter and 2.2 per cent higher than in the same
period a year earlier.
Industrial production was stronger than manufacturing output largely due to
the oil and gas industry.
UK oil and gas output reached a record level in December, and was 23.5 per
cent higher in the fourth quarter than in the last three months of 1992.
In the fourth quarter, industrial production was 1.3 per cent higher than in
the previous three months and 3.5 per cent higher than in the same period in
1992.
Over 1993 as a whole, industrial production was 2.7 per cent higher than in
1992, while manufacturing output rose 1.9 per cent.
A clearer picture of the strength of the recovery should be available today,
with the publication of statistics on unemployment, average earnings, retail
sales and the retail prices index.
Economists, however, also spotted some disturbing trends in the industrial
production figures. 'The breakdown of the data is unhelpful for the
government' said Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities. 'In the last
quarter, consumer goods production was up 1.6 per cent, while the output of
investment goods fell 1.5 per cent.'
The CSO blamed a number of factors for the December decline. Tobacco
production fell back after a one-off jump in November ahead of the Budget;
the iron and steel industries were affected by more holidays than normal;
computer production dropped back from higher levels earlier in the year; and
aerospace production continued to decline.
Electricity, gas and water output also fell back in December. This was
because the weather was slightly milder than normal but cold conditions in
October and November meant that, for the fourth quarter as a whole, the
sector's output rose by 1.7 per cent.
Mr David Coleman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said: 'The list
of excuses is suspiciously long and seasonal distortions should be adjusted
for. It is worrying that the latest fall in output was spread among several
industries.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / Merger activity highest for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mergers and acquisitions among UK companies have increased for the first
time in two years, according to figures published yesterday that bolster
government attempts to focus on economic recovery.
In the last quarter of 1993, companies spent a total of Pounds 2.7bn on
domestic takeovers compared with Pounds 1.2bn in the third quarter, the
Central Statistical Office said.
The increase pushed the annual value of mergers and acquisitions up to
Pounds 6.8bn, a 17 per cent rise over 1992.
Welcoming the signs of higher corporate activity, the Confederation of
British Industry said: 'This is a reflection of the growing confidence in
the recovery.'
The CSO said 160 deals were completed in the quarter. That figure was 51 per
cent ahead of the same period in 1992, reversing the downward trend for the
first time since the spring of 1991.
Mr Robert Hay, the CSO statistician who compiled the figures, added:
'Companies have got a bit more money to spend. Independent companies, in
particular, have proved very attractive for acquisitions.'
Relief at the figures was tempered, however, by the CSO's admission that
just three deals accounted for 62 per cent of the total spending on
takeovers in the last quarter.
Most of the increase resulted from the Pounds 800m acquisition of the Pillar
industrial businesses of RTZ, the mining company, by MB-Caradon, the
building products and security printing group. Scottish and Newcastle, the
brewing group, also made a substantial contribution to the total after
agreeing to pay Grand Metropolitan Pounds 622m for its Chef and Brewer pubs
subsidiary.
Whitbread, meanwhile, paid Pounds 260m for a 51 per cent stake in Whitbread
Investment Company, an associate group set up to protect regional brewers
from takeover.
However, deals worth less than Pounds 1m accounted for most of the
transactions that took place.
More than 200 small companies were either bought outright or merged into
larger operations last year, of which 69 changed hands in the last quarter -
the highest turnover for three years.
The CSO said acquisitive companies funded such deals mostly from existing
reserves, though they resorted to rights issues in 13 per cent of the
takeovers.

The world's four biggest traders - the US, the European Union, Japan and
Canada - plan to submit their final tariff schedules to Gatt within the next
few days, effectively concluding their market access negotiations under the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
The formal deadline for submission of schedules was yesterday. However,
trade officials said a few days' delay would not affect the timetable for
checking and printing schedules before the Uruguay Round package of trade
accords is signed in Marrakesh in April.
Hopes that Japan would agree to zero tariffs on wood and white spirits were
dashed during last week's meeting in Washington between President Bill
Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister. The US, EU and
Canada have withdrawn their offers to scrap tariffs on these items.
Tokyo has agreed to cut wood tariffs, now as high as 20 per cent, to about 6
per cent and copper tariffs will be halved to around 3 per cent.

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: WTO role 'crucial in bilateral disputes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, yesterday said a new World
Trade Organisation would have to play a critical role in cushioning
multilateral trade from the debilitating effects of bilateral trade
disputes.
Mr Sutherland, who ends a brief but high-profile visit to South Africa
today, said the trade wrangle between the US and Japan 'must not be allowed
to have any impact on the Uruguay Round' and on the talks still to take
place before ministers sign the accord in Marrakesh in April.
Mr Sutherland met President F W de Klerk yesterday before a meeting with the
National Economic Forum - the tripartite representation of government,
business and labour, - where he discussed future South African trade policy.
Mr Sutherland meets representatives from the private sector, in Cape Town,
the centre of the textile industry, today before leaving the country.
Mr Sutherland said that South Africa's revised Gatt offer left the country
with particular difficulties in the high tariff protection afforded to its
textile and motor manufacturing industries.
Central to the WTO, which he hoped would be established by January next
year, would be the graduated arbitration, mediation and settlement of
bilateral disputes. Binding decisions would be open to appeal but reversible
only if consensus was achieved among the parties involved.
The establishment of the WTO would have to go hand in hand with increased
co-operation with the World Bank and IMF. Mr Sutherland said he had held
talks last week with Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, to this
end.
The overriding priority of 'the Brettons Woods institutions' had to be
attention to the position of sub-Saharan Africa. The success of the Uruguay
Round was no panacea for the sub-continent, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Flows of foreign direct investment, which have faltered in recent years,
will pick up momentum over the course of the decade but are unlikely to
match the explosive growth of the 1980s, according to a United Nations study
published this week.*
Foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries is expected to
grow considerably faster than flows into industrialised nations, which now
account for some four-fifths of total global flows of Dollars 200bn (Pounds
136bn) a year. The study, by the UN Conference on Trade and Development,
bases its predictions on what it claims is the first-ever forecasting model
for FDI flows.
Using three different economic scenarios, the study projects increases in
FDI flows of 11-12 per cent a year for Asia in the first half of the 1990s,
down from 21 per cent a year in the second half of the 1980s. For Latin
America FDI growth is projected at 12-18 per cent a year between 1989 and
1995, against 16 per cent in the late 1980s.
For Africa the projected range is 6-16 per cent, well above the 4 per cent
annual growth notched up in the late 1980s but starting from a very low base
of Dollars 2bn a year or less. FDI flows into the developed world, which
grew by 22 per cent a year between 1984 and 1988, are expected to slow to
8-10 per cent a year in 1989-95.

FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US seeks to dog Chinese copycats - Tony
Walker on moves to halt copyright infringements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, passes through the ornate portals of
China's leadership compound in Beijing next month, he will have more on his
mind than simply paying respects to senior Chinese officials.
Ostensibly, Mr Gates will be in the Chinese capital to meet Microsoft
executives and local distributors, but he is certain to use the occasion to
complain about the rampant pirating of his company's products in potentially
the world's largest software market.
Industry representatives in Beijing estimate that Chinese software pirates
are costing US manufacturers, notably Microsoft, about Dollars 500m (Pounds
342m) a year in lost revenues.
Software piracy is at the top of the list of intellectual property rights
infringements that are preoccupying US trade officials in their testy
relationship with their Chinese counterparts.
Indeed, it may well become an issue in Washington's annual wrangle with
Beijing over the continuation of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status. China's attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade may also be affected.
Later this month in Beijing, when officials from the office of the US Trade
Representative conduct their third session since October with Chinese
counterparts on the issue of intellectual property rights, discussions are
likely to have a sharper focus.
This is because the US Trade Representative is obliged by April to recommend
whether to place China on a priority list of foreign countries infringing
copyright covenants, and thus begin the six-months countdown to the
imposition of trade sanctions under section 301 of the US Trade Act.
These semi-regular meetings have not been without their theatrical moments.
To reinforce their point, US officials have gone to the streets of the
capital, bought boxes full of counterfeit items such as CDs and American
brand-name clothing and dumped them on the table in front of their startled
Chinese counterparts.
Among steps being sought by US representatives is more vigorous Chinese
customs co-operation to curtail either the export or import of pirated
goods.
US officials note that US Customs ranks China first on the list of countries
exporting counterfeit items to the US market. Some Dollars 120m worth were
seized in 1992.
Chinese intellectual property rights abuses tend to run the gamut of
transgressions against trademarks, patents and copyright in spite of Beijing
having become a signatory recently to a range of international conventions,
including the Geneva (Phonograms) Convention, the Berne Convention for
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright
Convention.
China and the US also initialled an intellectual property rights memorandum
of understanding in January 1992. This document, with its safeguards
provisions against abuses, is the basis of ongoing official discussions.
Apart from software piracy, the recording industry is the other big loser in
a fast growing China consumer market. According to the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the representative body for
producers of records, cassettes and CDs, 'piracy is becoming rampant . . .
as an entrepreneurial spirit develops alongside economic reforms'.
The IFPI estimates that 15 pirate CD plants are operating in China,
including eight in southern Guangdong province, with a total production
capacity of more than 50m units a year. This compares with estimated
domestic demand for legitimately produced CDs of just 3m units in 1993.
Chinese officials, recognising perhaps that pirating has got out of hand,
have begun to emphasise steps they have been taking to crack down on
intellectual property rights infringements, including the establishment of
special courts to deal with the problem.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported this week that a
Taiwanese had been successfully prosecuted before a Shanghai court for
illegally manufacturing CDs. The paper accused the man of 'damaging China's
reputation' and said the case had 'brought to light the illegal
proliferation of laser CD production in China'.
Ms Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation,
insisted at a recent press briefing that the authorities were doing all they
could to counter such abuses, but China was a 'large country' and
enforcement was not easy.
Western lawyers in Beijing say that China appears more sincere in its
efforts to deal with infringements, but a big problem was the huge gap
between the enactment of regulations and their implementation.
'Western companies seeking redress before the courts are only going to have
limited success. It's such a vast problem that it's really difficult to get
enforcement,' said one.
Lawyers tend to advise clients to use 'administrative means', such as
appeals to the authorities, to press their concerns. Recourse to the courts,
which lack sophistication in dealing with anything but the simplest cases,
should be a last resort.

Mitsubishi Petrochemicals, Japan's largest plastics manufacturer, yesterday
announced its first investment in south-east Asia. The company is forming a
joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell to build a Y51bn (Pounds 324.8m)
petrochemicals plant in Singapore.
The complex, located at the Seraya island petrochemicals complex, will have
an annual capacity of 310,000 tonnes of styrene monomer and 140,000 tonnes
of propylene oxide. It will be Asia's largest styrene monomer plant.
The move is the latest in a rush of foreign investments by Japanese
chemicals companies. They hope to reduce their dependency on the domestic
market. Mitsubishi said the rapid growth of the south-east Asian market and
the recent appreciation of the yen had made it imperative to secure an
overseas production base.
Shell will control 70 per cent of the joint venture, to be called Seraya
Chemicals Singapore. Mitsubishi will control the remaining 30 per cent. The
plant, which should be operational during the second half of 1997, will take
its ethylene feedstock from the Singapore Petrochemical Complex operated by
Shell and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan.
East Asian styrene demand is expected to grow on average 7.8 per cent a year
between 1992 and the end of the decade, according to Chem Systems, the
specialist market research company.
Japan's petrochemicals industry is struggling with a collapse in domestic
demand, massive over-capacity and falling prices. The industry's 12 largest
manufacturers of ethylene, the basic building block of petrochemicals, are
expected to report combined losses during 1993 of Y51.6bn, according to
analysts.
A collapse in the demand for plastics from the automotive, construction and
electronics industry has hit the industry hard. The ministry of
international trade and industry estimates domestic demand for ethylene fell
8 per cent last year to 2.7m tonnes.

FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: BCCI audit doubts go back to 1979
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principal auditor to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
raised serious concerns about the bank's operations more than 12 years
before it was closed by regulators in July 1991.
Whinney Murray Ernst &amp; Ernst, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, the
international accountancy network, wrote to Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, founder of
the bank, in 1979 demanding that it be allowed to audit more companies
within the group.
It also expressed worries about the failure to be able to obtain independent
audit confirmation for funds deposited by and with companies within the BCCI
group.
A three-page letter shows that the firm said it would refuse to continue as
auditor unless it took 'complete audit responsibility' for several related
companies audited by other firms.
These included BCCI (Overseas), CFC, ICIC (Overseas) and associated
companies in the Cayman Islands, through which many of the manipulation of
accounts took place.
It also demanded to become auditor to Kuwait International Finance and - by
1980 - to BCP of Switzerland, two of the principal conduits through which it
has since emerged that funds misappropriated by the bank were channelled.
The firm did not become auditor to most of these concerns, but agreed to
remain auditor until 1986, when it again demanded that it become sole
worldwide auditor. At this point BCCI appointed Price Waterhouse to take on
the role.
The letter was written on April 11 1979 to Mr Abedi as president of BCCI
Holdings in Luxembourg from Mr Alan Middleton, a partner with Whinney Murray
who was hired some years later by BCCI.
It said it had been denied access to the reports of the group's internal
audit department and complained of the need for consultation earlier during
its annual audit.
The firm said it was giving 'serious consideration' to opening its own
offices in Grand Cayman and would 'definitely proceed' if Mr Abedi
reappointed it.
It added that it was willing to be reappointed on the terms given and 'on
the assumption that the fee on which we agree represents a fair reward for
our services'.
It says using a single firm should stabilise or reduce the total audit
costs.
Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday that he
knew about the letter and that the firm's concerns were met. He said BCCI
persuaded the firm that it was already using reputable auditors for its
other subsidiaries and need not change them all.

FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: The view from Abu Dhabi - Andrew Jack interviews the
emirate's man at the bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If one man can best describe the feelings of Abu Dhabi and its involvement
with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, it is Mr Ghanim Faris Al
Mazrui.
Since regulators closed BCCI in July 1991, Abu Dhabi has faced lawsuits,
allegations surrounding its knowledge of fraud, and criticism from
creditors, regulators and politicians alike, all compounding its own
financial losses and personal embarrassment in connection with the collapse.
'Creditors should be grateful for what Abu Dhabi has done,' says Mr Mazrui.
'We think they should understand we are not the only ones to blame, and
maybe not at all to blame.'
Mr Mazrui is chairman of the department of private affairs of the ruler of
Abu Dhabi, and is in charge of the government working group established when
the financial problems of BCCI emerged in 1990.
He sat on the board of BCCI companies from 1981, when Abu Dhabi acquired a
10 per cent stake through its investment authority. When in 1991 the Bank of
England commissioned a secret investigation into BCCI scattered with
code-words to preserve confidentiality, he was dubbed 'Robin'.
Until now he has spurned publicity, but last week Mr Mazrui put his
government's case in an interview, interrupted by a call to prayers from a
nearby mosque and by officials bringing documents for him to sign.
In the last few weeks he helped conclude an agreement with the US
authorities allowing them complete access to the bank's records, and
promising to hand over by April Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief
executive who is on trial in Abu Dhabi.
Mr Mazrui expresses confidence in his government's actions after the point
at which he says it became aware of financial problems at BCCI in April
1990.
'We have nothing to fear,' says Mr Mazrui. 'We started on a long journey.
All the time we discover that we are more confident about ourselves. We fear
absolutely nothing that Naqvi does unless he dreams or writes fiction.'
The story of Abu Dhabi's links with BCCI extends back to the initial
friendship and financial support offered by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, to
Agha Hassan Abedi, founder of the bank, from its creation in 1972.
They culminate in the purchase of new and existing shares in the bank in
April 1990 at the time Mr Naqvi told it of substantial losses staunched by
money stolen from Abu Dhabi's Dollars 2.2bn investment portfolio, and
pleaded for financial support. That led to the state's shareholding - split
between members of the ruling family and those of the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority - rising to 77 per cent.
Mr Mazrui joined the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority when it was created in
1976 and it was in this role that he became the government's representative
as a director on the board of BCCI in 1981. But he insists he had no inkling
of financial troubles, and little expertise or time to devote to the bank.
'I'm not a banker as such,' he says.
He admits that he was aware of rumours about the financial health of the
bank. 'We thought it was a question of envy in the west, seeing a bank grew
so fast in 10 years. We said BCCI must be taking a risk, but there are
auditors, regulators, bankers and customers giving it critical analysis.
This was really the atmosphere. On the face of the figures you cannot
contest them. If you are not tipped off you don't suspect, you take it on
trust.'
Much of the criticism of Abu Dhabi has focused on the extent and timing of
its knowledge of fraud at the bank, and its decision, once it knew, to
restructure rather than close it. Mr Mazrui says Abu Dhabi was unaware of
the losses until April 1990, when Mr Naqvi confessed - and then only in a
'piecemeal' fashion through a series of reports and interviews over several
months.
'When the management said they took the portfolio, we said we could not
trust them. But what could we do? There was little time. You could neither
believe them nor disbelieve them. They put it in our minds that the money
taken was only from (our) portfolio.'
'It was not an easy decision. They said if we left, one million depositors
would suffer. They said BCCI was a very good bank, with good, young people
working hard, and that within ten years we would recover our money.'
He has little sympathy for Price Waterhouse, which drafted the report for
the Bank of England leading to BCCI's closure while continuing to act as
auditor and to advise Abu Dhabi on the restructuring.
'The auditors knew about the problems,' he says. 'They had the background.
We felt their behaviour was somehow strange: they had said nothing in the
past and everything now. They had arguments with management, the board had
nothing to do with.'
Price Waterhouse made several allegations in its report to the Bank of
England against Mr Mazrui himself. It alleges that he signed a confirmation
to the auditors of a falsified loan made on behalf of Abu Dhabi's crown
prince. He says he signed no such document, has not seen the original and
that if there is a signature it must be a forgery.
He admits - as the Price Waterhouse report states - that he received money
from BCCI from the sale of the bank's shares in 1986, which he says totalled
Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m. But he says the bank credited him without his
knowledge, and that he demanded that Mr Abedi take the money back. When this
did not happen, he says he donated the money to charities, as Mr Abedi
suggested.
What is his message for the bank's creditors? 'We want them to be
reasonable, to appreciate our sacrifice, to question their own countries'
regulators. We were not the only ones on the scene.'

FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: Sir Sonny had special loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The former secretary-general of the Commonwealth received rental income and
deferral of interest on two loans from the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International while negotiating a consultancy contract during his last five
years in office.
Sir 'Sonny' Shridath Ramphal, Commonwealth secretary-general during 1975-90,
received a loan for Pounds 200,000 from BCCI in 1984 and a further Pounds
100,000 in 1985 on which all interest was deferred.
The bank also paid him rent on two houses: one in Barbados from 1983 which
had risen to Dollars 66,000 a year by 1990 net of taxes and rates; and one
in London from 1985 amounting to Pounds 43,500 a year by 1990.
Sir Sonny was one of several figures courted by BCCI as consultants on
international affairs. Others included Lord Callaghan, the former Labour
premier, and Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president.
The loans and interest - worth more than Pounds 536,000 - were to be written
off as part of a Pounds 300,000 a year consultancy contract when he finished
his term in 1990. He was to provide leadership through a consultancy
organisation for a Third World foundation planned by BCCI.
The contract was never fulfilled because of management changes at BCCI in
1990 and its closure by banking regulators in July 1991. Sir Sonny this week
confirmed details of the package and denied there was anything unethical in
the agreement. 'I could not possibly be blameworthy,' he said.
He said he had not performed any work for the bank during his time as
Commonwealth secretary-general except as chairman of the Third World Prize
established by BCCI in 1979. He said he had negotiated a settlement to repay
most of the money owed to the BCCI liquidators, less an offsetting amount to
compensate him for the failure of the contract on which he was relying to be
honoured.
The Bingham report into the supervision of BCCI, published in 1992, says
that a session at a Commonwealth Secretariat-sponsored crime symposium at
Cambridge University on money laundering and BCCI in 1989 was cancelled on
the directions of the secretary-general's office. Sir Sonny said he had no
knowledge of the decision to cancel the session.
Internal documents prepared by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of
BCCI, suggest that the bank had been attempting to hire Sir Sonny as an
adviser since 1980. The recruitment was delayed after he was re-elected but
the documents say he 'continued to appropriately project (its) image and
policies.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
China's industrial output rose 33 per cent in January against the same month
last year, despite government efforts to calm economic activity.
The surge in output suggests China faces serious difficulties bringing
growth down to a target of 9 per cent this year compared with 12.8 per cent
in 1993.
The latest indications of economic overheating, reported yesterday by
official Chinese newspapers, are likely to further intensify government
concerns about inflation.
Cost of living in China's cities rose by 23.9 per cent a year in December.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Hosokawa anxious as yen shoots up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday admitted 'serious
concern' about the yen's rapid rise against the dollar but argued that it
was not a direct consequence of the failure to reach an accord with Mr
Clinton.
He came under fierce criticism from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party,
which criticised him for failing to co-operate with the US to control the
yen's advance.
'If Japan-US relations really are mature, they should have talked about how
to deal with the yen's surge,' said Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general,
taking a jibe at the government's belief that Japan's relations with
Washington had reached a new phase.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said US trade sanctions
should only come 'at the very, very last' and that Japan was doing its best
to open markets.
Several cabinet ministers and senior bankers forecast that the yen would
soon fall again, when the political tension dies down.
'Fundamentals that shifted the tide in August are clearly still there,' said
Mr Toyoo Gyohten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo and a former senior finance
ministry official, referring to the last time the yen neared Y100 to the
dollar. He thought US trade sanctions unlikely.
Yet the currency turmoil, even if temporary, 'may dampen rising expectations
of economic recovery,' said Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC, the
electronics group. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, warned: 'Lifting
the yen is surely not the solution for all problems.'
Economic analysts warned that a high yen would depress prices, another
deflationary pressure when the government was trying to stimulate demand.
Domestic wholesale prices fell 0.1 per cent month on month in January,
though the wholesale index as a whole - including exports - rose by 0.1 per
cent, said the Bank of Japan.
The continuing weakness of the economy was underlined by another stream of
gloomy statistics yesterday, including a near 18 per cent rise in the number
of bankruptcies from December to January, to 1,104, a seven-year high.
Almost 60 per cent of Japanese companies have cut their workforces during
the recession and 70 per cent have reduced investment in plant and
equipment, according to a survey by Sanwa Research Institute.
However, a hint of recovery emerged yesterday with a 5.3 per cent rise in
purchases of machinery by private sector companies between November and
December, according to the government's Economic Planning Agency.
Machinery orders in the first quarter of this year are likely to rise by 8.1
per cent from the previous three months, it said.

   VIENNA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday agreed to allow inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency to check its seven acknowledged nuclear plants, Reuter
reports from Vienna.
IAEA officials said they expected the inspections to take place before the
agency's governing body meets in Vienna next week.
North Korean diplomats yesterday resumed talks with the IAEA over inspection
of the nuclear sites, breaking three weeks of deadlock. North Korea's envoy
to the IAEA, Yun Ho-Jin, met officials of the agency's division for the
first time since negotiations broke down on January 25.
North Korea has refused to allow inspections of the seven sites for the past
year. Talks with the IAEA, the UN agency charged with enforcing
international safeguards against the spread of nuclear weapons, stalled
after the two sides were unable to agree terms.
The IAEA board of governors was expected to declare Pyongyang in breach of
its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty next week unless
North Korea agreed to inspections.
South Korea said the North had proposed a working-level meeting with the US
before the February 21 deadline. The US has said it would bring the issue to
the UN Security Council and seek sanctions if the IAEA could no longer
guarantee Pyongyang was not making nuclear weapons.
George Graham in Washington adds: Although North Korea agreed to some of the
measures it has been arguing about, such as allowing IAEA inspectors to
reload permanent surveillance cameras and change seals, yesterday's
announcement made no reference to two undeclared sites which the IAEA also
wants to inspect.
The two sites are suspected of holding nuclear wastes which the IAEA
believes would help it to determine whether North Korea has been producing
more plutonium than declared.
The US yesterday welcomed the agreement as 'a necessary step for the agency
to be able to reassure the international community there has been no
diversion of nuclear material.'
A State Department official said satisfactory completion of the inspections
would, together with the resumption of discussions between North and South
Korea on the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, pave the way for a
new round of formal US-North Korean talks. An informal meeting was likely to
take place soon in New York.

<TEXT>
China is using new religious laws to crack down on foreign missionary
activity with the arrest in the past week of seven foreign Christians.
Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, urged China to release
all those arrested.
US officials in Beijing said they had been informed that three American
citizens among the seven arrested had been released.
Earlier this month, China gave notice that it was cracking down on foreign
missionaries with the publication of new laws aimed at improving religious
'management'.
News of the arrests of foreign Christians in central Henan province
coincides with Beijing's efforts to persuade the outside world that it is
improving its human rights record.
President Clinton is obliged within the next few months to decide whether
China has made an 'overall, significant improvement' in its human rights
performance that would justify renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading
status. International human rights organisations including Amnesty
International have intensified pressure on China and on the US
administration in the lead-up to the MFN decision.
An estimated 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by MFN.
China's new religious decree expressly bans foreigners from setting up
religious organisations, schools or offices.
Foreigners have also been forbidden to cultivate religious disciples among
Chinese citizens, and appoint religious clergy.

<TEXT>
Japan's cabinet yesterday approved a final draft budget worth Y73,080bn
(Pounds 465bn) for the fiscal year starting April 1, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
The budget, aimed at pulling Japan out of its worst post-war recession, is
expected to go to parliament for approval in early March.
The recession has caused sharp tax revenue shortfalls, prompting the
government to draw up an austere budget for 1994/95 which marked only 1 per
cent growth from the budget for 1993/94.
The draft budget backs up last Tuesday's Y15,250bn pump-priming package,
which cuts income and other taxes by Y6,000bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rallied yesterday after a recent spate of steep
falls. The index ended up 1.8 per cent, building on its 0.5 per cent
recovery following a 4 per cent fall on Sunday and a 9 per cent drop in the
course of last week.
The recent falls were triggered, in part, by well-publicised statements by
leading officials and analysts that many shares were overvalued. Euphoria
over the peace process had brought a wave of new investment, fuelling a 35
per cent rise in share values since last August.
Another factor affecting market confidence was last week's arrest of two
dealers who are suspected of large-scale insider trading.
Yesterday a third suspect, leading stock broker Amos Weiss, was questioned
by the Israeli securities authority on suspicion of share price manipulation
and fraud. Jockeying began in earnest yesterday to replace Mr Simcha Dinitz,
the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, who has been forced to
step down after being indicted for fraud and breach of trust. The agency has
a Dollars 500m annual budget to bring Jewish immigrants to Israel and help
in their absorption. Mr Dinitz is alleged to have used the agency's credit
cards for personal expenses totalling Dollars 22,000.
Chairmanship of the agency is a cabinet-level position. Mr Dinitz is a
member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's governing Labour party, and a
former Israeli ambassador to the US.
Several senior Labour politicians are believed to be pressing to replace
him.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Burma junta refuses to free Suu Kyi

<TEXT>
Burma's military junta yesterday brushed off international appeals for the
release of opposition leader Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and threatened to keep her
under house arrest until 1995.
'She has been told that her house arrest will extend to next year,' Col Kyaw
Win, a senior intelligence officer in the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc), told Japanese journalists in Rangoon.
His statement came a day after Ms Suu Kyi was visited at her Rangoon home by
US congressman Mr William Richardson, together with a New York Times
reporter and a UN official - the first visit by people other than her family
since she was held nearly five years ago.
The Oxford-educated Ms Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has
refused to leave the country in exchange for her release.
'Whatever they do to me, I can take it,' she told the New York Times. She
said the junta 'had tried to pressure me to leave in ways no self-respecting
government should try.'
The international standing of Ms Suu Kyi, her popularity within Burma and
her continued defiance are an embarrassment to the junta. Most other
democracy campaigners have been killed, jailed, driven out of the country or
browbeaten into submission.
Ms Suu Kyi is a beacon of hope for pro-democracy activists as they watch the
junta engineer a new constitution that would allow the armed forces to
continue running the country from behind the scenes.
The armed forces have held power since 1962. They crushed a popular uprising
in 1988 and allowed an election two years later which - to their discomfit -
was won convincingly by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. The
junta ignored the result and suppressed all forms of dissent, but is now
trying to convince Japan and other countries to renew aid.
Col Kyaw Win said yesterday Ms Suu Kyi would 'interfere with politics and
create unrest' if she were set free within Burma. Ms Suu Kyi has challenged
the junta to respect the results of the election.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Congress forces mobilise over balanced budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Battle opened in Congress yesterday over a constitutional amendment
requiring the US government to balance its budget each year.
If passed, the amendment could have sweeping effects on the US government
and economy, forcing Dollars 600bn of spending cuts over the next five years
beyond the savings already mapped out in the current budget of President
Bill Clinton's administration.
Nonetheless, the amendment has built up a strong coalition of supporters
ranging from liberal Democrats such as Senator Paul Simon of Illinois to
conservatives such as Republican Senator Robert Dole of Kansas.
Mr Dole said yesterday he believed the sponsors of the balanced budget
amendment now had 65 solid votes in the Senate, just two short of the
two-thirds majority it would require. The measure could, however, face a
filibuster, making it difficult to force a vote.
If the amendment is approved by the Senate later this month, it would be
expected to win the support of two-thirds of the House of Representatives,
and would then need to be ratified by three-quarters of the state
legislatures before taking effect.
The wording of the resolution that will be debated later this month would
require that total government outlays should not exceed total receipts for
any fiscal year, unless a three-fifths majority of Congress voted a waiver.
In the event of war, only a normal majority would be needed.
It would also require a three-fifths majority to raise the statutory ceiling
on total government debt.
Heavy opposition was mounted yesterday, however, by Senator Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, who as chairman of the appropriations committee controls the
purse strings for every senator's favourite project.
In a carefully orchestrated hearing yesterday, Mr Byrd paraded cabinet
secretary after cabinet secretary to explain the dire consequences that the
amendment would have on their departments.
While Attorney General Janet Reno warned that the Federal Bureau of
Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Agency would have to close field
offices, Ms Donna Shalala, the Health and Human Services secretary,
complained that the measure would 'shred the safety net we hold for our
disadvantaged' and force 1.5m older US citizens into poverty.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, said the amendment was a
gimmick favoured by 'those who seek to avoid making the tough budget
decisions'.
It would turn recessions into depressions, he said, create a feast of
litigation and prompt a host of accounting gimmicks.
'The constitution ought not to be a book-keeping manual,' he thundered. Mr
Simon retorted that if the balanced budget amendment was a gimmick, Congress
would have passed it long ago.
'There were so many heroes at the Alamo because there was no back door. What
we need is a constitutional amendment that doesn't give a back door to
members of Congress so we can duck,' he said.

The Spanish government will pay out Pta5.3bn (Pounds 25.7m) in indemnity

Cuba will then repay Spain with a combination of cash and goods under the
terms of a treaty worked out in 1990.
Some 2,450 property owners or their heirs applied for compensation for real
estate, businesses, stocks, cash accounts, pensions, insurance or mortgages
seized during the early 1960s.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Fujimori 'a political prisoner of the Peruvian armed
forces': Sally Bowen on growing disquiet at the role of the military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's fledgling democracy suffered a setback last week when the Supreme
Court capitulated before the government majority in Congress. Senior judges
backed a parliamentary manoeuvre initiated by the executive to shield the
military from public investigation into a high-profile human rights case.
For many observers, the incident has confirmed their long-standing
suspicions that Peru's elected authorities, from President Alberto Fujimori
down and including the supposedly independent judiciary, are being
manipulated by the country's traditionally powerful military.
'This underlines the relationship between civilian and military power,' said
Ms Lourdes Flores Nano, leader of the largest opposition group in Peru's
congress. 'Mr Fujimori has become a puppet of the military.'
Ms Flores Nano alleges that the armed forces have been, since Mr Fujimori's
1990 election, the power behind the throne. Their hidden agenda has been to
install a 'monitored democracy,' she says. Political commentators, in a rare
show of unanimity, have dubbed Mr Fujimori a 'political prisoner of the
armed forces' and 'the jester at the military court'.
Certainly, the influence of Peru's armed forces has grown since they backed
the 'self-coup' in April 1992 when Mr Fujimori dissolved congress and
suspended the constitution. Emergency legislation has given the military
special powers and a relatively free hand in rooting out subversion.
At the same time Mr Fujimori has entrusted them with tasks such as road
repairs, distributing donated food and helping the population in remote
villages.
Today, despite the advances in pacification in the 17 months since Sendero
Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman was captured, more
than a quarter of Peru's national territory, containing half of its
population, remains classified as 'emergency zones'. Here the
'military-political commander', usually an army general, is the supreme
authority. Elected civilian representatives have little or no real role.
The military have also acquired wide powers in the administration of
justice. Leading terrorists charged with 'treason to the fatherland' are
tried by secret military courts. They regularly receive summary life prison
sentences from what critics describe as 'faceless' judges and are often
denied proper defence provision and the right of appeal.
Pro-government congressmen - and indeed many ordinary Peruvians - have
applauded the speed and efficiency of these military courts, comparing them
favourably with slow, tortuous and frequently corrupt civilian legal
practice.
But the military also insist on washing their own dirty linen behind closed
doors. Over the years, many notorious cases of human rights abuses -
including massacres of peasants - have been tried in secret, the findings
unpublished and the military miscreants have rarely been punished.
The latest controversy began one night in 1992, at the height of the Shining
Path offensive against Lima, when a group of nine students and a professor
were abducted by hooded gunmen from the university of La Cantuta, not far
from the capital. The 10 were shot, their bodies dismembered, burned and
buried, to be unearthed more than a year later.
Few doubt that armed forces and intelligence service personnel carried out
the killings. There are allegations, however, that assassination orders came
from the highest levels - General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, and Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's
powerful chief intelligence adviser. The allegations have been supported by
General Rodolfo Robles, Peru's third-ranking army officer, who fled the
country last year.
A dispute over who should investigate the killings has dragged on since
April last year. Initiatives by the then newly installed congress to call
military witnesses were pre-empted when Gen Hermoza brought his tanks on to
the streets of Lima and warned elected representatives against meddling in
purely internal army matters. Then the army began its own inquiry behind
closed doors.
The political manoeuvring last week, involving all three branches of
government, is just a slightly more subtle move to prevent Gen Hermoza and
Mr Montesinos being called to give evidence at the end of this month.
A US state department declaration regretted the move and urged the Peruvian
government 'to show total respect for the separation of powers and judicial
autonomy enshrined in the new constitution'.
Human rights are high on the US-Peruvian bilateral agenda. Although
disappearances and extra-judicial killings have fallen steadily since 1992,
several influential US congressmen have insisted on blocking economic
assistance earmarked for Peru until progress is made on cases such as the La
Cantuta incident.
Now the Dollars 105m Peru was hoping to see disbursed in the wake of a
generally friendly recent visit by Mr Alexander Watson, US assistant
secretary of state for Latin America, is certain to be withheld, placing
further strain on a tight 1994 budget. Even more damaging, analysts warn, is
the dissuasive effect on intending foreign investors of this arbitrary
judicial move.
In times of strong subversive threat, Peruvians have been inclined to
tolerate the existence of one law for the military and one for the rest.
Those times may be drawing to a close.
'The military must never again run the country, either overtly or covertly,'
says Ms Flores Nano. 'We cannot and will not accept a democracy under their
tutelage.'

<TEXT>
Smiths Industries of the UK is competing for a contract to provide avionics
systems for 36 Skyhawk fighter bombers that Argentina is to buy from the US.
Smiths said yesterday it 'has offered to supply' avionics updates for the
aircraft and was discussing sale terms.
The sale of both the aircraft and the avionics was strongly opposed by the
British government, which claimed they would threaten the security of the
Falkland Islands.
A Smiths Industries official said yesterday: 'You can be assured that this
company would not proceed without keeping the appropriate authorities fully
informed.' He said that although Smiths had not made a formal request for UK
government clearance, it maintained informal contacts with the government on
the subject.
It first emerged in October that a wholly owned US subsidiary of Smiths
Industries had begun talks with Argentina's air force to sell an avionics
package. McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, both of the US, also entered
discussions on the deal.
The Argentine Defence Ministry is understood to have preferred the Smiths
approach, hoping this would underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the
British arms embargo, still in place since the 1982 Falklands conflict.
On February 1, Washington said it would sell the aircraft to replace some of
the 60 Argentina lost in the conflict. But it agreed to UK requests that the
1970s vintage Skyhawks would not be equipped with state of the art avionics.

FT  16 FEB 94 / US output grows 1/2%: Storms and earthquake constrain
January figures
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production rose 0.5 per cent last month, roughly in line with
analysts' projections, but distortions caused by very cold weather and the
Los Angeles earthquake made the figures hard to interpret.
Production was up 4.7 per cent in the year to January, following robust
increases in the final quarter of last year.
The Federal Reserve said adverse weather and the earthquake constrained
manufacturing output which rose 0.2 per cent, against an average monthly
gain of 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter. Steel, appliances and motor
vehicles were among the industries most badly affected.
However, the arctic weather conditions sharply boosted production at
utilities and mines as demand for electricity and gas surged. Output of
utilities rose 3.5 per cent from December to January, following gains of 0.9
per cent in the two preceding months.
The Fed said the overall rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to
83.1 per cent against 82.9 per cent in December, well above the long-term
average of 81.9 per cent.
Consumer spending last month was also affected by adverse weather and the
earthquake. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent in January, the first fall in 10
months, but already strong figures for December were revised up.

FT  16 FEB 94 / 'Tailhook' prompts navy chief to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Admiral Frank Kelso, US chief of naval operations, is to retire two months
early, the victim of controversy over his alleged role in the notorious 1991
'Tailhook' convention of naval airmen held in Las Vegas.
'I became the lightning rod for Tailhook,' he told the press yesterday, 'and
the lightning keeps striking.' With statements from the Pentagon's civilian
command 'reaffirming my honour, integrity and leadership, we can finally
close this difficult chapter,' he said.
The immediate chain of events leading to the departure of the senior Navy
uniformed officer started last week when a military judge dismissed charges
of sexual harassment and lewd conduct against three officers on the grounds
that Admiral Kelso had lied about his knowledge of incidents which he had
allegedly observed in person.
On Monday the admiral, clearly incensed, rebutted this ruling by releasing
internal Navy documents which found no credible evidence either that he had
first-hand knowledge of what went on at the convention or that he had sought
to obstruct subsequent inquiries. Dozens of women, including naval officers,
had complained they were molested at the convention.
Earlier yesterday, after intense consultations inside the Pentagon and with
the White House, Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said in a statement:
'I regard Frank Kelso as a man of the highest integrity and honour.'
In similar vein, Mr John Dalton, navy secretary, who last year sought the
admiral's dismissal over the affair, said that though he had 'questioned the
leadership which permitted the excesses of Tailhook to take place, I have
never questioned the personal integrity and honour of Frank Kelso.'
With these assurances, Admiral Kelso, considered a most progressive officer,
took the option of early retirement. 'It is time for me to go away,' he
said,' and let the Navy have a new leader.'

The Netherlands producer price index for manufacturing sales fell an average
1.5 per cent provisionally last year compared with 1992, the Central Bureau
of Statistics said. In December, the PPI fell a provisional 0.3 per cent on
November, giving a 0.8 per cent fall year-on-year.
A fall in interest rates cut the year-on-year rise in Finnish consumer
prices by 1.4 percentage points in January, Statistics Finland said.
Consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent year-on-year in January, its lowest since
1959 - and fell 0.3 per cent from the previous month, SF said. Industrial
production rose 10.1 per cent year-on-year in December.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 8.1 per cent in
December after a 7.2 per cent rise in November, the Bundesbank confirmed.
Unemployment in Poland rose 2.4 per cent, or by 69,527 people in January,
the labour ministry said. At the end of January there were 2.96m without
jobs, 16 per cent of the labour force.
Czech hard currency reserves rose to Dollars 4.08bn on February 10, from
Dollars 3.8bn at the end of 1993, the Czech National Bank said. Hard
currency reserves rose to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 6.29bn in the period.
Hungary's monthly consumer price inflation accelerated in January to 3.2 per
cent from 1.3 per cent in December, but the year-on-year change slowed to 17
per cent, Central Statistical Office figures show.
Spain's broad M4 money supply rose 5.3 per cent in January from December,
the Bank of Spain said. Its forecast range for accumulated M4 growth in 1994
is 3 per cent to 7 per cent.
Denmark's current account surplus for October 1993 came to Kr6.4bn, compared
with Kr6.5bn a year earlier. the Danish statistical agency said. In November
there was a deficit of Kr4.5bn.

After more than three weeks of sustained industrial unrest, talks resumed
yesterday between the Fiat management and unions on lay-offs and job cuts in
the Turin-based group's Italian automotive plants, writes Robert Graham in
Rome.
Resumption of talks followed a series of behind-the-scenes initiatives by Mr
Gini Giugni, labour minister, and reflect little softening of Fiat's tough
line. Mr Giugni is understood to be offering large-scale early retirement,
plus government funding for the development of an electric car, as a
compromise to Fiat's decision to cut 5 per cent of its workforce and lay off
up to a further 10 per cent for two years.
The unions are divided on the idea of early retirement. The labour
minister's intervention underscored the Ciampi government's concern to avoid
a serious confrontation between the unions and the country's biggest private
sector employer in the run-up to the March general elections. Since Fiat
decided to implement plans to trim its 95,000 workforce in mid-January the
group's plants have been hit by frequent strikes.

FT  16 FEB 94 / To Berlin or not to Berlin: That is the German question,
writes Judy Dempsey, who catalogues the worried debate about moving from
Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate about when, how, at what cost, should, might, will, the
government seated in Bonn on the river Rhine move to Berlin on the river
Spree, is reminiscent of a play Czech President Vaclav Havel wrote when he
was free of the burdens of state duty but not free to have his plays
performed.
Vanek, a dissident, asks Stanek, a bureaucrat, to sign a petition seeking
the release of a dissident composer. If Stanek signs he risks exclusion from
the 'official' world, blessed with its perks for those who conform. He
dithers, makes up all sorts of excuses, prevaricates.
The tortuous debate taking place in Bonn about the move to Berlin would
appeal to Havel the playwright. After deciding in June 1991, by a free vote,
to move to Berlin by 1996, the government - pressed by officials who have
got used to the easy, uncomplicated, provincial life of 'A Small Town in
Germany' - postponed the move.
A debate was called. Then another. And another. Each put the back the date.
At last, to avoid looking utterly ridiculous, before Christmas the
government decided to move 'not later than the year 2000'. But then Mr Theo
Waigel, no keen supporter of the Umzug - move, or, in another translation,
pageant - said it would cost too much.
Last week, after another round of soul-searching, a date, of sorts, and a
move, of a kind, was agreed. But the Rhinelanders are still dissatisfied.
The latest compromise means that eight ministries will remain in Bonn, the
remainder moving to Berlin. But for the price of moving, the Beamte, or
civil servants on permanent contracts, are demanding more office space than
their current abode. For example, the foreign ministry wants an extra 5,000
sq m on their present 50,284 sq m. In practice, these officials want 34 sq m
each in Berlin instead of 26 sq m.
On top of that, the lobbyists, if they cannot stay in Bonn, are insisting on
the highest office standards. Recent estimates suggest that it would cost
between DM14,000 (Pounds 5,450) and DM17,000 a sq m - even though the
Treuhand privatisation agency, future home to the economics ministry,
managed to revamp Hermann Goring's gargantuan Luftfahrt, or Air/War Ministry
for DM100m.
As the costs soar - the latest estimate is DM20bn - Mr Waigel and the
bureaucracy want to hold back. 'If they put out the renovations to private
tender, they could easily halve the costs,' said Mr Mark Palmer, former US
ambassador to Hungary, who is building a business centre on the site of
Checkpoint Charlie. 'If these bureaucrats want to understand what
unification is all about, they should see how the other half - the
easterners - live and just come.'
But the Umzug debate is about much more than cost. It is about coming to
terms with a united Germany.
Officials in Bonn repeatedly claim that if the government moves to Berlin,
it will become more eastern, far from the borders of the Netherlands and
France. 'We just feel that we will be cut off from Europe,' one foreign
ministry civil servant said. 'In Berlin, we will be removed from the western
influences. We will be in the centre of Europe,' he added.
'Sometimes I think the Umzug debate is about Germany not wanting to come to
terms with dealing with unification in the psychological and social sense,'
said an aide to President Richard Von Weizsacker. 'It's as if west Germans
want to retain the status quo ante, that is, before the fall of the Berlin
Wall, as if unification never happened, or at least that it will not impinge
on their lives. The move to Berlin would help end the division of the two
Germanys,' he said. The president is already ensconced in Bellevue, not far
from the Brandenburg Gate.
But there is a lingering religious element as well. A Bavarian, a
Rhinelander and a Berliner, all joked about the fear of 'the Protestant
Prussians arguing with the Catholic Rhinelanders'.
'We are talking about a complex religious divide in our country,' said one.
'Somehow, a divided Germany also divided us on religious grounds, with the
west predominately Catholic and the east Lutheran and Protestant.'
For Berliners, and eastern Germans, the issue of the Umzug has assumed the
status of ridicule, few believing it will ever take place. The Berliners,
apart from the business community who believe Berlin's underdeveloped
financial services and good office amenities would benefit from the move,
are unsure and discontented since the collapse of the Wall.
A united Berlin has ended the subsidies provided by Bonn to make the western
half of the city a prosperous oasis, with its bright lights shining across
to the grey east. The west Berliners are only slowly coming to terms with
life without a Wall, never mind the Umzug.
But for the Saxons and other eastern states, support for the Umzug is
lukewarm. 'It would remind us of the old days when Berlin got bananas and
gas heating, and we made do with preservatives and brown coal heating,'
quipped a Saxon.
Indeed, the officials in Bonn might yet strike an alliance with the eastern
states to oppose the Umzug. That would represent a bizarre twist to the
Umzug debate, almost signalling a meeting of minds rare in the new Germany.
But this is unlikely.
Instead, the Umzug debate will eventually be resolved with all sides trying
not to lose face - like President Havel's Stanek. He did not sign. He was
let off the hook: the dissident was released.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the ruling party in
Germany's most independent-minded state since the foundation of the federal
republic, was yesterday struggling to paper over serious divisions in the
run-up to a bitter election campaign.
The former state premier, Mr Max Streibl, who was forced to resign last year
for accepting free holidays from a business friend, was facing bitter
criticism and possible expulsion for holding talks with Mr Franz Schonhuber,
leader of the extreme right-wing Republicans.
At the same time, Mr Peter Gauweiler, the popular and populist Bavarian
environment minister and CSU party leader in the city of Munich, is facing
pressure for his resignation because of a simmering scandal over legal fees
he has continued to earn while in office.
Mr Gauweiler, the most outspoken critic of European integration in the CSU,
which is the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union in the Bonn coalition, held top-level talks yesterday with Mr Theo
Waigel, the Bonn finance minister and party leader, and Mr Edmund Stoiber,
the Bavarian premier and the real CSU strongman in Munich.
He emerged tight-lipped, refusing to comment on the talks until today, But
hitherto he has been strongly resisting pressure from Mr Stoiber to resign
before his affair becomes an issue in the September elections.
His plight is a severe embarrassment for the CSU, for he remains very
popular with the party rank and file, and a clear vote-catcher in the
contest with the Republicans for conservative votes.
As an outspoken opponent of the Maastricht treaty and the process of
European economic and monetary union, Mr Gauweiler was the man who coined
the description 'Esperanto money' for the future single European currency.
Mr Stoiber has now himself adopted a highly sceptical attitude towards
European integration in his pre-election platform.
Mr Streibl's contact with Mr Schonhuber is somewhat easier for the party
leadership to deal with, because he is already largely discredited in the
party and the electorate.
The meeting was instantly condemned by Mr Waigel as a private initiative,
and is seen in Bavaria as a reflection of personal bitterness on the part of
the former premier.
Mr Stoiber, as the man leading the CSU ticket in the state elections, is a
passionate opponent of Mr Schonhuber and the Republicans, and has repeated
his refusal to have anything to do with the party.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Audi earmarks DM800m to equip plant for new small car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Audi, Volkswagen's executive car division, is to spend around DM800m (Pounds
312m) on equipping its main plant at Ingolstadt to make a new small car.
The production facilities, due to open in mid-1996, are expected to turn out
100,000 vehicles a year.
The Bavarian site was awarded the production contract after a group-wide
competition in which the Seat works in Martorell, the Skoda factory in the
Czech Republic - both offering far lower labour costs than in Germany - and
VW's plant in Brussels were also short-listed, the company said yesterday.
Ingolstadt's advantages included lower start-up investment costs and greater
flexibility, Audi added. The local workforce had also accepted changes in
working practices and reduced benefit payments which alone would save DM150m
a year.
'We have proved Audi can make top-quality cars at competitive costs,'
claimed Mr Herbert Demel, who was named board spokesman last Friday after
the sacking of Audi chairman, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum. Mr Demel said he
expected the company to break even this year following losses in 1993
estimated at more than DM200m.
The new car, the Audi-A, based on the VW Golf chassis, is an integral part
of a plan laid by VW group chairman Ferdinand Piech, who was head of Audi
until the end of 1992, to widen the brand's product range.
Cheaper than the current bottom-of-the-range Audi 80, it is intended to
attract younger buyers to the marque, which at present sells mainly to the
over-40s.
Mercedes-Benz, the motor vehicle arm of the Daimler-Benz group, increased
car sales by 53 per cent in January compared with 7 per cent growth for the
market as a whole, the company's chief executive said, writes David Waller
in Frankfurt.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Russia and Britain 'de-target' nuclear missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and Britain yesterday signed an agreement to 'de-target' nuclear
missiles directed at their respective countries as part of a series of
measures to strengthen bilateral relations, writes Philip Stephens.
With Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, claiming that ties between London
and Moscow were now better than he could ever recall, he also agreed with
President Boris Yeltsin that the Russian leader would visit London later
this year.
After talks at the Kremlin, the two leaders signed a double taxation
agreement designed to promote British investment in Russia and a framework
accord to provide for joint military exercises next year.
Those agreements will be followed up today by the announcement of increased
British technical aid for Russia's economic modernisation programme when Mr
Major visits Nizhny Novgorod, the province at the forefront of the shift to
a market economy.
British officials voiced optimism that the enhanced co-operation resulting
from the visit could lead to the early signature of a number of large
contracts by UK companies.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Moscow to vet UN orders to its peacekeepers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian troops under United Nations command in the former Yugoslavia have
been told not to obey orders from their UN superiors until they are cleared
by Moscow, according to officials in President Boris Yeltsin's
administration.
This emerged as Mr Yeltsin raised strong objections yesterday to the threat
of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs in his first public comments on last
week's Nato ultimatum.
Presidential officials said at least one UN order to Russian troops had
already been countermanded. This was when Russian troops in eastern Croatia
refused an order to move nearer to Sarajevo.
Moscow's attitude was underlined by Russian deputy foreign minister Vitaly
Churkin. On his way back from a visit to Bosnia, he said it was unthinkable
that Russian troops should reinforce peacekeepers in Sarajevo while Moscow
was not part of the decision-making process in Bosnia.
Speaking after talks in Moscow with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr
Yeltsin warned Nato it would not succeed in ending the conflict without full
Russian agreement. But Mr Yeltsin held back from outright rejection of the
Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from
around Sarajevo by midnight on Sunday or face air strikes.
The Russian president, who appeared angry at the precedent set by the west
in issuing a unilateral military warning, told journalists at the Kremlin:
'Some people are trying to resolve the issue on Bosnia without the agreement
of Russia. This will not succeed.'
But he did not explicitly demand that the UN Security Council pass another
resolution before launching military action. He also threw Russia's weight
behind efforts to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
He did, however, distinguish between air strikes in defence of UN forces -
which he approved - and the wider re-mit of the Nato decision. He warned the
west against trying to impose a solution to a conflict that could only be
ended at a negotiating table. 'Russia will take part actively in talks to
bring a peaceful solution. . . I am glad Mr Major supports our view on
that,' he said.
Mr Major, the first Nato leader to meet Mr Yeltsin since the ultimatum was
issued, was anxious to reassure his host. He told journalists: 'Before air
strikes proceed on this very limited front there would need to be a
reference back, under previously agreed Security Council resolutions, to the
secretary-general.'
Reinforcing his assurances after a dinner with Mr Yeltsin, he said he had
told the Russian leader the Nato ultimatum was not about generalised air
strikes nor was it a proposal to change the character of UN involvement.
London and Moscow had no difference on their objective in Bosnia, he added.
The aim was to get a negotiated settlement.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Guns wait on the war of words: Robert Mauthner on who is
going to give the orders over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Bosnian Serbs are not rushing to comply with Nato's ultimatum giving
them 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons 20km (12 miles) from the centre
of Sarajevo or place them under UN control, failing which they will face air
strikes, that is hardly surprising.
The confusion created by the contradictory statements of Nato and United
Nations spokesmen about who, in the last resort, is responsible for ordering
these air strikes has given the Bosnian Serbs a heaven-sent opportunity to
stall and pin their hopes on yet another international fudge.
General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, has said,
somewhat imprudently, that the responsibility for launching air strikes is
his - as if such a crucial decision could ever be taken by a military man
alone without the express consent of his political masters.
By contrast, large Nato countries such as the US and France have indicated
clearly that, if the Bosnian Serbs fail to comply with the terms of the
ultimatum by the deadline next Monday, then air strikes will definitely go
ahead.
It seems almost as if the various parties have paid scant notice over the
past few days to the relevant texts on which the UN's and Nato's policy has
been based.
From these texts it is clear that the Nato decision 'to prepare urgently'
for air strikes was taken on February 10 at the express request of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
In a letter to Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, Mr Boutros
Ghali referred specifically to Security Council Resolution 836, under which
'. . . . member states, acting nationally or through regional organisations
or arrangements, may take under the authority of the Security Council and
subject to close co-ordination with the Secretary-General and Unprofor (the
UN protection force in former Yugoslavia), all necessary measures, through
the use of air power, in and around the safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to
support Unprofor in the performance of its mandate. . . .'
Mr Boutros Ghali goes on: 'I should be grateful if you could take action to
obtain, at the earliest possible date, a decision by the North Atlantic
Council to authorise the commander-in-chief of Nato's southern command to
launch air strikes, at the request of the United Nations, against artillery
or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo. . . .'
The arrangements for the co-ordination of such air strikes would be worked
out through direct contacts between Unprofor headquarters and Nato's
southern command. It appears very much as if the UN secretary-general was
making a distinction between a decision by Nato to authorise air strikes and
a joint UN/Nato decision to implement them.
No mention of a deadline in Mr Boutros Ghali's letter, as there is in the
subsequent Nato ultimatum. Moreover, the communique issued after the North
Atlantic Council meeting also specifically mentions that the launching of
Nato air strikes would take place at the request of the United Nations.
Formally therefore, the decision to launch the bombing of Bosnian Serb
positions, lies with the UN. However, the dispute about who has the ultimate
authority to launch the air strikes would be of less import if the UN and
Nato were pulling in the same direction on the ground. But there are
increasing signs that this is not the case.
Only two days ago, the Unprofor spokesman in Sarajevo, Lieutenant-Colonel
Bill Aikman was quoted as saying: 'The 10-day ultimatum is a Nato ultimatum.
It is not our ultimatum.'
Taking advantage of the uncertainties in the western camp, The Bosnian Serbs
maintain that what matters is not where the guns are located or under whose
control they are, but whether they are being fired or not - in other words
that the ceasefire negotiated last week by the warring parties under the
aegis of the UN is respected.
The UN and Nato still have a few days to sort out their disagreements and to
persuade the Bosnian Serbs that they must comply with their demands, or face
dire consequences. But it is difficult to see how Nato, after all its
posturing, can make compromises and go back on its threats without losing
all credibility.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Clinton blames Europe on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's administration is increasingly critical in private
of western Europe's failure to stimulate growth to create jobs, according to
confidential documents in the possession of the Financial Times.
US economic policy-makers believe European governments are wrong to
concentrate on structural supply side reforms in the labour market to cut
their dole queues. They also want to see a European commitment to economic
expansion.
Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
warned European central bankers at a meeting in Paris of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development in December that unless European
nations followed more ambitious growth objectives, unemployment would not be
significantly reduced by the end of the decade.
And last month in a letter to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD's director general,
Mr David Aaron, new head of the US mission to the OECD, expressed criticism
about OECD's 'lack of a positive role for macroeconomic approaches in
addressing unemployment'. His remarks were in response to the draft OECD
paper on employment and unemployment to be published next month.
'Structural reforms are more effective in an environment of growth,' argues
Mr Aaron. 'In the present climate of inadequate demand, reforms are more
likely to be ineffectual or merely cause jobs to shift from one sector or
activity to another. Indeed, some structural reforms undertaken in a climate
of deficient demand would exacerbate joblessness.
'This is particularly relevant in the case of Europe where there is
substantial room to reduce short-term interest rates to stimulate aggregate
demand, although fiscal policy is admittedly constrained,' wrote Mr Aaron.
The US head of mission told Mr Paye he had the backing of Ms Laura Tyson,
the chief White House economist.
At the December OECD meeting Mr Summers made it clear the US wants a
European macroeconomic stimulus and not just structural reforms to create
employment. He said the European situation was moving 'from stagflation to
stagnation' casting 'doubt over the European medium term economic-political
strategies'.
The US under-secretary wondered 'if inflation could not become too low' and
said it was 'difficult to understand why France and Germany accepted low
growth rates'.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Farmers add air strikes to their list of worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the cafe at Kumzin, a village close to Serbia's border with Bosnia, the
threat of Nato air strikes is not just a talking point on a day too frosty
for ploughing.
Kumzin lies a few kilometres from a ramshackle bridge over the Sava river,
used as a main supply route for the Bosnian Serb army. Buses, petrol tankers
and trucks loaded with food cross the bridge before arriving at a checkpoint
manned by police from the self-styled Serb republic in Bosnia.
'It's obvious the bridge would be a target for Nato planes if they start
attacking the Bosnian Serbs. And what happens if they miss?' said Drasko
Christic, an agricultural science student.
So far, the farming communities along the Sava have had little to do with
the war in Bosnia. Many villagers of military age manage to avoid
conscription, although some were called up to fight against Croatia when the
Yugoslav federation began to break up in 1991.
However, if the conflict escalates as a result of Nato involvement, 'I don't
think I and my friends have any choice about going to fight with the Bosnian
Serbs,' Mr Christic said. Though Kumzin is less than 100km from Belgrade,
newspapers no longer arrive there. With private radio and television
stations unable to relay much beyond the capital, the 5,000 villagers rely
on state-controlled television, which carries limited coverage of the
situation in Bosnia.
'I doubt we'd get much warning if the American planes decided to head this
way,' said an elderly villager working his way through a large flask of plum
brandy.
With an unannounced power cut underlining the resigned tone, the cafe's
gloomy consensus was that Nato intervention was likely to prolong rather
than end the war in Bosnia.
Yet several older farmers claimed they were more concerned about UN
sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia than the possibility of air strikes.
'I've got a thousand worries, and there's nothing I can do about bombs
falling down the road from here next week,' said Mr Petar Campric, the cafe
owner. 'It's the future that matters. What's my son going to do when he
finishes school, for instance, if Serbia is still isolated?'
Twenty months of sanctions have affected output in Kumzin, which grows
wheat, maize and sugar beet. There is little fuel available for tractors and
fertiliser is in short supply.
Farmers cut their livestock holdings because of the high cost of feed,
keeping only a few pigs for their own use and to supply meat to family
members living in the capital.
Mr Campric rented his seven hectares of land to another farmer because 'it's
too difficult trying to run a cafe and a farm when you have to chase up
petrol on the black market and organise selling the crop to a private
middleman because the state prices are so low.'
The villagers said they had stopped using the bank branch in Kumzin and
returned to hoarding hard currency at home. It is needed to deal with the
black market suppliers.
Many Kumzin farmers registered their frustration at last December's
elections by switching support from the Socialist party of President
Slobodan Milosevic to Depos, the coalition of democratic parties headed by
Mr Vuk Draskovic. Mr Branko Todoskovic, a Depos supporter, said: 'Things
were looking good in 1990 when I got back some land confiscated from my
family under communism. Now I don't know when I'll be able to afford a new
tractor to handle the extra work.'

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday raised strong objections to the threat of
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He warned Nato it would not succeed
in ending the conflict without full Russian agreement.
After talks in Moscow with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr Yeltsin
held back from outright rejection of the Nato ultimatum to the Serbian
forces besieging Sarajevo.
British officials said the Russian president was keeping open his options in
the event that air strikes were launched after the Nato deadline runs out at
midnight on Sunday. Mr Yeltsin has made clear he sees air strikes as a last
resort.
In Moscow, officials in the presidential administration said Russian troops
under UN command in former Yugoslavia had been told not to obey orders given
to them by their UN superiors until cleared by Moscow. At least one order
had already been countermanded, they said, when Russian troops in Eastern
Croatia refused an order to move nearer to the front line around Sarajevo.
The Russian president, who appeared angry at the precedent set by the West
in issuing a unilateral military warning, told journalists at the Kremlin
yesterday: 'Some people are trying to resolve the issue on Bosnia without
the agreement of Russia. This will not succeed. We will not allow that.'
But, in his first public comments on last week's decision, Mr Yeltsin did
not demand explicitly that the UN security council pass another resolution
before launching any military action. He also threw Russia's weight behind
efforts to lift the seige of Sarajevo.
But he drew a distinction between air strikes called in self-defence of UN
forces in Bosnia - which Moscow approved - and the wider remit of the Nato
decision. He warned the West against attempting to impose a military
solution to a conflict that could only be ended at the negotiating table. He
added: 'Russia will take part actively in talks to bring a peaceful solution
 . I am glad Mr Major supports our view on that.'
A presidential spokesman said air strikes might be seen by the Russian
public as a sign that last month's Partnership for Peace programme agreed by
Nato and former Warsaw pact countries opened the door to US domination.
Mr Major, the first Nato leader to meet Mr Yeltsin since the air strikes
ultimatum was issued, was anxious to reassure his host. He told journalists:
'Before air strikes proceed on this very limited front there would need to
be a reference back, under previously agreed security council resolutions,
to the secretary-general.'
Mr Major acknowledged that the search for a political settlement must
involve active Russian participation.
But British officials said the UK would oppose any move by Russia to force a
vote in the security council on air strikes.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Taskforce set up to uncover abuse in equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An organisation to detect equity market abuse was announced by the
Securities and Investments Board yesterday, at the same time as it opened a
debate on UK market regulation.
The new Market Conduct Regulators Group will be charged with bringing
coherence to varied regulations. The City believes its establishment, with
the issuing of a discussion paper on control, may lead to radical changes in
the way markets operate.
The SIB, the chief regulatory body for the UK securities markets, said
unified surveillance was needed of all markets where UK equities are traded,
so that abuse - such as share price manipulation for profit - can be
detected and punished.
The SIB is concerned that users' confidence in the market has been shaken by
reports of abuse and misconduct, while relatively few criminal prosecutions
have succeeded. It wants to develop 'explicit standards of market integrity
and investor protection'.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said it hoped first to tackle detection of
market abuse. He said: 'It is realistic for us to address (market abuse)
quickly. If the market can be seen to be taking it seriously, it will be to
everyone's advantage.'
The Market Conduct Regulators Group will have the task of making sure there
are no gaps between regulations and that they define and deal with market
misconduct. It will help to produce rapid responses to new market practices
and consider their propriety, and aid criminal prosecutions.
The taskforce is to be headed by the SIB and to include representatives of
the various self-regulatory bodies.
The SIB is also worried that the pace of change, such as the proliferation
of marketplaces and the development of derivatives, such as futures and
options, has overtaken regulations dating back to the Financial Services Act
of 1986.
In its discussion paper, the SIB posed questions to market practitioners and
users on how they felt the secondary market in equities and derivatives
should be controlled.
It asked whether current practices, which allow some information about
transactions to be kept secret, can lead to market manipulation, and whether
investors' interests might be better served if more information was
available.
Those issues are far more complex than that of market abuse and will need
much more discussion before answers can be formed. Mr Large acknowledged
that significant commercial interests were at stake.
Greater disclosure of information might deter people from Trading, reducing
the liquidity of markets prized by most practitioners. One institutional
investor favoured greater transparency, although admitting that it might
work against his interests. 'As a large institution, we benefit from the
lack of transparency because it means we can get rid of large blocks. But
why have some trades reported and others not?'
The London Stock Exchange welcomed the discussion paper. Mr Michael
Lawrence, chief executive, said it provided 'a helpful forum for
consultation'.

                   WHAT THE REGULATOR WANTS TO KNOW
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Should the prices at which market makers offer to buy and sell
shares from each other through inter-dealer broker screens be made
available to investors?
2. Should there be a single bulletin board for the display of all
prices at which a given security is traded anywhere in the UK?
3. Should derivative transactions relating to 3 per cent or more of a
UK company's listed shares be made public?
4. Should the current rules under which market makers can hide the
prices at which large blocks of shares are traded for certain periods
be changed or scrapped?
5. Should there be disclosure of short selling by investors in a
particular stock in the run-up to a large placing of that stock in the
markets?

Russian president Boris Yeltsin meets UK prime minister John Major in the
Kremlin yesterday. During their discussions Mr Yeltsin raised strong
objections to the threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, warning
that Nato would not succeed in ending the conflict without Russian
agreement.
The meeting, which was Mr Yeltsin's first public appearance for two weeks,
came as the president's health and ability to govern emerged again as an
issue of serious concern in Moscow after he postponed a 'state of the
nation' address due on Friday. Officials blamed a continuing 'bad cold'.

FT  16 FEB 94 / US moves towards trade sanctions against Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE, JUREK MARTIN and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday moved towards trade sanctions against Japan by announcing
its conclusion that Japan had violated previous agreements to open its
domestic cellular phone market.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would publish for
public comment within 30 days a list of proposed trade measures, not
necessarily to be limited to higher tariffs or other curbs on Japanese
cellular phone products sold in the US. 'This is a clear-cut and serious
case of a failure by Japan to live up to three agreements,' he said. The
agreements were negotiated in 1985-87, 1989 and finally, by letter, in 1992.
He said that new barriers had been raised after each fresh commit-ment.
Brandishing a cellular phone manufactured in the US by Motorola, he said it
was 'false and disingenuous' of the Japanese to accuse the company of not
trying hard enough. Motorola had only achieved 4 per cent of the Japanese
domestic market, not the 33 to 50 per cent promise held out.
Mr Christopher Galvin, chief operating officer of Motorola, said yesterday
that his company had lost an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 169m) and
Dollars 300m in annual sales because of the barriers which Japan appears to
have erected around the greater Tokyo cellular market. However, he hoped the
US would not have to impose sanctions against Japan. A trade war with Japan
would be counterproductive, he said.
The grace period of up to 30 days gives the US and Japanese governments time
to cobble together another agreement in this field. But should that fail,
other US actions now seem more likely. President Bill Clinton may announce
later this week his intention to revive the Super 301 trade law which, by
setting up deadlines for sanctions against 'unfair traders', would allow a
wide attack on Japan's perceived trade barriers.
The Motorola complaint has been long on the books and the timing of the US
finding is technically coincidental with the failure of last week's summit
to agree on specific ways of opening the Japanese market.
Nevertheless, US officials had warned it could well be the first indication
of the extent of the US displeasure with Japan. US officials say the
Motorola case illustrates the problems US companies face in penetrating
Japan's markets. Motorola is the world's largest manufacturer of cellular
telephones.
Michiyo Nakamoto adds from Tokyo: Japanese officials, ahead of the
announcement, appeared to regard the prospect of sanctions with equanimity.
One indicated that neither the possibility of sanctions nor the sharp
appreciation of the yen were cause for Japan to go back on its refusal to
accept the numerical targets sought by the US for a foreign share of its
markets. 'We made a decision at this point and that is where we stand,'
another official said.
The Bank of Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets to support the
dollar after the yen strengthened in Tokyo this morning to Y103.52. In New
York, the yen closed at Y103.815, slightly down on its London close of
Y103.1.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Abu Dhabi considers new deal on BCCI compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, is considering an agreement with the
liquidators that would provide a greater return to hundreds of thousands of
creditors around the world.
Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, chairman of the working group on BCCI for the
majority shareholder, said he wanted to see creditors receive more money to
compensate them for delays in any pay-out since the bank was closed by
regulators in July 1991.
It has also emerged that a predecessor firm of Ernst &amp; Young, the principal
auditors to BCCI until 1986, highlighted serious concerns at the bank with
audit verification, internal auditing and the need for a single worldwide
auditor as far back as 1979.
Abu Dhabi would prefer to reach a negotiated settlement rather than pursue
lengthy legal actions against BCCI and its liquidators that might continue
for many years and entail prolonged and politically embarrassing coverage of
the case.

FT  16 FEB 94 / Steelmakers face record Pounds 76m fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Competition authorities at the European Commission looked set last night to
seek a record fine on 17 EU steelmakers they have found guilty of operating
a cartel to supply the construction industry.
The opening bid of the Brussels competition directorate at a meeting of
senior officials last night was expected to be for a fine of about Ecu100m
(Pounds 76m), say Commission officials.
The biggest penalties Brussels has imposed until now were of Ecu75m in 1991
on Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, for restrictive practices and
predatory pricing, and of Ecu60m in 1986 on 14 chemical companies for
running a cartel in polypropylene.
But the officials warned that the Commission could reduce the figure at its
full meeting today, depending on the outcome of a dinner at which Mr Karel
Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry
commissioner, were due to meet leading European steelmakers.
The companies facing sanctions after the three-year inquiry include British
Steel, Arbed of Luxembourg, a division of Usinor-Sacilor in France,
Cockeril-Sambre of Belgium, and Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke,
Saarstahl and Thyssen of Germany. The Commission has found that they
infringed EU antitrust rules by sharing out markets and fixing prices for
heavy steel sections and beams.
'This is a terribly serious infringement,' one official said. He pointed out
that when steelmakers were hauled up by the Commission in 1990 for operating
a stainless steel cartel, they escaped with a token fine. But they were
warned then that the EU crisis regime for steel, which licensed certain
market collaboration between manufacturers until 1988, was at an end.
Under EU competition rules, the Commission can levy fines of up to 10 per
cent of annual turnover in the sector being distorted, although 2 per cent
of sales has been the normal ceiling.
Suggestions by officials that British Steel could face an Ecu10m fine are in
line with the lower threshold. The Commission estimates that British Steel's
turnover in the 1990 reference year was about Pounds 400m in steel beams, 2
per cent of which would be roughly Ecu10m. British Steel yesterday said it
was 'most likely' to contest the sanction.
At last night's dinner Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann intended to press
private steelmakers to deliver capacity cuts of up to 25m tonnes as part of
the EU restructuring plan for steel.

Extraordinary technical effort goes into the creation of the Olympics on
television. For every well-groomed presenter, grinning affably across a
flower-laden coffee table, a dozen cameramen, sound recordists and unsung
heroes are out in the snow giving their all for the pictures on your screen.
Add to that the almost overwhelming complexity of the control rooms,
communications networks and graphics systems at the International Broadcast
Centre in Lillehammer and one understands why some old hands in sports
broadcasting still refer to the show as 'the daily miracle.'
Mainstream coverage at each event is the responsibility of NRK, the
Norwegian state broadcaster. However, TV activity at some centres is
delegated to partners with the depth of experience and innovative capacity
to manage the task.
At the luge and bobsleigh tracks, for example, the BBC is charged with
getting the pictures to billions of viewers. Although Britain's gentleman
Alpinists invented the bobsleigh at St Moritz, this is the first time the
BBC has attempted to cover snowland's equivalent of Formula One motor
racing.
'We've spent a lot of time learning and we anticipate having around 28
cameras to cover the two tracks,' said the BBC's executive producer Jim
Reside. 'With so many curves in the two runs, there are places where a
single camera can only catch the competitor for a second or two, but you
must have that shot.
'We've also been experimenting with a high-speed camera which will 'run'
down the track as the bob team accelerates.'
Other broadcasters have been running trials with the winter equivalent of
the miniature cameras mounted on Formula One race cars. Problems have
arisen, ironically, because of the extreme environmental care with which the
bob and luge tracks at Hunderfossen have been constructed.
The overhanging branches of the protected pine trees obscure and break up
the microwave links from the miniature camera to the helicopter overhead.
One possible alternative source of pictures is the blimp which CBS plans to
have overhead during the Games.
Equally radical are CBS plans for 'cap-cam' in the ice-hockey stadium. If
all teams agree, with the assent of the sport's ruling body, each goalkeeper
will have a miniaturised TV camera broadcasting from within his helmet.
Whether or not it will carry sound remains a secret. Perhaps now the
armchair hockey fan will discover what it is the goalkeepers say to
themselves while awaiting a penalty shot.
On the ski slopes, the viewer is promised the advent of yet another 'cam':
this time it is 'rail-cam'. A miniature cable-car, running down rails
parallel to the skier, gives vividly exciting side-shots of the competitor
leaning into bends as the landscape rushes by. It gives a sense of speed
undreamt of by the conventional camera looking up and down the hill.
At the ski-jump, a big concession has been made to the aesthetic
considerations of television. Producers and directors claimed that the
chairlift in the background, normally used to ferry competitors to the
summit, was ruining picture composition.
Following lengthy consultations, the chairs and cables will be removed for
the duration of the Games and competitors will be taken to the start line by
army lorry.
For the BBC, Lillehammer represents another significant technical first. Via
satellite, World Service Television will broadcast the BBC's version of the
Olympics to a considerable new audience outside the UK itself.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (14): No longer the poor
relation - Television fees / Six months ahead of the first skier hitting the
piste, CBS had already sold 85 per cent of all the advertising time
available within its Lillehammer coverage - compared with 60 per cent at the
same time prior to Albertville
</HEADLINE>

If pictures speak louder than words, George Washington on a dollar bill is
the image that shouts loudest of all. The increasing interest and esteem
enjoyed by the Winter Olympics is reflected by the willingness of leading
broadcasters to bid handsomely for the Games that were once the poor
relation of the Olympic family.
CBS, for example, paid Dollars 300m for the American rights to telecast from
Lillehammer. That was Dollars 57m up on the figure for Albertville in 1992,
where CBS was also the rights-holder. Sentiment did not come into the
equation.
'The ratings we had from Albertville were just sensational. Also, the
demographics were far more broadly spread than you would normally see for a
sports show audience in the States: a great many women and older viewers,'
said Mr Barry Zegel, director of the 800-strong CBS beachhead in Norway.
Post-Albertville research released by the International Olympic Committee
showed that in key markets the Winter Games was close behind the summer
Olympiad in terms of appeal. In the US, Spain, and UK combined, nine out of
10 people watched some TV from Barcelona. But an extraordinary seven out of
10 also watched coverage from Albertville, earlier the same year.
The 1992 gross cumulative TV audience - added across all Olympic
transmissions in all countries - is estimated at 24.6 billion (16.6bn for
Barcelona and 8bn for Albertville), compared to only a 17bn total in 1988
(10.4bn for Seoul and 6.6bn for Calgary).
Yet the growth in telecast hours and global audience is not just the result
of the addition of new countries. In the key regions of the US, Europe and
Japan, representing 73 per cent of the world's economy measured by gross
national product, audiences grew since 1988 by 16.2bn; up 38 per cent.
Despite its massive expenditure in Norway - and the logistical effort must
cost at least as much as the rights, although the exact sum is a commercial
secret - CBS is smiling through. Six months ahead of the first skier hitting
the piste, the network had already sold 85 per cent of all the advertising
time available within its Lillehammer coverage - compared with 60 per cent
at the same time prior to Albertville.
American TV industry predictions suggest CBS could make a gross profit of
between Dollars 30m and Dollars 60m on the deal. If so, the negotiations for
the rights to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, will be ferocious. Mr
Dick Ebersol, NBC's boss, is determined to make his channel 'the Olympic
choice' and will fight hard to maintain momentum from Atlanta.
Overall, the Norwegian officials report that the value of the various TV
contracts has increased between 20 and 40 per cent compared with
Albertville. This is despite the fact that Albertville contracts were signed
in a period of economic boom whereas Lillehammer's were signed during the
worst economic depression for two generations.
One thing is certain; that the European Broadcasting Union will never again
pick up an Olympic bargain like Lillehammer, for which they paid a scant
Dollars 24m rights fee. To secure the rights for Barcelona the EBU paid
Dollars 90m; Atlanta cost the consortium Dollars 250m, reflecting both the
increased value of the summer Games and the European market area.
Although the IOC has consistently said that it will not entertain
broadcasters who cannot deliver the majority of a national audience - thus
ruling out many individual satellite operators - the EBU is itself a
consortium. A 'patchwork deal' over the skies of Europe that met the Olympic
body's criteria, and promised more dollars, could further increase the value
of snow and ice.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (17): Parasites on the piste
 -International sponsorship / So-called 'ambush marketing' is the biggest
concern in the International Olympic Committee's commercial sector. It is
not a game but a deadly serious business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is commonplace, whenever sport is discussed, to lament its increasing
'commercialisation'. Everyone likes to hark back to some imagined golden age
before sponsorships, advertising deals and player salaries featuring six
zeros. Such debates are almost as much fun as watching the sport.
Although the TOPIII sponsorship programme will raise the extraordinary sum
of about Dollars 800m for the Olympics in the quadrennium containing the
Lillehammer and Atlanta events, few people realise that Olympic sponsorship
is not new.
Even in the ancient Games, athletes received the backing of wealthy patrons.
When the modern Games were revived in Athens in 1896, the organising
committee faced financial hurdles and sold advertising in a souvenir
programme to help meet the bills. Among the companies taking space was
Kodak, still a leading Olympic sponsor through its participation in the
TOPIII programme.
When the Games visited Stockholm in 1912, rights were granted to several
Swedish companies to take exclusive photographs and sell memorabilia from
the Games. At Paris in 1924, advertising was sold within the main stadium.
This policy has since been reversed and the Olympics are now the only major
international sporting event with no signage at the actual venues.
Although the costs of becoming a TOPIII sponsor are such that only the
biggest multinational companies can take advantage of the global product
exclusivity on offer, the worries of the Olympic movement are now directed
as much to protecting existing partners as to seeking new ones.
'Ambush marketing' is the biggest concern in the International Olympic
Committee's commercial sector. 'It is not a game but a deadly serious
business. One that has the potential to destroy sponsorship,' says Michael
Payne, the IOC's marketing director. 'If ambush marketing is left unchecked
then the fundamental revenue basis of sport will be undermined.'
Unlike official sponsors, who pay significant amounts to help support the
Olympic Games, ambush marketeers pay nothing. In the words of Dick Pound,
unofficial commercial leader among the IOC vice-presidents: 'they try to get
a free ride, which is neither fair, ethical, nor right.' The phenomenon is
becoming known as 'parasitic marketing'.
The distinction is to try to correct the image of gung-ho Robin Hoods taking
from the wicked, wealthy corporate giants. In fact, the ambush tactics are
often adopted by companies bigger than the actual sponsors themselves.
Some of the most common ploys include creating signage or branding within
sight or broadcast of Olympic venues. Airships are a much-tried tactic. In
Barcelona, both Reebok and Fuji had blimps stationed to fly over the city
but these were grounded by IOC legal action.
For a decade, American Express has waged a guerrilla war to combat Visa's
status as an official Olympic sponsor. During 1988, Amex used photos of the
main Olympic stadium in Seoul for a general advertising campaign. Pictures
from the Asian games were retouched to make them look like the Olympics.
During the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, Amex launched an entire print
advertising campaign in France based around the Games. The IOC successfully
sued the company.
'When a company chooses not to be involved with an event and then tries to
borrow or steal the imagery associated with that event, it steals from the
event and the institutions behind it,' says John Bennett of Visa
International.
So far in Lillehammer, most of the problems have been nipped in the bud
before lawyers become involved. However, Lillehammer Olympic Organising
Committee officials are watchful. Ethics are so highly developed in Norway
that any 'ambush' trouble is most likely to come from companies outside the
country.
'Very few Norwegian companies infringe on the rights of sponsors,' said
Asmund Berge of the organising committee. 'However, there have been some
examples of top international firms who have engaged in such activities. We
have had discussions with them and, so far, have been able to sort out the
matter.'
Dick Pound thoroughly disagrees with any advertising managers or marketing
managers who see ambush tactics as imaginative short-cuts for companies
short of resources.
'Cute? Street smart? You must be kidding,' says Pound. 'This is uncreative,
unethical and unprofessional.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (9): Speed-skating
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-track speed-skating has been part of the Winter Olympics since its
inception in 1924. Women were included in 1960. Short-track speed-skating
was a demonstration sport at Calgary in 1988. Short-track was raised to full
Olympic status for 1992 but in a limited form with only one distance for men
(1,000m) and one for women (500m), plus a relay race for each sex. Part of
short-track's appeal is that four or more skaters race against one another -
rather than against the clock. Tactics are vitally important and there are
many thrills and spills. In long-track skating, competitors race in two
against the clock.
Enthusiasts need the skills of an accountant to figure out whether a
competitor is in contention for a medal.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (8): Ice-dance favourites
return - Skating / Torvill and Dean and other top professional skaters are
back in Olympic harness this year. Sandra Stevenson reviews the competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDRA STEVENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The modern era has finally caught up with figure skating and the Winter
Games of 1994 will be considerably richer for it. Amateur and professional
classifications are no more.
This has brought back such audience favourites as Jayne Torvill and
Christopher Dean, Brian Boitano, Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, and
Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev - all past Olympic gold medal
winners.
T &amp; D, as they are widely and affectionately known, brought Britain to a
halt on Valentine's Day 1984, when they won the Olympic gold for ice-dancing
with a spellbinding version of Ravel's Bolero. All nine judges awarded it
6.0 for artistic impression, which had never happened before or since in the
Olympics.
They are still regarded as the world's greatest ice-dancers ever. The
question of whether they can live up to that reputation a decade later was
answered when they won their seventh national title in Sheffield in January.
The judges gave their routine straight 6.0s for artistic impression, a first
for a British championship.
Also back in harness are the skaters who, in magnificent fashion, won the
1988 mens and pairs gold medals at Calgary, American ace Brian Boitano, and
Russians Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.
Boitano, now 30, suffers pain from past injuries and can only skate for a
little over an hour a day. He was second in the recent US championships but
still believes that skating in these Olympics is worth the agony he has
endured.
'Many people ask why I'm doing this,' Boitano says. 'I can't repeat 1988.
That was like angels were lifting me. But I still feel I can skate well and
don't want to reach 60 and be regretting that I never took the opportunity.'
Boitano, like Torvill and Dean, has faced criticism that he has had his turn
and is taking the chances of Olympic competition away from some youngster.
Boitano contends: 'I was never a believer in waiting your turn. If you are
good enough for Olympic selection, then you earn it.'
His fellow American, 22-year-old Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the 1992 womens'
Olympic gold medal, can't understand why anyone would want to lay their
reputation on the line after the door to the lucrative touring ice show
circuit swung open.
'I worked so hard all my life so I could win the gold and become a
professional,' Yamaguchi argues. 'Why would I want to go back and risk
losing it all? Albertville was an incredible experience but at Lillehammer
there would be many more expectations. I'd feel the pressure and it would
discourage me from performing my best.'
Her predecessor, German skater Katarina Witt - who won in 1984 and 1988, and
is the only woman since Sonja Henie to repeat an Olympic singles victory -
says it is the challenge that makes for excitement. Witt, 28, exclaimed: 'I
love a mountain to climb.'
One of the judges at the recent German championship said of Witt: 'For the
technical side, four triple jumps is just average. There are many others who
can do more. But for the artistic mark she is perfect. No other skater can
express her own personality so well through the music except Oksana Bayul
and Bayul is just a child compared to Kati.'
Bayul is a Ukrainian who won the world title at her first attempt last March
 -at the tender age of 15, the youngest since Sonja Henie in 1927. Witt does
not have the variety of triple jumps to match Bayul, Szewczenko or Surya
Bonaly of France, who was runner-up for the world title to Bayul.
Also in the running for gold is Nancy Kerrigan, if the American star is
fully recovered from the attack which prevented her from defending her US
title in January.
None of these rivals take Witt's come-back seriously. But she shrugs off
their dismissals. 'There is a place for me. Many in the audience cannot tell
one jump from another, yet they say my skating is so beautiful it gives them
goosebumps,' says Witt. 'This is what skating is about, not just the most
number of jumps.'
The other returnees are having an easier time than Witt. The 1988 stars
Katya and her now husband Sergei Grinkov had no problem recapturing the
Russian pairs championship at the end of December in which they beat the
current Olympic champions, Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev.
Mishkutenok and Dmitriev had taken a year off to work as professionals but
returned this season and in November trounced the Canadian pair who had
succeeded them as world champions, Isabelle Brasseur and Loyd Eisler.
Brasseur and Eisler, possibly fearing that their chances of Olympic gold are
fading, have strongly criticised the return of the professionals. Britain's
media have tried hard to coax Marika Humphreys and Justin Lanning to play
the same game. In November 1992, Humphreys and Lanning, aged 15 and 19,
became the youngest-ever holders of British ice-dance championships but lost
the title, and the one Olympic berth, to Torvill and Dean.
Lanning admitted he was disappointed when the news that T &amp; D were returning
first emerged, but that has been more than compensated for by the
opportunity the teenagers have had to train alongside their idols.
His partner said: 'When we won they didn't televise the event but this time
there was tremendous interest. That's great for skating and for us. And by
getting into the top three at the world championship, in Japan in March,
Chris and Jayne will earn Britain the right to enter three couples in the
1995 world championships which are in Birmingham.'
The reigning Olympic ice dance champions, Marina Klimova and her husband
Sergei Ponomarenko, are not returning and have been disdainful of Torvill
and Dean's decision. 'They do it for advertisement and promotion,' the
Russian Ponomarenko said on German television.
If T &amp; D win, their market potential will be enormous. No one has come back
to the top after 10 years away. Prior to their Olympic return, the pair had
been in the twilight of their career but winning will almost certainly
revitalise it. They will probably do another ice show tour through Britain,
Australia and the US. 'And if we don't win,' says Torvill, 'We just have to
be big enough to accept that.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (10): Unique challenge of
the Olympics - Skiing / The special appeal of the Games is in the drama of a
make-or-break occasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Many well-known sports correspondents would rather be anywhere than at a
Winter Olympics.
It is not just that Torvill and Dean ice dancing to Let's Face the Music and
Dance offends macho definitions of sport, although that often comes into it.
Not even that competition is so often judgmental or clock-based, lacking the
head-to-head drama of, say, a 100 metres sprint.
Most of the major TV sports are ball-based yet the nearest anyone will get
to a ball at Lillehammer is an ice-hockey puck.
The prime enjoyment of winter sport has to be based on its ethereal nature,
and no part of the world knows this better than Scandinavia, where worship
has for so long attended the weather gods. Outdoor ice and snow are fickle,
elemental products which, when the weather curtain parts and the sun begins
to shine, offer a backdrop which can be pure enchantment.
That much can apply equally to season-long World Cup events as to Winter
Olympics. The special appeal of the Games is in the drama of a make-or-break
occasion.
It is the reason why CBS spent Dollars 300m on the broadcast rights and
another Dollars 75m in production expenses. Moreover the commercial,
advertising-oriented research of US television identifies another
interesting fact: more women watch than men. Of the 184m who swept the
ratings on the 16 nights of the Albertville Games coverage, 57 per cent were
women.
At the height of the women's ice skating final, 28 per cent of American
households were tuned in, while the men's downhill peaked at 25.4 per cent.
Little wonder that a charismatic Olympic champion such as Jean-Claude Killy,
Franz Klammer or Alberto Tomba can become a legend in his own time.
The first of the heroes made by television was Austria's Toni Sailer at
Cortina d'Ampezzo in the black-and-white days of 1956. It was not just that
the 20-year-old Kitzbueheler became the first man to win three Alpine ski
gold medals, or that he was handsome enough subsequently to attempt a film
career. In truth, he was an unknown who won by unprecedented margins.
In his first race, the giant slalom, it was by as much as 6.2 seconds,
representing about 70 yards. Next, Sailer won the slalom four seconds ahead
of Chiharu Igaya, winning Japan's first Winter Olympic medal. Then, just
before the start of the downhill, he broke a leather binding strap.
Borrowing another from a companion, he threaded it just in time to be in the
starting gate.
Ten of the first 24 failed to finish in a temperature of minus 22C but
although Sailer nearly fell when exiting into a bitter wind from some woods,
he went on to win by 3.5 seconds.
It is usually overlooked that another skier, Sixten Jernberg of Sweden,
actually won four medals at these Games. He won a gold in the 50 kilometres
'marathon', plus two silvers and one bronze. But Sailer's feat finally
settled Alpine skiing, so long decried as unmanly by the Nordic countries,
as the most widespread and popular of ski disciplines.
Not even Stein Eriksen's 1952 Oslo performance of giant slalom gold, and
slalom silver, before his own crowd, had quite done that. The Nordic bias
was so strong that organisers printed only 11,000 tickets for the slalom and
another 15,000 watched without paying.
Lillehammer is hardly likely to make that mistake: the final day's slalom
involves Italy's Alberto Tomba seeking slalom gold, uniquely, at his third
Olympics, if he has not already succeeded in the giant slalom. By then all
Norway will be hoping that Kjetil-Andre Aamodt or one of a phalanx of young
Norwegian Alpine skiers will be denying him the prize. That is how much
things have changed.
The inauguration of the Alpine ski World Cup in 1967 linked big races for a
season-long grand prix for the first time. It created a more coherent
platform for the sport and enabled the growing armies of holiday skiers to
see, learn and be entertained via TV.
But neither the World Cup nor the International Ski Federation's own World
Championships, first run by the British at Muerren in 1931, overshadowed the
1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics and Jean-Claude Killy's feat in matching
Sailer with triple gold.
The two performances are not easy to compare. Specialism was emerging. So
was professionalism. And so was increased sophistication in the equipment
industry, which could deliver certain advantages to teams or individuals at
given times.
Killy had some advanced wet-wrap skis involving a kind of mummifying process
offering different properties over the ski length. A soft tip and hard tail
gave him just the instrument he needed for his 'avalement,' a technique
where he appeared to sit back further on his skis and jet out of his turns.
Killy's triple gold came at a convenient point for third-generation,
purpose-built resorts springing up from Geneva down to the Mediterranean.
Killy, cold-shouldering Avery Brundage and the Olympic movement's dying
amateur throes, sold his picture to Paris Match, created a clothes empire he
has bought, sold and rebought, and marketed his lean good looks so
successfully that Albertville had need of him as organising president of its
1992 Games. Even today, the average American asked to name a world skier
would probably answer first: 'Jean-Claude Killy.'
Women skiers have not found equivalent fame, although it is a sport with up
to 40 per cent female participation, with all the influence that represents
in travel, holiday and sartorial terms.
Nancy Greene of Canada won the 1968 giant slalom gold and slalom silver, and
France's Marielle Goitschel and Switzerland's Marie-Therese Nadig all
acquired gold. But the major presence of the 1970s, Austria's Annemarie
Moser-Proell, had to retire and return before attaining her first Olympic
gold in the 1980 Lake Placid downhill.
Rosi Mittermaier of Germany was a charming winner of two golds and a silver
at Innsbruck in 1976. But her fame never came close to that of Franz
Klammer, whose epic run was widely acknowledged as the downhill performance
of all time.
In the Austria of the time you could lose any race except the downhill. And
here was the man from Bad Kleinkirchheim, winner of 19 World Cup races out
of 23 in his prime, required to justify Austria's pride on home snow.
In a fever of excitement, Switzerland's Bernhard Russi, the reigning
champion from the 1972 Sapporo Olympics, set the target for Klammer, going
15th. The intermediate time winked up - Klammer was only third. Then, on the
last third of the course, Klammer seemed to defy both gravity and all known
technique. Arms whirling, legs pumping, off the snow as much as he was on
it, he was under the finishing banner a mere sliver - 0.33 seconds - quicker
than Russi. A new legend was born.
Since then, an army of Swiss have come and gone with Pirmin Zurbriggen and
Peter Mueller lingering in the memory. Italy's Gustavo Thoeni; Sweden's
unexcelled slalom master, Ingemar Stenmark; and the Austrian-born Marc
Girardelli have filled columns of World Cup record books. Thoeni, though,
managed only one Olympic gold - in the giant slalom in 1972. Stenmark
finally made his mark with two golds at Lake Placid in 1980, and Girardelli
has probably his last chance of one at Lillehammer.
Hard as everyone tries to resist the idea that World Cup matters more than
Olympic glory, the truth is different. Individual champions may come and go.
How many outside a small circle will remember Heini Hemmi's giant slalom
gold for Switzerland in 1976, or Barbara Cochran's slalom for the US in
1972? But for the master class the challenge remains.
The unique pressure of an Olympics must be overcome, before the world beyond
skiing's specialist limits bestows the highest accolade.

THE NAMES TO WATCH
Downhill skiing may be the most glamorous Alpine event but it traditionally
had little following in Norway. A young Norwegian named Kjetil-Andre Aamodt
changed all that. His scintillating form in the World Cup, at No 1 for most
of this season, puts him in line for a medal at Lillehammer.
Despite being a World Cup star for week after week, Luxembourg's own Marc
Girardelli has never won Olympic honours. This is probably his last chance.
No one will be watched more closely than the Italian legend Alberto Tomba,
in the slalom. A third consecutive gold medal for Tomba would be a record.
Knowledgeable ski-watchers say, however, that 1994 must be the year of
Patrick Ortlieb, Austria's most famous skier since the days of Franz
Klammer.
The tragic accident of Garmisch-Partenkirchen two weeks ago robbed women's
skiing of a potential Lillehammer medallist. Ulrike Maier had been in
Austria's World Cup squad since 1985.
Supporters of Pirnella Wiberg, the Swedish girl currently lying second in
the World Cup, will not have far to travel to support their best medal
prospect.
Canada's world champion, Kate Pace, is highly rated. And Germany's Katza
Feizinger is the women's downhill favourite.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (4): Turning Point for
Winter Games - Introduction / Norway has seized the opportunity to show that
the Olympics can be run by small communities representing a whole nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Lillehammer represents a genuine turning point for the Winter Games and
possibly the Olympic movement as a whole. A change in timetable means that
Winter and Summer Olympics will now alternate every two years, rather than
being crowded into the same 12 months.
'The Winter events will now come into their own,' predicts IOC president
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 'They used to be seen as the Small Games before the
Big Games but now they will be seen as Olympics in their own right.
Lillehammer is the event of 1994.'
Norway has imaginatively seized the opportunity to show that the Olympics
can be run by small communities representing a whole nation. Lillehammer
embodies a 'small is beautiful' philosophy.
It says everything about the scale of this event that more than half the
population of Lillehammer could be accommodated in the Hakon Hall, where the
ice hockey finals will be played.
'Let us be proud of a small city and a small country's ability to take on
such a huge task as the Olympic Games,' said the community's mayor, Mr Audun
Tron, when he opened the Hakon hall.
Furthermore, Lillehammer has resolutely striven to stage the Games on its
own terms. Much of the luxury, excess and Byzantine protocol that has come
to surround the Olympics and its hierarchy simply has no place in Norwegian
culture - nor will it have.
'Some of the IOC members coming here will not be very happy,' predicted
Gerhard Heiberg, chief of the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee
(LOOC). 'There are no five-star hotels in Lillehammer and we won't be
building any.
'I said to Mr Samaranch at the beginning that the Games will be in Norway
and we want to do things in a Norwegian way - with modesty and nothing
especially luxurious.'
This focus on inherent qualities rather than external glitz has
characterised Lillehammer's programme, from the architecture through to the
hugely successful licensed goods programme.
Here again, Norwegian values set the tone in a sector that is notorious for
ephemeral trash mass produced in the Far East and peddled for a fast profit.
'I just told everyone No Junk. Your product must be unique in its way and
reflect our nation,' says Mr Heiberg.
But it is in the field of environmental development of the Olympics that
Lillehammer has set the pace. The LOOC agenda is described in detail later
in this magazine. The committee has used the Olympics to improve the
environment rather than accepting it as an ugly polluting monster, too
powerful to be turned aside. This has set the pattern for future Games.
Sydney based much of its detailed bid on the philosophies being put into
practice in Norway. Mr Samaranch and his team have advised any aspirant
Games city to learn from what is being done in Lillehammer.
The numbers of competitors and spectators will be higher than ever - not
least because of the passion with which the Norwegian public has taken the
Games to its heart.
Advances in television technology will ensure the best coverage is available
for Lillehammer's worldwide audience. Improved cameras and sound equipment -
and faster results systems - will enhance broadcasts.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (6): Spin-off for Norwegian
industry - Commercial benefits / The commercial star of the Winter Games is
the programme for officially licensed products. Revenues are expected to be
five times higher than originally projected in 1990
</HEADLINE>

Lillehammer called its national sponsorship programme Team Birkebeiner -
named after a 13th century group of royalists renowned in Norway for their
daring rescue of a young prince from rebel forces. It is a title that
conveys a sense of strength and resourcefulness to all Norwegians.
The activities of Team Birkebeiner comprise the biggest Norwegian component
out of a total projected income for the Lillehammer Olympic Organising
Committee (LOOC) of NKr2.5bn. Other sources of revenue are ticket sales,
licensed goods, and the sale of TV rights - handled, in practice, by the
International Olympic Committee.
Nine Scandinavian sponsors - Volvo, IBM, Statoil, Norwegian Post, TBK
(telecommunications), ABB (climate control), Sparebanken, Procordia, and
Norwegian Telecomm - have contributed a total of NKr390m to the Games. A
further 17 smaller companies have signed up as official suppliers, worth a
budgeted NKr75m.
However, the commercial star of the Winter Games is the programme for
officially licensed products, with revenues five times higher than
originally projected in 1990. The final income will probably exceed NKr100m,
on a total turnover of NKr946m - all returning to Norwegian factories and
workshops.
Goods range from Olympic knives - where the producer has had to introduce an
extra production shift to cope with demand - to fine porcelain and T-shirts.
Judith Gloppen, LOOC project leader for licensed products, believes the
success is due to an aesthetically-led design programme, careful selection
of producers, and strict quality control. The cheap rubbish sold from
pavement stalls at most leading sports events would be totally out of place
in Norway.
'Out of more than 1,000 applicants who came to us with licensed product
ideas, only 35 were accepted,' says Ms Gloppen. 'In close co-operation with
the LOOC, they have developed more than 150 different products based on our
own design elements.' Novel themes include ancient Norwegian rock carvings
and traditional elements of Norwegian culture.
Another success is the extent to which clothing incorporating the
Lillehammer and Olympic logos has become fashionable among young people -
from toddlers to teenagers - right across the country. Every sweater
contributes to the cost of the show.
Official estimates suggest that 300 permanent and 450 temporary jobs have
been created by the products. The IOC was so impressed by the range of goods
that they have been put on display in the newly-opened Olympic Museum in
Lausanne and Olympic president Samaranch has urged future Games host cities
to base their programmes on Lillehammer's precepts.
No Olympics would be complete without mascots. Kristin and Hakon, child
dolls from Norway's folklore, are a good deal more tasteful than many
previous examples. A consignment of 60,000 has recently been sent to Italy,
and they are selling well in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the US.
In Japan, where officials are already limbering up for the 1998 Winter
Games, marketing rights for Lillehammer products fetched a remarkable
NKr10m.
In Norway itself, one of the biggest breakthroughs has been in the
construction of new venues using the most advanced techniques in timber
structures. The new methods are attracting international interest to one of
the country's most important industries.
Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre is the world's largest modern timber building.
'Until Hamar was built, the longest clear span in laminated wood was 66
metres. This has now increased to 96.4 metres,' said Frode Alhaug, chief
executive of timber group Moelven Industrier.
'What has been created here has shifted the boundaries of what can be
achieved with wood; in terms of size, span of load-bearing elements and fire
safety,' he added.
Some 2,000 Norwegian companies have supplied goods or services to the
build-up in Lillehammer. Many have had to expand or learn new skills to do
so. But there is a feeling abroad that the Olympics has brought Norwegian
industry forward a generation in just four years.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (3): Message from the
sponsors - Seiko
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Challenge is the essence of sport. Each and every Olympic Games comes alive
when the world sees young men and women who have the courage to put on
display their skill, their passion for excellence and their will to win. For
these athletes, the next 16 days in Lillehammer will be the ultimate
challenge of their sporting lives.
Seiko represents this spirit of challenge and will do justice to it by
providing to the athletes and their events the highest level of timing
technology ever seen at a winter sports event. Since 1964 when our
appointment as Official Timer to the Summer Olympic Games was the catalyst
for Seiko to develop Quartz Timing Technology, we have continuously set new
standards and accepted the challenge posed by the ever-increasing needs of
sport for timing systems accurate to the millisecond and capable of
instantaneous transmission to spectators, athletes and TV viewers
world-wide.
To our technology partners in the Olympic Family; to the Organiser of the
Games; and, most of all, to the athletes; we offer our commitment to help
Lillehammer 1994 be the best Winter Games in history.

Kodak has been associated with the Olympics for many years, both as a
sponsor and provider of imaging products and services.
At Lillehammer, our ID system will help strengthen the security set up to
safeguard the athletes and spectators at the Games. We will speed diagnosis
and treatment of injuries by enabling the digital transmission of
radiographic images. Our cameras will supply images which can be downloaded
to a computer for viewing, editing and transmission - and our Photo CD
system will store and manage picture files.
Information is the breath of modern life. The way we communicate that
information will either help or hinder the way we understand and assimilate
it. This supplement has been designed to enhance our knowledge of the Winter
Games and the ideals of the Olympic movement. We are delighted to be a part
of it.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (16): Towards greener Games
 -Environmental issues / Plates and eating utensils at the Olympic village
are made from potato starch. Mixed with food scraps, they can either be fed
to pigs or used to form garden compost
</HEADLINE>

A bird sanctuary was the environmental turning point for the Lillehammer
Games.
In the early planning stages of the Olympic projects, 'green' protestors
seemed to oppose virtually every scheme that the Organising Committee put
forward. Then the proposed siting of the Hamar Olympic Hall close to the
bird sanctuary became an issue.
Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee (LOOC) chief Mr Gerhard Heiberg
says he had a feeling at the time that it was going to be better to join the
environmentalists rather than to fight them. 'I asked them to co-operate
with us at every stage and consider the ecology and the environment before
we got to fighting over specific plans and drawings,' recalls Mr Heiberg.
That was three years ago but it turned out to be an inspired move.
In the case of the bird sanctuary, the Hamar Hall was built on the same
site, but the entire building was rotated through 180 degrees. This meant
that the doors faced away from the nesting grounds, thus minimising the
disruption as spectators used the building.
'Since local authority planning permission had already been given, we could
have ignored the lobbyists' concerns,' says Mr Osmund Ueland, the LOOC's
environmental director. 'But the solution was satisfactory to all sides. The
conflict led to a constructive dialogue with environmental groups.
'Our goal since then has been to influence the decision-making process ahead
of time, instead of dealing with conflicts and protests afterwards.'
Throughout the construction phase of the Lillehammer venues, enormous
attention has been paid to the impact on the area's visual amenity. The two
ski-jumps in the Olympic park are a break with tradition in that both
launching ramps are well below the level of the surrounding pine trees.
From the town and the highways approaching Lillehammer they are barely
visible - except, of course, when floodlit at night. The soil and rock
blasted from the mountain has been used to create natural spectator
amphitheatres around the run-out zones.
At the bobsleigh and luge tracks near Hunderfossen, 15km from Lillehammer,
even greater care was taken when building the concrete chutes, more than a
kilometre long, that meander down the forested mountainside. In Norway there
is no tradition of either sport and traditionalists were reluctant to see a
native forest virtually felled to provide a facility alien to the region.
Building companies signed contracts accepting penalty clauses of up to
NKr50,000 a tree if they were to fell even one more pine than the plans
directed. The consequence is that from the judging area at the finish of the
runs - where the competitors hurtle past at up to 120kph - the bulk of the
circuit is completely invisible.
Many spectators for the cross-country and biathlon events will take to the
forest and watch the event from the trackside rather than a grandstand. Many
 -and Lillehammer's mayor Mr Audun Tron is one of them - will obtain permits
to build a camp in the woods and stay several days. Around a gapahur - a
simple shelter made from branches - and cooking over a campfire, the mayor
and numerous others like him will commune with nature. And afterwards, they
will remove all their rubbish.
Technology is helping to ease the environmental impact of the thousands of
athletes and media who will stay in Lillehammer. Plates and eating utensils
at the Olympic village are made from potato starch. Mixed with food scraps,
they can either be fed to pigs or rotted down to form garden compost.
Several plates have already been eaten in the cause of publicity by LOOC
officials and pronounced edible, if less than delicious.
During the Games, specially marked bins for sorting refuse will sprout
throughout Lillehammer and 150 Team '94 volunteers will be encouraging
spectators and others to dispose of their refuse in an ecologically sensible
manner.
During the biathlon, competitors will fire an estimated 8 tonnes of lead
bullets from their rifles. Behind the targets, specially designed machines
will collect the lead before it can leach into the soil.
Some environmental issues are less visible to the naked eye - energy
consumption, for example. Engineers have proved adept at meeting new
demands.
In Grovik, 40 minutes' drive to the south of Lillehammer, the Olympic Cavern
Hall has been blasted inside a mountain. Many of the early round ice hockey
matches will be played here. The naturally constant temperature inside the
rock keeps heating costs at less than half those for comparable venues.
Environmental protection clauses have been included in contracts between
LOOC and all of the official sponsors - including international members of
the TOPIII programme. Kodak is adapting the laboratory where as many as
5,000 rolls of film a day are likely to be processed, to produce fewer toxic
chemicals.
Coca-Cola has been busy developing environmentally friendly disposable cups.
Xerox has its own ecologically-tested plan for the re-cycling of paper,
chemicals and toner containers during the Games. Already, almost every LOOC
publication comes on recycled paper.
None of these measures has been ignored by the Olympic movement. When Sydney
won the right to stage the summer Games in 2000, the International Olympic
Committee asserted that the success of the bid had been in part due to its
concern for the built environment around Sydney Harbour.
Olympics president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his officials are alert to
every nuance that affects the public perception of Olympism. Environmental
concerns now figure so large with the public around the world that the IOC
has joined the chorus.
Since Sydney's success and the eco-blessing of the Olympic movement,
virtually every city planning to bid in the next decade has been visiting
Lillehammer to carry out an environmental audit on its own plans. It is
plain that henceforth only the Green will inherit the Games.
'We have tried to achieve a third dimension in the Games. Sport and culture
are already in the charter and now we want to add the environment,' says Mr
Ueland.
He is pleased with the positive reaction from both the IOC and the world at
large, stressing that there is a new perception of the Olympics to be gained
 -as a force for environmental effort in the host city.
'We must never forget that the Olympics are an international gathering of
peoples; a unique opportunity to exchange ideas, ideals and understanding
between different cultures,' says Mr Ueland. He believes that the IOC will
place codified environmental demands upon future Olympic organisers.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (12): The agony and the
ecstasy - Bobsleigh / You have as much influence on your direction, speed or
destiny as a stowaway on a space shuttle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riding a four-man bob as a helpless, ineffectual passenger clinging
desperately to the half-ton (when fully laden) steel and fibreglass machine,
you have as much influence on your direction, speed or destiny as a stowaway
on a space shuttle.
As the meat in the sandwich, you have no choice but to trust implicitly the
man in front (the driver) and the man at the back (the brakeman). Until the
1920s you would have encountered women bobsleighers too, but rather like the
Cresta Run, women are no longer officially allowed to compete
professionally. There is also an age restriction for men: you cannot race in
competitions if you are under 18.
If this were the real thing, the man normally sitting in your seat would
have a function: to 'Bob' backwards and forwards with the other two
rear-crew members. Hence the name. By leaning backwards at an extreme angle
and then snapping forward in unison, the Bobbers' action sharply accelerates
the speed of the sleigh.
The British invented bobsleighing, in St Moritz a century ago. After another
good World Cup year they are still a force to be reckoned with. It was in
1890 that two Britons tied two toboggans together and slid down the high
street, causing considerable commotion. To this day, St Moritz is one of the
few resorts where ordinary members of the public can try the four-man bob.
It is a nerve-racking experience. You and another apprehensive tourist
squeeze yourselves between the two professionals and pretend not to be
quaking with fear as the glistening but cumbersome contraption drifts -
agonisingly slowly at first - towards the first bend. So far, not too bad;
you tell yourself. Perhaps it will all be over so quickly you will not have
time to panic. No such luck.
Irrevocably, the monster gathers speed. Having survived the first bend, you
brace yourself for the next. No turning back now] You peep through your
tightly-clenched eyes just long enough to realise that the bends are coming
thicker and faster at impossible, almost vertical, angles. You feel as
though you are on a frozen wall of death. How can you possibly revert to the
horizontal again after flirting so brazenly with the vertical? Surely you
will hurtle helplessly into space at any moment]
When it is all over you have to pretend it was a breeze. With a casual grin
which belies your still pumping heart, you accept your certificate, signed
by Gunther Sachs - there has always been more than a hint of a playboy
element about the sport. The certificate comes complete with a photograph
taken on the way down to prove you have survived a minute or so of agony and
ecstasy. The ecstasy occurs when you stop.
St Moritz is one of the most celebrated 'natural' bobsleigh tracks built
each year out of snow. Cortina and Cervinia in Italy have other examples.
These natural tracks - which vary each year in design and speed - are
generally thought to be more intimidating and therefore a better test of a
good bobsleigher than the kind of artificial tracks found in Olympic
locations such as La Plagne, Igls, Lake Placid, Calgary and the track at
Hunderfossen to be used for the Games at Lillehammer. Most courses average
just over 1,300 metres.
The track at St Moritz is considered to be the fastest in the world,
rivalled only by the Mount Van Hoevenberg run in Lake Placid, New York, some
of whose 26 turns are more than 30 feet high, with walls that are almost
vertical.
According to the BBA (British Bobsleigh Association): 'A mixture of
strength, speed and driving ability is required' to be a successful
bobsleigher.
There is no mention of courage - perhaps that is unspoken, but without that
quality the other three are a little academic if you are chasing glory at
the highest level.
Racing sleighs have been known to clock speeds of up to 118mph although
between 60 and 70mph is more the norm.
Traditionally, what was formerly East Germany dominated bobsleighing. The
government there invested more than Pounds 10m in the sport over a period of
20 years and to this day, the most sought-after four-man sleighs come from a
factory in Dresden.
The standard model is almost 3.5m long, and runs on four steel runners which
are polished by hand to a mirror finish each day by the crews.
The sleigh's weight bearing down on the runners melts the ice at the point
of contact, and the sleigh actually runs on a thin film of water. The sleigh
costs more than Pounds 14,000 and even a set of runners can cost anything
from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 8,000. According to the BBA 'There are no rich
men left in the sport - only sponsors and governments]'
The two-man version, at 3.1m long, is only a slightly less awesome mass of
hurtling steel, flesh and bone: the maximum weight with crew is almost 0.4
tonnes.
The British team - with Mark Tout performing exceptionally well and Sean
Olsson also getting good results in both the four-man and two-man events
last year - will be disappointed if they don't bring back a medal or two
from Lillehammer.
After my brief but terrifying encounter with the sport in St Moritz, I think
they deserve a medal just for completing the course.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (5): Will small be
beautiful? - Lillehammer in context / There are already signs that these
Games may avoid some of the problems associated with previous Winter
Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The selection of a location for the Winter Olympics has always thrown up
more dilemmas and anomalies than the summer counterpart. Few sites in the
climate necessary for winter sports have the resources necessary to cope
with the influx of contestants, officials, spectators and media, and, in
particular, with the demands of television.
The commercialisation of the Winter Olympics - and the professional status
of some of the competitors - also appear in sharper relief against a
background of snow-covered hills. Indeed, Avery Brundage, president of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1952 to 1972 believed the Winter
Games had no place in the Olympic movement, a view which has long since
given way under the subsequent regimes of Lord Killanin and Juan Antonio
Samaranch to a new policy of accepting commercial realities while trying to
avoid the worst excesses.
The question, therefore, is whether the Lillehammer games, which take place
only two years after the last games at Albertville in order to put summer
and winter games on different four-year cycles, can resolve these dilemmas
and create an event which will be both successful and fully in line with
Olympic ideals.
It does start with the advantage of a central Olympic Village based on a
town of 23,000. Its predecessor in 1992, Albertville in France, was
criticised as a Games wholly tailored to TV. To the athletes, Albertville
was a set of disparate, mini world championships, not an Olympics where they
could chat and pass time with people from other disciplines, a serious
objective of any Games.
In Norway, seven of the 12 sports, as well as the opening and closing
ceremonies, will be staged in Lillehammer's Olympic Park - all its
facilities merged carefully with the terrain in what must be the most
environmentally sensitive Winter Games.
The Birkebeineren Ski Stadium hosting the cross-country is a part of it, and
within walking distance of the town centre. The free-style skiing stadium is
also here, staging aerials for the first time as a full event, and the
moguls (bumps) introduced at Albertville.
The ski jumps are fashioned against a nearby hillside 'like a drop of
liquid.' It is, we are told, an architectural solution to the problem of
accommodating 120-metre and 90-metre jumps and 50,000 spectators.
The Hakon Hall, housing the big ice hockey matches, is also designed to
blend into the landscape as one of the many 'green goals' which the
organising committee has set for itself.
Fifty kilometres and about an hour's drive to the north, Kvitfjell will
stage the men's and women's downhill and super giant slalom. Its style is
more Canadian, even Scottish, than Alpine. The 3,150-metre downhill course
falls 850 metres from the treeless heights of Norway's geologically ancient
mountains through a belt of forest, pastures, then more conifers, to the
valley floor. One big jump just before the finish will send racers flying
over the Oslo-Trondheim railway line.
Bernhard Russi, Switzerland's former Olympic and world downhill champion,
has designed it with much more chance of approbation than was won by Val
d'Isere's visually stunning but cliff-like course which had even the
champion, Austria's Patrick Ortlieb, declaring he would never want to ski it
again. The checks were so fierce that at one point near the end the racers
almost ground to a halt.
Slaloms are at Hafjell, down-valley from Kvitfjell, while on the other flank
of Lake Mjosa, at the outpost of Hunderfossen, bobsleigh and luge are
serviced by runs almost invisible except when floodlit at night.
The southernmost venues, about an hour south of Lillehammer, are at Hamar, a
small town where the ice rink will host figure skating, short-track skating
and speed skating. Hamar's Olympic Hall resembles a massive Viking longship
turned upside down. Equally striking is the nearby Gjovik ice rink. It is a
massive underground cavern blasted out of the rock in the centre of the town
and entered via a 150-metre tunnel. Some of the ice hockey will be staged
there.
Norway's pride is that it is the cradle of skiing. The Nordic Games long
pre-dated the Olympics and the role of the melancholy but remarkable
peasant, Sondre Norheim, in fashioning the modern ski shape and fixed
binding, is as fetching as that of Fridtjof Nansen. The explorer's book By
Ski Across Greenland, published in 1890 and translated into many languages,
alerted the world outside Scandinavia to the pleasures of skiing.
When the XVII Winter Olympic Games are completed on February 27, eight men
will leave Lillehammer on the 16,000-kilometre journey to Nagano, Japan -
hosts of the 1998 Games - using only man, dog and sail-power as they
traverse the northern coastline of Russia and Siberia before crossing the
Bering Strait to Alaska and thence by Aleutian Island hops to Japan.
With all their modern contrivance, the Olympics retain a thread of community
spirit. The Norwegian ski teams are raising what funds they can for the city
of Sarajevo, where the ski hills now are used for shelling. Lillehammer's
XVII Games will surely convey a better message to the world.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (11): Nothing is left to
chance - Ski technology / Olympic skiers are constantly seeking new
developments in the shape and structure of skis to help them go faster. But
is the skill of skiing being eclipsed by its hardware?
</HEADLINE>

Downhill ski racing, one of the fastest Olympic sports in which speeds of
80-90mph are often achieved, might leave the Olympic founders turning in
their graves.
Surrounded by the kind of road show more normally seen in Formula One motor
racing, ski racers receive the attentions and obsessions of coaches,
physiotherapists, waxing specialists and video technicians.
Armed with different pairs of skis for each snow temperature, nothing is
left to chance. Results hinge on hundredths of a second and the slimmest
advantages can be worth extracting. Surprise equipment can be a useful
gambit.
Franz Klammer, appearing at the 1976 Innsbruck Games with large holes in his
ski tips, achieved a publicity sensation for his then ski sponsor, Fischer.
The tip of a ski creates a little pocket of air turbulence, so the open tip
was more than a talking point. There was a desperate scramble to copy the
idea until ski makers realised they could achieve the same result by simply
shortening and reducing the height of the tip.
In common with all technology-tied sports, competitors are strictly
regulated. The International Ski Federation (FIS) lays down rules on what
equipment is, and is not, permitted. Several years ago, a Scottish inventor
came up with a device that would pump a lubricant through holes in a ski to
reduce its friction against snow. The FIS banned this device because it
might pollute the snow for subsequent racers.
More recently, controversy has surrounded the use of another speed-enhancing
accessory called the Derbyflex and now known as the Deflex. This is an alloy
suspension unit like a shallow bridge, screwed into the top of the ski, on
to which the bindings are mounted. Under the suspension plate lies a
dampening layer of viscoelastic material that absorbs shocks from the ski.
Skis fitted with the Deflex proved to be so fast when first used a few
winters ago that racers rushed to pay cash for the device - unheard of in a
sport where top racers are themselves paid handsomely to bolt their feet to
designated ski brands.
Skiing on a raised platform has other advantages. Firstly, the ski has less
of a flat spot under the boot; it flexes more naturally and hugs the terrain
more closely. Secondly, the racer gains extra leverage in turning the ski;
the tilting of the boot is transmitted more into a carving effect at the
ski's edges.
Racers are now fitting riser pads to take their boots even higher. I am
using 1 centimetre spacers,' says British downhiller Martin Bell. 'In
addition to the Deflex, that means I am now 2.2 cm above the ski (almost one
inch). The boots drag less in soft snow which could be another speed
advantage.'
It is a distinct reversal from the position a few years ago, when racers
insisted on having their feet as close and sensitive to the snow as
possible, sometimes by thinning out the soles of their ski boots.
The under-surface of a ski is, of course, its primary speed component. The
ski base - a sheet of polyethylene only two millimetres thick, edged by
thin, sharpened, strips of steel - has always been a subject of myth and
fetish. Service technicians spend hours grinding, filing, waxing, scraping
and polishing ski soles.
Recently, the emphasis has switched from waxing the sole to 'structuring'
it. Structuring is the brushing or grinding of tiny grooves into the smooth
plastic surface to break up suction, which is a particular problem in
warmer, wetter snow.
A ski-maker's real secrets are locked into the core of the ski, and the many
layers of advanced materials above and below the core. In spite of the use
of advanced alloys and composite materials, wood remains the chosen core
material. Many racers, however, know very little about the constituent
materials of their skis and the racing divisions of ski factories are run as
semi-autonomous and secret departments.
The outer shape of skis has generated much discussion recently. Equipment
market leader Salomon launched its 'monocoque' ski four years ago and
insists that this form of chassis, where an outer shell of composite
materials controls the performance of the ski, supersedes traditional ski
construction.
Salomon has started to make the break in terms of winning race medals but
its competitors continue to win races with conventional skis where the
construction emphasis is more on the ski's innards.
At the Albertville Olympics, racers took the unusual step of choosing
shorter, slower skis simply to get down the run intact. The steep, testing,
Bellevarde Face downhill above Val d'Isere contained so many tight turns
that most racers reduced their ski lengths by up to 8 cm simply to get
through the gates. The normal length of 223cm became 215cm. At Lillehammer,
on a more gliding course, racers are likely to be back on 223s.
One element of a racer's kit is so critical and personal that changes are
viewed with a mixture of suspicion and superstition: ski boots.
Ski racers - much to the frustration of the manufacturers of high-gloss,
colourful, new models - often use boots that are several seasons old. The
shells are often hacked about to create the right flex pattern, sometimes
with additional pieces bolted on. The inner boot is often in embarrassingly
tatty condition, usually custom foamed for the closest fit, but often with
pieces shaved away or specially layered with extra pads.
Because Norway's mountains are less steep and testing than the Alps - the
highlight of the skiing at Lillehammer will be the Nordic cross-country and
jumping events. Here, technology has had a gentler impact, but is equally
influential.
Watch out for the first examples of cable-free bindings under the feet of
Nordic ski jumpers. These are new bindings that grip the toe of the boot
without the aid of a cable pulling it forward at the heel.
In cross-country skiing, the recent introduction of a 'skating' technique,
where skiers propel themselves by pulling one ski out of the track and
diagonally skating it, is having a marked effect on the kind of boots used.
More ankle support is needed from the boot, with bindings and skis that
maximise the driving effect of the skate. No other area of ski equipment
puts lightness at such a premium.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (13): Why another US
miracle' is unlikely - Ice hockey / Norman de Mesquita takes a look at the
background to the Olympics event, and suggests which teams might earn a
medal in this year's tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I happened to be in New York on Friday February 22, 1980: that famous Friday
on which the United States, represented by a bunch of college kids, beat the
might of the Soviet Union at Lake Placid to come within one win of Olympic
gold.
The atmosphere in New York that Friday evening was very reminiscent of
London in 1966 when England had won football's World Cup. People who had no
regular interest in sport of any kind and who could not tell a hockey puck
from a red line, were caught up in the emotion of the event.
For the Americans, of course, it was very much a case of 'us against them'
and the win was seen as a triumph of democracy over what were seen as the
evils of communism.
Americans are very insular and generally care very little about
international sport. That is why the play-off between their two leading
baseball teams is known as the World Series' and why the team which wins the
National Basketball Association finals will be referred to as World
Champions'.
But success breeds interest and anything perceived as the best will arouse
interest as well. So the World Cup will give football a high profile in the
US, albeit temporarily.
In Winter Olympic terms, ice hockey is one of the very few events to arouse
the Americans' interest. The expansion of the National Hockey League (NHL)
to sunnier climes and the establishment of franchises in such unlikely
locations as Miami, Dallas and Anaheim means that the sport has a higher
profile than in the past and it is certainly followed more keenly than such
events as the luge or Nordic cross-country, which remain a closed book to
most Americans.
The non-availability of the best US players makes any chance of a repeat of
the Lake Placid 'miracle' unlikely. The same applies in Canada and, to a
lesser extent, in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. Many of
the leading players now play for NHL teams and the league is reluctant to
close down for something like three weeks and make them available.
While basketball, a winter sport but part of the summer Olympics, can send a
'dream team' to represent the US, it is only for the occasional Canada Cup
that their ice hockey team can be at full strength.
Upsets are few and far between in Olympic ice hockey. Canada dominated the
event in its early days, with only Britain's controversial success at
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936 interrupting their sequence of titles, from
1920 until 1952.
Then the Soviet Union came on the scene and brought a new dimension to the
sport in 1956 with the emphasis on the aesthetic qualities of ice hockey
rather than its physical excesses. The US sprang a surprise at Squaw Valley
in 1960, but Soviet domination returned from 1964 until Lake Placid in 1980.
Canada, in the meantime, withdrew from Olympic competition, objecting to
what they saw as the professionalism of the Soviet Union's 'amateurs.' But
they returned in 1980 and have taken part ever since.
Their chances of success this year are remote. For the World Championships,
which are held in the middle of April, a number of NHL players are
available, their teams having been eliminated from the play-offs. But this
is not the case at the end of February. Those players who have spent the
season with the Canadian national team are somewhat resentful of the arrival
of the top professionals in April and it is not conducive to team spirit.
There will be no such problems in Lillehammer, but it seems likely that
Canada together with the US, will field supporting players, rather than the
top stars.
For the first time, Russia will compete as an independent nation, which
means that, strictly speaking, there are no defending champions because the
1992 gold medal went to the Unified Team. Any Ukrainians or Latvians who
appeared in Meribel will not be in Lillehammer. And, for the first time in
Olympic competition, the Czech Republic could face Slovakia.
For Peter Stastny, a 13-year veteran of the NHL, it will be a dream come
true. When Slovakia beat Latvia in an Olympic qualifying tournament in
Sheffield last August, he described it as, 'the most exciting moment in my
life. It is far more exciting than playing for Quebec Nordiques in the
Stanley Cup play-offs or for Czechoslovakia in the world championships. This
time I am playing for my own country; a new country.'
Just as most of the best players in the Soviet and Unified teams were from
Russia, so most of the best Czechoslovakian players were Czech rather than
Slovakian. But Slovakia showed themselves to be some way ahead of Latvia in
the Sheffield tournament and this could be ominous news for the other
competing nations in Lillehammer.
Sweden, runners-up in 1992, will probably be a force once again, but it is
hard to look beyond Russia as the likely winners with the Czech Republic and
Slovakia as the probable dark horses.

FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (15): Invisible electronics
are the key - Results service / Light beams on the ice surface will trigger
equipment capable of timing speed skaters to one hundredth of a second.
Commentator information systems will disseminate worldwide the results of
events within one second
</HEADLINE>

Performances have improved remarkably but the basics of skiing and skating
have changed little since the Winter Olympics were last held in Norway. The
technology underpinning the management of the Games has undergone a
revolution, however.
The timing, data processing and security systems which will be used in
Lillehammer would have seemed miraculous to competitors and spectators in
Oslo, 42 years ago.
Even by today's standards, they are something special. Light beams on the
ice surface will trigger electronic equipment capable of timing speed
skaters to one hundredth of a second - one thousandth of a second on the
luge. The results of events will be disseminated worldwide within one second
of the finish.
Complete and detailed maps of each site and every location, down to
individual chairs and tables, are available from a computer database at the
touch of a button. Police resources will be monitored by satellite and
controlled by a computer system developed by Andersen Consulting.
Technological innovation extends to the physical environment of the Games.
Advanced construction techniques have been used to create structures of
remarkable grace and strength. The laminated wood beams which support the
vaulted roof of the 22,000 sq m. Olympic Hall at Hamar, to be used for speed
skating, are an unprecedented 96m in length. A special low-vibration
dynamite was used to blast a vast cavern 120m into a mountain side in
Gjoevik to create an ice hockey rink. The houses nestling on the mountain
suffered nothing more than a few broken windows.
But it is the electronic systems, invisible to competitors and spectators
alike, that are the technological wonder of Lillehammer. They fall into
three main categories:
First, the timing and scoring systems, the responsibility of Seiko of Japan.
The company is spending some Dollars 10m to install and operate systems for
the 11 events where a competitor's time is the only guide to his or her
performance-including speed-skating, downhill and cross-country skiing.
Some 80 technicians, 15 managers and 300 specially trained volunteers will
be on site during the Games to tend the equipment which must be able to
perform at temperatures down to -20C.
Seiko's technology is simple in principle. The competitors break light beams
which trigger electronic timers. Time and speed are computed automatically
and fed to the judges and to the results and media information services.
There are, for example, nine sets of light beam units, each comprising two
beams 10 metres apart, down the Alpine skiing course. A competitor's time
and speed can be monitored all the way to the finish.
The trick, however, is to make the equipment work every time in sometimes
appalling conditions. There are contingency plans to prevent moose
interfering with the equipment.
Seiko technicians switch on each beam unit as a competitor approaches to
prevent, say, a rabbit leaping across the course and triggering the timers.
The company is using its new HD1000 slit video system to replace
conventional photo-finish equipment for the short track speed-skating. The
Seiko system scans an ultra-thin line precisely aligned with the finish
1,000 times a second. The resulting high definition image is stored in
semiconductor memory and is immediately available for replay and
examination.
Wet process photography, by comparison, can take as long as two minutes for
developing, printing and reading.
Second, the information technology systems. International Business Machines,
the world's largest computer manufacturer, has signed an agreement with the
International Olympic Committee through which it will provide computer
systems for the next four Olympics, summer and winter. IBM will also act as
project manager for the army of software houses and systems integrators
developing special systems for the Games.
One advantage will be that systems developed for one Olympics can be
improved and used in future Games.
The Olympic Commentator Information System (CIS), for example, source of the
flood of results and information about competitors that will emerge from
Lillehammer during the 16 days of the Games, was developed originally more
than a decade ago by a handful of students at Sarajevo university. Now, IBM
and an Oslo-based consultancy, Avenir, have turned it into an
easy-to-operate system for the radio and television commentators covering
the Games.
Mr Erik Anderson, Avenir senior consultant with responsibility for the CIS,
recalls his shock on being told that none of the commentators would be
available for training. They would expect to be expert after five minutes'
familiarisation. Keyboards and elaborate computer commands were out. The
answer has been IBM's top-of-the-range PS/2 personal computers with
touch-sensitive screens and colourful graphics.
IBM is providing enough computers to equip a large commercial company. Three
large mainframes, two in Oslo and another - for security - in a secret site,
provide the raw computing power. Some 3,000 workstations and 500 printers
will disseminate the results. More than 150 IBM engineers will be on call
during the Games to maintain the equipment.
Everything has been duplicated for security,' says Mr Dag Sanne, director of
management services for IBM Norway. While the technology is sophisticated,
it is also tried and tested. The data processing load is not huge, but there
can be no irrecoverable failures during the two weeks of competition.
For the first time in the Olympics, IBM is combining conventional mainframe
data processing with networks of personal computers. It makes possible 'Info
'94', a comprehensive information system available to all 50,000 or so
accredited personnel - athletes, team officials, journalists and Games staff
 -during the Games. All that is needed to gain access to the system is an
accreditation number. The terminals have touch screens and users can rapidly
find results, biographies and weather reports - or send electronic mail
messages to each other.
The final category is administration and management. Computer-aided design
methods have been used to develop a pictorial record of every site and
location. The system has proved invaluable for the planning, design,
building and detailed management of every arena and building, down to
signposts and fences.
The Lillehammer Olympic committee was able to save NKr5m by being able to
calculate exactly how much security fencing would be required. In previous
Games, whole barnloads of tables, for example, have been found surplus to
requirements after the competitions ended.
Accreditation, ticketing and accommodation systems complete the package.
Many have been adapted from systems used in the last Winter Olympics in
Albertville, France. Written using a computer-aided software engineering
technology developed by Andersen Consulting, it took, according to Mr Frode
Finne, the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee's management systems
project leader, only a couple of weeks to convert the French systems to
Norwegian.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alcatel to win Framatome control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, engineering and transport
company, appears set to gain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear
power station group, according to an official at France's atomic energy
authority.
Mr Philippe Rouvillois, the general director of CEA Industrie, who has been
charged by the government to draw up plans to privatise Framatome, said that
Alcatel Alsthom was likely to be offered a further 15 per cent of
Framatome's shares in addition to its existing stake of 44 per cent.
In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Rouvillois
said that Alcatel Alsthom could be offered part of CEA Industrie's stake in
Framatome and the 5 per cent of Framatome held by Credit Lyonnais, the
state-owned bank.
EdF, the state electricity group would maintain its holding in Framatome at
10 per cent and the 5 per cent stake held by Framatome employees would also
be unaffected.
The proposed share structure would leave the state with a blocking stake of
about 34 per cent, according to Mr Rouvillois. 'This would guarantee the
preservation of essential interests in nuclear policy and in the company's
co-operation with Siemens of Germany.' said Mr Rouvillois.
The conclusion of the deal is expected to be reached within the next two or
three months, according to Mr Rouvillois, following the valuation of the
shares in the nuclear power station company and approval by the
privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government
on the sale of state assets.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, has made no secret of his desire to
gain control of Framatome. He believes the two groups would complement each
other, with Framatome's strength in the construction of nuclear power
stations combining with Alcatel Alsthom's presence in conventional power
generation.
The Daya Bay project in China, in which Alcatel was involved in the
construction of the conventional power units and Framatome led the nuclear
reactor project, is seen as an example of how the groups could combine their
activities.
In 1990, Alcatel Alsthom briefly managed to acquire a majority stake in
Framatome, raising its holding from 40 per cent to 52 per cent. But the
socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced Alcatel to reduce its
shareholding.
Framatome, which also has activities in electronic components, has annual
sales of more than FFr12bn (Dollars 2.02bn). In 1992, the latest year for
which figures are available, it reported net profits of FFr900m.

Ytong Holding, the German construction and housing group, yesterday bought
80 per cent of Gazobeton, Bulgaria's leading concrete producer, in the first
major privatisation deal in Bulgaria's construction sector involving a
foreign investor.
Ytong has paid DM4m (Dollars 2.3m) for the two-year-old company and will
spend a further DM5.6m over the next five years to modernise the plant.
Mr Dieter Goerres, Ytong's technical director, said the acquisition was
another large step in the company's expansion in eastern Europe.
Ytong had a 1993 turnover of DM887m and has stakes in 20 industrial and
housing construction plants in 15 European countries with more than 3,000
employees. Its main markets are Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Portugal.
The company first made acquisitions in eastern Europe in 1992 and now owns
several construction plants in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Croatia. Mr
Goerres said the company and its main competitor, Hiebel of Germany, are the
biggest producers and traders of concrete in Europe.
The new company, Ytong-Bulgaria, plans to target local markets and
neighbouring Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. Ytong has already established a
trading company in Greece.

Reuter reports from Moscow.
The Kiev, part of the Northern Fleet, and the Minsk and the Novorossiysk
from the Pacific Fleet, are still young. The Kiev was commissioned in 1975,
the Minsk in 1978 and the Novorossiysk in 1982, according to Jane's Fighting

The navy said all three needed an overhaul, but Russia had neither the

FT  15 FEB 94 / Russian officials 'blocking oil funds from west'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Official western efforts to pump investment funds into reviving Russia's
ailing oil industry are being blocked by obstacles put up mostly by Russian
officials, bankers say.
A prime victim has been Dollars 2bn in export credits guaranteed by the US
Eximbank and first made available last December to help speed aid to the
Russian economy. The facility requires the Russian government to provide
export quotas to Russian oil producers so they can repay loans to buy
capital equipment.
But the fate of the oil loans provides a clear illustration of just how
difficult it is to channel money to support Russian reforms even when funds
are available.
Western bankers say that the oil quotas required by the US loan facility so
far have not been forthcoming, though Mr Sergei Konychev, chairman of the
Development Project Finance Bank, whose shareholders include the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said that he was confident
the quotas would be made available in a matter of weeks.
He said officials were unfamiliar with the scheme, while one western banker
said the Eximbank requirements were too complicated for most oil companies
to bother with.
Mr Konychev said oil producers were presently absorbed in an annual battle
with the government for extra roubles to help deal with customers which are
not paying their bills, such as state-owned oil refineries.
Others bankers say some oil company managers were reluctant to take on new
debt and export obligations at a time when the industry was over-taxed and
saddled with non-paying customers. One said 'severe' congestion in Russian
pipelines made it difficult to get oil out of the country.
A Dollars 60m emergency loan by the EBRD for Nizhnevartovskneftegas, one of
the country's biggest oil companies, has been held up for similar reasons.
Many private western companies meanwhile have almost given up hope of making
any meaningful large-scale investment in Russia. A presidential decree
providing for production sharing, which would generate more secure revenues
for western investors, has yet to be backed up by a vote in parliament.
Designed to cut through red-tape, presidential decrees have increasingly
lost their credibility, as they have been consistently blocked at
implementation level.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (8): Private firms may get
public cash - Grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government is considering offering grants direct to private housebuilders to
build and operate social housing developments similar to those run by
housing associations, writes ANDREW TAYLOR.
This would satisfy the government's desire to provide greater competition
for the supply of social housing as well as, possibly, encouraging greater
private sector investment in rented housing.
The grant would be similar to the housing association grant (HAG)
administered by the Housing Corporation.
Private sector developers, however, may be reluctant to become landlords of
social housing developments, according to Mr Alan Cherry, chairman of
Countryside Properties and chairman of the social housing committee of the
House Builders Federation.
He says that many developers would be unwilling to cope with the extra
bureaucracy needed to ensure proper accountability and management of public
money when they already had well-established relationships with housing
associations. These relationships could be threatened if builders were to
compete directly with associations.
All social housing required some form of long term management which would
not interest housebuilders. There was also no suggestion of more government
money. The private sector would have to share an already shrinking
government budget for social housing, said Mr Cherry.
He added: 'Most housebuilders who are working with housing associations are
opposed to the idea of direct grant and can see no additional benefits to be
gained.'
He said that long term partnership schemes involving private sector
developers and housing associations were now producing three new homes for
the price of two and were proving the most cost effective way of generating
more accommodation for people in need.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (7): First breaks in the ice
pack - Andrew Taylor weighs the building industry's debt to social housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a slow thaw rather than a rapid recovery. The icy grip that has
held the housing market in recession began to loosen its hold last year, but
progress remains slow.
Sales to owner occupiers and the prices they have paid have edged up during
the past 14 months but builders remain glad to uncover any market they can
find for their developments. Housing associations have been among the most
enthusiastic buyers.
Last year saw record sales by the private builders to associations. These
mainly supply rented housing to the poor, infirm and disabled, an area
euphemistically dubbed social housing.
Associations, since the 1988 Housing Act, have become the principal
purchasers of social housing taking over from local authorities which have
become buyers of associations' services rather than providers of housing in
their own right.
At the same time the government has expected associations to raise more of
their finance from the private sector. This switch in emphasis coincided
with the deepest recession in the private sector housing market for more
than half a century. The growth of housing association purchases has
cushioned some of the decline in total sales.
The number of homes annually acquired by associations in England trebled
from 20,889 to 62,137 between 1989-90 and 1992-93. Associations are expected
to have purchased nearly 60,000 more homes in the current financial year.
The proportion of homes acquired from private sector builders has risen:
from about 55 per cent in the mid 1980s to 85 per cent currently.
These purchases have enabled private builders to raise much needed cash by
selling expertise as well as developments and land. These otherwise might
have sat in their balance sheets, unwanted by private sector home owners,
and attracting high interest payments on the money borrowed to develop them.
The Government's decision to provide associations with a windfall grant of
more than Pounds 700m in November 1992 to buy unsold properties proved a
boon to housebuilders. These had just seen the bottom kicked out of the
private housing market after sterling left the ERM.
The grant had to be spent by the end of the following March. The Pounds 591m
made available in England and Wales acquired more than 18,000 homes of which
more than 9,000 were properties originally built for sale to owners.
The speed with which the money had to be spent meant that associations had
to buy a large proportion of completed properties. More usually associations
buy land themselves, sometimes from housebuilders, which they then employ
under under contract, to develop the site.
The Housing Corporation, which administers government grants to
associations, estimates that about 70 per cent of homes purchased by
associations will have been acquired under design and build contracts with
the private sector. Less than 5 per cent of purchases are likely to have
been new homes which have failed to find a private sector buyer.
Mr Derek King, the corporation's director managing the investment programme,
says: 'We are sensitive to complaints from owners who have bought homes on
private sector developments only to find that part of the developments is
being sold to a housing association. This is only a small part of our
business but we prefer it when owners are told from the start that a
development is going to be of mixed tenancies. In practice we have had very
frew problems.'
Private builders like contract work. They receive a guaranteed cash flow for
virtually no capital investment. Mr Alan Cherry, chairman of Countryside
Properties, one of the most successful builders of homes for associations,
says: 'Housing association work very quickly generates a positive cash flow
so there is relatively little capital employed in the process.
'Even though it would appear that some tenders are won on 2.5 per cent net
profit the return on capital should be very good. Most builders will
approach this activity on the basis of return on capital and, looked at this
way, housing association work can be just as rewarding as speculative
developments.'
Builders might expect net profits of 10-15 per cent on developments built
for sale to private owners but the company could expect to have a lot of
capital tied up in land and work in progress.
Countryside has recently signed long-term building contracts with several
groups of housing associations including a three year project to develop
1,800 homes over three years on 24 sites for South Thames Housing
Partnership in consortium with three housing associations.
Large scale projects such as these enable builders to offer substantial
economies of scale in terms of design, building and legal costs, he says.
Pressure on government spending means, however, that the amount of grant
administered by the Housing Corporation is due to fall over the next few
years from Pounds 1.86bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 1.51bn in 1994-95 and Pounds
1.48bn in 1995-96.
Housebuilders can also expect the resurgence in private sector housing to
continue. Even so they are expected to maintain their interest in housing
association work which has become a permanent feature of many businesses,
providing cash flow irrespective of market conditions elsewhere.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (6): Like ducks to water -
Trusts are eager entrants to the capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among all the changes in the way housing associations have operated in the
past two years, one of the most dramatic was their brisk entry to the City.
Associations that hardly considered tapping public markets five years ago,
have suddenly become among the most active issuers of sterling bonds.
The traditional source of finance to supplement public grants was loan
capital from banks and building societies. But associations have now moved
briskly into sterling debentures, raising Pounds 800m from issues in 1992
and 1993. About half was issued in the last two months of 1993 alone.
Until the end of last year, the UK insurance companies and pension funds
which buy long-dated fixed rate paper displayed a healthy appetite for what
associations were offering. But as tends to happen with a change of diet,
institutions showed signs of indigestion three months ago.
Associations and the lead managers of issues from securities houses such as
NatWest Markets and Hambros now face the question of how to respond. Some
believe that associations will simply have to take things more slowly;
others argue that they will have to devise ways of widening the investor
base.
Four factors have stimulated the growth of association interest in the
capital markets:
the funding requirement has grown. Housing association grants have been cut
from 80 per cent of the cost of projects in 1988 to 62 per cent in the
1994-95 financial year. This means associations may have to raise Pounds
650m a year in private finance in the medium-term.
Building societies have been keen to increase loan funding to associations
to augment slack demand for their traditional mortgage products. But
although funding from banks and societies has increased, capital markets
issues have grown quickly to take equal share of association funding.
there is a good match between the maturity of bond issues and associations'
assets. Banks in particular are often unwilling to lend for more than seven
years, whereas associations want a source of finance that matches the longer
term cash flows from private rented housing.
UK interest rates and bond yields are at a historically low level, which
offers the chance for associations to lock in a low cost of funding.
Re-financing after seven years through banks means taking the risk that
interest rates will rise significantly by then.
there has been demand for associations' paper. Ms Caroline Shah, an
associate director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, says
that investors have been 'hungry for paper'. There was a lull in debenture
issues by property companies which increased interest in associations.
These factors created not just a rise in the number of bond issues, but a
growth in the number of issuing vehicles. The original vehicle was The
Housing Finance Corporation (THFC), which enabled associations to band
together, and has made six issues totalling Pounds 770m since 1990.
However, this structure did not satisfy all investors. It was open-ended,
allowing a variety of associations to join; it lacked credit enhancement to
insure against the failure of one association. Some investors also thought
that its board lacked people known in the City and independent of
associations.
This led three lead managers to devise their own vehicles. Kleinwort Benson
started with HACO, which issued Pounds 115m in two tranches starting in July
1992. It was followed by Hambros' FFH vehicle last March which gave credit
enhancement through a 5 per cent levy on the participating associations.
These new vehicles gradually widened the net to cover most of the 35-odd
institutions who might be expected to buy bond issues from associations. All
was well until NatWest Markets was left with much of a Pounds 125m issue
through its HALOS vehicle which it offered in November.
The shock of that led to Hambros delaying a planned issue for medium-sized
associations called Housing Securities, and a general reassessment of the
market. Market participants have come up with varying explanations for the
problem and with varying remedies.
One problem that many agree on is that institutions may be perplexed by the
variety of issuing vehicles in a relatively new sector. 'There is a certain
amount of confusion around because investors do not seem to be as clear as
they were about which vehicle to pick,' says Ms Shah.
Mr David Wallis, director of NatWest Capital Markets, says that investors
are still coming to terms with the sector as a whole because it is so new.
'We still have a task explaining to investors exactly what associations are.
I had a hard time understanding them myself two years ago,' he says.
One issue not easily assessed by investors is the political risk affecting
associations. The government has no commitment to bailing out an association
in trouble, and income support provides about half the rental payments from
which associations must meet bond interest payments.
Some participants believe this unfamiliarity, combined with the rapid growth
of issues, is the essential problem which came to a head before Christmas.
Mr Charles Arbuthnot, a director of Hambros, says the sector grew too
rapidly.
'You do not build a market by going suddenly from Pounds 200m of issues to
Pounds 600m the following year. That is very, very fast,' he says. Mr
Arbuthnot argues that the task facing associations is to be 'boring and
controlled' and ensure a steady flow of issues rather than allowing sudden
bursts.
Others argue that associations must find ways of broadening the investor
base. No issue has so far been rated formally by credit ratings agencies.
One securities house is thought to be working on a structured issue which
would have credit enhancement and be formally rated.
An advantage of such a rating would be that associations could draw on a
wider investor base. Mr Wallis of NatWest Markets says that associations
will have to employ 'a more sophisticated approach' to stimulate investor
interest, possibly varying maturities or enhancing credit.
Some large associations could also follow the approach of Peabody Trust in
making their own issues. After associations started by banding together no
matter what their size and competence, this year may see a more cautious
approach to capital markets, and a more diverse approach.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (5): Doubts about Government
support - The concerns of associations catering for smaller social and
ethnic groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public image of the Young Men's Christian Association is probably still
more akin to its foundation 150 years ago by an evangelical draper's
apprentice than to contemporary reality. Not only does today's YMCA, in
spite of its name, cater for both sexes, it is also the biggest specialist
provider of accommodation for young people in England.
It already houses 6,000 young people at 67 locations, and last month the
YMCA launched a Pounds 35m building programme which will increase its
housing stock by 17 per cent.
While traditional hostels still exist, the new programme - funded by
charitable donations, local authorities and the Housing Corporation - will
provide self-catering flats and bed-sit complexes. Counselling and training
services are offered alongside housing. In 1992, the YMCA opened Britain's
first foyers - hostels linking accommodation with training for unemployed
young people - under a government pilot scheme.
One of the central values of the housing association movement is its ability
to house sections of the community with particular needs. But many
specialist associations have neither the reputation nor resources of
national charities such as the YMCA or the Anchor Housing Trust, which
provides housing for the elderly. There is concern that a climate of
declining government grants, coupled with lenders' preference for large,
established organisations, may put the future of smaller specialist
associations at risk.
'Things are getting worse rather than better,' says Mr Barrington Billings,
director of Derby People's housing association, an ethnic minority
association which was set up three years ago and has 130 housing units.
Problems recounted by Mr Billings are similar to the experiences of many
people from the ethnic minority communities trying to launch small
businesses. 'Potential funders and partners ask for evidence of track
record, reserves and all the other things that new organisations do not
have. There is, in addition, a perception of black organisations as high
risk. That is a myth which we have to break.'
The public grant to housing associations, currently averaging 65 per cent of
new building costs, is declining and is expected to drop to 55 per cent by
1995-96. Public financial support remains particularly important for small
specialist associations, and continuing reductions in subsidy would threaten
the survival of some.
An eventual outcome could be the withdrawal of specialist associations from
house building, while retaining letting and management functions. Small
associations already sometimes carry out developments in conjunction with
larger, well-established ones.
'It is often necessary to piggy-back in this way,' says Mr Billings. 'But
you are then at the mercy of the bigger associations and have to accept
their decisions on priorities and charges. Smaller associations are looking
at other options like consortia purchasing arrangements and groups schemes.
'The ultimate solution would be mergers to form larger associations. But
while this may be economically efficient, it is not necessarily in the
interests of the particular services we are trying to provide.'
Some of these particular interests could be lost if specialist associations
withdrew from building. Mr Billings points out that ethnic minority housing
associations are, for example, more likely to try to encourage the
employment of local black people in building projects.
Although ethnic minority housing associations must have a majority of black
people on their management committees they do not, in spite of their name,
provide accommodation only for the ethnic minority communities. But their
closer relationship with these communities often gives them advantages in
identifying needs.
Mr Tony Soares, director of Westway, a relatively small black housing
association in London, shares the concerns. 'Lenders have a typically
suspicious view of new, small organisations. But housing associations are a
far safer prospect for them than many of the private business ventures that
they support.
'The Housing Corporation has enormous powers to regulate an association that
looks as though it is running into financial trouble or has management
problems and, at the end of the day, you've at least got the houses. The
task is getting through the door of some of the big institutions and
persuading them to revise their thinking.'
An idea which may help tackle the familiar problems of lenders preferring
large, established borrowers is being developed by CDS Co-operative housing
society and housing association specialists at Lewis Silkin, CDS's
solicitors. Aimed at housing co-operatives, the approach could eventually be
extended to small housing associations as well.
CDS hopes to set up a provident society - the Co-operative Housing Finance
Society - as an intermediary between lenders and borrowers. It would provide
co-operatives and small housing associations with management support, and
guarantee lenders interest payments for a specified period in the event of
problems arising.
'The society would be offering risk management and default management,' said
Mr David Rodgers, CDS chief executive. 'Borrowers would be expected to
perform within tighter controls than under a normal loan deed, and if they
looked as though they were running into difficulties it would show at an
early stage. This would provide reassurance to lenders, and should
eventually lead to lower rates.'
If the plan takes off - and the Housing Corporation is giving encouragement
to it - representatives of lenders would be invited to join the society's
board to generate maximum confidence.
New arrangements for funding housing associations catering for people with
special needs will be outlined by the government shortly. Associations
receive support from the Corporation for providing homes for people with
special needs, and there has been concern that these could be threatened by
the government's community care reforms.
Sir George Young, housing minister, announced last month that arrangements
for paying special needs management allowance to housing associations would
continue unchanged for another year, pending the new proposals. The National
Federation of Housing Associations says continued Housing Corporation
funding is 'desperately needed' to safeguard housing schemes for vulnerable
people. It is calling for greater certainty and flexibility in funding
housing association community care schemes.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (4): People before bricks and

to be refocused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN

<TEXT>
The success of housing associations in providing affordable housing since
1988 has been built on two streams of government finance: housing
association grant for building new homes; and housing benefit to help
tenants pay rents which have been rising closer to market levels.
The continuing success of associations as housing providers - and their
attractiveness for private investors - rests to a large extent, therefore,
on the goodwill of Whitehall.
With pressure to reduce public sector borrowing over the coming years, both
elements of financial support for housing associations offer tempting
targets for the Treasury.
That pressure has already manifested itself in the declining rate of grant
to housing associations for providing new homes. It has fallen from an
average of 75 per cent of the cost of each new home to 62 per cent in four
years, and the government has set a target of 55 per cent for next year.
There have also been leaks that the budget for housing benefit - the cost of
which has almost doubled to more than Pounds 8bn in the last five years -
has been under scrutiny. If housing benefit were to be cut, tenants might
find their rents harder to pay. This could undermine the quality of the
income stream earned by associations, making private investors less willing
to lend to associations.
Happily for associations, their achievements since 1988 are well-recognised
by the government. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary who is
spearheading the search for cuts in public expenditure, told a recent
seminar for lenders that the government would do nothing to housing benefit
that would compromise associations' position.
The increase in the housing benefit is the result of a conscious decision to
switch housing subsidy from bricks and mortar to people, according to Sir
George Young, the long-serving housing minister.
'We believe that it's more effective to target resources on individuals in
need,' he says, 'rather than indiscriminately on subsidies to housing
associations.'
Sir George has been involved with housing associations since the 1960s and
has been an energetic promoter of their virtues among ministerial
colleagues. 'What housing associations have achieved since 1988 has been a
real success story,' he says. 'The mixed funding regime has brought Pounds
2.6bn of private funding into housing, providing an extra 55,000 homes that
wouldn't have been built if we'd gone on providing 100 per cent of the
finance for new homes.
'Associations have developed a good reputation with the lending institutions
as viable, well-run organisations. And they've produced good quality homes
at affordable rents.' In many ways, Sir George says, housing associations
provide a model for the government's private finance initiative which seeks
to raise more of the funds for public services from the private sector.
'We've taken wholly public sector funding for housing and geared it up by
raising private finance,' he says.
Scarcely a month goes by without Sir George launching another initiative
involving housing associations. Urban regeneration schemes, getting rough
sleepers off London's streets, managing property for private landlords,
compulsory competitive tendering for local authority housing management -
all have included a role for associations.
'Associations are a resource in terms of housing management skills which
they have traditionally applied to their own stock,' he says. 'I want to
encourage lateral expansion, so that they put these skills to wider use in
managing others' stock. We need to revive the private rented sector and one
way of doing that is by bringing in institutional funds. Housing
associations could manage property on their behalf, so that ownership could
be divorced from the management function.' Sir George has also encouraged
local authorities to use the planning system to persuade private developers
to include an element of social housing in new developments. These would
then be sold to or managed by housing associations.
'Such mixed tenure is how most of our villages and towns grew,' he points
out. 'Having all sorts of people living closely together is much more
natural than the polarisation of housing between huge council estates and
owner-occupier estates.'
With falling grant rates, many of the smaller associations which cater for
special needs are being squeezed out of the development programme. But Sir
George remains enthusiastic about the role they can play, especially in
rural areas and in serving tenants with special needs, such as ethnic
minorities and the disabled.
'The larger associations will account for a bigger share of the grants for
development,' he says, 'because they can drive the deals with builders and
get the private finance. We have to take a hard-nosed approach to value for
money and it makes sense to focus development skills in those associations.
'But once they have completed the developments, some of the stock can then
be handed over to smaller associations. Many of the smaller specialist
associations are building partnerships with larger associations. Fewer
developers needn't mean fewer managers.' As for the future, Sir George
believes that the emphasis is due to shift back from development to
rehabilitation of older property, particularly in the inner cities.
'I have increased the Housing Corporation's target for the share of its
budget which is to go on rehab this year,' he says.
'If the owner-occupied market takes off and builders regain confidence, the
new homes that are being built will be for sale. Housing associations can
then concentrate on those things that the private sector finds difficult
such as rehab. 'Associations have an appetite and a capacity to do more,' he
concludes. 'I have every confidence they can respond to the challenge of
spending whatever grant they get and the lateral challenge of moving into
related fields where their skills are used even where they don't own the
underlying assets.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (2): Quango with a beady eye
 -The role of the Housing Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many leading property developers have fallen victim to the housing market's
biggest slump in recent memory.
Yet housing associations have weathered the recession without a single
casualty and have been building record numbers of new homes.
Much of the credit for this record lies with the Housing Corporation, the
quango that regulates more than 2,200 registered housing associations. It
keeps a watchful eye over associations' finances, protecting the interests
of the taxpayer and the institutional investors who provide their funds.
This involves scrutiny of an enormous range of associations, from the tiny
Stephen Hutchen's Charity Trust with six homes at Paul in Cornwall to the
giant North British Housing Association which has more than 25,000 homes
across Britain.
The Corporation is also responsible for allocating government grant to
housing associations in England, and for encouraging them to make it go as
far as possible. Last year, it distributed Pounds 2.3bn of grant, which
associations topped up with Pounds 627m of private investment to provide a
record number of more than 62,000 homes.
The Corporation has been promoting housing associations for 30 years,
funding and regulating them since 1974. But it has achieved a new prominence
with the funnelling of almost all public housing investment through
associations and the need to attract an increasing share of their finance
from the capital markets.
This higher profile has led to warnings that the Corporation's role in
implementing government housing policy could be at odds with its regulatory
role of ensuring that associations remain in good financial health.
On the one hand, the Corporation must squeeze associations' finances to
increase the number of homes provided from a shrinking government grant.
This forces associations to push rents up to levels which many tenants find
hard to pay, increase borrowing and use older stock as security for new
loans.
On the other hand, the Corporation must ensure that associations do not take
risks with the substantial amounts of government money they receive. The
financial failure of a large or medium-sized association would be an acute
embarrassment to the movement and could bring down ministerial wrath.
More important, a failure would drain institutional investors' confidence in
housing associations, making it harder to raise the funds needed to top up
the government grant. Since 1988, the capital markets have invested more
than Pounds 4bn in associations, and a similar amount is likely to be needed
over the next three years.
The man who must resolve these conflicting pressures is Anthony Mayer, chief
executive of the Corporation since 1991. He brings to the job an unusual
combination of public and private sector experience.
After leaving Oxford in 1967, he joined the old Ministry of Housing as a
fast-stream entrant, progressing up the career ladder to assistant secretary
level. His time as a civil servant included spells in ministerial private
offices and a secondment to the Central Policy Review Staff, the Whitehall
thinktank abolished by Mrs Thatcher in 1983.
But in 1985, Mayer left the civil service to spend six years with N M
Rothschild, the UK merchant bank. By the time of his move to the Housing
Corporation in 1991, he had become managing director (administration and
finance) of Rothschild Asset Management.
This combination of experience has proved invaluable as the budget for
housing associations has come under pressure from the Treasury. Mayer knows
how to operate in Whitehall where he must fight his corner in the annual
public expenditure battle. But he has also been able to act as an advocate
for housing associations in the City, persuading the institutions to invest
increasing amounts to make up at least some of the loss of grant. 'The
existing lenders in the market are very happy with their investments in
housing associations,' he says. 'But I want to broaden the investor base
which is still curiously restricted.
'With my Rothschild's experience, I see good investment opportunities in
associations which are asset-based and can increase their rental income
without getting into elasticity problems. A private sector lender is not
going to lose money investing in housing associations.'
Mayer's priority has been to make far-reaching changes in the Corporation's
regulatory procedures in order to improve the confidence of investors in the
movement. One important step is the introduction of PLC-type accounts from
April.
'Traditional housing association accounts were unintelligible except for the
cognoscenti,' he says. 'PLC accounting will make associations much more
transparent for the new investor.'
The emphasis on regulation has switched from day-to-day monitoring of
associations to the collection and analysis of financial and management
information. All associations involved in development now complete quarterly
financial returns providing information on cash flow, gearing and interest
cover.
'We are putting much more emphasis on the financial health of housing
associations, their management and the control exercised by their
committees,' says Mayer.
'Since 1988, associations have grown into major risk-taking businesses,
using financial and treasury techniques appropriate to plcs. They need the
expertise and techniques to exercise the responsibility.'
And it is the Corporation's success in selling housing associations to the
capital markets that is the key to stretching taxpayers' money in public
housing, says Mayer.
'In 1989-90, we were getting 2,000 homes for rent from every Pounds 100m of
taxpayers' money. This year, we're getting over 3,000 homes - a huge
improvement in value for money.'
Mayer concedes that this has been achieved partly because of lower
construction costs, which have dropped markedly since 1988. Lower interest
rates have also helped by reducing the cost of borrowing the higher
proportion of finance needed to build each new home.
But he also says that the lower grant rates imposed by the government have
encouraged associations to become more competitive in bidding for a share of
public funds. They are making better use of their existing assets, putting
up rents on existing homes to finance the building of new ones and using
older stock as collateral for loans.
This, says Mayer, has been achieved without undermining their financial
wellbeing.
'The movement has survived the worst property market since the war. On a
book of more than Pounds 2bn raised for development, there are bad debts of
under Pounds 12m - a record that is better than any other sector of the
property market.'
This record reflects the wisdom of keeping the regulatory role under the
same roof as the allocation of government grant, Mayer believes.
'If we are allocating public funds to housing associations, we have an
interest in protecting the interests of the taxpayer and the private sector
lenders who make the government grant go further. This can be done only if
we make sure that associations are well-run and financially healthy.'
Powerful backing for retaining the two roles under one roof came last year
when the Commons environment select committee recommended that the
Corporation should continue to exercise both functions.
Nonetheless, the Corporation is only as good as its last decision, says
Mayer.
'There is no room for complacency,' he adds. 'I can't guarantee that an
association won't take a bad business decision - any more than I can do the
same for a private sector company. 'My aim is to ensure that we have the
earliest possible warning of any problems so that we can work with the
association to get out of them.'
Achieving that aim while continuing to squeeze the maximum number of homes
out of a diminishing government grant is likely to tax all the skills that
Mayer has acquired in his diverse career.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (3): Honesty and ability -
Management standards are on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fraud and corruption, and the paler although sometimes more expensive evils
of mismanagement and incompetence, are not unknown in the private sector.
When they occur in statutory or voluntary organisations, however, they raise
particular concern because of the likelihood that public money will be
involved.
A recent spate of public sector problems - many of them brought together in
a report from the Commons public accounts committee last month - has
unleashed serious questions about the quality of management and
accountability arrangements in the increasing variety of agencies, quangos
and charities that handle a large volume of public funds.
Many such organisations are already examining their management and
governance structures, and the housing association movement is about to join
them. The National Federation of Housing Associations has set up a
wide-ranging, independent inquiry into governance issues that will begin
work by March.
Interest in management and decision-making in the public and voluntary
sectors has not only been stimulated by recent specific examples of things
going wrong. The Cadbury committee's report on the financial aspects of
corporate governance in private companies started a debate on the extent to
which its principles might be applied in other sectors of the economy. And
the 1992 Charities Act, by reiterating the responsibilities of charity
trustees, has forced the voluntary sector to question the adequacy of
trustee selection, training and accountability arrangements.
Such issues are of particular importance to housing associations, given the
exceptionally large sums of both public and private funds for which they are
responsible.
Some housing associations are charitable trusts; some function under
provident society law, some under Housing Corporation registration. The
national federation's inquiry will consider the pros and cons of various
forms of status and whether there is a case for rationalisation.
This will raise complex issues on which there is unlikely to be unanimity
within the movement. Some associations, for example, believe there are
advantages in housing associations being perceived as charities and would be
loath to lose charitable status; on the other hand, charity law places
restrictions on associations' activities.
The inquiry team is likely to consist of a housing association chief
executive, a lay committee member, a lawyer, an academic and a private
sector representative with experience of the Cadbury recommendations.
Among the issues addressed by the inquiry will be the respective roles of
committee members and housing association management. This central corporate
governance issue - defining the relationship between executive and
non-executive directors - is currently the subject of debate throughout the
voluntary sector, and elsewhere in areas such as the National Health
Service.
The debate has, however, been heightened in the housing association movement
by recent suggestions that lay board members - or at least chairmen and
women - should receive salaries.
This is a controversial suggestion in an area which has strong voluntary
sector origins and traditions. But Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the
Housing Corporation, believes the governance of housing associations is
ready for an overhaul and is prepared for radical change.
'The present structure was devised in 1975 and housing associations have
outgrown it,' he says. 'In many towns, a local housing association is the
largest private sector spender, yet the regime under which they are
operating is way behind the role.
'Association committees need to make sure that they have the members and the
expertise to cope with business challenges such as modernising internal
controls, treasury management, borrowing strategies and so on. 'Paying
committee members might interfere with the voluntary ethos. But if you paid
committee members, you would establish a contract between them and the
organisation. Without pay, you are relying entirely on the good will of
people to give up their time. 'Having the chief executive sitting on the
committee and sharing its accountability could also cement more closely the
relationship between the executive and the committee. My own view is that
the answers on these questions are not clearcut, but it is vital that they
are addressed head-on and some proper answers established.'
Full-time managers and non-executive lay members sharing responsibility on a
single board - the model adopted in the NHS since the 1991 reforms - would,
say its advocates, enhance decision-making and clarify accountability. But
this approach, allied to paying committee members, is considered too
commercial by some association managers and committee members. They believe
that a lay committee considering broad policy issues at arms-length from
executive management remains essential. Any organisation's lay committee is
of true value only if the members are properly selected, trained and aware
of their responsibilities.
A recent study showed that many charity trustees did not even appreciate
that they were trustees, and lacked understanding of their legal duties.
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has, with government
financial support, set up a unit to help prepare trustees and management
committee members for their responsibilities.
It has published a resource guide for governing bodies and established a
telephone helpline (071-833 1818) which provides committee members with
advice on legal, financial and managerial responsibilities.
Housing associations often seek to strengthen the skills of full-time
management teams by recruiting people with business skills to their
committees. But the affairs of Circle 33 housing trust - where a Pounds 1m
maintenance fraud is under investigation - demonstrate that even the most
impressive committees cannot guarantee protection against criminal activity
or deliberate, concealed mismanagement. Its board included Mr Mark Boleat,
director general of the Association of British Insurers, and Ms Colette
Bowe, a senior Securities and Investment Board official who has been
selected as chief executive of the proposed Personal Investment Authority.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (1): From philanthropy to
business - Born in the age of Victorian idealism, housing associations are
now an influential factor in the UK housing market and are increasingly
entrepreneurial and business oriented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN

<TEXT>
Housing associations, once small-scale providers of specialist housing, have
become social businesses playing a leading role in the UK housing market.
They remain voluntary bodies, governed by management boards made up of
unpaid volunteers. Yet the largest associations now own tens of thousands of
homes with assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds.
Since the 1988 Housing Act, associations have increasingly drawn on private
finance to augment government grants for providing affordable housing.
They have borrowed around Pounds 4.5bn in that period, both in direct
investment and through a growing range of club deals and intermediaries. A
similar sum will be required over the next three years to fund their
continuing expansion plans.
'The growth of private finance has been an undoubted success story,' says Mr
David Burnett of Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank. 'The variety of
instruments and the spread of investors which has been achieved in such a
short period is quite remarkable.'
Housing associations have also become much more entrepreneurial, according
to Mr Don Wood, chief executive of London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust, one of
the largest associations managing 17,000 homes in London and the south-east.
His association has built new partnerships with local authorities and urban
regeneration bodies to make its government grant stretch as far as possible.
Growth since the 1988 Act means that associations now manage about 900,000
homes, approaching 4 per cent of Great Britain's housing stock. While this
is less than a fifth of the number owned by local authorities, it will
continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
With almost no new development by local authorities, they have become the
main providers of new low-cost homes for rent or sale. In recent years, they
have provided an average of more than 50,000 new homes annually.
In many parts of the country, associations are also taking over local
authority housing stock through voluntary transfers. In five years, they
have assumed responsibility for 130,000 such homes on behalf of 28 local
authorities. Another 12 transfers involving 50,000 homes are in the pipeline
for next year.
The government has also encouraged associations to play a much wider role on
the housing market, particularly in managing property for private landlords.
It also sees associations winning a large share of the Pounds 1.25bn a year
market in managing local authority housing, due to go out to compulsory
competitive tendering in 1996.
And it was the housing associations that the government turned to when it
launched the housing market rescue package in the 1992 autumn statement.
In just 93 working days, 81 associations pumped Pounds 577m into buying
18,430 homes in England from developers, private sellers and mortgage
lenders to let to the homeless.
In meeting these new challenges, associations are becoming much more
sophisticated in their operations, under the watchful eye of the Housing
Corporation which this week stages a conference in Brighton to celebrate its
30th birthday. The Corporation acts as regulator and distributes government
grant to associations in England.
It has also encouraged the movement to improve the quality of its management
and to learn new financial skills. Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the
Corporation, is keen to get more business people involved on the committees
which run associations.
'Associations have become massive private sector businesses involved in
delivering a public service,' he says. 'The more people we can get with
business acumen, the better.'
The next few years may be rather tougher however. The greatest challenge
will come from the decline in the amount of the government housing
association grant. The Housing Corporation's budget is due to fall from a
record Pounds 2.3bn last year to Pounds 1.45bn in 1995-96.
To maximise the number of homes this declining grant provides, the
government has been ratcheting down the rate of the grant from 75 per cent
of the cost of a new home to 62 per cent. By 1995-96, the target grant rate
is 55 per cent.
Associations must borrow the balance of the cost on the capital markets and
that could become harder as the grant rate falls. Standard procedures for
valuing tenanted homes mean that investors are normally unwilling to lend 45
per cent of the cost of a home solely against the security of that home.
Other assets must be pledged to raise finance.
'Only the financially strongest housing associations will be able to
continue to develop over the next few years,' says Mr George Barlow,
director of the Peabody Trust, one of 20 biggest associations.
The trust, founded in 1862 by a the wealthy American banker George Peabody,
has inherited mansion blocks in central London locations such as Chelsea and
Westminster. With such a strong asset base, it was the first housing
association to issue debenture stock on the strength of its own covenant and
without a government guarantee.
But many other associations have little or no additional security to pledge.
This is particularly so for the newer specialist associations set up to
cater for ethnic minorities and other special housing needs.
'The result will be an increasingly monochrome future,' according to Mr
Giles Goddard of Southwark Diocesan housing association, which has provided
65 homes on former church land in south London. The diversity offered by
smaller associations such as his will be squeezed out, he fears, as grant
rates fall.
Even some larger associations have limited scope to find additional security
for loans, says Mr David Hucker of the Coventry-based Orbit Housing
Association.
'Reserves can only be spent once,' he says. 'At a time when associations
need strong balance sheets and cashflows to encourage investor confidence,
this draining of their collateral will ultimately be to their detriment.'
A further consequence of falling government grant rates is higher rents. If
a higher proportion of the cost of a new home has to be borrowed, then there
is a higher interest charge to be passed on to the tenant.
Data collected by the National Federation of Housing Associations shows that
rents have increased 150 per cent since 1988. During this period tenants'
incomes have risen by just a third.
If the tenant is unemployed, the rent will be paid by the Department of
Social Security through housing benefit. But the tenant is then stuck in a
poverty trap which is a deterrent to taking employment. Up to 96 per cent of
each extra Pounds 1 of income the tenant earns can be clawed back as
benefits are withdrawn - leaving the tenant little better off, or even worse
off after allowing for child-care and work-related costs.
'With rents rising faster than tenants' incomes, the poverty trap is
widening,' says Mr Jim Coulter, director of the federation. 'Accepting a job
paying around average earnings can leave a parent with two children worse
off at the sort of rent levels which are now required.'
Such concerns were crystallised last year with the publication of a report
by Mr David Page, a housing consultant. He said that government policy was
encouraging associations to recreate the conditions which had turned so many
large local authority estates into housing disasters.
On the one hand falling grant rates were driving associations to build
larger, high-density estates to cut costs. On the other, rising rents were
turning these estates into 'welfare ghettos', largely populated by people on
benefits.
'The combination of unfavourable dwelling mix and very disadvantaged new
tenants has produced a seriously unbalanced population mix on new estates,'
the report concluded. The result could be soulless estates plagued by crime,
inhabited only by those with no choice in their housing.
Such predictions may turn out to be unduly pessimistic. The publication of
the Page report has had a salutary effect on the movement, serving as a
warning of what will happen if the pressures it identifies are not
adequately addressed.
But it set off alarm bells which indicate that there is no cause for
complacency in the movement. The leading role that housing associations have
successfully taken in the provision of social housing will bring new
challenges in the years to come.

FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued speculation that Great Universal Stores, the diversified retail,
property and financial group, is preparing to give a chunk of its Pounds
1.6bn cash pile back to shareholders inspired the shares to an ex-dividend
rise of 9 to 583p on turnover of 2.1m.
However, weekend press reports suggesting that only Pounds 500m worth of
shares would be bought back disappointed some analysts. One said a buy-back
of 10 per cent of the stock (at a cost of some Pounds 575m) would give only
a 5 per cent rise in earnings per share for 1994-95. Others were more
positive, suggesting that the GUS move - thought probable within the next
six months - was likely to be part of a wider restructuring. This could
include floating or selling its constituent parts, with the property and
financial services arms thought to be particularly eligible.
A weekend newspaper report saying that Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group, was
discussing a strategic alliance with US competitor Pfizer saw the former's
share price jump 16 to 655p. Glaxo said the story was pure speculation but
the company would be unlikely to comment on such sensitive issues ahead of
the announcement of first-half figures on Thursday. Some analysts said a
co-operation deal in the US would make sense, particularly after last year's
US merger between Merck and Medco. The shares also benefited from a
reiterated NatWest buy recommendation and closed 12 up at 651p.
The war of words between LWT and its unwanted suitor, Granada, continued
yesterday. LWT urged shareholders to reject the revised hostile bid by
Granada Group saying the price was too low and there were few potential
savings. The final offer values LWT at around Pounds 776m or 750p per share,
an increase of nearly 30 per cent on the value of the original offer
launched on December 6. LWT's chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, said the
company was worth between 840p and 850p a share.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, described LWT's defence as
'strong on presentation but weak on content' and the Granada offer was
'demonstrably generous'. LWT shares held steady at 746p and Granada was firm
at 585p. Meanwhile, Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, whose share price has doubled since
the start of the year on the belief that it will be the next regional
television group to attract a predator, added a further 10 to 362p.
Oil major BP was restrained following heavy selling in New York on Friday.
Analysts said the company's post-results presentation in the US was badly
received and remained under pressure in spite of the sharp fall in
temperatures on both sides of the Atlantic. However, heavy US selling was
masked by a London buyer switching out of Shell Transport. BP ended the day
2 lower at 370p on turnover of 10m, while Shell slipped 5 to 735p.
Aran Energy, which analysts said has acreage adjacent to the big oil finds
west of the Shetlands, gained 1 3/4 to 29 3/4 p.
International conglomerate Hanson fell 6 to 282 1/2 p with some marketmakers
voicing concern over the growing disparity between the shares and the
warrants. The warrants dropped a quarter to 39 1/2 p on turnover of 8m.
Banks weakened with Abbey National falling 7 to 509p on profit-taking and
Lloyds Bank and TSB Group shedding 14 1/2 to 587p and 8 to 250 1/2 p
respectively after going ex-dividend. HSBC and Standard Chartered both
responded to the 4.5 per cent fall in the Hong Kong market. HSBC fell 23 to
987p and Standard 34 to 1265p.
The English generators were again in demand, basking in the positive comment
caused by the decision on Friday by Offer, the industry regulator, not to
refer the two companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. PowerGen
surged 9 to 550p and National Power 15 1/2 to 491p. Eastern Electricity,
which again announced the purchase of its own shares - 750,000 at 675.5p -
yesterday, slipped 2 to 676p. Other recs lost ground.
Chemicals group Courtaulds slipped 7 1/2 to 497 1/2 p after two securities
houses cut this year's profit forecasts for the company. UBS cut by Pounds
5m to Pounds 135m and James Capel reduced by Pounds 10m to Pounds 140m.
Unease about the departure of the current chairman weakened sentiment in
British Aerospace, the shares closing 4 lower at 539p.
Lines of stock were on offer in BBA, leaving the shares to drift 16 to
1022p. The group, which operates seven airports, reported a 5.4 per cent
increase in January passenger traffic against the same month a year earlier.
Market watchers said the figures were in line with expectations and had been
discounted.
Container leasing and trailer rental group Tiphook firmed 3 to 67p, on
suggestions, later confirmed, that this week's financial statement from the
group will be accompanied by details of boardroom changes. However, details
about the sale of its container division to US insurance and financial group
Transamerica are also expected. Tiphook confirmed after the close that Mr RN
Hambro had agreed to become non-executive chairman pending the appointment
of a new permanent chairman. The restructuring costs were put at Pounds
49.7m.
A block of 1.6m shares in United Biscuits were sold into the market at 337p
and subsequently placed at 340p. The stock slid 4 to 345p.
Packaging company Parkside made its market debut at a 12p premium to the
placing price and closed 2 higher at 124p.

FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bar wars hit Foster'sfigures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits slide in Foster's, the Australian brewer which owns the Courage
drinks group, led to a sell-off among domestic beer stocks yesterday, though
they later recovered on the view that some of the selling may have been
overdone.
Analysts had expected Courage to produce flat profits at worse, but it fell
17 per cent. The brewer is the first of the industry leaders to include
figures for the crucial December sales period. While the market has been
fretting about a retail price war among bars and pubs, one analyst said the
Foster figures showed an intensifying of the wholesale battle between
brewers. 'Margin pressure on both fronts would be very worrying,' he said.
However, some in the market believe the brewery bears have gone too far, and
late yesterday there was talk of one leading broker preparing to turn
positive on selected stocks. After the initial hit yesterday, most shares
rallied. Bass fell 10, but recovered to close at 516p, down a net 3.
Whitbread slid 10 to 534p, after 530p, while Allied Lyons fell 7 to 612p.
Fosters was steady at 61 1/2 p. Grand Metropolitan gained 7 to 443p with one
broker recommending a switch out of Guinness, off 5 at 517p.

FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 retreats but bounces off
3,350 level - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A low-key trading session in London saw share prices come under further
moderate bouts of selling pressure. They were weakened mostly by worries
about international bond and equity markets but also by a large mixed
programme trade carried out by one of the London market's biggest
marketmaking firms.
Dealers said the market was unsettled by worries about the failure of joint
trade talks between Japan and the US, which had aimed at increasing US
penetration of Japanese markets. Also, the FT-SE 100 future traded at a
discount to the cash market for much of the day.
Activity in London was also restricted by serious disruption to transport
services in and out of the City, caused by bad weather, plus a general
reluctance by fund managers to trade in size ahead of a deluge of economic
data from the UK and abroad this week.
At the close of a rather disappointing opening day to a new two-week trading
account, the FT-SE 100 index settled 15.4 lower at 3,363.5. The FT-SE Mid
250 index moved in tandem with its senior index, closing 19.4 off at 4010.6.
Turnover levels were badly curtailed by the weather problems in Europe and
North America. Only 626.5m shares changed hands yesterday, halting a
sustained run of near 1bn share turnovers in UK equities. The day's business
was said to have been among the lowest in the market so far this year.
The value of customer business in the equity market last Friday reached
Pounds 2.26bn, the highest in a two-week trading account which saw some of
the heaviest customer business on record.
There was no real downside pressure in London at the outset with dealers
already primed to cope with the overnight weakness of the influential far
eastern markets, where Tokyo dropped 2.7 per cent and the Hong Kong market
4.5 per cent.
International bond markets opened on a steady note but began to lose ground
as the day wore on, undermining sentiment throughout equity markets.
The FT-SE 100 opened only marginally easier and briefly moved into positive
territory, following good economic data on producer prices, before embarking
on a decline which gathered pace throughout the early afternoon.
What surprised the market was the weakness in the FT-SE 100 index in the
face of a strong showing by Wall Street. The US market, which was a constant
threat to European market stability last week, followed last Friday's good
late rally with a strong opening performance which took the Dow Jones
Average up almost 30 points during London trading hours.
Dealers attributed London's weakness to a sizeable programme trade, thought
to have been operated by Smith New Court, and said to have been weighted to
the sell side. However, after testing the crucial 3,350 level, the FT-SE 100
stabilised and edged higher, helped by Wall Street, eventually halving its
earlier fall.
Strategists saw no real lead in the day's events, however. 'The simple
message is that there are no real inflationary threats to the economy at the
present moment, or for the next eighteen months,' said Mr Richard Jeffrey of
stockbroker Charterhouse Tilney.
Among a welter of economic details due this week, this morning brings
industrial production numbers for December, while tomorrow sees January
inflation, unemployment and average earnings figures.

FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in gilts and other European markets brought a retreat in stock
index futures and undermined the cash market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Independent traders adjusting positions led the selling early in the session
after the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened the new account at 3,373.
The selling briefly steadied with the release of favourable producer price
index figures.
However, dealers were soon reflecting on the weakness in the gilts and other
European markets which brought further selling of the contract, pulling the
cash market lower. One dealer said: 'The cash market surprised us with its
resilience, given this kind of weakness in the futures.'
The firm start in New York failed to lift the gloom and having traded at a
discount for most of the session, March ended at 3,354, a 9 point discount
to its fair value premium to cash which now stands at around minus 5 on this
account. Volume was a modest 10,822 contracts at the official close.
Turnover in traded options was well down on Friday's strong total, reaching
41,377 against 72,492 contracts. Business in the index options was also down
reaching only 18,003 in the FT-SE 100 option. In the stock options, HSBC
traded 2,943 lots and was followed by British Gas at 2,632 lots. Barclays,
Asda and Lucas Industries were also busy.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy stands alone in bearish week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy stood alone last week, the only component of the FT-Actuaries World
Index to show a positive trend as it continued to attract favourable
brokers' recommendations.
Kleinwort Benson reflects the optimism currently surrounding the market,
forecasting that it is likely to be among Europe's top performers in 1994.
Mr Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort remarks that foreign investors, particularly
from the US, have already prepared themselves for a victory by the left-wing
Progressive Alliance in next month's general elections.
'In discounting a left-wing victory, the market seems to be accepting the
lesser of two evils - given the dangers presented by some of the policies
put forward by both the League and the neo-fascists, not to mention
Berlusconi's questionable credentials,' he says. The media magnate formed
the Forza Italia in an attempt to counter the possibility of a left-wing
victory.
Goldman Sachs is also bullish, recommending a 'moderately positive stance'
because of falling interest rates, a competitive lira, and subdued
inflationary pressures.
Other European bourses reacted during the week less to the tightening of US
monetary policy than to worries over the possible delay in a further easing
of domestic rates, although both the UK and Belgium moved modestly in that
direction.
Switzerland was the heaviest faller. Here, technical factors were a major
influence. Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that small
and medium sized companies had escaped the correction, however, with many
still showing 5-6 per cent rises in their prices since the start of the
year.
He added that government bond yields had picked up during the week from 4.02
per cent to 4.19 per cent, 'not a big movement but it makes the market
nervous'. Much of the week's selling was by institutions, while foreign
sales had swelled trading volumes as investors took profits and booked
currency gains.
Ireland also declined, but, says Mr Adrian O'Carroll at Dillon Read, this
needs to be taken in context with the market's strong performance since
January. 'There was some profit-taking', he says, 'and I would expect the
market to track UK equities quite closely in the short term.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken after an
optimistic beginning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although US stocks moved on a rising trend in the European afternoon,
bourses managed to end weak after a relatively optimistic start. Low
turnover was another feature of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, unable to find any good news, persisted with its downward correction
following steep gains earlier in the month. The CAC-40 index lost 31.93 or
1.4 per cent to 2,243.16 as turnover sank to FFr3.3bn from Friday's
FFr4.7bn.
There was some interest in Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting: Mr Michael
Woodcock of Nikko Europe said that it remained to be seen whether the French
'would feel able to act unilaterally in cutting rates if the Buba were to
fail to act . . . the market has been anticipating a German rate cut for at
least two months, and while inaction can be understood after the traumas of
last summer, it may be emboldened by the quarter point rate cut in the UK
and the continued strength of the franc against the D-Mark'.
Elf Aquitaine lost FFr2 to FFr415 ahead of the announcement of the
institutional offer price of FFr403 a share after the close of Wall Street
last night. The private tranche was three times subscribed.
There was a further fall in Euro Disney, down FFr2.10 to FFr34.05 as bankers
held talks with Walt Disney, the theme park's parent company, over financial
restructuring.
FRANKFURT began by consolidating Friday's post bourse gains, the Dax index
adding a little more and closing 25.40 higher at 2,116.01 after last week's
2.2 per cent fall. Turnover reflected the carnival season, falling from
DM9.6bn to DM5.1bn.
However, in the afternoon thoughts turned to the prospect of a national
engineering strike after the failure of last Friday's metalworkers' wage
negotiations. Bund and Dax futures weakened and the Ibis indicated Dax
dropped to close at 2,101.93.
Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said that retailers were weak
after Friday's report that German retail sales dropped by an
inflation-adjusted 6 per cent in December compared with the year before.
After hours, recent favourites held their gains well, BMW ending at DM813
after an official close of DM816.50, up DM16.50 and Degussa at DM490 after
DM494, up DM10.
AMSTERDAM weakened in line with the general trend, the AEX index losing 5.59
at 428.78.
Fokker's downside was limited; the market had already discounted its
announcement yesterday of job cuts and restructuring proposals, and the
shares eased 20 cents to Fl 22.90. Bigger losses were seen among the more
heavily capitalised issues, with Royal Dutch losing Fl 2.80 to Fl 212.60 and
Elsevier Fl 3.20 to Fl 182.80.
MILAN began the first day of the new account broadly lower, but some gains
were featured particularly with companies associated with the forthcoming
privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana.
BCI itself moved up L71 to L5,601 as investors anticipated a successful
flotation: the public share offer begins on February 28. Advances were also
seen in Generali, up L175 to L40,680, and Gemina, up L47 to L1,563 on
suggestions that they may take stakes. The Mibtel index lost 1.1 per cent to
10,792.
Domestic investors were still unsettled by the political environment, with
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia making steady gains in opinion polls. Mr
John Stewart of InterEuropa in Milan commented that the weekend arrest of Mr
Berlusconi's brother for alleged corruption was unlikely to have a long-term
effect on his campaign, while his increasing popularity should not be
under-estimated.
ZURICH fell by 1.3 per cent in subdued dealings, the SMI index closing 38.6
lower at 2,947.1. It had risen at the outset on short covering after last
week's index drop of 4.9 per cent, but subsided in the afternoon on a drop
in index futures: the SMI February future ended at 2,951.0.
Individual stocks reflected the day's pattern. The most active, Roche
certificates, fell SFr105 to SFr6,825 after an earlier rise to SFr7,075.
MADRID blamed a gloomy macroeconomic outlook as the general index closed
2.16 lower at 345.82 on a combination of rising unemployment, up from 17.5
to 18 per cent of the total workforce in January and worse-than-expected
January inflation data.
Turnover fell to Pta26.1bn from Pta48.4bn. Weakness in bonds drove equities
down and banks were hit worse than most, with BBV Pta70 lower at Pta3,360
and Banesto down Pta14 at Pta701.
ATHENS dropped 4.1 per cent, the general index closing 43.02 lower at
1,018.55 with investors cautious over the possibility that Nato forces could
become involved in the Bosnian crisis.
ISTANBUL, down 22.5 per cent last week, recovered 8.9 per cent on aggressive
central bank moves in the money and currency markets to check the
depreciation of the lira. The composite index ended at a provisional
15,096.03, up 1,232.33.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips brush aside talks
failure

Wall Street
Blue-chip stocks finished moderately higher yesterday although concern over
US-Japanese trade relations restrained the broader market, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.28 ahead at 3,904.06, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.05 at 470.23.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.32 down at 474.91,
but the Nasdaq composite gained 4.06 to 785.45.
Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 263m shares traded. Advancing issues
led declines, 1,103 to 1,026.
Stocks faltered at the opening as investors sought to put into perspective a
2.7 per cent slide in Tokyo share prices overnight. However, investors
quickly decided that the collapse of Friday's bilateral trade talks in
Washington would have only a minor impact on US corporate earnings.
Likewise, the day's only economic news - December business inventories  -
was virtually ignored. The data showed no change, just as analysts had
expected.
Indeed, the market was looking ahead to a week which was nearly free of
potential obstacles, with the exception of January's consumer price index,
due out on Thursday. In such a vacuum, cyclical issues were free to resume
their march forward.
But later a stumbling block emerged in the US Treasury market. At first, the
heightened trade tensions failed to unhinge bonds. But as the dollar plunged
against the yen during the afternoon, prices on the longer dated government
securities began to show moderate losses. In late trading the benchmark
30-year issue was  15/32 down at 97 15/32 .
The weakness in bonds dampened enthusiasm in stocks, but blue chips managed
to post some gains. Among individual stocks, 3m advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 105 3/4 and Philip Morris added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 .
United Technologies climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 67 3/8 after Morgan Stanley
upgraded the issue. But Merck dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 7/8 and Allied
Signal shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 78.
Car makers were back in favour after three losing sessions: General Motors
gained Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 5/8 , Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59
1/2 and Ford Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 .
With Paramount shareholders set to choose between rival takeover offers,
principals in the long-running takeover saga were active. QVC jumped Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 amid expectations that its bid would fail, while
Viacom B shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 7/8 on the likelihood that
its offer would prevail. The target company's stock eased Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 76 1/8 .
In healthcare, investors continued to respond favourably to last week's
merger of Columbia Healthcare and Hospital Corporation of America. Columbia
HCA added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 3/4 . Canada
Toronto stock prices closed modestly lower. According to preliminary data,
the TSE-300 index fell 10.40 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 4,395.20.
Volume was 64.847m shares, down from Friday's 67.084m shares, but trading
value rose to CDollars 930.3m from CDollars 761.8m.
Nine of 14 sub-indexes closed lower, led by the conglomerates group, down
2.9 per cent as Canadian Pacific tumbled 1 to 22 3/4 on volume of about 2.1m
shares. Maclean Hunter fell  3/8 to 17 on the day's heaviest volume of about
4.2m shares.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 2.7%, sharp
falls in Hong Kong, Taiwan

<TEXT>
The failure of the US-Japan trade talks, the sharp rise in the yen as a
result, and technical selling stemming from the listing of the Nikkei 300
stock futures contract depressed investor confidence and the Nikkei 225
average plunged 2.7 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 lost 531.45 to 19,459.25 after a high of 19,938.99 and a low of
19,368.24. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 26.16 to
1,581.98.
Traders said that the market was driven down by small-lot selling in low
trading volume. 'Half of the cause was the rise in the yen, and the other
half the shifting of futures positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Nikkei
300,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
The yen moved to a three-month high against the dollar, closing at Y105.69.
However, rumours that the Bank of Japan had intervened in the currency
market to stop its ascent triggered buying just below the 19,400 level. The
Nikkei 300 index, against which the Nikkei 300 futures contract was listed
in Osaka, fell 4.4, or 1.5 per cent, to 292.41.
'The fate of the market is in the hands of currency market traders now,'
said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. He added that in a worst case
scenario, the Nikkei 225 could fall to 18,500 in the next few days.
Volume was 300m shares against 359m, declines leading advances by 934 to 155
with 82 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 16.90 to 1294.40.
Export-related stocks plunged on the yen's appreciation. Sony lost Y240 to
Y6,050 and TDK Y110 to Y4,160. Automobiles, however, were mixed, with Nissan
Motor down Y19 to Y819, and Toyota Motor up Y10 to Y1,910.
Banks were lower on profit-taking. The Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to
Y3,270 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,930.
The telecommunications sector, recently up on the 'multimedia' theme, lost
ground, Fujitsu shedding Y50 to Y1,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Y29,000 to Y926,000.
Pharmaceutical shares, un-affected by currency fluctuations, were firm.
Takeda Chemical rose Y20 to Y1,300 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical gained Y10 to
Y1,580.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 288.65 to 21,490.97 in volume of 38.1m
shares.
Roundup
The year of the dog opened with a whimper, as Hong Kong and Taiwan came back
to sharp losses from last week's holiday.
HONG KONG looked at Tokyo and a worrying couple of days on Wall Street,
added expectations of tighter domestic credit and dropped equities in thin
volume.
The Hang Seng index ended 515.22, or 4.5 per cent lower at 10,988.81, about
100 points above its worst.
Unfortunately, London decided the fall was not steep enough, and knocked off
another 1 1/2 per cent, the Fleming Hong Kong index falling 167 to 10,822.
Turnover was HKDollars 6.29bn against HKDollars 5.04bn in last Wednesday's
half-day session on the final day of trading before the lunar new year.
TAIWAN dropped 4.4 per cent after heavy selling in the finance sector, the
weighted index ending 278.87 lower at 6,015.26 in moderately active turnover
of TDollars 58.93bn.
The market had been closed for a week which had seen losses elsewhere, and
sentiment was also hurt by the possibility of tighter liquidity in the money
market this week.
The financial sector lost 6.3 per cent with Cathay Life and the big three
banks limit down.
BOMBAY's speculators sold to comply with a Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI) order to liquidate all forward positions by March 12, and the
BSE 30-share index closed 79.69, or 2 per cent down at 3,911.69. This
followed a 2 per cent decline last week, and a two-month long bull run which
sent share prices up by nearly 50 per cent.
SEOUL reacted to its own market-cooling measures with the composite index
losing 15.77, or 1.7 per cent, at 901.38 in a correction in which, it was
estimated, expensive blue chips and and other low PER stocks have fallen by
about 30 per cent.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index fell 22.30 to 2,319.30 but a
sharp fall in the index stock Wing Taion going ex-rights contributed to the
fall, brokers said. Wing Tai was quoted SDollars 1.46 lower at SDollars
3.00.
AUSTRALIA recovered from an early sell-off in early trade, defying the Tokyo
and Hong Kong trend to close with the All Ordinaries index only 2.8 lower at
2,238.6.
ANZ rose 16 cents to ADollars 5.68 in 4.6m shares, but the better trend in
industrials was balanced by lower metal prices, which dragged the all
resources index down 10.2 down to 1,345.7.
BANGKOK featured cautious bargain hunting by Thai investors which pushed the
SET index up 5.86 to 1,422.20. Turnover was still low at Bt7bn against
Friday's Bt5.5bn, and brokers said that investors were waiting for a lead
from New York.
KARACHI closed higher on settlement day, driven by interest in liquid stocks
in the textile, cement and energy sectors, and prompted by reports of buying
by a foreign fund. The KSE 100 share index rose 39.64 to 2,379.34.
COLOMBO rose 19.37 on corporate earnings growth expectations, the approval
of a second Sri Lankan country fund, and low interest rates.
The CSE all-share index ended at a new 1994 high of 1,207.18.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market activity was yesterday dominated by the dollar which fell to a
five-month low against the yen, as investors sold the US currency in the
wake of last week's failed trade talks, writes Philip Gawith.
After closing at Y107.1 in New York on Friday, the dollar was heavily sold
in Asian and European trading. It touched a low of Y103.50, before
recovering to close in London at Y104.100, its lowest level since September.
The currency fell further in New York and was trading at Y103 yesterday
evening.
Investors sold dollars for yen in anticipation that the US administration
would try and talk up the Japanese currency as a means of curbing Japan's
large trade surplus with the US which reached Dollars 60bn in 1993.
It was the failure last Friday of President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa
to reach agreement at their Washington summit on measures to deal with this
long-standing problem that prompted yesterday's sell-off.
Rumours of intervention by the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve
helped stabilise the currency temporarily, but many dealers felt the market
would probably see if it could push the dollar lower, towards Y100.
The US administration has in the past talked up the yen as a weapon to exert
leverage on Japan in the trade talks. Yesterday's movement clearly reflected
market nervousness that this scenario was likely to be repeated. Mr Mickey
Kantor, US Trade Representative, said the US would be considering its
options all week and would not be making a hurried response. He did say,
however, that it was up to the Japanese to re-open talks.
Apart from a stronger yen, a further option would be imposing sanctions. The
Washington Post reported on Sunday that the Clinton administration has
decided to impose sanctions on some Japanese imports to bolster its
negotiating position.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, believes the dollar
will probably go as low as Y100 unless the US administration speaks out and
makes clear that it disapproves of the current level. The Fed was last
reported intervening for its own account at the Y103 level in August.
Yesterday there were market reports of the Bank of Japan and the Fed
intervening to support the dollar, but no indication that the Fed was
intervening on its own account rather than in concert with the BOJ.
Mr Cunningham believes that the Fed will intervene from its own book when it
thinks the market is short of dollars - that is, when there is maximum
chance that intervention will have some effect. With the market not having
had enough momentum to go through the Y103 level, the Fed may still have
doubts about whether the market is in a corrective mood.
Notwithstanding talk of further yen strength, analysts are already warning
that the currency looks unsustainably high. Nomura Research Institute put
out a note saying it would be 'wary of chasing the yen too far', adding that
'the renewed strengthening is distinctly bad news for the Japanese economy'.
It will undermine confidence further, squeeze corporate profits and raises
the prospect of more job losses. Also, 'further yen strength would undermine
the stock market and could lead to a flight of capital out of Japan,
ultimately reversing the currency's strength'.
Observers noted that this scenario offered little cheer to the US either. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'Even from the US
point of view there must be a recognition that a Japanese economy that is
expanding is preferable to one that is flat on its back.' Mr MacKinnon said,
however, that the onus was with the Japanese to make the next move. 'For the
market to be convinced that the US is going to refrain from jaw-boning the
currency, there are going to have to be some proposals from the Japanese.'
Sterling closed at DM2.5622 in London, slightly down on Friday's close of
DM2.5685. The weakness of the dollar took some pressure off the currency,
which closed at Dollars 1.4693, up from Dollars 1.4663 on Friday. Investor
sentiment was also improved by the release yesterday of producer price data,
lower than forecast, which lent support to last week's much criticised
easing of policy by the Bank of England.
The D-mark maintained its recent mild uptrend against other EMS currencies.
Dealers said trading was mostly a function of how individual currencies were
holding up against the yen. It also closed higher against the weak dollar,
finishing at DM1.7438, up from Friday's London close of DM1.7517.
The German currency was also supported by the market view that the
Bundesbank council is unlikely to ease policy at its meeting on Thursday.
This view was encouraged by the Bundesbank's announcement that this week's
repo would be at a fixed rate of six per cent.
The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money markets with late
assistance of about Pounds 460m. Earlier the bank had put put Pounds 748m
liquidity into the market at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent for
outright sale of bills and 5 5/32 per cent for repo transactions. This
compared with its forecast of a Pounds 1.5bn liquidity shortage, revised up
from Pounds 1.4bn.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU president faces the
unpalatable facts - David Naish is prepared for change, but some of his
members hanker after the past / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost imperceptibly over the last few years the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales has changed from the whingeing body many still believe it
to be into a positive, forward-looking organisation, ready to meet, head-on,
the undoubted challenges ahead.
At least its leaders have changed. In the backwoods, some grass roots
members still expect the government to provide them with a living through
guarantees and subsidies; and there are probably far more of them than the
union's leaders would care to admit.
Last week's annual meeting in London illustrated the point. Ten or 15 years
ago the keynote speech by the president of the day was often a long tirade
against the inadequacies of government farm policies. It normally contained
demands for increases in guaranteed prices of a whole range of farm
commodities. That was the kind of speech the membership expected and it had
been like that for most of the 90 years of the union's history.
But at last week's event, significantly entitled 'Farming in Society', Mr
David Naish, the NFU president, sought to create a different mood. And he
did so at a time when agriculture faced more and potentially greater
challenges than for 60 years.
Although average UK farm incomes increased by over 60 per cent in 1993 -
largely a result of the 1992 sterling devaluation and compensation for the
set-aside and price cuts imposed by CAP reform - they did so from a very low
base. Furthermore ongoing reform, followed by further Gatt-inspired
restrictions, would lead, said Mr Naish, to 'turbulent' times for farmers
over the next few years.
The price-cuts and compensation package is scheduled to continue for two
more years, after which there is no firm policy except that the level of
those guaranteed prices which remain will be below most UK farmers' current
production costs. And although both the European Commission and the UK
government claim the requirements of the Gatt deal are compatible with CAP
reform the NFU and other commentators are not convinced. They believe
further price and production cuts are inevitable.
But apart from stressing the need for new policies to be 'applied equitably
across the European Union and the world', Mr Naish accepted the challenge
these changes would bring. He went on, moreover, to state that agriculture
had just two choices to consider - reducing production or accepting more
price cuts.
It was clear that for the long-term he favoured the removal of production
restrictions and the acceptance of much freer markets based on world values,
not least because he questioned whether taxpayers would be prepared to fund
more and more set-aside. Open-ended support systems, he declared, did
farmers no favours; they merely distorted marketing decisions and made the
process of change even more difficult.
Nevertheless, he demanded that farmers should not be abandoned to the whims
of a totally unregulated market and that his members should not be
sacrificed on the altar of free trade. The question was not whether farmers
should be supported, he said, but what form the support should take. And he
went on to suggest that it should be tied to the holistic relationship
farmers have with the countryside - as its guardians as well as producers of
safe food.
These were brave, and to insiders, radical words from a man who faced
re-election the following day.
The NFU insists on subjecting its leaders to a vote every year; and if a
sitting president fails to receive the support of 80 per cent of the council
he can be ousted from office. Clearly the incumbent cannot afford to offend
more than a few of the 80 or so members of that ruling body, or the regions
they represent, if he is to survive. And at the end of Mr Naish's speech to
the AGM, the applause was, to say the least, subdued.
In spite of that, Mr Naish and his two deputies, both of whom have been
associated with the new positive approach of the union, were all re-elected.
Perhaps most of those who voted were feeling charitable because of those
increased incomes last year. Or perhaps the grass roots membership is at
last coming to terms with the fact that change is inevitable and they must
either accept the challenges or get out of the business.
In any case, the re-election of the NFU's top team seems likely to lead to
even greater official advocacy of sound farm business principles rather than
reliance on government. That means improving efficiency and getting more
from the market. As Mr Naish put it in his address: 'We must be determined
to produce what our customers require - not just what we want to produce'.
To such an audience those were very brave words indeed.

FT  15 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices extend losses -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most base metals prices extended last week's losses yesterday as short-term
sentiment switched towards the downside with the recent speculative uptrend
losing momentum, London Metal Exchange dealers said.
ALUMINIUM prices broke lower in after hours trading, with the three months
delivery position falling below the Dollars 1,250-a-tonne level as the
market lost some enthusiasm over the current round of output cuts. Long
holders had seen recent announcements of cuts as an opportunity to take
profits, and there was further to go on the downside, dealers suggested.
Noranda Aluminium Noranda, a subsidiary of Noranda of Canada, said yesterday
it would cut output at its New Madrid, Missouri, smelter by about 22,000
tonnes a year by delaying the relining of pots and reducing amperage. The
cut will be implemented within 90 days.
COPPER prices were fairly resilient, holding close to the Dollars
1,850-a-tonne three months level after early rises attracted sellers. But
dealers warned that there was further scope on the downside and some thought
a test of support at Dollars 1,830 a tonne was likely soon.
The ZINC market slid back in line with the overall trend, although some
support seemed to be developing around Dollars 960 a tonne, with final
business at Dollars 966, down Dollars 9.
LEAD prices fell to session lows after the afternoon trading ring as
stop-loss selling orders were triggered by a breech of the Dollars
490-a-tonne level. Final business was at a one-month low of Dollars 482 a
tonne, a Dollars 14 loss from last Friday. Although the fundamental picture
was constructive for lead, in the short term the market was coming under
pressure from the overall re-alignment in metal prices.
The London Commodity Exchange's COFFEE and COCOA markets both ended a
routine day in the minus column as they continued bereft of any fundamental
news.
Precious metals prices picked up after a slow start with GOLD closing
Dollars 2 up at Dollars 382.75 a troy ounce, SILVER 9 cents up at Dollars
5.34 1/2 an ounce and PLATINUM Dollars 3.75 up at Dollars 393.75 an ounce.
Dealers saw few fresh factors affecting the markets, which were still
dominated by the weaker dollar following the breakdown of US-Japanese trade
talks. Gold's indifferent performance had been predicted on the charts,
which had been signalling a sideways drift for several weeks, one dealer
said.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait considers hedging to
stabilise oil revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait is considering the use of financial hedging instruments such as oil
futures to help stabilise government revenues, which have been badly hit by
low oil prices.
Some international banks are said to have made recent representations to
Kuwaiti government officials on the advantages of using futures' contracts
to hedge a portion of their oil revenues. They are reported to have have
cited Mexico as an example of an oil producer that uses hedging techniques
to cover about 10 per cent of its petroleum export revenues.
No decision has been made on whether to adopt such a strategy, according to
industry officials. But they stress the importance to the country of
stabilising government revenues, which are overwhelmingly dependent on the
prices of oil and petroleum products.
Bankers and industry analysts have suggested in recent months that members
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could reduce their
vulnerability to sharp falls in volatile short-term oil prices by adopting
hedging strategies. Some Opec members, however, are restricted by domestic
laws that bar such practices. The hedging issue is just one element of a
current debate in Kuwaiti government circles over ways to reduce the impact
of wildly fluctuating oil revenues. One of the most contentious issues is
whether Kuwait should expand its international exploration and production
activities in non-Opec countries, where any discoveries would fall outside
the Opec quota system.
Opec has blamed independent producers for undermining already weak oil
markets by expanding production at a time of low prices.

<TEXT>
World oil prices took a fall yesterday as traders at the New York Mercantile
Exchange started selling heating oil futures in the belief that the worst of
the Arctic winter in the US was over, reports Reuter.
At the London International Petroleum Exchange the April futures contract
for the world benchmark Brent Blend of crude oil traded as low as Dollars
13.45 a barrel, down 31 cents from Friday, before rallying in the afternoon.
Brokers said the decline was led by the Nymex where heating oil tumbled on
forecasts of above-normal US temperatures later this week. At midday Nymex's
March heating oil futures contract was down 2.5 cents, about 5 per cent, to
just under 48.5 cents a US gallon.
It was Europe's turn to feel the cold as icy Siberian winds swept westward.
But wholesalers said consumer stocks of heating fuel in Germany - the
biggest European market - were relatively high, so the European cold snap
might have to last some time before it had an impact on oil demand.
In the longer term, the Vienna-based secretariat of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast of likely underlying oil
demand in the forthcoming April-June quarter.
An Opec official said the latest estimate was for a requirement for the
cartel's oil of 23.17m barrels a day, down 240,000 from its previous
estimate.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pressure mounts for cuts at
Russian aluminium smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's aluminium smelters have been given until Thursday this week to come
up with proposals that will enable the government to meet its undertaking to
cut annual aluminium production by 500,000 tonnes over the next six months.
Smelter managers have been told by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime
minister, to decide among themselves who should cut output and by how much,
according to western industry observers.
The Russian industry is looking particularly towards its two biggest
smelters, at Bratsk, which has an annual capacity of 850,000 tonnes, and the
760,000-tonne Krasnoyarsk plant to make most of the cuts. Smaller smelters
say they have no room for manoeuvre as whole communities depend on their
output. Cuts at the two big smelters would not be a matter of life and death
as it would be for them.
However, both Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk are resisting the pressure, pointing
out they are now private entities with private shareholders to think about.
Only Novokuznetsk so far has volunteered a contribution. It will close one
building for modernisation and take 30,000 tonnes, or about 11 per cent,
from its annual capacity of 280,000 tonnes.
'I am sure the smelters will come up with a solution - it is too big a risk
for them not to,' said Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology
marketing for VAW of Germany, which is helping Novokuznetsk to modernise. He
pointed out that, although the smelter managers had considerable
independence from Moscow, they understood that if they did not agree to make
output cuts the European Union might continue to restrict Russian aluminium
imports and that anti-dumping charges might be made by the US industry. 'The
smelters understand there has to be joint action or their two biggest
markets might be blocked,' said Mr Peters.
The smelter managers also understood the connection between record London
Metal Exchange aluminium stocks and low prices, he added.
Mr Peters suggested the Russian smelters were already under considerable
financial pressure and having to cut costs in the face of squeezed margins.
At the Siberian smelters, for example, average wages had been increased from
the equivalent of Dollars 50 a month to Dollars 300 in the past year and 'a
year ago they had a margin of Dollars 800 a tonne, now they are struggling
to survive.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: JGBs stage rally as European sectors fail
to settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
While Europe's bond markets resumed their erratic and volatile trading
patterns of recent days, Japanese government bonds rallied smartly after
their recent declines.
Encouraged by a firmer yen, the weak stock market and renewed speculation of
a cut in the official discount rate, JGBs rallied in Tokyo and continued to
rise in London. The March JGB future rose 0.77 point to 115.30 in Tokyo and
rose further to 115.55 in London trading on Liffe.
The rally was triggered by the failure of last week's US-Japanese trade
talks which fuelled fears of a higher yen, said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of
bond research at Yamaichi International. Currency strength will also boost
Japan's already positive inflation outlook, underpinning bonds and
encouraging speculation of more rate cuts, he said.
While supply concerns remain, they were not enough to damp bullish
sentiment. Moreover, the long end was helped by the fact that today's
government auction is in the six-year sector - the first time since 1981 the
government is selling six-year notes, one trader said.
UK gilts had another volatile day, briefly supported in the morning by
bullish producer price data but slipping back after the US opened. 'There
was more US selling in the futures market,' reported a trader at a large
London bank.
Price action is expected to remain directionless and investors sidelined
until Wednesday's release of January inflation numbers. The market consensus
is for a headline rate of 2.6 per cent and an ex-mortgage rate of 3 per
cent.
Traders also are awaiting today's announcement by the Bank of England of the
terms of the latest gilt auction. Traders are divided, with some calling for
the 7 per cent gilts due 2001 to be tapped while others expect another
tranche of the 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. The latter would be targeted
more at foreign investors, who favour 10-year bonds, while a shorter
maturity would primarily attract domestic investors, traders said.
German bonds wiped out early gains to close little changed in technical
trading. The Bundesbank's announcement of another round of fixed-rate repos
at 6 per cent had little market impact, although it was seen to reduce the
likelihood of a cut in interest rates at Thursday's meeting of the
Bundesbank central bank council.
Meanwhile, the Dutch government accepted Fl 5.3bn of bids for its new
tranche of 5.75 per cent 10-year bonds. The paper was initially offered at
99.35 but the price was increased to end the session at 99.80. The tap will
remain open today, with the finance ministry seen wanting to raise a total
of Fl 10bn.
Italian bonds fell nearly  1/2 point, pressured by new 3- and 5-year supply
and the prospect of a 10-year auction today. The March BTP contract on Liffe
fell 0.41 point to 117.24.
French bonds also slipped on disappointment that the Bank of France left
rates unchanged at its latest repo operation. The March notional bond future
fell 0.12 point to 128.86.
Longer-dated US government bonds retreated yesterday afternoon on fears that
the dollar's sharp drop against the yen would trigger heavy selling by
Japanese investors.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower at 97
15/32 , with the yield rising to 6.438 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.403 per cent.
In early trading, prices sagged as the market waited to see how the
break-down of Friday's US-Japanese trade talks in Washington would influence
sentiment. When heavy selling by Japanese bond holders failed to
materialise, bonds stabilised in buying driven by technical factors.
By late afternoon, however, concern over movements in the currency markets
caught up with bonds. Near the end of the session, the dollar was trading in
New York at around Y102.70, against Y107.20 late Friday. Earlier it touched
a low of Y101 before rebounding somewhat. The news of the dollar's weakness
brought a swift drop to longer-dated bonds, but the short-end held steady.
The market virtually ignored the day's economic news. The Commerce
Department reported that December business inventories were unchanged, as
expected.
Reuters, the financial information and news group, has signed a deal with
Liberty Brokerage Investment Company, the New York-based inter-dealer
broker, allowing it to quote data on US Treasuries.
Reuters said its customers would be provided with Liberty Brokerage's data
free of charge later this year. Liberty Brokerage is a significant
inter-dealer broker of US Treasury securities and - through its affiliates -
of US mortgage-backed securities, non-US government securities and
derivatives in Europe.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Uncertainty again keeps dealers on the
sidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issuance in the Eurobond market got off to a slow start yesterday as
continuing uncertainty in the financial markets kept investors and issuers
at the sidelines.
However, syndicate managers reported that there were several deals in the
pipeline. The National Bank of Hungary has awarded the mandate for its first
global offering to Salomon Brothers and the deal could be launched towards
the end of next week. The issue is expected to raise between Dollars 500m
and Dollars 750m, have a maturity of 10 years and be priced to yield between
225 and 250 basis points over 10-year US treasuries.
World Bank officials are due in London today to give details of its
forthcoming Dollars 5bn global multi-currency note programme. The facility,
which is expected to be signed in the next two weeks, is designed to
facilitate the launch of structured products.
Among yesterday's sparse offerings, Credit Local de France raised CDollars
250m through an offering of 12-year Eurobonds. An official at lead manager
Paribas acknowledged that the bonds were tightly priced at 20 basis points
over the yield on 10-year Canadian government bonds, giving a spread of 15
basis points over the interpolated 12-year yield curve.
However, he noted that the issuer had been less aggressive than usual in
obtaining longer-dated funding and had missed its funding targets by between
five to 10 basis points. The issuer was believed to have swapped the
proceeds of the issue into floating-rate dollars.
The official added that the bonds were attractive to investors who felt that
the yield differential between 10-year Canadian government bonds and US
treasuries would narrow to around 50 basis points from 70 basis points
currently.
When Credit Local's bonds were freed to trade they were quoted at 98.70 bid,
down from their re-offer price of 99.125, which reflected the weak opening
in Canadian government bonds.
Credito Italiano and ABB raised L200bn each through offerings of five-year
floating-rate notes and 10-year Eurobonds respectively. Both issuers took
advantage of the recent strength in the Italian government bond market and
investor demand for yield.
Credito Italiano's deal, the first FRN offering denominated in lira to be
issued by an Italian bank, was targeted mainly at Italian investors who were
seeking the protection of a floating-rate instrument in the run-up to the
general election in March, an official at Credito Italiano said.
Late in the day, the Republic of Colombia launched its first offering in the
Yankee market - the US domestic market for foreign issuers. The Dollars
250m, 10-year offering, via Merrill Lynch, is due to be priced today to
yield around 150 basis points over US treasuries.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Disappointment at Depfa-Bank
over rating level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depfa-Bank, Germany's largest mortgage bank, yesterday expressed
disappointment at the decision by Moody's to assign a long-term debt rating
of Aa3 to its Eurobonds.
The unsolicited rating is at least two notches below the market's perception
of the bank, whose full name is Deutsche Pfandbrief- und Hypothekenbank. In
the past year Depfa has raised more than Dollars 3bn in a variety of
currencies in the Eurobond market at spreads commensurate with strong
double-A rated institutions.
'We are disappointed by the rating,' said Mr Gerhard Bruckermann, the member
of Depfa's management board responsible for treasury fund management and for
public sector loans.
He added that he had been surprised that the Moody's analysts had not asked
any material questions during discussions with Depfa's management board. The
meetings took place in late January as a result of a letter which Moody's
sent Depfa in December saying that it was about to assign a rating on the
basis of publicly available information.
Moody's said its rating reflected the changing risk profile of Depfa, its
wholesale franchise and dependence on wholesale funding, as well as the
structural subordination of the senior unsecured debt in relation to its
secured German mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe).
Analysts said Moody's appeared to be penalising Depfa for both its current
low profitability and for the diversification strategy it was pursuing to
enhance the bank's earnings. 'I think Moody's has taken a step too far,'
said one analyst.

advances 21%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The volume of interest rate swaps written during the first half of 1993
reached 60,553 contracts, up 21 per cent from the previous six months, while
contract volume in over-the-counter currency swaps dipped 8 per cent, to
4,897 contracts during the same period, according to a bi-annual survey of
swaps activity conducted by Arthur Andersen and commissioned by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
ISDA said the total notional principal amount of new swaps written during
the first six months of 1993 reached Dollars 2,100bn, up 27 per cent from
the last six months of 1992. Interest rate swaps accounted for Dollars
1,900bn of the total, and currency swaps Dollars 157bn. The value of capital
risked in these transactions is typically 2 to 3 per cent of the notional
principal value.
The fastest-growing segment of the over-the-counter derivatives business,
according to the survey, was interest rate swap options, or 'swaptions.'
During the first half of 1993, about 40 per cent of interest rate and
currency swaps were denominated in US dollars.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Foster's up 21% in spite of
decline on brewing side
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian company which owns the Courage
business in the UK, reported a 21 per cent rise in profits after tax and
abnormal items in the half-year to end-December, to ADollars 210.8m
(USDollars 151m). This was on spite of lower earnings from its core brewing
interests,
Profits in the same period of 1992-93 stood at ADollars 173.6m. First-half
sales were ADollars 2.62bn, compared with ADollars 3.49bn.
The improvement, however, was due entirely to lower interest charges, which
fell from ADollars 123.6m to ADollars 89.3m, and a ADollars 49m abnormal
surplus related to asset sales, compared with a ADollars 17.7m gain in the
previous year.
By contrast, Foster's said its total brewing profit fell from ADollars
302.9m a year ago, to ADollars 279.8m. The Australian operations at Carlton
and United Breweries chipped in a 26.7 per cent improvement in operating
profits, at ADollars 129m, which Foster's said came on the back of increased
market shares - rising to 54 per cent of the Australian market overall in
December - and some product launches. Exports to Asia-Pacific and the Middle
East also grew 'significantly'.
In the UK, Courage saw earnings before interest and tax decline from
ADollars 131.3m to ADollars 100.7m. Although about ADollars 10m of this was
due to exchange rate movements, Fosters blamed most of the fall on higher
sales and marketing expenditure. Sales volume was static and market share
nudged ahead to just over 19 per cent.
Courage's performance was hampered by British consumers taking advantage of
relaxed excise duties to import cheap European beer. Courage - Britain's
second largest brewer - said it also expected Inntrepreneur Estates, its pub
joint venture with Grand Metropolitan, to break even in 1994 despite an an
Pounds 18m (USDollars 263m) loss in the 12 months to September 30 last year.
In Canada, meanwhile, the contribution from Molson fell from ADollars 69.8m
to ADollars 50.2m. However, Foster's said around ADollars 14m of this
reflected the change in ownership structure, which saw the Australian
group's stake fall from 50 to 40 per cent.
After the lower interest charges - which reflected the ongoing disposal
programme at Foster's and associated reduction in the group's heavy debt
levels - pre-tax operating profits were 13.3 per cent higher at ADollars
178.3m.
Foster's said the economic outlook in its main markets of Australia, the UK
and Canada, was improving.

Thai Airways International (Thai), the partially-privatised national
airline, yesterday announced a sharp rise in net profit in its first quarter
to end-December to Bt1.09bn (Dollars 43m) from Bt119m in the same period a
year earlier.
The profit for the quarter amounts to more than Thai's entire net earnings
in the previous financial year, but falls short of the company's own
forecast for the quarter of Bt1.15bn made a month ago.
Thai released no further financial details yesterday, and it was not clear
how the rise in profit was achieved.
In previous years the company has inflated its profits by selling aircraft
and leasing them back. There is no evidence of aircraft sales in the latest
quarter, but the company may have sold other assets; to add to the
confusion, the company is reforming its accounting system with the help of
KPMG Peat Marwick Suthee.
Thai said recently that profits have benefited from a higher load factor.

Aztec Mining Company, which is facing an unwanted bid from Mr Robert de
Crespigny's Poseidon Gold, yesterday reported a turnround in profitability
last year, with net operating profits of ADollars 12.8m (USDollars 9.2m) for
the 12 months, compared with a loss of ADollars 50.8m in 1992
The improvement, however, was due to abnormal items. The previous year
included a charge of ADollars 459.8m, while the recent 12 months benefited
from a gain of ADollars 9.6m, related to the disposal of an investment in
Discovery Petroleum.
At the operating level, before tax and abnormals, Aztec made a small loss in
1993 of ADollars 41.8m, compared with an equally modest profit of ADollars
1.2m in 1992.
Aztec noted that the state of base metal prices had made life difficult last
year, but said that 'continuing improvements' at the Bounty Gold Mine, and
'increasingly stable operating conditions' at the Woodcutters and Scuddles
zinc mines had 'significantly reduced the full impact of the adverse
economic climate.

<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday began negotiations over
the emergency financial restructuring of Euro Disney at a meeting with its
European subsidiary's banks in Paris.
The banks demanded at the meeting that the US group, which owns 49 per cent
of Euro Disney, should play a fuller part in the restructuring. They
proposed a number of concessions that Walt Disney might make: notably
reducing its entitlement to royalties on the income from admissions,
catering and merchandise at the EuroDisneyland theme park.
Walt Disney repeated its warnings that unless the banks agree to an outline
deal by March 31, it will withdraw its financial support for Euro Disney.
The European company, which is burdened by heavy losses and debts, has since
the start of this year been financially dependent on its US parent and,
without its backing, would be forced to close.
The banks are still awaiting the completion of a full audit on Euro Disney's
financial position that they have commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick and is
scheduled for completion by February 22. However, they estimate that Euro
Disney will need a capital injection of FFr12bn to FFr13bn, to reduce its
FFr20.3bn (USDollars 3.41bn) net debt to a more manageable level.
This figure is slightly higher than the FFr10bn injection proposed last
autumn by Walt Disney. The US group had suggested raising the money through
the combination of a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. The banks
yesterday proposed examining a more complex solution with a bigger role for
Walt Disney.

National Bank of New Zealand is nearly doubling its dividend to its parent,
Lloyds Bank of the UK, to NZDollars 60m (USDollars 34m) after announcing a
48 per cent rise in after-tax profit to NZDollars 151m in the year to
December 31. In 1992 it paid Lloyds a NZDollars 34m dividend.
The bank, New Zealand's third biggest, said the improvement reflected a
strong performance across all areas of operations. Sir Spencer Russell,
chairman, said the low level of provisions for bad debt also contributed to
the profit rise. Provisions fell from NZDollars 36m to NZDollars 7m.
Profit before tax was NZDollars 215m against NZDollars 153m. The result
included a full year's contribution from Rural Bank, which was bought from
Fletcher Challenge in 1992. The 1992 accounts included only six months'
profits from this subsidiary, the country's biggest lender to the farming
sector.
Lloyds Bank NZA, a 100 per cent owned Australian subsidiary of Lloyds Bank,
yesterday reported after-tax profits up 5.8 per cent to ADollars 8.2m
(USDollars 5.9m) in 1993 from ADollars 7.8m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from
Sydney.
Mr Tony Parkes, chairman, NZA, said profit has increased for three years in
a row.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Matif aims to win forex
business from OTC rivals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Matif, the French futures exchange, hopes to wrest business from the
over-the-counter foreign exchange markets when it opens options contracts on
price movements between the US dollar and two European currencies on May 20.
In launching the forex options the exchange will be defying the overwhelming
sentiment of the world's foreign exchange traders: that exchange-listed
currency hedging vehicles are redundant.
With a daily global net turnover in excess of Dollars 880bn, forex dealers
have deep and liquid markets in which to transact both spot business and
contracts for forward delivery. These unregulated markets allow a
flexibility in transaction size and delivery terms that other exchanges have
been unable to imitate.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange was the first to attempt to divert some of
the lucrative forex turnover on to its trading floor in 1972. It added
options on its currency futures in 1984, and in 1993 had currency-related
turnover of 5.9m contracts. The growth has been respectable, exchange
officials say, but has not kept pace with the overall expansion in global
forex dealings.
London's Liffe listed options on spot foreign exchange rates in 1985, but
abandoned the effort in 1990, unable to compete with deeply liquid and
highly standardised OTC markets. The Chicago Board Options Exchange tried
similar products, but volume was so low that they transfered the business to
the tiny Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
Matif's options contracts - one reflecting dollar/D-Mark exchange rates and
the second dollar/French franc movements - most closely resemble those
traded in Philadelphia. Franc and D-Mark options are the Philadelphia
markets' most active currency products. In January, Philadelphia's average
daily volume in spot D- Mark options was 15,000 contracts, and in its French
franc options, 12,200 contracts.
Matif officials reason that Philadelphia is an unlikely centre for foreign
exchange derivatives. They also have discovered that a good portion of
Philadelphia's currency options business originates in Paris, and they would
like to recapture it, however small.
The Matif's options contracts, to be sized in Dollars 100,000 increments,
will be traded on Matif's floor during regular business hours, and on its
old THS telephone trading system after hours.

Nikkei 300 contract

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new futures and options contract for Japanese shares was launched
yesterday on the Osaka Securities Exchange. The long-awaited listing of the
Nikkei 300, a capitalisation weighted index, however, helped the underlying
Tokyo stock market to decline 2.7 per cent as investors shifted positions
from the existing Nikkei 225 futures contract.
Financial authorities had long blamed the price weighted Nikkei 225 futures
for the plunge of Japanese share prices, and had hoped that the Nikkei 300
would eliminate volatility. However, they were embarrassed when the
announcement of the index's details in October by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
prompted a technical sell off as futures traders unloaded component stocks
of the Nikkei 225 not included in the new Nikkei 300.
Some traders expect further shifts in futures positions to affect Japanese
stock prices in the near term. The OSE will not immediately abolish Nikkei
225 contracts, but wants the Nikkei 300 contracts to take over once trading
volumes increase.
The Nikkei 225 has been blamed for the slump of the Tokyo stock exchange
over the past three years, triggering a spate of restrictions to curb
speculative trading on the futures and options markets. Leaders of the Osaka
business and financial community also hope the Nikkei 300 will restore the
OSE's image.
Although it is still too early to judge the success of the new futures
contracts, the OSE has managed to enlist the country's large institutional
investors into a group of business leaders 'promoting the Nikkei 300 to the
world'.
But while some foreign traders predict that in two to three years the Nikkei
300 futures market could become the largest in the world, the short-term
outlook remains subdued before the March book closing period.

Cigna, the US insurer, reported a fall in after-tax profits last year as it
took a Dollars 244m charge to cover asbestos and environmental costs. It
also restructured its property and casualty operations.
The company said it would report after-tax losses of Dollars 60m in the
current quarter, due to the Californian earthquake, and Dollars 25m
attributable to the severe weather in the US.
However, Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive, said the restructuring on the
property and casualty side, which led to a Dollars 107m after-tax charge,
would lead to improved results in the future.
Net income for the year fell to Dollars 234m, or Dollars 3.25 a share, from
Dollars 311m, or Dollars 4.34, in 1992. In the final three months of 1993,
net income jumped to Dollars 194m from Dollars 50mm, boosted by after-tax
realised investment gains of Dollars 102m, compared with Dollars 19m in the
1992 quarter.
Operating income in Cigna's life and health insurance businesses was up 42
per cent during the year, to Dollars 464m.
Property and casualty activities reported an operating loss of Dollars 124m
in the final quarter, and Dollars 350m in the year as a whole, compared with
losses of Dollars 115m and Dollars 351m.

<TEXT>
The Japanese company Aoki Corporation has agreed in principle to sell the
Westin Hotel &amp; Resort chain for Dollars 708m to a group of investors led by
Bernardo Dominguez, the chief executive of DSC, a large Mexican business.
The Aoki Corporation bought Westin Hotel &amp; Resort in 1988. The chain
operates more than 70 luxury hotels in 19 countries. It has around 42,000
rooms, and reported revenues of about Dollars 420m a year.
Mr Dominguez and investors will buy about 50 of the hotels, with those in
Asia, six in Canada, and some minority investments in the US remaining in
the hands of the Aoki Corporation. The two companies will sign agreements
co-ordinating services, marketing and sales to ensure the Westin group
operates as an integrated organisation.
DSC is a privately-owned company with interests in construction, property
and tourism. It owns several four-star hotels in Mexico, and one of the
country's largest travel agencies and tour operators.
Mr Pablo Macedo, head of DSC's tourism group, said the new owner would
expand the Westin hotel chain in Europe and Latin America. He said DSC would
not run the Westin hotel group, but that Mr Dominguez, as chairman of the
board, would play an important part in overseeing its operations.
The letter of intent to conclude the transaction was signed between the two
groups at the weekend. The transaction is expected to be finalised in the
second quarter of 1994, according to a joint statement by Aoki and Mr
Dominguez. Aoki was advised by The Blackstone Group of the US, and Mr
Dominguez by Salomon Brothers.

Canadian Pacific, the transport, resources, hotel and property group, is
raising CDollars 500m (USDollars 373.1m) with a new equity issue.
Net proceeds of CDollars 484m after costs will be used to repay debt and for
investment in its principal businesses.
'The new equity will raise flexibility and put our balance sheet on a sound
footing, just as prospects are improving with economic recovery,' Mr William
Stinson, chairman, said.
CP stock hit a 52-week high of CDollars 24.25 in the market last week after
the company reported a stronger than expected turnround in 1993.
The group has been restructured over two years of recession, and mining and
forest products interests have been sold. The writedowns required have
already been made.
Before unusual items, fourth quarter net profit from continuing operations
was 34 cents a share, nearly twice what many analysts had expected. For all
1993, profit equalled 76 cents a share, against 34 cents in 1992.
Freight rail operations led the fourth-quarter upturn with a 15 per cent
gain in volume, while energy and most other businesses did better for the
full year.
Analysts expect a weaker first quarter this year, but Mr John Johnson, of
Richardson Greenshields Canada, says 'CP's earnings are at a full recovery
setting'.
CP will file a short-form prospectus for the issue of 22m common shares at
CDollars 22.75 a share tomorrow. The offer closes March 10 and is not being
registered in the US. RBC Dominion Securities leads the underwriting group.

<TEXT>
Co-Steel, with mini-mills in Canada, the US and UK, reported an impressive
recovery in 1993 in spite of rising scrap prices.
Strengthening US markets, record production and shipments and a lower
Canadian dollar help to lift net income to CDollars 26.4m (USDollars 19.7m),
or 87 cents a share, from CDollars 3.2m, or 11 cents, in 1992 on sales of
CDollars 1.06bn, a jump of 21 per cent.
Shipments rose 6.5 per cent to 2.4m tonnes.
Fourth-quarter profit amounted to CDollars 7.4m, or 24 cents a share,
compared with CDollars 2m or 7 cents a year earlier,on sales of CDollars
280m, up 30 per cent, with higher selling prices.
The British scrap operations did well but the Sheerness mini-mill continued
to lose money because of the recession.
Co-Steel is due to start up a USDollars 300m joint venture thin-slab
mini-mill in Kentucky in 1995. It is also considering a USDollars 200m
mini-mill project in the US midwest.

Placer Pacific net

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Placer Pacific, the Australian mining group controlled by Canada's Placer
Dome, yesterday reported record after-tax earnings of ADollars 110.3m
(USDollars 79.1m) in the year to end-December. The group has a minority of
its shares listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges.
The improved result, which compares with ADollars 74.9m the previous year,
was entirely due to to special tax adjustments. Placer Pacific's operating
profit before taxes and outside equity interests for the 12 months stood at
ADollars 129.7m, compared with ADollars 154.2m last time.
The company's revenues in the period fell from ADollars 623.5m (including a
ADollars 6.7m special item) to ADollars 532.3m. Placer said this was
partially due to the sale of a 5 per cent interest in the Porgera gold mine
in Papua New Guinea to the PNG government. The sale reduced its interest in
the mine to 25 per cent.
Lower production at Porgera, and at the Misima mine, also in PNG, also
dented revenues. This, however, was partly offset by higher production at
the Kidston and Granny Smith mines in Australia.
Placer said gold production from Placer-managed mines was 1.89m ounces,
compared with 2.32m ounces in 1992, and ahead of early forecasts. The
company's equity share of gold production was 829,064 ounces compared with
1.03m ounces in 1992.
Although costs overall fell, the lower level of gold production meant cash
cost per ounce rose from ADollars 227 to ADollars 252.
Placer said it expected to increase 'significantly' its exploration budget
for 1994, to fund expansion of its exploration programmes into Asia.
Countries targeted include Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Myanmar.

skyways - The big carriers are struggling against small low-cost airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Which is the most profitable airline in the US? The mighty United Airlines,
the nation's biggest carrier in terms of passenger miles flown? American
Airlines, relegated this year to the number two slot? Delta Air Lines, still
at number three?
The answer is none of the above. All three of the biggest airlines reported
yet another year of heavy losses, while by far the largest profits came,
once again, from Southwest Airlines, the relatively small, Texas-based
carrier transforming the US air travel market with its low-cost, no-frills
services.
The US airline industry, at least as represented by the big carriers, is
still an industry in crisis.
The fundamental problem is that too many seats are chasing too few
passengers. The only airlines doing well are those with costs so low they
can offer cheap fares and still make a profit - and that means airlines such
as South-west.
Still, the last year has not been quite as disastrous as the preceding three
for the larger carriers. In the third quarter, traditionally the strongest
because it includes the busy summer holiday season, most airlines managed to
creep back into profit. The fourth-quarter figures, though showing most of
the airlines back in loss, show the same improving trend, too.
Admittedly, the improvement may not be evident in the results from American,
Delta and Continental. However, in each of these cases there were special
factors.
American suffered a five-day strike by its flight attendants that wiped an
estimated Dollars 190m from after-tax income; Delta took a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 112.3m for the early retirement of nearly 1,500 workers; and the
comparison at Continental has little meaning because the airline emerged
from bankruptcy protection as a new company in April 1993.
With or without these special factors, all the big airlines performed
significantly better in 1993 than in the year before. Partly, this reflected
efforts to get costs down to a level nearer the small carriers'.
They shed thousands of jobs, and tried, with varying success, to get more
efficient working practices out of their remaining employees. They also
reduced capacity, retiring older aircraft and deferring delivery of new
ones, and dropped some loss-making routes.
With those efforts continuing into the current year, and the economy still
showing modest growth, stock market analysts are expecting a further
improvement in the figures for 1994.
In fact, they believe the industry could make its first profit since the
economic boom of the late 1980s, with net income of between Dollars 1bn and
Dollars 1.5bn for the full year. Even so, the celebrations are decidedly
muted.
The reason is the big carriers are still far from delivering an acceptable
profit margin, and profound uncertainties remain to be resolved before they
do so. The biggest of these is the likelihood that domestic fares will
plunge still lower, as the large carriers copy small ones by setting up
low-cost, no-frills subsidiaries to handle short-haul flights.
United's employees have already agreed to the company's plan to set up a
low-cost airline-within-an-airline in exchange for a controlling stake in
the company's equity.
Delta is awaiting the results of an internal review which will decide
whether it follows the same route. The largely non-union Continental is a
step ahead of both with its low-cost operation nicknamed CALite offering
'Peanuts Fares' on many routes.
A telling sign of the downward pressure on fares came when USAir recently
responded to severe price competition from Continental and Southwest by
slashing fares on hundreds of routes in the eastern US by up to 50 per cent.
This was not just a special promotional offer hedged about with conditions
and restrictions: the cuts applied to business fares as well as leisure
fares, and will last indefinitely.
The picture is not entirely gloomy. Airline capacity is lower this year, and
passenger numbers should rise. However, with the competitive pressures on
fares showing no signs of easing, the big carriers are caught in a cycle
where each cost-saving is needed to deliver the next fare cut instead of
flowing through into a profits recovery.
'Sure, I think there will be some spells of 12 to 18 months where we see
some nice numbers,' says Mr Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan
Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank. 'But can I foresee a period of
five or six years of decent profits? Not for the balance of the decade.'

CANTV, Venezuela's nationalised telecommunications company, is lifting
capital investment for 1994 to USDollars 705m, its largest annual outlay.
Investments this year are part of a Dollars 6bn capital spending programme
planned for up to 2000.
CANTV, formerly owned by the Venezuelan government, has since 1991 been
controlled by an international consortium headed by GTE of the US. Other
non-Venezuelan partners in the consortium are Spain's Telefonica and AT&amp;T.
CANTV's capital investments in 1993 totalled Dollars 650m.
Just over 67 per cent of this year's investments will be used to expand
telecommunications services; 5 per cent will go to new services, 15 per cent
to modernisation, and 11 per cent to services, including mobile phones.
The privatised company has improved Venezuela's telecommunications services
substantially since it took over. However, it still has a long way to go in
establishing a reliable and modern network for its population of 20.7m.
Mr Bruce Haddad, CANTV's president, said demand for 1m new telephone lines
would not be met until the end of the decade.

Two Canadian energy groups have reported big gains in 1993 profits and are
stepping up capital spending this year.
Westcoast Energy is western Canada's top producer of natural gas and takes
in Union Gas, an Ontario gas distributor, acquired late in 1992.
Its 1993 net profit was CDollars 158m (USDollars 117m) or CDollars 1.82 a
share, against a 1992 loss of CDollars 64m or CDollars 1.31 after a CDollars
161m special charge. Revenues doubled to CDollars 3.6bn.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 56m or 64 cents, compared with a loss of
CDollars 111m or CDollars 1.97 on revenues of CDollars 1.1bn, up 36 per
cent.
The 1993 results included Union Gas. The company plans to spend CDollars
900m this year to expand its utility operations, well up from last year.
Alberta Energy, one of western Canada's 10 biggest oil and gas producers,
had 1993 net profit of CDollars 91.6m or CDollars 1.23, up 117 per cent from
CDollars 42.2m or 53 cents a share in 1992, on net revenues of CDollars
626m, up 10 per cent.
Production and sales in its gas, oil and pipeline operations set new
records.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Recession cuts jobs and output
at Fokker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, has unveiled plans for a drastic
cut in aircraft output and jobs to cope with the continued deep malaise in
the aviation industry.
The company, which came under majority control of Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa) last year, is to reduce the number of aircraft it
manufactures to 40 a year from around 60. This will lead to the loss of some
1,900 jobs out of almost 10,000, marking the third major reorganisation at
the company in the space of three years.
Mr Reinder van Duinen, who became acting chairman last month after a
boardroom shake-up, denied the cuts had been imposed by Dasa, which owns 51
per cent of Fokker's shares.
'That is complete nonsense,' he said in a statement to staff. 'We must again
cut jobs because the market is so bad. The market, and not Dasa, dictates to
Fokker.'
He said other aircraft manufacturers were being forced to take similar
action, citing job cuts at Dasa and at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the
US.
The cuts are harsher than those proposed by Mr van Duinen's predecessor, Mr
Erik Jan Nederkoorn, who resigned on January 31 after a bitter row over the
division of responsibilities within the board and the scale of the
reorganisation.
The plans also call for Fokker's suppliers to reduce prices, thereby
enabling the Dutch company to be able to meet customers' demands for lower
selling prices. Mr Nederkoorn had previously sought a 30 per cent reduction
in cost prices, but Mr van Duinen would not be drawn on the scale of cuts
being negotiated.
Mr van Duinen said Fokker would remain a 'fully fledged' aircraft maker
despite the cut in production. During the takeover negotiations with Dasa
last year, the Dutch had insisted the company retain a full complement of
industrial capabilities, including the development, production and marketing
of aeroplanes.
Mr van Duinen and his fellow board members declined to forecast when Fokker
would return to profit or when the market for aircraft would recover.
Before the latest round of cuts, Fokker had predicted it would post a loss
of Fl 150m (Dollars 76m) in 1993. Figures for 1993 are due in March.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Endesa lifts profits by 9.9% to
Pta116bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Spain's largest utility, Endesa, the partially privatised state-controlled
electricity distributor and generator, lifted consolidated net profit in
1993 by 9.9 per cent to Pta116.8bn (Dollars 819m).
This was despite slack domestic demand and a drought-induced fall in
hydraulic production which forced a switch to more costly coal-fired
operations.
The results, which brought earnings per share up to Pta449.3 from Pta408.8,
were marginally ahead of forecasts.
They are likely to raise expectations that INI, the state holding company
which owns 75 per cent of the utility, will further reduce its equity
through an international share offer.
Endesa said it owed its profitability last year to lower overall debt -
long-term debts fell sharply by 24 per cent while short-term borrowings
increased by 16 per cent - to falling interest rates and the devalued
peseta, and to internal cost controls.
These compensated for a modest 0.8 per cent increase in energy sales to
electricity distributors and an increase of 1.8 per cent in direct sales to
consumers and for a 5.1 increase in operating costs. Consolidated revenue
rose by 4.7 per cent to Pta752.5bn.
The company, which has a 2 per cent stake in Germany's RWE and owns 7 per
cent of the Venezuelan utility, Electricidad de Caracas, has been an active
buyer of equity in private Spanish utilities. The aim is to boost its
distribution network ahead of the formal deregulation of the domestic
electricity sector.
Endesa is understood to be negotiating the sale of 6 per cent of its equity
to RWE and to the UK's National Power and the placement of a further 4 per
cent among institutional investors. Following a 1988 partial privatisation,
23 per cent of the utility is listed on the markets and, since 1992, some 10
per cent of the free float is in the form of ADS on the New York stock
exchange.

<TEXT>
Zale, the biggest US jewellery retailer, yesterday reported a return to
profit for the first full quarter since it came out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last July.
In the three months to December, it made net profits of Dollars 41.6m, or
Dollars 1.19 a share. The predecessor company made net losses of Dollars
17.8m in the same period last year, largely because of heavy reorganisation
costs.
Sales fell from Dollars 428.2m to Dollars 396.5m, but this was because Zale
closed 175 stores as part of its restructuring. Sales at the stores which
remained open rose by 1.6 per cent.
Zale has 1,276 outlets in the US, Puerto Rico and Guam operating under the
names Zales Jewelers, Gordon's Jewelers, Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle, and
Corrigan's.
It went into bankruptcy protection at the beginning of 1992 when it became
unable to meet the interest payments on junk bonds issued in the 1980s.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Wall Street ends its love affair
with Sears Roebuck - The US retailer has lost favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's year-long love affair with a slimmed-down and revamped Sears,
Roebuck cooled when the retailer's fourth-quarter figures failed to produce
the forecast accelerated earnings.
Sears reported record income for 1993 of Dollars 1.7bn in a turnround from
heavy losses of Dollars 3.93bn, which included restructuring costs and
charges for losses following Hurricane Andrew.
But per share earnings, at Dollars 4.36 for the full year and Dollars 1.39
in the quarter, fell short of forecasts of Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 1.43.
The share price fell by 6 per cent.
Company executives complain they were victims of unrealistic expectations.
Sears' share price moved from a low of Dollars 30 in October 1992 to a high
of Dollars 60 a year later, gaining at each step in a restructuring that
shed the company's brokerage, credit card and real estate business and
closed its venerable but loss-making catalogue sales division.
Investor confidence peaked just after portions of Dean Witter, Discover and
Co. and Allstate were sold to the public in popular offerings. Sears
continues to hold the majority shares of Allstate, while the balance of Dean
Witter was spun off to Sears' shareholders.
However, 1994 will be a pivotal year for Sears. Both of its main businesses
 -insurance and retailing - face intense competition and, unlike 1993, will
be up against comparisons with their own strong performance a year ago.
The Sears Merchandising Group posted substantial 9.1 per cent year-on-year
sales advances for 1993, making it more difficult to maintain that momentum
this year. This helped knock 20 per cent off Sear's share price since its
peak in October.
Analysts are also concerned that the retailer's new-found grip on expenses
may be loosening, with the company sliding back into the fiscal liberties
that toppled Sears in the late 1970s. Fourth-quarter expenses rose in
relation to sales, particularly at the Merchandising Group, which poured
Dollars 40m into a glitzy television advertising campaign to boost Christmas
season sales.
The campaign paid off. Sears stores saw sales jump 13.3 per cent in
December, while most competing retailers logged only single-digit increases.
However, Sears' desire to capture more of the high-margin women's clothing
market has been only marginally successful, analysts say, with the sales
increases coming substantially from Sear's traditional hard lines.
The merchandising group's advertising expenses are likely to remain high in
the first quarter due to an ambitious promotional push that made Sears the
prime advertiser for the Olympics on US TV.
Allstate, one of the US's largest property insurance concerns, managed to
squeeze a 2.8 per cent revenue gain in the fourth quarter, and stabilised
its balance sheet after taking a Dollars 1.6bn charge in 1992 for the
effects of Hurricane Andrew.
However, analysts are already toting up Allstate's share of the insurance
costs related to this month's California earthquake. Mr Richard Nelson,
analyst with Duff and Phelps in Chicago, says the quake will cost Sears
between 20 to 30 cents per share in 1994 earnings, and has revised his
full-year estimate down to Dollars 4.50, from a pre-earthquake forecast of
Dollars 4.75 per share.
Allstate itself has estimated its costs from the January 17 quake to be
Dollars 350m.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: BCI set to benefit from the
bandwagon effect - The latest move in Italy's privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's ambitious privatisation programme took another step forward
yesterday with the publication of the prospectus for Banca Commerciale
Italiana, one of its top financial institutions.
The deal follows two other bank sales. In December, the IRI state holding
company, which controls BCI, sold its stake in Credito Italiano, BCI's
slightly smaller Milan neighbour. Earlier this month, the Treasury floated
almost 220m shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big financial
services group. Together, the two deals raised more than L4,000bn (Dollars
2.37bn). Selling BCI should raise about L3,000bn.
The BCI offer, in which IRI is selling its 54 per cent holding, should echo
the success of its predecessors. The bank, still probably Italy's most
prestigious financial institution, is successful at home and familiar
abroad. Its international links date back a century to its foundation in
1894 by Swiss, German and Austrian financial institutions.
The sale should be plain sailing thanks to the bandwagon effect of the two
previous privatisations, both of which were heavily oversubscribed, and the
bullish stock market, with share prices up by 9.4 per cent this year.
So great is the confidence about the BCI deal that many analysts believe the
shares will be sold at a substantially smaller discount to the stock market
price than for Credito Italiano or IMI. Credito Italiano stock was sold at
almost 10 per cent below market prices, while IMI was priced at a 6 per cent
discount.
Investor enthusiasm should also be boosted by upbeat group results, due on
Friday. BCI's parent company figures showed a 1.7 per cent rise in net
profits to L268.2bn. The consolidated figures should mark a recovery from
the L218.5bn made after tax in 1992, when earnings were hit by losses at
BCI's French and Canadian subsidiaries.
The earnings rise would be stronger but for higher bad debt and tax
provisions, notes Mr Sergio Siglienti, the chairman. BCI had to set aside an
extra L200bn at parent company level to cover potential bad debts last year,
while its tax bill rocketed by 145 per cent to L713bn because it has used up
all its remaining tax breaks from buying a loss-making IRI subsidiary.
Yet in spite of the bullish sentiment towards BCI's privatisation, some
doubts remain. First, the sale is taking place against rising controversy
about Italy's banks in the mushrooming political corruption scandal.
This month has seen the temporary resignation of the heads of two top banks
owing to alleged corruption. The revelations have triggered criticism of the
Bank of Italy for poor supervision and the banking sector in general, where
largely state-controlled banks have been accused of pursuing
politically-influenced lending policies.
The taint has reached BCI itself. Two former executives have been enmeshed
in the scandals. One, Mr Enrico Braggiotti, is a former chairman who still
chairs a Monaco-based bank 40 per cent owned by BCI.
Mr Siglienti says his bank has managed to steer clear of most of Italy's
worst corporate rescue deals thanks to careful lending. Its total exposure
to Ferruzzi, the troubled industrial group which is at the heart of a big
corruption inquiry, is only about L700bn. Only about a third of that is tied
up in the company's debt rescheduling package, he says.
In spite of his protestations, however, analysts note that BCI's lending to
now-troubled companies grew sharply in the early 1990s, just as political
influence over formerly independent Milan-based banks such as BCI and
Credito Italiano appeared to be rising.
The other imponderable concerns BCI's future. Mr Romano Prodi, the IRI
chairman, says he wants to turn the former subsidiaries into true 'public
companies' with a wide shareholder base. Following its share sale, Credito
Italiano now has about 200,000 shareholders.
A similar destiny should await BCI were it not for lingering doubts about
the plans of Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank run by Mr Enrico Cuccia,
the legendary eminence grise of Italian finance.
Precise information about Mr Cuccia's plans are obscured by Mediobanca's
traditional refusal to talk to the press, creating an aura of mystery about
the bank and its honorary chairman. However, some analysts believe Mr Cuccia
still nurses ambitions to gain control of BCI by forming a small core
shareholders' group led by Mediobanca. Privatisation, they believe, will
give Mr Cuccia his chance.
The government appears to be divided over the question of shareholder pacts,
in spite of Mr Prodi's obvious hostility. But even those in favour of core
groups, which can have a disproportionately large sway over companies in
which they invest, believe they should be obliged to pay a premium for the
privilege.
Hence the background to Italy's latest privatisation rules, now being
discussed in parliament. The rules would require investors creating a pact
in a newly-privatised company to launch a public tender offer for part of
the remaining stock within two years of the flotation.
If the proposed regulations are put in place, they could balloon the cost to
Mr Cuccia of forming such an alliance. However, the rules are still unclear
and may not become law before parliament winds down before next month's
general elections. Moreover, they may only cover share pacts formed
post-privatisation.
Hence the reason, according to some analysts, for the very sharp recent rise
in BCI's stock price as potential pact members buy equity ahead of the
enactment of the new rules. Others, however, dismiss such theories as
fanciful and attribute the rise to mere speculation.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's first chief executive for
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, has
appointed Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, the former European head of Digital
Equipment, the computer manufacturer, as its first European chief executive.
The appointment signals the priority AT&amp;T gives to building its European
business as Europe's telecommunications market undergoes radical
liberalisation.
Mr Falotti, who left Digital in July 1992 and has since been chief executive
of ASK, a US software group, is well regarded in Europe's computer industry
and well-placed to spearhead AT&amp;T's European ambitions.
His appointment comes at a key stage in negotiations between AT&amp;T and the
French and German state telecommunications companies about a possible
alliance.
AT&amp;T is also keen to break into the UK. It is in talks with Energis, the
subsidiary of National Grid which is to launch a third national
long-distance telecoms network in April, about taking a one-third stake in
the new operator.
Mr Falotti, 51, will report directly to Mr Victor Pelson, AT&amp;T's chairman of
global operations and effectively deputy to Mr Bob Allen, the chairman. AT&amp;T
has 25,000 employees in Europe, about half acquired with the takeover of
NCR, the computer company.
Mr Pelson said AT&amp;T looked to Mr Falotti to 'drive a more synergistic and
proactive approach, to expand our presence, and build our relationship with
European partners and customers'.
Mr Falotti said his preference was to build AT&amp;T's presence through
partnerships, not confrontation. 'You must have an availability to partner
in this industry', he said.
Outside the UK, AT&amp;T's capacity to compete in Europe is limited by monopoly
restrictions set to remain in force until 1998, the EU's deadline for the
introduction of competition in basic voice services.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Andre Rousselet resigns as Canal
Plus chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Andre Rousselet yesterday resigned as chairman of Canal Plus, the French
media group, in the latest instalment of his bitter row with its main
shareholders.
The resignation follows the announcement on Friday that Mr Rousselet was
leaving the board of Havas, the French leisure group which is Canal Plus's
largest shareholder, in protest against plans to merge its holding with
those of Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale.
Mr Rousselet, 72, has for years been a pivotal figure on the French media
scene. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mr Pierre Lescure, 48, Canal
Plus's chief executive.
The departure of Mr Rousselet, who founded Canal Plus in 1984 and has since
turned it into one of Europe's most successful television groups, comes at a
very difficult time for the company, which is preparing to renegotiate with
the French government the terms of its French pay-TV franchise.
The original 10-year franchise was negotiated before Canal Plus's launch
when no-one realised how successful the new pay-TV channel was going to be.
The government is now expected to try to strike a tougher deal and to force
Canal Plus to help France's ailing cable television system.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: US groups agree breast implant
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three US healthcare groups have agreed to provide more than Dollars 3bn
between them for a proposed world-wide compensation fund for women who have
suffered ill health as a result of silicon breast implants.
The companies announced last year that they were seeking to negotiate such a
deal.
Dow Corning, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter International said they had now
reached agreement between themselves, and with representatives of claimants,
that would lead to the three bearing 80 per cent of the Dollars 4bn
settlement costs over the next 30 years.
The settlement is intended to benefit women around the world who have
already suffered illnesses, or who become ill in future. However, lawyers in
the US said that the bulk of the settlement would go to women in that
country.
'Like all settlements, this is a political solution - these companies are
based in the US and have most of their business here,' said Ms Lori Henkel,
a lawyer in Rochester, New York, who represents around 150 claimants.
All women with implants will be included in the deal automatically, and will
lose their right to sue the implant manufacturers, unless they actively opt
out.
This aspect of the arrangement is likely to come under particular scrutiny
by the district court in Birmingham, Alabama, where all the implant cases
have been consolidated. The court must approve the terms of the settlement
for it to take effect.
The settlement would be threatened if a large number of women decided to opt
out. In that case, Bristol-Myers said it would withdraw from the deal. Women
who have suffered cosmetically from implants are believed to fare worst
under the deal, and so are the most likely to reject the offer.
All three companies reported one-off charges in the final quarter of 1993 in
anticipation of the settlement. Bristol-Myers said yesterday the present
value of the future payments it expected to make under the settlement was
Dollars 1.15bn, out of a total Dollars 1.5bn costs associated with implant
claims. Of this, at least Dollars 1bn was covered by insurance, it said.
Dow Corning put its total contributions to the fund at Dollars 2bn over the
next 30 years. It announced a pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m for the fourth
quarter, after expected recoveries under insurance policies. Baxter said the
settlement would cost it Dollars 556m, of which Dollars 426m would be
covered by insurance.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ford to increase stake in Hertz
to 54%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US motor vehicle manufacturer, is planning to increase its stake
in Hertz, the world's largest vehicle rental company, to 54 per cent.
Ford said that it is to take over the 5 per cent stake held by Commerzbank
of Germany, which made the first approach to Ford to dispose of the holding.
None of the financial details of the deal have been disclosed.
Hertz is currently 49 per cent owned by Ford, while Volvo, the Swedish
vehicle maker holds a 26 per cent stake and 20 per cent is controlled by
Hertz management.
The car rental group is the largest single private purchaser of new vehicles
in the US. It has a domestic rental fleet of around 230,000 vehicles and a
worldwide fleet of 420,000.
Vehicle makers have established dominant positions in most of the world's
leading vehicle rental groups in recent years, and Hertz already plays a key
role for Ford as its biggest single private customer.
Around 70 per cent of Hertz's vehicle purchases in the US are from Ford,
while the US carmaker supplies a third of Hertz's fleet in Europe.
Last year Hertz marginally improved its net income to Dollars 53m from
Dollars 51m on a turnover of Dollars 2.85bn compared with Dollars 2.82bn a
year earlier.
Ford first acquired an 80 per cent stake in Hertz at the end of 1987, when
it assisted the vehicle rental group's management to purchase the company
from UAL (Allegis Corporation) for Dollars 1.3bn.
Ford said at the time that it planned to expand the ownership base in order
to reduce its holding to a minority position, and it later sold stakes to
both Volvo and Commerzbank.
The US vehicle maker said yesterday that it had obtained all the necessary
US regulatory approvals to return to a majority position in Hertz, and that
it expected the deal to be approved by the European Commission.
The Commission said yesterday that it may investigate the deal and
competitors must file their submissions by February 22.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom likely to win
Framatome control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, engineering and transport
company, appears set to gain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear
power station group, according to an official at France's atomic energy
authority.
Mr Philippe Rouvillois, the general director of CEA Industrie, who has been
charged by the government to draw up plans to privatise Framatome, said that
Alcatel Alsthom was likely to be offered a further 15 per cent of
Framatome's shares in addition to its existing stake of 44 per cent.
In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Rouvillois
said that Alcatel Alsthom could be offered part of CEA Industrie's stake in
Framatome and the 5 per cent of Framatome held by Credit Lyonnais, the
state-owned bank.
EdF, the state electricity group would maintain its holding at 10 per cent
and the 5 per cent stake held by employees would also be unaffected.
The share structure would leave the state with a blocking stake of about 34
per cent, according to Mr Rouvillois. 'This would guarantee the preservation
of essential interests in nuclear policy and in the company's co-operation
with Siemens of Germany.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: LWT rejects Granada'sfinal Pounds 776m
offer as still 'far too low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television yesterday appealed to shareholders to reject
Granada's increased offer for the company as still 'far too low'.
Last week Granada announced a final offer worth about Pounds 776m, or 750p,
in a deal that offered 13 new Granada shares and 100p cash for every 10 LWT
shares with a 686p cash alternative.
In a new circular to shareholders yesterday Sir Christopher Bland, LWT
chairman, said the offer failed to reflect 'not only the level of our 1993
earnings but also the earnings which we are confident we can achieve in
future.'
Sir Christopher argued that LWT was a premium franchise which should only be
sold at a premium price.
LWT directors refused to be drawn about whether they would quit if the
Granada bid proved successful. However, Sir Christopher said few directors
had figured prominently in a Granada organisation chart drawn up for running
an enlarged company.
He emphasised that the importance of management should not be
underestimated. LWT said that all directors, who together hold 6.7 per cent
of the company, intended to reject Granada's offer as will 32 senior
management shareholders who own 32 per cent of the company.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada said LWT's defence was strong
on presentation but weak on content.
'In their latest document the board of LWT have made no fundamentally new
points,' said the Granada executive, who added that the argument in favour
of size and resour-ces has been won and that LWT risks being marginal-ised.
Both sides plan to spend this week making presentations to institutional
investors who will decide the outcome. The final date for acceptance is
February 25.

Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, is expanding its
interests with the acquisition of JJ Priebe Holdings for Pounds 2.1m,
satisfied by the issue of 646,154 shares at 325p.
Hereford-based Priebe publishes two free weekly newspapers with a combined
circulation of about 105,000. The purchase extends Adscene's portfolio of
local newspapers to 34, producing 755,000 copies of both paid for and free
newspapers each week.
In the nine months to December 31 Priebe had turnover of Pounds 1.22m and
profit before tax of Pounds 141,449. Net assets were Pounds 427,929.
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive of Adscene, said he expected
Priebe to make a small contribution to profits in the current year and,
after bringing additional marketing resources to bear, a full contribution
from June 1994.
He said that the the group was confident that cost savings could be achieved
by bringing the typesetting and printing activities in-house, which will
have benefits for the printing company in Welshpool.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Valentine bloom for Flying Flowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flying Flowers, the UK's sole quoted flowers-by-post business, celebrated St
Valentine's Day by announcing more than doubled 1993 pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 533,000.
The result compared with a forecast last August of not less than Pounds
940,000 at the time of the Jersey-based company's flotation.
Total sales expanded from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 7.05m.
Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said the results reflected strong trading in
postal packs of flowers. This was achieved by mailing to an increasingly
large database and by direct response advertising.
Additional sales were generated by the progressive involvement with retail
chains, mail order and credit card companies.
Mr Goldsmith said the company was now offering a postal pack service for
delivery to most northern European countries and would be market testing an
advertising offer in France for Mother's Day.
The carnation nursery in Jersey produced about 4m blooms in 1993, he said,
although production was inhibited by unusually low natural light levels.
The 17-acre Jersey site had become one of the island's most successful
tourist attractions, generating extra revenues.
The company is paying a dividend 25 per cent higher than expected of 1.08p
gross to UK shareholders - equivalent to 1.35p for Jersey holders - against
a flotation forecast of 0.866p and 1.083p to UK and Jersey shareholders
respectively.
Earnings per share climbed from 3.06p to 5.19p.
Mr Goldsmith said the company entered 1994 'with a strong balance sheet, no
borrowings and a consistent growth record'.
Cash and short term deposits at the end of 1993 were Pounds 751,000.
The shares rose 1p to 96p yesterday.

FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bananas on a growth curve -
Fyffes' strategy for expansion in Europe and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1994 year will be decisive for Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and
vegetable distributor.
The shadow boxing it has been engaging in for the past three years since its
IPounds 60m rights issue is about to become a real test of financial muscle,
business skill and stamina as its expansion plans in Europe and the US pitch
it headlong into combat for market share with the established 'majors' such
as Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte.
Fortunately for Fyffes, the rules of engagement have been written in its
favour. The new EU banana import regime, introduced last July, favours
distributors that source bananas from the protected markets of African,
Caribbean and Pacific producing countries - mainly from the Caribbean - as
well as the cheaper 'dollar-banana' countries of Central and South America.
Its rivals, which import primarily 'dollar bananas', stand to lose as much
as 50 per cent of their market share under the new rules, according to
analysts in Dublin, which is why the 'majors' and Latin American producer
countries are fighting such a stiff rearguard action to have the new import
regime challenged through GATT.
Fyffes' expansion plan remains vulnerable to that challenge.
Earlier this month it announced that its banana business will expand by more
than 50 per cent in 1994, from 17m boxes to 28m, or some 500,000 tonnes in
total.
Until recently Fyffes was importing some 100,000 tonnes a year into the
continental European market. By this time next year that figure is expected
to have grown to more than 250,000 tonnes.
Fyffes' bananas are about to become as familiar to German, Danish and French
families as they are to British and Irish ones. Altogether, Fyffes will
control about 14 per cent of the European market, placing it second in the
European league behind Chiquita.
The main source of this supply will be from a new 9,000-acre plantation in
Guatemala, which is being financed by Fyffes, and which is also to feed some
2m boxes of bananas into the US this year.
To secure the distribution chain, additional ships have been bought or
chartered, and import licences have been purchased in the European market.
Should the EU import regime now unravel, then Fyffes will be exposed to a
free-for-all and oversupply in the market.
Nonetheless, the company has a strong balance sheet with no debt and IPounds
92m (Pounds 88m) in cash. This puts it in a powerful position to sit out any
price war, and to make substantial acquisitions on the European mainland to
strengthen its control of the distribution network.
According to Mr Carl McCann, finance director, 'up to IPounds 300m' could be
spent on acquisitions, which would take gearing to a still-manageable 100
per cent.
Entering the US market has been the other leg of Fyffes' strategic
development plan. This will be 'a very cautious and phased development',
according to Mr McCann.
Some 2m boxes of bananas are planned to be sold there this year, but this
will be increased as opportunities arise and will provide a 'safety valve'
should prices weaken in Europe.
Mr David McCann, managing director in charge of operations, explained that
the new Guatemalan plantation puts Fyffes closer to the US market than most
of its competitors, giving it an edge in transport costs.
A reefer ship is now dedicated to this trade, but is still a long way from
carrying full loads, so the maximum benefits of Fyffes' geographical
advantage will only be realised as its share of the US market grows.
Despite the lingering uncertainties, analysts in Dublin have been impressed
by the group's plans and pleased that management has finally shaken off a
traditional reticence about discussing group strategy with brokers and
financial journalists.
'We can at least now see where they are going and make better judgments and
forecasts,' said one analyst. Most brokers have upgraded their forecasts and
are predicting pre-tax profits of about IPounds 35m this year, rising to
almost IPounds 40m in 1995.
However, cynical minds among them have questioned whether the motivation for
this new-found desire for frankness and publicity might not be pointed in
another direction.
Last year, Dole made a friendly bid for Fyffes at 115p per share, which
prior to the bid had been a six-year high. Fyffes would be a prize
acquisition for one of the 'majors' under the new EU regime.
Key shareholders, including the McCann family which controls 8 per cent of
the company, considered the bid carefully, but then turned it down. Since
then the share price has fallen back and languished at about 100p to 105p.
Mr Neil McCann, executive chairman, said he had 'no regrets' for having
rejected the offer. But when asked if he would consider another approach by
Dole he said: 'We will look at anything that comes along, and we will look
at it on its merits.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson buys Greig Middleton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King &amp; Shaxson, the listed discount house and moneybroking company, is to
purchase Greig Middleton, one of the UK's largest private client
stockbroking companies, in a push to create a more stable income base.
The offer values Greig Middleton at Pounds 18.5m, which will be paid through
the issue of 1.6m ordinary shares, convertible loan stock which could add
5.6m shares, and a further 4.8m shares to be issued three years after
completion. Assuming full conversion, the acquisition will result in a 43
per cent increase in King &amp; Shaxson's issued share capital.
King &amp; Shaxson has been in discussions with the broker for more than two
years. It already owns a moneybroking subsidiary and has been keen to expand
from its highly volatile discount business into fee-based financial
services.
Greig Middleton employs 300 people and has Pounds 2bn under management
within its private client operations. It also has an institutional sales and
research business and has expanded into corporate finance. It is 25 per
cent-owned by four outside investors, who purchased their stake in 1986 for
an undisclosed sum.
These four shareholders are Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz Girozentrale, the
Bank of Scotland, Scottish National Trust and Greig Investments. The
remaining shareholders are primarily current and former employees of the
company.
According to Mr Ian Perkins, King &amp; Shaxson's managing director, Greig
Middleton remained profitable in the aftermath of the 1987 crash. In the
year to July 16 1993 it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m on turnover
of Pounds 19.8m.
Greig Middleton is threatened with litigation from a group of investors in
relation to losses in the Second Greig Middleton Enterprise Zone Trust. The
fund raised Pounds 10.7m in 1991 for investment in a London Docklands office
tower, the main tenant of which went into receivership, removing the fund's
only source of income.
King &amp; Shaxson has ensured 'as far as is possible' that any payments in
relation to these proceedings will be covered by the former shareholders of
Greig Middleton. The broker has shareholders' funds of only Pounds 7m, but
shareholders employed by Greig will only receive their King &amp; Shaxson share
entitlements if they remain with the group or leave under agreed
circumstances.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Heavy dosage of biotechnology flotations -
The forthcoming launch of International Biotechnology Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now might not seem the best possible time to launch Britain's first
biotechnology investment trust.
After a flurry of biotechnology flotations, virtually all of which are
currently trading at a discount to their issue price, UK investors'
enthusiasm appears to be cooling.
However, Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, of Rothschild Asset Management, argues that
the timing is perfect.
'The biotechnology sector as a whole is at least two and a half times
undervalued compared with major pharmaceuticals companies in terms of the
products in the pipeline. Competition for those new products is bound to
increase, forcing up share prices in the near to medium-term.'
To take advantage of the predicted upturn Rothschild's will next month
launch the International Biotechnology Trust - a listed trust intending to
focus on recently floated biotech companies.
It is hoping to raise about Pounds 100m from a placing and offer for
subscription of shares and warrants by Robert Fleming. About a quarter of
the issue will be available for private investors.
The trust will be managed by the same Rothschild's team that runs
Biotechnology Investments, a 12-year-old fund now valued at over Dollars
200m (Pounds 137m).
The team is headed by Mr Curnock Cook, who joined Rothschild's in 1987 after
selling the biotechnology company he founded to Shell. He believes that now
is the time to invest in the sector partly because of the downward pressure
on drug prices caused by healthcare reforms, particularly in the US.
'In future, the major pharmaceuticals companies will have to rely on
innovative new products, not price, to drive their profits. Yet when they
turn to their own pipelines they look rather bare.'
The top 10 quoted pharmaceuticals companies, which have a market value six
times that of all the world's listed biotechnology companies, have 20 per
cent fewer new products in clinical trials.
Moreover, Rothschild's argues that the biotechnology companies tend to be
developing innovative products with greater market opportunities than those
in the pipelines of the established companies which are often refinements of
existing products.
However, partly because of this wealth of potential products the
biotechnology industry faces a 'funding hiatus', according to Mr Curnock
Cook.
'A huge amount of money went into the industry in 1991 with an explosion of
flotations. The funds were spent getting a large number of products half way
up the development ladder.'
Now the companies need cash for the most expensive part of the process, the
clinical trials. 'But the money won't come from the public markets and the
pharmaceuticals industry is not going to start writing cheques at that
level.'
This is where the International Biotechnology Trust sees its opportunity. It
plans to take stakes of between 5 and 10 per cent in companies which went
public up to two years ago or intend to float within the next year. Although
its investment would be limited to some Dollars 15m it would normally lead a
syndicate of other investors. It will be looking for companies with strong
technology and identifiable market opportunities but also with a low market
valuation and some management weaknesses.
'Many of the companies which came to the market in 1991-92 were still in
short trousers and are now suffering from holes in the management,' says Mr
Curnock Cook.
The companies in which the trust invests will have access not only to the
10-strong investment team - with experience in science, industry, finance
and management - but also a distinguished panel of scientific consultants,
including professors from Cambridge, Edinburgh and New York universities.
The board of non-executive directors will include leading figures from the
US biotechnology industry such as Mr Ted Greene, founder of Amylin
Pharmaceuticals, and Mr James Grant, a former deputy commissioner of the US
Food and Drug Administration.
The annual management fee will be 1.375 per cent of net assets with other
expenses estimated at 0.28 per cent. Based on gross proceeds of Pounds 100m
the total launch costs are expected to be 3.1 per cent.
The trust will have a geographic spread roughly in line with the industry,
70 per cent of which is based in the US, and will have an initial life of at
least five years.
Although managed by the same team the trust will have little overlap with
Biotechnology Investments, which has a large portfolio of holdings acquired
earlier in companies' lives. The trust's individual investments will be
bigger but should also be somewhat less risky.
The prospectus will highlight the particular risks of investing in
biotechnology, not least the extreme volatility of shares in the sector, but
Rothschild's can point to the record of Biotechnology Investments.
According to NatWest Securities this was the best performing UK-listed
investment company in the venture capital and unquoted securities sectors in
the five years to September 1993.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Verity back in the black with Pounds 0.44m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verity Group, the manufacturer and distributor of Wharfedale and Mission
loudspeakers, yesterday reported a return to profit and a link to maximise
its potential in Asia.
For the half year to end-December the Surrey-based group, which moved from
the USM to a listing last summer, swung from losses of Pounds 1.35m to
profits of Pounds 444,000 pre-tax. The turnround was achieved on a Pounds
4.8m rise in turnover to Pounds 11.6m.
The link-up is with Tomei Group, a Hong Kong-based maker of electronic and
electrical products. The two companies have formed a joint venture whereby
Tomei will manufacture and distribute certain Wharfedale products in China,
Hong Kong and Indonesia.
Sir Gordon Brunton, chairman of Verity, said Tomei had distribution access
to some 5,000 sales outlets throughout China. He added that trading in east
Asia was expected to bring important benefits to both companies.
Tomei will also raise its stake in Verity from 7.71 per cent to 9.97 per
cent via the purchase of 5m new ordinary shares at 13p, costing Pounds
650,000.
Verity will hold 32 per cent of the venture with Tomei holding the balance.
Previously Tomei acted as a distributor for Verity products.
Control of Cascade, which distributed Wharfedale products in the UK, has
passed to Ross Group. Mr Syd Edels, former chairman of Cascade, has left the
board and Mr Johnny Lau, chairman of Tomei, has joined as a non-executive
director.
Mission was acquired in October 1992 and for the interim period contributed
turnover of Pounds 7.67m, some 66 per cent of the group's total.
Other contributing factors to the turnround were lower interest charges and
a reduction in overheads.
Early indications lead the directors to believe that the rest of the
financial year will continue the progress made in the opening half.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.2p (losses 1.9p). Comparative figures have
been adjusted to conform with FRS 3.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Clinical Computing flotation to raise
Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinical Computing, the medical software group, yesterday announced a
flotation price of 124p to raise Pounds 3.1m net from a placing of 4.05m
shares.
Mr Michael Gordon, executive chairman, said the funds raised would be used
to accelerate the development of its Proton software package, used mainly as
a medical information database in the UK and the US.
'The flotation will increase the company's ability to raise additional
capital to finance future growth,' he added.
The group, which develops computer information systems for clinical use,
said institutions had already taken up all the shares on offer, representing
25 per cent of the enlarged capital.
Of those shares, 2.85m have been issued by the company while Mr Gordon has
agreed to sell 960,000 shares and Mr Conrad Venn, technical director,
240,000.
Following the flotation, handled by brokers Keith Bayley Rogers, existing
directors will retain more than 66 per cent of the enlarged share capital,
with 32.5 per cent being held by Mr Gordon.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed the company made a
Pounds 1.16m pre-tax profit on turnover of Pounds 2.6m in the 1993 year.
This compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 549,000 on turnover of Pounds 2m
in the previous 17 month period.
Mr Jeremy Woan, chief executive, said the 1992 deficit was due almost
entirely to 'non-recurring directors' emoluments' of Pounds 737,816.
Since then, he added, the directors involved, Mr Gordon and Mr Venn, had
agreed to employment contracts on annual salaries of Pounds 85,000 and
Pounds 75,000 respectively. Mr Woan will also receive Pounds 75,000.
In the current financial year, the estimated aggregate remuneration and
benefits in kind payable to directors is expected to be about Pounds
340,000.
Trading is expected to begin on February 17.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power agrees Pounds 250m N Sea gas
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power yesterday underlined its ambitions in the UK gas market by
contracting to buy the entire output of the Andrew field in the North Sea
over a period of 15 years. The deal is worth about Pounds 250m, payable as
the gas flows.
The contract will help support the future expansion of Scottish Power's
subsidiary, Caledonian Gas, which expects sales in the 12 months to March 31
to be 'several times' the Pounds 7m achieved in the previous year.
Mr Martin Fleming, managing director of Caledonian, said the deal was the
biggest gas purchase the company had made. 'It is a milestone for us which
demonstrates that we have serious intent in the gas market.'
He added that it would help Caledonian cater for the expansion of gas sales
which is expected to follow the liberalisation of the UK domestic market
from 1996 onwards.
Mr Mike Smith, one of Scottish Power's two chief operating officers, said
the deal could also help the company 'explore ways of improving the
environmental profile of our generation business'.
Scottish Power is considering investing in devices which reduce emissions of
nitrous oxide from its coal burning power stations by burning some gas,
enabling it to maintain coal burning at present levels in the face of
stricter environmental controls.
The Andrew field is expected to produce 150bn cu ft of gas in addition to
100m barrels of oil after it comes on stream in January 1997. Daily gas
output is likely to be between 25m and 35m cu ft.
The field, which is almost 200 km east of Aberdeen, is operated by BP
Exploration in partnership with Lasmo, Fina, Agip and British Gas.
Caledonian, of which Utilicorp - the US gas company - has 25 per cent,
supplies gas to nearly 4,000 commercial and industrial sites. It is now also
focusing on the part of the domestic market which is already open to
suppliers other than British Gas.
This week it begins trying to locate and sign up some of the 60,000
households which take more than 2,500 therms of gas a year from British Gas,
meaning annual gas bills from British Gas of at least Pounds 1.12m.
Caledonian agreed in December to buy part of the output of the Baird field
operated by Amoco off Bacton, Norfolk. Mr Fleming said the company had its
'shopping basket out' to make other purchases.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges boost WHC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Westminster Health Care, the nursing home group, jumped
from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 5.2m for the six months to November 30, partly
thanks to lower interest charges following the group's flotation last year.
Net interest costs were Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 2.74m). Earnings per share
were 8.6p (5.4p) and the interim dividend is set at 1.75p.
Mr Patrick Carter, chief executive, said that after 10 months working with
the new Community Care legislation, it was taking longer to fill beds in
existing and new homes; but he said this had been anticipated, and WHC had
held back opening new homes during the first half.
The effect was marginal, with 57 per cent of revenue coming from non-social
services budgets. The rule changes had led to differential pricing for
state-funded residents, which now ranged from Pounds 280 a week - the old
social security rate - to Pounds 400 plus in areas such as London.
During the half year 186 beds were added, taking the total to 3,429, and
with a further 581 due to come on stream in the second half there would be
4,010 by the May year end.
Plans were in place to increase this to 5,000 by the end of its 1995 year.
The group is testing a new business, running an acute surgery unit in Devon
performing operations for the National Health Service.
The unit had been acquired from the receivers in November and was being
assessed to see whether returns would justify investment.
Mr Carter said the changes in the nursing home business, which had increased
the private sector's provision of beds, would probably be repeated in
surgery. This could provide a growth area when nursing homes began to
mature.
Turnover rose 41 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 17m) for pre-interest
profits up 26 per cent to Pounds 5.48m (Pounds 4.34m).
Mr Kent Phippen, finance director, said the squeeze on margins reflected
higher costs associated with being a quoted company, the slower fill rate
and an upgrading of the computer system needed to deal with a range of local
authority purchasers rather than with the DSS.
Mr Phippen said gearing at 23 per cent was lower than expected. Cashflow
funded more than half the Pounds 10.4m spent on fixed assets.
COMMENT
The shares have performed well since the float at 260p last April. Since
then a number of other operators have come to market fostering the idea that
nursing homes provide a sure route for profit growth. But, as Sir Jimmy
Goldsmith said, if you spot a bandwagon you have missed it. Greater stock
selectivity is now creeping into the sector. WHC has proved itself to be one
of the winners in operational terms, and it is encouraging to see it testing
a related business without indulging in great expense. One concern might be
that National Medical Enterprises, which retained a 42 per cent stake after
the float, might one day want to sell just when WHC needs to raise further
capital for expansion. Meanwhile, on forecasts of about Pounds 11.3m for the
year, against Pounds 4.3m, the prospective p/e approaches 21. No longer a
compelling buy, but unlikely to disappoint in the medium term.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: National &amp; Provincial jumps 51%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial Building Society yesterday saw pre-tax profits advance
51 per cent to Pounds 121m for 1993, assisted by a 37 per cent decline to
Pounds 68m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The improvement at the UK's eighth largest building society follows 1992
results which saw total provisions rise to more than double the 1991 figure.
The society said that the stabilisation of house prices was a significant
factor in the lower level of provisioning, contrasting the 8 per cent fall
in 1992 with an increase of just under 2 per cent last year.
Despite the strong competition faced by the societies' sector for personal
customers' savings, N&amp;P's retail balances rose 8 per cent to Pounds 8.5bn,
taking into account net receipts of Pounds 296m.
This enabled the society's wholesale funding ratio, which had been
approaching the limit set by regulators at 29.3 per cent at December 1992,
to fall back to 26.8 per cent by December 1993.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 269.2m (Pounds 252.4m), reflecting an
increase in commercial assets.
Other income and charges, such as general insurance commissions, rose to
Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 67.3m). It now amounts to almost one-quarter of total
income of Pounds 348m (Pounds 320m).
Management expenses rose from Pounds 130.8m to Pounds 158.7m. Mr David
O'Brien, chief executive, said that this reflected investment in extending
the network, telephone service and systems.
As a result, cost/income ratio rose from 40.9 per cent to 45.6 per cent.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, described the results as
'sound' and said that he expected them to be better than average for the
sector.
For the first time, the society made provisions for its regulated business
in 1993, including the sale of personal pensions to people transferring out
of occupational schemes; these totalled Pounds 4.8m.
N&amp;P said it had paid particular attention to managing arrears and
repossessions and by the end of 1993, the value of cases in arrears of three
months or less was 29 per cent lower than at the end of 1992.
Its stock of unsold residential repossessions was 2,800 at the start of
1993, and 2,250 at the year-end.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Jefferson Smurfit's US side to be refinanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit/Container Corp of America, one of the US's biggest paper
and packaging groups, is preparing for a public flotation as part of a
multi-billion dollar recapitalisation plan.
The financial restructuring will also involve raising Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn) of bank debt, marking one of the biggest leveraged bank financings
since the 1980s.
The company, which is owned half by Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland and
half by an equity fund run by Morgan Stanley, was the creation of two
leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s.
It has struggled through the 1990s under a heavy weight of junk
bond-financed debt, exacerbated by the effects of weak paper markets. The
paper industry as a whole has barely broken even since 1990.
The company, with sales of Dollars 3bn in 1992, is the largest recycler of
waste paper in the US, and one of the largest producers of paperboard,
packaging and newsprint.
The flotation would bolster the company's equity base and give it access to
further capital. The strength of the stock market is believed to have led
the company to bring forward plans for a flotation.
Using bank debt to pay off some of the company's bonds, meanwhile, would
reduce interest costs and strengthen its cashflow.
The company carries a single-B non-investment grade (or junk) bond rating,
though bankers hope an improvement in its financial condition will enable it
to reach a double-B rating before long.
While the US junk bond market reached record levels of new issuance last
year, banks have remained cautious about backing large financings for
non-investment grade companies.
However, a lack of new opportunities to lend, at a time when banks in the US
are in better financial health than for many years, is beginning to
re-awaken interest in leveraged deals.
The proposed bank deal has met a generally favourable reception among
financiers in New York.
'The mills are world-class operating entities, and the company's management
is very strong,' said one banker who had been approached about participating
in the transaction.
Recent experience at other paper companies suggested the industry had
overcome some of its over-capacity problems and had been able to sustain
price rises, he added.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Time to capitalise on a classy set of connections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whom you know is very important in the French corporate scene and there can
be few people better connected than Mr Jacques Friedmann.
Mr Friedmann, 61, is a former chairman of Air France and a close friend of
both favourites for the conservative candidacy in next year's presidential
elections, Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, and Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister. Yet he will need all his valuable contacts in his new role as
chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the next company to be sold
in the French privatisation drive.
The completion of the sale of the government's stake in Elf Aquitaine, the
oil group, clears the decks for the sale of the state's 50 per cent UAP
holding, which could be worth FFr25bn-FFr28bn. Mr Friedmann, after only
three months at UAP, faces the challenge of steering France's largest
insurer and biggest institutional investor into the private sector.
He is adamant that it is ready for sale. 'Of course we're ready,' he said in
an interview with the FT at his elegant office at UAP's headquarters on
Place Vendome in Paris. 'Is there any reason why we shouldn't be?'
The analysts who follow UAP are less enthusiastic. Its net profits fell from
a peak of FFr4.2bn in 1990 to FFr1.08bn in 1992. Mr Friedmann recently
warned that it only managed a modest recovery to FFr1.5bn in 1993. Banque
Worms, its troubled banking subsidiary, is still in the red.
The French insurance market is still beset by recession. UAP, like other
state controlled insurers, is burdened by heavy overheads. It also has to
digest its latest acquisition - a controlling stake in Colonia, the big but
battered German insurer.
'What we really want is firm evidence that UAP is tackling its long-term
profitability problem, and that will involve some difficult decisions about
costs,' said one analyst. 'It also needs a clear international strategy.
It's all very well buying businesses, but it has to prove it can run them.'
Mr Friedmann insists that UAP will deliver on both counts. One of his
priorities is to modernise the huge domestic network. He does not, however,
envisage doing so by shedding staff. Instead he hopes to improve
productivity through investment in technology and by drumming up new
business.
Where does he expect to find new business in the intensely competitive
French insurance market? 'From the reform of the state pension and health
insurance systems,' he replied. 'These reforms will create huge new markets
and the big insurers like UAP are best placed to benefit.'
How can he hope to compete against the UK and US insurers, which have had
more experience in the pensions sphere and see it as an entree into the
French market? 'We have excellent contacts with large French companies.
They've been coming to us for years for big commercial policies and they'll
come for their employee pension plans.'
On the international front Mr Friedmann plans to expand UAP's activities
outside Europe, which now account for just 3 per cent of turnover. 'There
are lots of markets, particularly in Asia, that are only just opening up,'
said Mr Friedmann, who recently acted as Mr Balladur's intermediary in a
successful effort to reopen commercial relations with China.
His plans for expansion in Europe are more modest. UAP is interested in
acquiring a damage insurer in the UK, although he declined to comment on
speculation about talks to acquire The Provincial. In the meantime he plans
to restructure UAP's European network, which includes Royal Belge in Belgium
and Sun Life in the UK as well as Colonia.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UAP to seek cash as part of sale: Alice Rawsthorn talks to
the head of the French insurance group ahead of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, is
in negotiations with the government to raise cash for its international
expansion plans as part of its forthcoming privatisation.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of UAP, yesterday said that he was discussing
with government officials the possibility of including a capital increase
within the privatisation package.
'We do want to stage a capital increase,' he said. 'But it hasn't been
decided yet whether we will do it at the same time as the privatisation or
in a separate issue afterwards. The final decision will depend on the
condition of the stock market.'
UAP is scheduled as the next company for sale in the French government's
privatisation drive. The economy ministry is expected to launch the
disposal, which will involve selling the state's 50 per cent stake in UAP at
an estimated value of up to FFr28bn (Pounds 3.2bn), as soon as it is
convinced that the stock market has digested the Elf Aquitaine issue.
Mr Friedmann declined to comment on how much money UAP hoped to raise.
However, he said that the group needed cash to finance its investment plans
and to complete existing deals such as its recent purchase of the
international interests of Victoire, the French insurer.
UAP late last year took control of Victoire's international business by
buying the 78.8 per cent stake owned by Suez, the French holding company. It
also has an option to buy the remaining 21.2 per cent from the Oppenheim
group, which will be exercisable in September at a fixed price of DM1.2bn
(Pounds 460m). It needs to raise capital to fund the deal by the autumn.
'In the past we've been able to finance acquisitions by issuing new shares
because the state has agreed to reduce its stake,' said Mr Friedmann. 'After
privatisation that course of action will no longer be open to us.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Elf sell-off three times subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation issue of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group which is France's
largest industrial company, attracted more than 3m individual investors and
was three times subscribed, Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister announced
yesterday.
He described the sale of Elf shares as 'a popular success'. The strong level
of demand for the issue, the largest in the government's programme to sell
21 publicly-owned groups, would result in a full clawback of shares from
institutional investors, he added.
Under terms of the issue, the 27m shares allocated for institutional
investors can be reduced by 20 per cent to satisfy demand from individuals,
who were originally allocated 33m shares. Proceeds of the sale of most of
the government's 51 per cent stake in the oil group are expected to be
FFr35bn (Pounds 4bn).
'The Elf sale shows there is still strong demand in the French market,' said
an industry analyst in Paris. He said the level of interest in the
privatisation issues partly reflected the pricing - Elf shares were offered
at FFr385 compared with a market price of FFr415 at yesterday's close. First
privatisation candidates are also among the most attractive in the state
sector.
The issue of Elf shares comes against a background of falling profits. In
1993, the group saw net profits fall to FFr1.1bn from FFr6.2bn. Mr Philippe
Jaffre, who took over as chairman last August, has outlined a strategy of
cost-cutting and tighter control over investments.
The government will retain about 13 per cent of the company's shares through
Erap, the state holding company, and will hold a golden share which gives it
veto rights in certain areas of decision-making. A hard core of stable
investors, which includes several of France's largest industrial and
financial groups, will hold a combined 10 per cent of Elf's shares, which
will also protect the company from predators.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Price cut for Tiphook disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the debt-laden UK transport leasing group, has further reduced the
estimate of the price it will receive for its container business from
Transamerica, the US financial services group.
Tiphook first announced the proposed sale of its largest asset for Pounds
830m in November, but last month reduced the figure to a maximum of Pounds
757m. Last night the group said it would now receive up to Pounds 734m. Of
that, Pounds 44.25m will be placed in an escrow account and be subject to
further claims by Transamerica, so the group may receive only Pounds 690m.
The proceeds will be used to reduce Tiphook's debts, which ballooned to more
than Pounds 1bn last year, breaking banking covenants and causing a collapse
in the group's share price.
The group continues to borrow money from its banks and said that without
their support, and in the absence of other financing, 'the directors believe
that the group would be forced into either administration or liquidation'.
Accounts are being prepared on a 'going concern basis'.
Mr Robert Montague, the controversial executive chairman of the group he
founded, will be replaced by Mr Rupert Hambro as non-executive chairman,
pending the appointment of a new permanent chairman.
Mr Montague will become chief executive of Tiphook's remaining activities -
its fleet of truck trailers, the biggest fleet in Europe, and a small rail
rental business. Five other board members will also resign, including
non-executive director Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs
Margaret Thatcher.
Tiphook said it expected to record a profit on the sale of the container
business. However, when this profit was booked, the company would be
required to write off through the profit and loss account the goodwill
associated with the container operations, resulting in a substantial net
loss.
This goodwill charge would not affect the reported net assets of the group.
Excluding the effects of the sale, Tiphook is expected to report a
second-half loss.
Tiphook said its prospects would depend on revenue generated by the trailer
and rail rental divisions, as well as on its ability to reduce costs.
The group would have a lower level of borrowings and, therefore, lower
interest charges. It said cash outflow had been reduced through the
cancellation and deferral of trailer capital expenditure commitments. But
the interim results for the six months to October 31, due today, would
contain a related charge of Pounds 49.7m.

FT  15 FEB 94 / JIB puts Lloyd's agency in liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JIB Group, the insurance broking company which is part of the international
conglomerate Jardine Matheson, yesterday placed one of its Lloyd's agency
subsidiaries, Christand, into creditors' voluntary liquidation.
Christand is one of dozens of Lloyd's agents targeted by loss-makers in
legal actions, which will go ahead as a result of yesterday's decision by
Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets traditionally supported the market
 -to reject a Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer.
JIB said yesterday the decision 'reflects legal advice concerning the size
of the contingent claims faced by Christand and the costs which would be
incurred in defending such claims'. The size of the claims was not made
available, but they are understood to be more than Pounds 100m.
Others members' agents could also come under pressure as legal actions get
under way. This in turn could accelerate rationalisation - the number of
members' agencies declined from 65 to 46 last year.
JIB acquired Christand, formerly Nelson Hurst &amp; Marsh Agencies, in 1990 but
the agency, which handled the affairs of 475 Names, has not traded since
1991. Its ongoing business was transferred into a separate subsidiary,
Jardine (Lloyd's Underwriting Agents), and its past liabilities
'ringfenced'.
Although the assets of Christand are limited, the company's liquidation did
not adversely affect the rights of Names to make claims against the company,
JIB insisted.
Separately, London Wall Holdings (LWH), the parent company of two other
Lloyd's agencies, confirmed that receivers had been called in.
Mr Charles Hunter, managing director of London Wall, stressed that both its
members' agency - the sixth biggest in the Lloyd's market handling the
affairs of 650 individual Names - and the smaller managing agency were
continuing to trade. Negotiations were taking place for their sale.
The agencies have been hit by a decline in profit commissions and fee income
as a result of the problems at Lloyd's over the past five years. LWH ran
into difficulties when its Bankers refused to lend additional funds on top
of an existing Pounds 1.4m facility. The group had originally borrowed
Pounds 4m in 1988 to finance acquisitions.

FT  15 FEB 94 / CBI sales survey points to decline in demand: Retail figures
highlight 'patchy' recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Consumer spending may already be weakening, even though pay packets have yet
to feel the effects of April's tax increases, according to the Confederation
of British Industry's distributive trades survey, published today.
It shows that UK retail sales in January were below expectations. The
balance of CBI respondents reporting an increase in sales compared with the
same month last year, at plus 15 per cent, was lower than at any time since
January 1993. The same balance reported that sales were lower than expected
for the time of year.
The evidence of weakening consumer demand was accompanied by official
figures showing that manufacturers have been unable to raise prices
substantially in the past year.
The CBI figures 'highlight the patchy nature of recovery from month to
month', said Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel. December's report was far more upbeat, with a balance of 34 per cent
of stores reporting a sales increase.
That survey, though, was quickly followed by disappointing official figures
for December retail sales. The Central Statistical Office is to publish
details of January's retail sales tomorrow.
According to the survey, large stores are enjoying sales growth while small
groups are suffering a decline. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of
the British Retail Consortium, said reports from members suggested that
trading in January had been strong, but sales tended to favour larger
stores.
However, the British Shops and Stores Association, which represents 3,000
companies and 15,000 retail outlets, said it believed that sales had started
strongly in January, but fallen off towards the end of the month. Mr Allan
Sayers, chief executive, said he thought publicity about the tax increases
had dampened confidence.
Meanwhile, figures for January producer prices appear to show that inflation
is under control. The prices of UK manufactured goods at the factory gate
rose by 0.3 per cent between December and January, for an annual increase of
3.7 per cent, down from 4 per cent in December.
If food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum prices are excluded, then
'underlying' inflation rose by just 2.6 per cent over the year.
Manufacturers' costs actually fell by 2.5 per cent in the year to January.

FT  15 FEB 94 / UN backs Nato over Bosnian air strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council yesterday threw its weight behind the
Nato threat to launch air strikes around Sarajevo if Bosnian Serb and
Bosnian government troops fail to place their artillery under UN
supervision.
Security Council members sent a clear message to the Serbs during a debate
that the UN meant to act in total unison with Nato.
US ambassador Ms Madeleine Albright told the Security Council: 'Co-operation
between Nato and the UN is essential - not only for the citizens of Sarajevo
and other safe areas in Bosnia, but also for the precedent it will set for
the future of collective security.'
The statement came as the British commander of the United Nations Protection
Force (Unprofor) in Sarajevo said he had no doubt that by the time the
ultimatum was up the Serbs would have complied totally with the weapons
demand.
But Lieut Gen Sir Michael Rose told reporters that he would have 'no
hesitation' in calling in airstrikes after the ultimatum expired if they
were warranted.
Nato has said it will strike at positions held by either Serbs or Bosnian
government troops if heavy weapons located in the exclusion zone are not
handed in by midnight GMT on Sunday.
Last night, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur reaffirmed that there
would be no extension of the Nato ultimatum. Mr Balladur told France-2
television: 'The ultimatum will not be extended by a day.'
Earlier, Gen Jean Cot, the French commander, admitted there were very few
weapons being handed over despite attempts by UN forces to speed up their
collection so that Nato air strikes would not be necessary.
Sir Michael has already spoken to senior Nato officials about the need for
much greater back-up on the ground to collect and supervise heavy weapons.
He acted to quash reported differences between Nato and UN officers over
what constitutes UN control over the Serb weapons.
Sir Michael Said: 'Nato and the United Nations are completely aligned as to
what our plans are.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Lottery could raise Pounds 10bn for good causes, say bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first national lottery in Britain for more than 150 years could raise up
to Pounds 10bn for good causes over the next seven years, it was claimed
yesterday.
Eight groups representing a wide range of businesses, including TV,
bookmaking and entertainment, lodged bids to run a lottery that officials
said would create many new millionaires.
A leading contender for the seven-year licence, Mr Richard Branson, the
Virgin chairman, who together with Lord Young, the former cabinet minister,
put in a bid by the UK Lottery Foundation, said the lottery could raise up
to Pounds 10bn.
Two other leading bidders suggested a similar amount might be raised.
The government plans to spend a share of the proceeds on public 'good
causes' - arts, sports, charities, the national heritage and a millennium
fund.
Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary, said the fact that eight bids
had been submitted was 'immensely good news for everyone'.
The competition would help cut costs to a minimum and 'in the next year or
so the first millionaires' from lottery prizes would be enjoying their
new-found wealth.
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of Britain's first national lottery since
1826, hopes to pick the winning bidder by the end of May. The first tickets
could go on sale by early next year.
Mr Branson said the UK Lottery Foundation, which unlike the other bidders
would give all its profits to good causes, was talking to Marks and Spencer,
which, he said, was 'inclined to support' the bid. The retail group will
decide next month whether to allow Foundation terminals into their stores in
the event of a Branson-Young victory.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of Camelot, a front-runner, said its submission
represented the combined recommendations of the world's leading lottery
experts.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of Games For Good Causes, said the
consortium had devised 'an exciting games strategy'. Mr Gerry Robinson,
chairman of the Great British Lottery Company, promised 'the amount retained
by us will be very small'.
Whatever happens to Richard Branson's lottery bid, he won the publicity
battle yesterday. Despite snow, Desert Orchid, the racehorse, was called in
to promote his bid.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Bosnians slow to hand arms to UN
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The number of artillery pieces being placed under United Nations supervision
by Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government troops is 'negligible', a senior UN
officer said yesterday.
General Jean Cot of France admitted that there were very few weapons being
handed over despite attempts by UN forces to speed up their collection in
order to pre-empt Nato air strikes on positions near the city.
UN officials believe air strikes could lead to an escalation of the fighting
and undermine the humanitarian relief effort, and could amount to a Nato
declaration of war against Serbia.
General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of the United Nations
Protection Force (Unprofor), has spoken to senior Nato officials about the
need for much greater back-up on the ground to collect and supervise heavy
weapons.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, warned that if Sarajevo
were not demilitarised, 'an air strike is unavoidable and this could cause a
further escalation of the war'. He was speaking at a news conference in
Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic.
Nato has said it will strike at any positions, held by either side, if heavy
weapons located in the exclusion zone are not handed in by midnight GMT on
Sunday.
Military experts yesterday said the UN was at a disadvantage in trying to
demilitarise Sarajevo since it did not know exactly how many weapons were
held by either side. 'There are certain kinds of weapons which we can
identify from the air. But there is no inventory. We do not know where all
the weapons are,' said Mr Edward Foster, military strategist at Britain's
Royal United Services Institute.
There is also concern that Bosnia's Serb forces are placing weapons in their
own depots to be supervised by unarmed UN personnel. Weapons handed in by
the Bosnian government are being supervised by Ukrainian UN peacekeepers. UN
officials are also concerned that the Bosnian government forces might try to
destabilise the ceasefire by provoking the Serbs, possibly leading to Nato
air strikes.

FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gushing demand for Elf Aquitaine's FFr35bn share offer confirms that
France's privatisation programme is still well on course. Following last
year's sales, the perception has grown that the government is offering
shares at attractive prices. The Paris bourse still appears tempting at this
stage in France's economic cycle. Given Elf's size and importance, few fund
managers could resist.
Income-hungry funds have been attracted by Elf's yield of 4.8 per cent,
which represents a fair premium to the French market. US investors, in
particular, have warmed to Elf for the same reason they bought BP after its
shares slumped. Elf boasts an enormous asset base which has been poorly
exploited in the past. More market-minded management could generate good
returns simply by cutting costs and shedding peripheral assets.
That said, the rewards will not come quickly and much is taken on trust.
There has been little critical analysis of Elf's prospects since so many
stockbrokers were scrambling for the right to distribute shares. Though
ravaged by writedowns, Elf's net profits fell from FFr6.2bn to FFr1.1bn last
year. With the oil price below Dollars 14, earnings will not recover as fast
as they fell.
Moreover, the share claw-back will ensure few investors receive a worthwhile
allocation of shares. Fragmentation of ownership will make it all the harder
to counteract any incestuous tendencies among Elf's web of French corporate
shareholders. As the row over Canal Plus has highlighted, outside
shareholders are invariably left on the sidelines when insiders change their
priorities.

FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the big uncertainties facing the UK economy as the recovery picks up
speed is how the housing market will respond. Some estate agents suggest
residential property values may follow the upsurge in the commercial sector.
The seeming problem of negative equity may only sharpen the upturn because
it will restrict supply. In its latest inflation report, the Bank of England
said the number of households with negative equity had fallen by almost one
third from the peak. A further small rise in house prices would spring many
more from the negative equity trap, stimulating consumer spending.
Others are less sanguine. Legal &amp; General recently forecast that in a world
of reluctant borrowers and cautious lenders negative equity would remain a
problem until 1997-98 and might not be eliminated until the next century.
The housing market may have improved but 1993 remained the second worst year
on record. Although the trend is clearly downwards, there were still some
59,000 house repossessions last year. At the year end, 1.5 per cent of
mortgage payments were more than a year in arrear.
Negative equity also exerts a downward pressure on house prices because it
restricts demand. Stricter loan criteria and higher deposits for mortgages
will also dampen the market. The 0.4 per cent fall in house prices that
Halifax recorded in January may be no more than statistical noise. But it
also hints that house prices may only rise slowly despite a recovery in
transactions.

FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook's statement on the sale of its container business was slipped
quietly into the water at 5.41pm yesterday, when all good stockbrokers are
already in bed. That is a pity, because it makes such interesting reading.
The initial high hopes for the price the container business would fetch had
been further shaved, so that now Tiphook can only expect Pounds 690m
immediately. The ambitious new-trailers-for-old deals which the company
agreed last spring to raise cash and defer problems - at the same time that
it was insisting it had no banking difficulties - have had to be expensively
renegotiated. Some Pounds 49.7m has been lost as a result. Yet the company
still finds itself with the commitment to buy at least Pounds 160m of
trailers in 1996, for which it sheepishly admits that it currently cannot
pay.
Its most recent results have also been prepared, in that chilling
accountants phrase, on a 'going concern basis'. Some hopeful assumptions are
made about the company's ability to remain that way - including a general
economic recovery in Europe which will work to Tiphook's advantage. For a
company with a congenitally sunny disposition, such optimism is at least
consistent. For shareholders who have suffered the loss of most of their
market value as a result of this rosy boardroom view, the wholesale
departure of directors is perhaps the only consolation.

FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Japan under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration scarcely needs to talk the yen up. The mere
expectation that it would do so after the failure of the latest bilateral
trade talks saw the currency rise by nearly 4 per cent against the dollar in
Europe yesterday. Yet such a knee-jerk reaction is not entirely rational.
That became clear in the afternoon when the strength of the movement
prompted fears the Federal Reserve might even intervene to drive the yen
down again. It did so last August when the dollar approached Y103. A strong
yen may be a convenient way of putting trade pressure on Japan, but last
year's intervention suggests even the US authorities acknowledge it is a
mixed blessing.
A quick glance at the Tokyo stock market's response is a reminder of how the
deflationary impact quickly offsets the benefits of fiscal economic priming.
A strong yen may price Japanese exports out of overseas markets but that
will do nothing to boost corporate earnings, employment and therefore
consumer confidence within Japan. There is little chance of import volumes
rising if the yen is too high to allow the economy to recover.
The US may thus have little ultimately to gain by turning the currency
market into a trade battlefield. Nor would the tactic necessarily succeed
for long. Strip away trade politics and the fundamentals are poor for the
yen. The US economy is recovering and interest rates have begun to rise.
Japan is still in recession; rates may fall again. The current account
surplus is falling in yen terms and is anyway offset by strong capital
outflows. These would only increase if a strong yen made investment at home
even less attractive.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Choice of cuts or catastrophe: Europe's unaided steel
companies are on a collision course with their subsidised rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody ever said it would be easy to pull the west European steel industry
out of its latest crisis. But in trying to alleviate the sector's problems,
governments, steelmakers and the European Commission seem to be thrusting
themselves deeper into a furnace of controversy.
The European Union's largest steel producers will meet Mr Martin Bangemann,
the industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner,
today - ostensibly to discuss cuts in EU steel production. Private
steelmakers, and those publicly owned producers that no longer receive
subsidies, made tentative pledges last year to reduce their steel production
by a total of 25m tonnes to about 135m-140m tonnes. Brussels considers this
the vital last element of the EU's complex and politically sensitive plan to
restore the industry's health after years of overcapacity, slowing demand
and competition from cheap imports. Moves, which emerged last night, to fine
leading European steel manufacturers for operating a cartel in heavy steel
beams appeared timed to step up the pressure on private steel manufacturers
to come to heel.
But producers not receiving aid are unhappy about continued subsidies to
state-owned competitors in east Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In
December, EU industry ministers agreed unanimously to limit that aid and cut
production capacity in the subsidised sector, in the hope of levelling the
playing field. But the deal has opened a rift between the non-aided sector
and the subsidised producers.
Since December, the attitude of unsubsidised producers has hardened further.
Their most vehement attacks have been reserved for the German city-state of
Bremen and its plans to keep Klockner-Werke's steel mill in the city alive,
a proposal being investigated by Brussels for possible illegal state aid.
So at today's meeting, instead of co-operating to cut capacity and relieve
the crisis, individual steel chiefs could find themselves pitted against one
another as well as against the Commission - only 16 months after they stood
shoulder to shoulder calling for EU action.
The meeting could mark the beginning of a dangerous stand-off between public
authorities - in Brussels and national capitals - and the unsubsidised
steelmakers, in which both sides seem ready to gamble with the fate of the
industry itself. 'It's a poker game,' said one Commission official last
week. 'We have done our part and it was clear from the end of last year that
(unsubsidised) industry had to do its part.'
The problem is that, since the December subsidies deal, the non-aided
producers - led by big west German steelmakers and backed by British Steel
and Usinor Sacilor of France - have shown no intention of fulfilling their
part of the bargain.
When EU steelmakers first called for action in October 1992, they seemed
prepared to offer capacity cuts in return for help from the Commission and
national governments. Brussels has tried to comply with the other elements
of that request, negotiating with east European governments to reduce cheap
imports, promising cash to help cover redundancy costs, issuing forecasts of
market conditions and allowing certain steel companies to club together to
reduce capacity.
But by withholding cuts in production capacity, the Commission believes the
private and non-aided sector risks sacrificing the benefits of those other
measures, prompting a drop in the steel price and, in the worst cases,
provoking bankruptcies and a new race for state subsidies.
The non-aided producers are worried that the December agreement is
unenforceable. Under the deal, governments were allowed to pump subsidies of
Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) into state-owned companies, provided the same
producers cut capacity by more than 5m tonnes. But observers claim the
effective cut in capacity will be nearer to 2.5m tonnes, and they doubt
whether the political resolve exists to ensure that the main public
companies involved in the December agreement - Ilva in Italy, Ekostahl in
east Germany and CSI in Spain - receive no further subsidies, as promised by
the ministers.
As a result, the non-aided producers are reluctant to push through
restructuring which the Commission itself forecasts could lead to the loss
of more than 33,000 jobs in the industry during 1994. As British Steel puts
it, the unsubsidised steelmakers are prepared to share in the cost of
restructuring the industry, but they will not put plants and workers at risk
while others continue to receive subsidies.
Preussag, the German company, says it cannot close any capacity without
unbalancing its entire integrated operation: cutting capacity in one part of
its production line would merely lead to overcapacity in another, the group
claims. Thyssen, another of the German steelmakers, says it has done enough,
at least on flat products: it is laying off 15,000 workers - more than 30
per cent of its workforce - between 1992 and the end of this year.
Mr Van Miert is prepared to listen to such arguments today. But he will
insist that December's subsidy deal cannot be reopened. He has always said
the compromise was not ideal, but points out that ministers would never have
reached unanimous agreement on a tougher subsidy package.
He and Mr Bangemann will also resist any pressure for the Commission to use
special powers to declare a 'manifest crisis' in the industry and impose
production quotas. The commissioners believe such measures, used during the
steel slump of the early 1980s, would simply postpone necessary longer-term
restructuring of the industry.
The commissioners are counting on subsidised producers and their governments
to demonstrate that the December agreement on subsidies and capacity cuts
will stick. The timetable is tight, but governments previously known for
procrastination are already acting. On Friday, the outgoing Italian
government approved a decree providing L800bn (Pounds 324m) to restructure
the state-owned steel industry in order to comply with production cuts, and
is pressing ahead with privatisation of large parts of the industry.
However, that is unlikely to be enough to mollify the unsubsidised steel
producers, which will cite the Klockner subsidy case as the best example of
how the Commission's plans are unravelling.
The Commission is investigating the sale of 75 per cent of the Klockner mill
for just DM4 (Pounds 1.50) to a consortium led by Bremen and made up mainly
of publicly controlled companies. That has angered non-aided producers in
west Germany and beyond, which hoped that when the Klockner-Werke parent
company went into receivership last year the hot-strip mill would be closed.
Some 3m tonnes of annual production would then have been cut and
overcapacity eased in the sensitive sector of flat products. Critics say the
mill will only survive because of a capital injection from the consortium
partners, and warn that the chances of further cuts in flat products are
remote if the sale is approved by Brussels.
Klockner's chief executive, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, claims his
restructuring plan has turned the plant round, and made it profitable. It
would be quite wrong to close one of the most modern integrated steel plants
in Germany, he says: 'We would be slaughtering the wrong pig.' But he admits
he cannot see any easy alternative - except to close another entire plant,
if possible one of the oldest.
Mr Van Miert and his officials have indicated they are likely to take a
tough line against the Klockner plan, to ease the confrontation with the
private and non-subsidised steelmakers. If it is not, then the chances of an
easy solution are probably slimmer than they were when a united west
European steel industry approached the Commission in October 1992. The only
hint of a concession on the part of the non-aided producers is a possible
reduction of capacity in long products, such as beams used in construction.
In trying to persuade them to go further, the Commission's only lever is the
threatened abandonment of other elements in its rescue package, such as
redundancy aid and protection against cheap imports.
Brussels still insists that it is calling the steelmakers' bluff and not the
other way round. Officials say the choice for the industry is capacity cuts
or catastrophe. But if the steelmakers are prepared to push negotiations to
the brink, it is hard to imagine that the politicians in the Commission and
national governments will stand by and watch the steelmakers throw

FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Lloyd's snubbed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's rejection by Lloyd's Names of a Pounds 900m offer of
compensation from the London insurance market looks a little quixotic. Even
an inveterate gambler would hesitate to punt on the verdict of the courts
over an issue as contentious as this. While the bill for successful legal
action against Lloyd's agents would be met chiefly from errors and omissions
insurance and from Lloyd's central fund, money from these two sources could
easily fall short of what may ultimately be required. There is a worry that
some parent companies will walk away from the liabilities of their agency
subsidiaries.
This was, then, a case where the bird in hand had something to commend it.
Yet the whole dismal Lloyd's saga, which has caused a substantial and
painful redistribution of wealth among Britain's landed and professional
classes, is fraught with emotion. For too many people the proposed
settlement would not have been enough to stave off impending bankruptcy:
they had nothing to lose by turning it down. The result is that Lloyd's will
suffer the nagging distraction of continuous litigation for the forseeable
future. Whether the damage to the market's reputation will be equally
durable is another matter.
Certainly this snub from the Names is less worrying than it would have been
before Lloyd's brought in Pounds 800m of corporate capital last year. Having
passed this test, the ability of Lloyd's to write new business is greatly
enhanced. Dire forecasts of a meltdown in the insurance market now look less
plausible - the more so since the 1993 underwriting year is expected to be
profitable. There is a growing perception that the market may be past the
worst and that the new broom at Lloyd's was beginning to deliver something
tangible.
Yet there is still a long haul ahead. Losses for 1991 and 1992 which have
yet to be reported are expected to saddle Names with a further bill of
Pounds 3bn. And a successful outcome to the attempt to insulate the market
from pollution and asbestosis claims by setting up a separate Pounds 4bn
reinsurance arm known as NewCo is far from certain. That said, Lloyd's still
has a formidable advantage: it has never short-changed its policy holders.
Insurance rates are rising. If the market professionals manage to keep their
nerve in the face of continuing bad publicity arising from litigation, they
might just pull through

Supermarket trolley drivers are becoming more sophisticated.
When Britain's Gateway supermarket chain started fitting calculators to its
trolleys, it thought they would be used for mundane calculations, such as
totting up the bill.
Not so. It seems that more and more customers are using the gadgets for
complicated calculations such as whether a 500 gramme product at 48p is
better value than a 200g version at 21p.
Gateway's shoppers still have far to go to catch up with their US
counterparts where healthy shoppers mainly use the calculators to add up the
calories.

Place your bets, please, on who gets to run the UK National Lottery. William
Hill, the bookmaker, has opened a book on the sweepstake to beat all
sweepstakes. The 7-2 favourite is The Lottery Foundation, headed by Richard
Branson and Lord Young. Second favourite is The Great British Lottery
Company at 4-1. Games for Good Causes, in which William Hill's rival
Ladbroke has a stake, is trailing at 6-1. Last of the eight bidders is
Rainbow, at 20-1.
The smart money seems to be on Branson's bid. Indeed, Observer hears that
Will Whitehorn, the entrepreneur's mouthpiece, has bet Pounds 1000 of his
own money on Branson winning.
Sensibly, he never risked a penny betting on the chances of his master

Far be it from Observer to mention Sunday Times columnist Lynn Barber's

Mellor for dubbing her a 'sabre-toothed old harridan' she boasts that 'it
has never occurred to me to attack anyone for their looks or even to comment
on them'. Oh no?
'Who is this terrible man Robert Peel?' squawked Barber from her page but a

bald pate, though I suppose that could be the drawing.'

<TEXT>
'Anyone who tells you they always get the stock market right is either
called George Soros, or is a liar,' says Nick Knight, Nomura's London-based
stock market strategist. Even so he's acquiring quite a following for being
prepared to make the big stock market calls.
Although he's still only 32 he seems to have been strutting London's stock
market stage for ages. His detractors say that he makes so many aggressive
calls that he's bound to get some right. However, the size of his fan club
has increased considerably since he highlighted the 'once-in-a-lifetime'
investment opportunities caused by Britain's sudden exit from the exchange
rate mechanism in September 1992.
His latest target is Hong Kong. Last week he told clients that its market
could fall by 30 per cent this week, which may help partly explain
yesterday's 4.5 per cent fall.
Knight admits getting the Japanese market wrong at the end of last year but
regards himself as the stock market equivalent of golf's Arnold Palmer.
'The more I practice, the luckier I get,' says Knight.

Why has Britain's Labour party shied away from pushing one of its 45 MEPs to
run for the forthcoming vacancy as president of the European Parliament,
when Germany's Egon Klepsch steps down? It's a much more important job than
it used to be, especially now that the European parliament has the power to
vet new commissioners.
Labour MEPs are the single biggest contingent in the socialist group, in
turn the biggest group in the European parliament. The number of Labour MEPs
could easily swell to more than 50 in the forthcoming elections, giving them
even more clout. If they wanted one of their own heading the parliament,
David Martin, a 39-year-old Scotsman who has been a MEP for a decade, would
be the obvious choice. He's been described as the Tony Blair of the European
parliament.
However, the Labour party has decided that instead of shooting for the
presidency, its MEPs should try for second best - chairing the socialist
group. And instead of pushing Martin for the job, they are also fielding
Pauline Green, 45, whom some regard as a second best candidate.
It might make tactical sense. Britain's Labour MEPs are never going to get
both jobs and probably stand more of a chance of securing the socialist
group leadership.
Nevertheless the decision to push Green is another sign that John Smith,
leader of Britain's Labour party, wants to keep his MEPs on a short lead in
the run-up to Britain's own elections.
The last thing Labour wants is to have an articulate proponent of the
socialist super-state - in a position where he could highlight the cracks in
Labour's own European policy.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: AEA for sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to now, the government's 12-year privatisation programme has been largely
about selling state entities with plenty of tangible assets: energy
companies, public utilities and so on.
The imminent privatisation of the Atomic Energy Authority poses a challenge
of a different kind. The AEA - or at least that part of it which is to be
sold off - consists mostly of brainpower and technology accumulated from
half a century of developing Britain's atomic energy programme.
The government is right to want to privatise the AEA. One objection is that
it might be of strategic value, but that is not the case. The AEA today has
expanded well beyond its original brief, and contains a high-class, possibly
unique, amalgam of expertise, which can be marketed to a wide range of
industries. Privatisation will wean the AEA off excessive reliance on
government contracts and force it to earn a living.
The question for government is how to extract full value from this
collection of intangibles: the expertise, the people and the contracts which
represent the AEA's flow of business, worth more than Pounds 200m a year.
Apart from last year's sale of the Department of Transport's information
technology arm (later assimilated by its new owner), the government has
little experience in this area.
The ideal solution must be a management buy-out. This would create a sense
of partnership among the company's employees, and guarantee the AEA the
independence to underpin its credibility as a consultancy. However it may be
too much to expect a state-owned scientific agency to make that sort of leap
in one bound - particularly when it does not even have a chief executive.
The alternative would be flotation as a private company. This would not be
easy, however, since investors would have to be sure that the AEA had a
worthwhile portfolio of contracts, and that its principal assets - people -
would not walk out of the door.
Only as a last resort should the government consider the remaining
alternative: sale in whole or in part to trade purchasers. This would be
highly unsatisfactory. The AEA would lose its independence and, if broken
up, its range of skills as well. The loss of those two attributes would also
presumably reduce its sale value.
The AEA should remain independent. The government's City advisers need to
produce ideas for a sale that will keep it so.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: In Germany, it may get worse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week quoted Goethe to explain how Germany had to
solve economic problems stemming both from the cyclical downturn and from
the country's structural deficiencies. 'Intent alone is not enough: we must
pass to action.' One widely-held view is that Germany's corporate and
political leaders now agree on the therapy to lead it out of the deepest
recession since the 1940s. All that remains to be done, according to this
argument, is to wait for already-decided measures - government
deficit-cutting, industry restructuring, trade unions' accord on lower wage
rises - to bear fruit, assisted by eventual upturn in east Germany and a
revival in world trade.
This view is starting to look complacent. There are grounds for believing
that Germans have not yet grasped the full import of the challenges
resulting from world-wide deregulation, the opening of eastern Europe, and
the specific burdens of German unification. If this thesis is true, then
Europe's most important economy stands at the beginning of efforts to adapt
its industrial and social structure to harsh new realities.
The latest sign of these strains is the difficulty engineering employers and
trades unions are experiencing in their current negotiations on wages and
working patterns. Employers seeking reductions in labour costs and more
flexible working hours are embroiled in a worsening confrontation with
unions demanding a 5.5 per cent wage increase, which may even lead to strike
action.
This is the last thing the German economy needs as it struggles to emerge
from its most serious recession since the war. For a country that built
post-war recovery on exports, restoring competitiveness must take priority.
Since the mid-1980s, industry has been hit by above-average increases in
wage and non-wage costs and an appreciating D-Mark. The Federation of German
Industry's research institute calculates that west Germany's unit labour
costs in 1992 were 23 per cent higher than a weighted average of other
industrial countries, compared with a position 14 per cent below the average
in 1985. According to the OECD, Germany's share of world exports has fallen
more since 1987 than that of any other of the group of seven leading
industrial countries.
Germany needs lower labour costs. One reason for the stubborn resistance to
lower wage settlements is that disposable incomes are already being eroded
by ever-heavier taxation and the rising cost of domestic services, which now
shows up in 3 to 4 per cent inflation. Government receipts as a share of GDP
are already higher than in any other G7 country, apart from France.
Nevertheless, massive resource transfers to east Germany, combined with a
failure to cut spending in west Germany, have led to continued rises in
public sector deficits. Barring an unexpected economic spurt, the general
government borrowing requirement is likely to stick at around 5 per cent of
GDP for several years. After incorporation of an extra DM500bn (Pounds
194bn) of debt stemming from eastern Germany, general government
indebtedness next year will also exceed the Maastricht treaty guideline of
60 per cent of GDP.
So it is not too surprising that the Bundesbank has slowed down cuts in
short-term interest rates. Since the summer of 1992, net purchases of
fixed-income German securities from abroad have totalled an unprecedented
DM340bn. In view of long-term budgetary concerns, the Bundesbank fears that
premature short-term easing would provoke large foreign sales of German
bonds - producing higher long-term interest rates and worsening further the
fiscal outlook.
Notwithstanding trade union resistance, German industry must continue to cut
costs. Similarly, the next German government will be unable to avoid further
action to reduce spending. Carrying either task through will be arduous,
particularly so for the politicians. But the consequences of procrastination
could be even more unpleasant.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Personal View: Positive aspects of Ireland's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRET FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union statistics shows that there is one member state whose growth
over the past five years is spectacularly ahead of all the others - almost
three times faster than the rest of the EU - and which has by far the best
EU record in relation to the expansion of manufacturing employment. It also
has the lowest rate of inflation during this period. Moreover, it has for
some years had the lowest level of public borrowing and by far the fastest
export growth and biggest external payments surplus in the European Union.
This state is also unusual in that the increase in the purchasing power of
its average wage since 1988 has been matched only by one other EU country -
Portugal. Other striking features are that it has the lowest death rate in
the world for mothers and for children under five, the highest level of food
consumption and the second-highest rate of home ownership. Its rate of
female participation in parliament and government is a third higher than in
Britain and the EU respectively.
The state in question is Ireland.
Of course, this is not the whole story. There are two other aspects of the
Irish state which are equally notable and less positive: its average level
of living standards, measured in terms of its disposable income per head of
population, is 22 per cent below that of the EU as a whole, and its
unemployment rate is higher than in any other EU country except Spain.
Both of these features are, however, largely time-lagged consequences of a
very high birth rate, which as recently as the late 1970s was as much as
four-fifths higher than in many other European countries. However, this
exceptionally high rate is now a thing of the past. For, despite the
increase of more than half in the number of young people in its population
during the past two decades, a virtual halving of the fertility rate has
reduced the Irish birth rate by more than a third. This was brought about by
the almost universal adoption of contraceptive practices, in disregard of
the attitude of the Roman Catholic authorities. It is quite possible that
within a few years the rate will have fallen to the kind of very low level
that prevails in countries in southern Europe.
Why has the Irish birth rate been such a crucial factor influencing
ultimately a country's living standards as internationally measured? For the
simple reason that a country whose birth rate has been very high in the
recent past is bound to have a much higher ratio of dependants to workers:
not only children and students, but also, eventually, unemployed. This is
because there is a limit to any modern industrial state's ability to absorb
very large flows of young people emerging annually from the education
system. This is why the Irish state's dependency ratio is 215 per 100
workers as against about 130 dependents per 100 workers in the UK and 157
per 100 in the EU as a whole.
Vis a vis the UK, this factor helps explain the Irish state's lower level of
output per capita. For after a five-year period in which Irish gross
domestic product has risen by 26 per cent, against a net 2 per cent in the
UK, the level of disposable income per worker in Ireland measured at
purchasing power parities is now the same as that of Britain and higher than
that of Scandinavia.
The level of Irish unemployment is also largely a function of the past high
birth rate. Because Ireland's population was a fifth smaller up to 30 years
ago, the number of annual retirements is currently relatively low. At the
same time, the high birth rate up to the 1980s has been yielding - and will
continue to yield until after 1998 - a high rate of entry into the Irish
labour force. The result: a need for a net annual increase of more than 3
per cent in jobs - whereas in the EU as a whole the rate has been only a
fifth of 1 per cent. With annual births down from 74,000 in 1980 to fewer
than 52,000 in 1989, and now dropping below 50,000, it is clear that this
problem will have largely solved itself within about 15 years.
Meanwhile, the short-term growth prospects of the Irish economy are probably
better even than forecast by the European Commission. There are now marked
signs of a recovery in consumer demand, which will generate increased
employment later this year.
This is the background to the recent Irish budget, which should have a
moderately stimulating effect on the economy, mainly through income tax
reliefs.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Gremlin in the gearbox: Uncertainty for Russia's largest
carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, recently announced
he would 'correct' economic reforms to help 'factories which are now
standing idle', he might have had in his mind Avtovaz, Russia's largest car
producer.
The maker of Lada cars shut down its sprawling plant because of a shortage
of raw materials and components, and sent most of its 102,000 workers on
part-paid leave, for the whole of January.
Traditionally considered a jewel in the crown of Russian industry, Avtovaz,
which has 75 per cent of Russia's car market and exports 40 per cent of its
output for hard currency, had incurred difficulties in adjusting to market
reforms.
The problems were common to most Russian manufacturers: low productivity; a
refusal by companies to pay their debts to each other in the hope the
government would step in to help them; and a lack of capitalist institutions
such as banks that would enable companies to supply goods without demanding
upfront payments.
Two weeks ago, however, the Avtovaz plant ended its stoppage without Mr
Chernomyrdin's help. It used export revenues to repay its debts to domestic
suppliers, which had stopped deliveries until they were paid, and used the
shutdown as a chance to re-equip its production lines for a new model it
plans to launch at the end of this year.
Avtovaz managers, with their long experience of international markets, have
in fact been more energetic than those in many other companies in responding
to the challenges of the radical reforms now being ditched by Mr
Chernomyrdin.
In January Avtovaz signed a memorandum of understanding with General Motors
of the US to explore setting up an assembly plant to produce Opel Astras in
its home town of Togliatti, south of Moscow. The plant would provide western
production expertise, create up to 60,000 jobs, and help ensure a
higher-quality product than Avtovaz has achieved to date.
For GM, which already had a Dollars 750m contract to supply Avtovaz with
more environmentally-friendly fuel-injection systems, the main attraction of
a partnership with the Russian carmaker would be easier access to a
potential consumer market of 150m people. 'We recognise the high potential
of the Russian market,' says Mr Leo Kalageorgi, GM's liaison manager for
relations with Avtovaz. 'But we're also aware of the risk.'
In an ambitious step to win the confidence of international capital markets,
Avtovaz has also hired accountants Price Waterhouse to train staff and help
produce financial reports which correspond to international standards.
Avtovaz is aware that it needs restructuring to make it competitive in world
markets once it loses the advantage of Russia's lower production costs:
energy prices, for instance, are fast approaching world levels. Productivity
at Avtovaz, which makes 670,000 cars a year, is reckoned to be significantly
lower than for western counterparts.
Avtovaz is keen to take advantage of the respite it is currently enjoying -
as a result of prohibitive import tariffs - from competition in its domestic
market. A Fiat Uno, for instance, costs Dollars 16,000 after Russian import
taxes, compared with Dollars 9,000 for a Lada.
But Avtovaz is worried by Mr Chernomyrdin's announcement that he plans to
use 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation - a move regarded as departing
from the tough fiscal and monetary policies of Russia's radical reformers.
Mr Nikolai Lyachenkov, Avtovaz's vice-president, says: 'You can't stop
inflation with political declarations.'
Inflation, currently about 20 per cent a month, is seen as the company's
biggest enemy because it discourages investment, and destroys the value of
its own working capital as well as the savings of Avtovaz's potential
customers.
It was only the financial squeeze maintained by the government last year
which forced Avtovaz to realise that it had to dig into its hard currency
revenues to pay off its suppliers. Similarly, suppliers were pushed into
stopping deliveries to Avtovaz once it became clear the government would not
step in to pay company debts as it had in 1992, when Mr Victor Gerashchenko,
the central bank chairman, wrote off the outstanding debts of all Russian
companies.
Yet financial discipline alone will not succeed in turning around companies
such as Avtovaz. The government has yet to implement the industrial policy
it proclaimed more than a year ago, when the radicals were in power, of
picking winners and letting go of the losers; but it is clear that
restructuring will still require state support. Avtovaz's size means it is
unrealistic for a western investor to make the necessary financial
commitment.
'They're too big for us to get involved in any significant way,' says Mr
Roger Gale, Moscow representative of the International Finance Corporation,
the World Bank's investment arm. Proposals Avtovaz has made to international
organisations for helping it modernise and expand its existing plant would
require almost Dollars 2bn.
'Who saved Chrysler?' asks an executive at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. 'The US government. The role of the
government in Russia is to know how much it can afford to invest and to help
the people displaced by restructuring.'
Mr Kalageorgi of GM says: 'What Avtovaz is going through is what we had at
GM . . . We had social security and unemployment benefit, but here the
company has paid for healthcare, housing and transport. They can't just let
people go all at once. With time, however, they will emerge stronger from
having to reorganise as we did.'
Some state support has been forthcoming: a recent presidential decree
promised a three-year tax holiday for the car plant Avtovaz hopes to build
with GM. But until Avtovaz draws up a detailed restructuring plan it will
not be clear how much extra aid will be required from the state.
Meanwhile, as a sign of its determination to join the ranks of world car
producers, Avtovaz has begun selling to the Russian public Rbs2 trillion
(Dollars 1.3bn) worth of shares in a new consortium with other Russian
companies to help finance the plant it hopes to build with GM - even before
the latter has agreed to the project's go-ahead.
To attract Russians eager to protect their savings from inflation, the
consortium is offering shareholders the chance to win a car by entering a
lottery rather than waiting for dividend payments.
But its efforts to behave in a market-oriented way are threatened by Mr
Chernomyrdin's promised 'policy corrections'. At best they mean a reversal
of policies which had only just begun to show benefits for Avtovaz - for
instance by enforcing financial discipline. At worst, they threaten to
unleash either hyperinflation, or a return to old-style state control of the
economy - both of which would set back, and perhaps bury, Avtovaz's hopes of
thriving on the world industrial stage.

<TEXT>
The British cabinet spends more time re-organising local government than it
does on everything else, not excluding the delicate process of halving and
quartering the truths that its esteemed ministers vouchsafe to parliament.
The word 're-organising' is of course a euphemism. What has actually been
going on since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 has been the steady,
purposive, and highly effective destruction of local democracy.
It is customary to regard the centralisation of power in Britain as roughly
equivalent to that in France. Historically, this may be true. Today, we
cannot be so sure. Local party bosses dominate the French chamber of
deputies, but in Britain councillors assume that if they are elected to
parliament they must stand down locally. In the power-grabbing stakes,
London surely has the edge over Paris. No? There is a doctoral thesis in
this. If someone takes it up, bet on Britain turning out to be the most
centralised state in Europe.
According to Mr Jack Straw, the Labour spokesman on such matters, no fewer
than 144 're-organising' acts of parliament have been passed in the 14 years
since the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher first took office. The precise number
may be debatable, but it certainly feels as if a huge quantity of new
restrictions have been imposed. Locally-elected councils have seen their
public housing sold off to tenants, or transferred to the control of
self-selecting committees. Education is steadily being taken away; first the
polytechnics went to a quango, now the secondary schools are being picked
off. Soon Whitehall will attempt to tie the strings of patronage around
Britain's 24,000 primary schools.
The onslaught never ceases. A new bill is diluting the presence of locally
elected representatives on police authorities. Traditional powers to raise
finance locally have been circumscribed or removed altogether. Before 1979
around half local spending was financed by locally-determined taxes; today
the figure is 15 per cent. The geographical borders within which the system
works are, it seems, perpetually redrawn. The current plan to replace the
two-tier structure of county and district councils in England with single
authorities has run into difficulties, but the Whitehall army does not know
how to halt.
Defenders of this 14-year blitz do have a case. In the 1960s and 1970s much
of British local government was a form of indoor relief for otherwise
unemployable white collar workers. It was bloated and inefficient. The
housing estates were Labour theme parks, inhabited by captive voters.
Schools were often ideological play-centres. Finance was out of control.
Regular services, such as refuse-collection, were the property of trade
unions. Too much was done with too little care by too many employees.
Something fresh has arisen from the Tory-created rubble. Spending is under
strict Treasury control. The unions are quiescent - or is it battered into
submission? Decisions are made at or near customer-level. School boards run
schools, hospital trusts hospitals, housing associations housing. Instead of
town hall dictators we have consumer choice and open competitive tendering.
Local businessmen and women take part in making things run smoothly.
This pretty picture conveys only a mandarin's fraction of the truth. What is
missing is the electorate. Ministers appoint reliable party hacks, chums of
chums, to the new quangos. This has one advantage. It is less tedious than
campaigning for office. It also gets better results: across the country,
Labour has some 2,000 more elected councillors than the Conservatives. Their
deliberations are open to the public. The Tory-packed boards and management
committees usually meet in secret. They are answerable to no one, except
perhaps a civil service voice on the telephone, purporting to be that of the
minister. These local worthies and party hacks are supposed to serve
parents, patients, tenants, victims of crimes, householders and, indeed, all
of us. But we, poor boobies, have nowhere to turn for redress of grievances,
no influence over policy, nobody to dismiss.
It is an outrage. If England's blood still ran red and strong it would be in
mid-revolution by now. Local citizens would stand enraged behind dustbin-lid
barricades. Instead we must make do with a pair of mild analytical
pamphlets. One, from the Fabian Society*, asks what the Labour party's
commitment to decentralisation really means, and comes up with limp answers.
Labour favours unitary authorities, but what has been missing, the Fabian
authors complain, is any debate or agreement about the purposes of the new
councils. A second pamphlet, from the European Policy Forum** accepts what
has happened since 1979, but offers suggestions for improvement. Its
approach is, you might say, Fabian.
The EPF authors would make quangos more accountable, by getting elected
local authorities to keep an eye on them. Whitehall's monopoly of control,
although not necessarily of patronage, would be diluted. Elected councillors
would sit on the new boards and governing bodies, as representatives of
democratic local authorities. As to finance, the EPF and Fabian authors both
argue that the business rate should be set locally, and that other forms of
local taxation should be allowed. Thus would a portion of the power grasped
by the Tory centralisers be returned, as burglars might be asked to hand
back a share of their loot.
This is not quite good enough. We need to decentralise within Britain as
much as within the European Union. John Stuart Mill wrote in 1861, 'it is
but a small portion of the public business of a country which can be well
done, or safely attempted, by the central authorities.' He might have added,
'or their appointed puppets'. Perhaps he has been misunderstood. Our
government, headed by a former Brixton councillor, has all the sense of
history, the probity, the global vision, of your average inner-city town
hall. Inexplicably, it keeps losing local elections, and will doubtless do
so again in May. No wonder it seeks to replace all councils everywhere.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hospitals move threatens charity
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof NICHOLAS WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Health secretary Virginia Bottomley, hospital trusts and medical
schools will need to consider carefully their actions now that, having
solicited charitable funds for projects like Philip Harris House at Guy's
Hospital, they choose to make such projects either unavailable or
undesirable for occupation ('Guy's role to be cut in London hospitals
shake-up', February 11). They must urgently address the question of what is
to happen with all the charitable funds they appear to have put at risk.
This point, as much as any other, should have been considered in calculating
the cost implications of consolidating on one site.
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund has invested Pounds 1.7m of public
donations in Philip Harris House. The objective was to bring together the
research clinicians and pathologists working in our breast cancer unit and
to add a new laboratory to work on gene and biological therapies, which we
believe will play a major role in the next generation of breast cancer
treatments. With the move to St Thomas's we want accommodation there of an
equal standard at no further cost to the charity, or our money back.
During all the recent months of deliberations, we have repeatedly asked for
assurances regarding our investment and plans and we have been informed that
no such assurance is possible.
We are all obliged to pay our taxes and we all accept we have no control
over how they are spent. But giving time, energy or money to charities is a
matter of personal choice: people support charities precisely because they
do know the charities' objectives. And they certainly do not expect the
government or any other public body to throw away the fruits of their
efforts.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No doubt about nature of manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir CHRISTOPHER PROUT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Stephens' report, 'Major deepens Tory divisions on Europe'
(February 11), suggests that the prime minister has tilted Tory
Euro-Election preparations in a sceptical direction by announcing, at
question time last Thursday, that we will fight in June on a 'distinctively
British Conservative manifesto' rather than on a European People's Party
(EPP) platform.
There has, in fact, never been any doubt that the British Conservative
European parliamentary candidates would be fighting on anything other than a
British Conservative manifesto. This position has been set out with crystal
clarity on several occasions by both the prime minister and by the foreign
secretary.
I am, in fact, confident that the Conservative party manifesto will be both
balanced and positive, setting out a clear agenda for the next five-year
European Parliamentary term. There is no question of it marking a
fundamental shift towards Euro-scepticism. Fears in this direction are, I
believe, groundless.
In his article, Mr Stephens inadvertently re-cycles some well-travelled
misinformation about the Conservative MEPs' relationship with the EPP.
Neither the Conservative party nor the Conservative MEPs are members of the
EPP party organisation, which is a transnational centre-right political
party. The Conservative MEPs are 'allied members' of its European
parliamentary off-shoot, the EPP parliamentary group.
Our office in Conservative Central Office is the office of the British
section of the EPP parliamentary group.
This difference is important. British Conservative, Ulster Unionist, Danish
Conservative and some French UDF MEPs all sit in the EPP group as allied
members, whose full members comprise Christian Democrat and other
Conservative MEPs from all over the Community.
After June's elections, we hope the Gaullist MEPs will also join as allied
members. Together we are all in an alliance to oppose both socialist and
extreme right political forces in Europe.
The EPP party organisation intends to issue a manifesto for the forthcoming
elections. Although we shall part company in several specific respects, its
likely commitment to an open, decentralised Europe based upon the principles
of subsidiarity and market forces is one we wholeheartedly share. But
whatever it says, neither the Conservative party nor the British
Conservative MEPs will have played any part whatsoever in drafting it and
nor will we be bound by it.
That situation is the opposite of the one faced by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats. Their national parties are full corporate members of the
transnational European Socialist and Liberal parties. Their European
manifestoes are binding.
Some Tory Euro-sceptics should ask themselves whose interest they are
serving by propagating a deeply misleading interpretation of the role played
by British Conservative MEPs in the European parliament. They should,
rather, direct their anti-centralist fire not at members of their own party
but at our Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents. Unless they desist from
this destructive campaign, they will bear a heavy responsibility for any
electoral losses which follow.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a small, financially uncomplicated, five-man service business, (700
invoices a year, nil stocks, PAYE-based remuneration, and with no unearned
income), we tended to devote our energies to developing the business and
left the accounting and auditing to the accountants.
Creeping suspicion at their escalating charges over four years finally
caused us to seek alternative quotes, resulting in a reduction of more than
60 per cent in accounting/auditing charges from the firm which were to
become our new accountants. Accordingly, we dismissed our previous
accountants because of their excessive charges.
Apart from the money, our main grievance is that our ex-accountants persist
in referring to their dismissal as resignation in letters to the
authorities.
While this is probably an isolated incident, we wonder if any of your other
readers have experience of similarly isolated incidents?

FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong case for reform along unitary
councils line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN MOSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was staggered to read your article suggesting that councils did not
back the present review of local government in England ('Councils refuse to
back review', February 3). I wondered whether the information in it had more
to do with the effectiveness of the Association of County Councils' public
relations machine than the reality.
The Association of District Councils supports the review of local government
and replacing the existing two-tier system with new unitary authorities. In
the Cheshire review area, Chester City Council and the seven borough
councils have agreed to submit a joint proposal to the Local Government
Commission to replace the existing nine councils and a two-tier system with
6 unitary councils for Cheshire.
Not only local authorities support these proposals. There is substantial
public support for change. The Local Government Commission's own Mori poll
for Cheshire shows that in Cheshire twice as many people support the new
unitary councils as oppose change. This poll was supported by the city
council's own recent consultation exercise. Leaflets and questionnaires were
sent to nearly 50,000 households. We have received a staggering response of
more than 11,000 replies, of which more than 80 per cent support the
proposal for a unitary authority for Chester.
A recent rigorous financial appraisal shows that unitary authorities would
be cheaper than the present two-tier system. The eight district councils in
Cheshire have worked jointly with consultants on a financial appraisal based
on factual information provided by the county council and the district
councils. That appraisal shows that scrapping the existing system and
replacing it with six unitary authorities would produce annual savings of
more than Pounds 9m.
The pay-back period for the cost of these changes would be less than three
years.
The case for change in Chester and Cheshire is very strong. It is backed by
public opinion and by eight of the area's nine local authorities.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Women of importance - Willian Packer admires the work
of Sandra Blow; Emma Sergeant and Sophie Macpherson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAN PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is, perhaps, invidious today to lay too much stress on what should be
unremarkable, but so often the most interesting of current work is by women.
Sandra Blow, if it is not ungallant to say so, is now nearer 70 than 60. She
has been an ornament of the Royal Academy's Summer Show for more than 20
years, and her work is widely represented in public collections. And yet to
look back over her career is to find not a steadily cumulative celebration
of her achievement but only a list of mixed and survey shows here, a handful
of solo shows there.
She was a bright and rising star of the 1950s, showing regularly at Gimpel
Fils and, into the 1970s, at the New Art Centre, all set to shine along with
such as Gillian Ayres and Bridget Riley, a rare female in the then male
firmament of abstract painting. But somehow it never quite happened. If each
of those women painters has suffered a career of periodic shadow and
eclipse, for Sandra Blow the shadows have been the deepest, and the
longest-lasting.
Was it her association with the Academy itself that was the mistake?
Certainly the free-for-all of the Summer Show is not the easiest of contexts
for work such as hers, with its generous, environmental scope. But then it
was the Academy that gave her, in 1979, her one proper show in 20 years,
until Francis Graham-Dixon brought her forward again in 1991. And now again
it is the Royal Academy that is giving her at last her due and proper
retrospective, filling the splendid Sackler Galleries with light and colour.
In the 1950s she saw at first hand, in all its shock and excitement, the
assault upon European sensibilities of the American abstract expressionists,
Pollock, Rothko, Kline and all. From their example came the amplified scale
of her work, its light and open surface and space generated by clear, pure
colour. These, however, are technical considerations. She remains as ever
European at heart, associative, romantic and intuitive in her approach.
She worked closely with the Italian painter, Alberto Burri, in the 1950s,
from whom she took the practice, which she still employs, of working up the
surface, often quite densely, with collage, matiere and applique. But she
spent time too at St Ives, with Roger Hilton especially, whose graphic
gestural freedom is still characteristic of her work. She was never truly a
member of the Cornish School, but always a loose associate.
To dwell on influences here is no disparagement, for Sandra Blow has never
been anything but true to herself. The great thing in this exhibition is
indeed to see how strongly personal those works of the 1950s and early 1960s
now seem, all whites and greys, blacks and ochres, plaster, sawdust and
sacking. They are very beautiful and have been unjustly overlooked for far
too long.
But the greater surprise of the show is the group of huge canvases that mark
Miss Blow's extraordinary creative achievement of the past year or two.
After those early works, and the calmer formal engagement of the middle
years, we come to paintings that are astonishing in their confidence and
authority, so deceptively simple in their imagery, so certain in their
articulation, with the broadest sweep of pigment held just so by the
particular accent of colour, pitched to a nicety. Here is an artist at last
resolved in her work, come into her own.
Emma Sergeant, still in her 30s, has a long way to go before she resolves
the problems she sets herself, but she does not flinch from the grand scale
and the great theme, the ambition of which is itself admirable.
But she deserves rather more than a mere pat on the head for trying hard.
She has taken the story of Orpheus and Eurydice as her subject, which she
treats for the moment in terms of life-size figures painted in isolation
within an empty and portentous stage-like space, with but a hint of a world
beyond.
So far so good, and the figure painting alone is remarkable in its
accomplishment. It is only the theatricality of the setting that is
occasionally obtrusive and self-conscious, with diptychs and triptychs set
up for the sake of it. The simpler these compositions, the better they are
and, with only a few days left on show, well worth the seeing.
Sophie Macpherson, also in her 30s, is no less ambitious but less
conspicuously so. Her subject is the industrial relic left ambiguously in
the landscape, the boiler in the scrap-yard, the wreck on the foreshore,
disused or forgotten tackle and trim. Hers is the romantic surrealism of the
megaliths and fallen trees of Paul Nash, but more quietly and discreetly so,
and more dispassionately seen. Her work gets more confident with every show.

Tomorrow BBC1 begins a six-part series, shown nationwide, called 'The
Underworld', investigating 'Britain's, and in particular London's, criminal
underworld since the second world war'.
Today, in the London region only, ITV begins a six-part series called
Gangsters 'offering powerful personal testimonies from members of London's
criminal underworld from the 1940s to the early 70s' (7.30).
It's a good job we are all obsessed with crime and criminals, isn't it?
Channel 4's series Without Walls returns with a new notion: 'Bad Ideas of
the 20th Century' and 'Good Ideas Of The 20th Century'. In the bad category
today is 'Bodyism', the pressure which, we are told, 'drives' women to
attempt to make their bodies the same shape as those of fashion models. In
the good category is plastic surgery .. could there be irony buried here
somewhere? (9.00).
BBC1 shows the first 80 minutes of a two-part drama, Calling The Shots, in
which Lynn Redgrave plays a television journalist who is urged to take her
programme down-market (9.30 BBC1).

The Royal Academy is getting back to basics with a vengeance; its 1994-95
programme, announced yesterday, is a feast of Old Master art.
It starts in March with Goya, concentrating on his small paintings; picks up
steam in September with a major exhibition of 18th century Venetian art,
packed with Tiepolos, Canalettos, Guardis and Canovas, and continues a month
later with The Painted Page, illustrations from Italian Renaissance books
and manuscripts; and reaches its apogee next January with the first major
Poussin show for decades, with over 90 paintings by the 17th century French
artist.
Tucked in between are displays of art from late 19th century Belgium; the
Summer Show; and in February 1995 an architectural exhibition devoted to
Lord Burlington and the Palladian style.
It is chance rather than design which has eliminated the modern from the
programme. The RA is on something of a high at the moment, with a small, but
unexpected, Pounds 150,000 surplus on its 1993-94 operations. But it is
finding it harder to get sponsors, and even the Goya show lacks a backer.
Its corporate membership has fallen from 161 to 141 but this shortfall has
been made good by signing up 5,000 more Friends. With 68,000 in the club the
RA is third in the world, (behind the Los Angeles County Museum and the
Metropolitan Museum, New York), in the size of its Friends organisation.
The recession also hit the Summer Show, with visitors down 10 per cent at
135,501, and the value of art sold, at Pounds 1m, is nearly 50 per cent
lower than the 1990 peak.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: The London Sinfonietta explores 'Living Toys'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year at about this time the London Sinfonietta mounts one of its
'Explorations': a collaboration with London schoolchildren in the form of an
educational project with composers whose works are then exposed in a
concert. On Friday the Barbican Hall stalls were pleasantly packed with the
young people who over the past few weeks had been working with Thomas Ades
and Robert Zuidam, two of the evening's four featured composers (Osvaldo
Golijov and Julian Anderson the other two).
The event itself, conducted by Oliver Knussen, was rather milder and more
diffuse than the orchestra's self-advertisement suggested it would be. (It
was made even longer by the last-minute addition of Chain 1, a memorial
tribute to Witold Lutoslawski, who died last week and who was one of the
Sinfonietta's household gods.)
Most of the works lacked, in a word, necessity, that sense of artistic
pressure - as distinct from intelligent calculation or even interesting
sound-combination - forcing them into existence. The shining exception to
this rule was the final item, Living Toys by Ades, a young (b. 1971)
Englishman whose recent rise to prominence seems on this evidence entirely
justified.
The 17-minute piece for chamber orchestra, in spite of being decked in a
tortuous programme-note, proved a quirky, radical and also an utterly
fascinating explosion of ideas and sounds, drawn together with toughness,
wit and personal accent. Divided by Ades's (incomprehensible) scenario into
differently-paced linked movements, it gave the impression of a Ravellian
toybox fantasia laced with infusions of strong Spanish flavouring and
stiffened with Birtwistle-like dialectic.
Unlike almost everything else on the bill - apart from Lutoslawski's
wonderfully elegant invention - Living Toys suggested that a second hearing
would be not only desirable but positively necessary.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Orchestra set to 'enlighten' Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it looks like an Anglo-Dutch merger designed to conquer the market.
This week the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment sets out on a two-week
European tour. A brisk itinerary will take it through Germany, France, Italy
and Austria, where period performances of Mozart and Beethoven symphonies
are the exception rather than the norm. In Austria and Germany especially,
the traditional symphony orchestras guard the music of the classical era
jealously, no doubt unwilling to let such a popular part of the repertoire
slip from their grasp.
They still have to face the real challenge - namely, that it is
period-instrument orchestras these days which are giving the performances of
classical music that are alive, exciting and important. Part of the reason
is that they have attracted the most interesting conductors. The OAE has
Simon Rattle and Frans Bruggen as its Principal Guest Conductors (a good
example of Anglo-Dutch collaboration) which serves to underline the point.
Rattle is in charge of this tour and his preliminary pair of concerts at the
Queen Elizabeth Hall in London at the weekend gave a good idea of the
vibrant musicianship that is about to set off across the Channel. One of the
ironies of 'authentic' performances is that they are faster and tougher than
standard symphony orchestras used to be, not dainty minuetting in period
costume at all.
Nothing could be further from the world of powdered wigs than the Minuet of
Mozart's Symphony No 40 as it was played here, thrusting forwards with a
ferocious determination, as though intent on sweeping the other couples from
the dancing-floor. With the four double-basses on a raised platform, the
colour of the symphony was darkened ominously. The night before Haydn's
Symphony No 90 had conversely kept to light-hearted fun (naughty Rattle to
overplay the surprise ending so flagrantly]).
It is strange how self-conscious details of interpretation stick out so in
period performances (Rattle is fond of making answering phrases first loud,
then soft, which becomes very predictable) but the overall impression of
these concerts was of music-making full of life. Schubert's Ninth Symphony
was bracing, alert, unexaggerated. Beethoven's 'Pastoral' Symphony had a
sunny warmth and spontaneity. The peasants' dance was marvellously vigorous.
Klemperer would have stood gasping for breath on the sidelines.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Played in the right spirit - Music on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arriving at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday, one expected that Olga
Borodina's lovely, lustrous mezzo would have drawn as many voice-lovers as
the hall could hold. Not so: greatly appreciative though her listeners were,
they filled only half the seats. Does that show that audiences at the Royal
Opera, where she triumphed as Dalila in 1992, disdain mere songs?
Here, with her accompanist Larissa Gergieva she offered a baker's dozen of
Rakhmaninov songs and then a curious pairing of Shostakovich's op. 100, six
Spanish pastiches, with Falla's artful but deeply authentic Seven Popular
Spanish Songs. From her first notes in Rakhmaninov it was plain that she was
in golden, generous, wonderfully easy form - though most of the composer's
chosen texts carry heartache to the point caricature.
Borodina fathomed their (slightly) varied sentiments with natural sympathy
and spelled them out in glowing lines, with rich, solidly idiomatic support
from Gergieva's Bosendorfer. More contrasts in weight and pace would have
been welcome: left to her own instincts, this singer likes to be relaxed and
unhurried, and some sameness began to be felt. Shostakovich's odd but lively
op. 100 set (on 'Spanish' vignettes by a pair of Russian poets) enforced
more variety.
We heard no hint of affectionate mockery, however, only simple affection;
some of the piano-writing can reveal more of a sardonic glint than the
efficient Gergieva let it do. In the evergreen Falla sequence, she was out
of her depth. The final 'Polo' is a brute of a piece with its furious
flamenco effects, and here it sounded like forced labour. At least Borodina
found the right spirit for almost every song, if in some Martian dialect of
Spanish.
On Sunday the Royal Festival Hall was packed for the first of three
Philharmonia concerts with James Levine as conductor. A short series, but
imposing, with the Mahler Third to come on Wednesday, and Berlioz's
Damnation of Faust on Saturday; this opening programme comprised Beethoven's
'Eroica' Symphony and his Piano Concerto no. 4, with Murray Perahia as
soloist.
Perahia delivered the concerto with his usual unforced grace. It was as
rewarding as it was captivating to hear, and Levine accommodated him with
his usual professionalism. Perhaps the orchestral exposition built up a head
of steam that the pianist would have to tamp down later, gently but firmly;
and Levine made the string-statements at the start of the Andante strangely
dry, bitten off note-by-note - a conception that had little to do with
Perahia's reading.
Those slight mismatches did no real injury to a beautiful performance. We
were subliminally aware that Levine was drawing an unfamiliar hard-edged
sound from the Philharmonia, especially from its strings - very tight and
sharply focussed. That sound came into its own in Levine's 'Eroica'. The
whole symphony was lean, swift, charged with determined purpose; the
performance was at the furthest extreme from the old Viennese ideal of
majestic, well-upholstered weight and ruminative depths.
While it lasted, it gripped one's attention unrelentingly. It had been
superbly rehearsed: the orchestral counterpoint was absolutely lucid, with
lower voices striking pointfully through in places where usually we barely
notice them.
'Expansive' Levine was certainly not, still less indulgent. Committed
admirers of, say, Furtwangler, will not have been converted; to them, it may
have seemed a heartless, machine-tooled reading. I found it unexpectedly
bracing.

FT  15 FEB 94 / People: All change at Woolworths as Barnes departs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworths' managing director Mair Barnes, one of the UK's most successful
female executives and a former Business Woman of the Year, has surprised the
retail world by resigning 'for personal reasons'.
Woolworths' parent Kingfisher refuses to comment on the reasons for the
departure of Barnes - who had been tipped in the past as a possible
successor to group chairman Sir Geoff Mulcahy. She will be replaced by
Jonathan Weeks, currently strategy and business development director.
Barnes, 49, started out as a graduate trainee at Harrods before becoming the
House of Fraser's first woman store manager at Howells of Cardiff. She
joined Woolworths, part of the Kingfisher group, in 1985, initially as
merchandise director.
Later, when she told Mulcahy that she was not happy with Woolworths'
direction, she found he agreed and made her managing director of the
operation - just two years after she had joined the group.
She then proceeded to turn a Pounds 5m loss into a Pounds 45m profit within
four years through cutting Woolworths' range and building its strength in
children's clothes, sweets, toys, videos and CDs. She transformed what had
been seen as a dinosaur of the high street into a success story, and was
well-rewarded. A survey last year identified her as one of the UK's 50
best-paid women.
The improvement continued through to last year, when operating profits for
the year to January 30 reached a record Pounds 77.8m, on sales of Pounds
1.2bn. However, since Kingfisher appointed former Marks and Spencer stores
director Alan Smith as group chief executive last year, Smith has shown a
particular interest in the Woolworths chain, and is expected to announce new
initiatives to ensure the chain's continuing success.
He has also shaken up Woolworths' management, bringing in Bharat Patel from
Tesco as finance director, and has just appointed Saeed Hatteea, presently
with Marks and Spencer, as merchandise director.
Barnes' replacement, Jonathan Weeks, joined Woolworths in 1984 as director
of distribution, and later became operations director. He was appointed MD
of Entertainment UK in 1989, and became a member of Kingfisher's management
committee in 1992. He is said to have particular expertise in the
operations, distribution and supply chain side of the business.
Before joining Kingfisher group, Weeks was managing director of SPD, the
distribution subsidiary of Unilever, and previously worked at Hoover, Black
&amp; Decker and Bass.

FT  15 FEB 94 / People: Rentokil phones the lawyers again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry King, 57, (right) who took over as chairman of City lawyers Denton
Hall in November, is following in the footsteps of one of his predecessors
and taking on the chairmanship of one of his firm's bigger clients. He will
become non-executive chairman of Rentokil, the environmental and property
services group, when David Newbigging steps down in May.
King, who joined Denton Hall in 1961 as an articled clerk, has been a
non-executive director of Rentokil since 1985. He is also a director of City
Centre Restaurants and Brambles Investments. Clive Thompson, Rentokil's
chief executive, said that the board had felt it was preferable to appoint a
chairman from one its own members rather than hire headhunters to bring in
an outsider.
King is not as well known outside the City as David Newbigging, 60, a former
chairman of Jardine Matheson, who is retiring from the Rentokil board after
seven years as chairman. However, King does know the company well. His firm
of Denton Hall &amp; Burgin acted for Rentokil when it was floated on the stock
market in 1969 and Pat Burgin, one of King's former colleagues, was chairman
at the time of flotation.
King says that the fact that Rentokil has drawn two of its chairmen from the
same law firm was a coincidence. Denton Hall is not Rentokil's sole law firm
and King says that one of his own inviolable rules is that he never gets
involved in giving legal advice to clients 'where I sit on the board'.

In recent months, Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest society, has
been notable for acquiring mortgage books to boost its assets. Now it has
acquired a full-time corporate development director to take on this work.
Stephen Bright, the society's finance director, has been appointed to a new
position of corporate development director, though he will continue in post
until a successor is appointed, probably within the next few months.
Birmingham Midshires currently has assets of over Pounds 4bn, and aims to
increase them to over Pounds 5bn by the end of the year.
Bright, 44, has been finance director for almost 10 years since he moved to
the society from a background in stockbroking and management consultancy.
He sees his priorities both as identifying new mortgage books for the
society to buy, and talking to other societies with a view to merging.
'The business now is about building a customer base and keeping it, not
about acquiring assets willy-nilly,' he continues.

Roger Barton, managing director of business development at the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, yesterday announced he
will be leaving LIFFE in the near future. The date of his departure has not
yet been set.
'I decided that, after an enjoyable career at LIFFE, I needed to move on to
a fresh start,' 39-year-old Barton said. He explained that he intended to
find a related position in the securities industry, before adding that
'there's nothing quite like LIFFE'.
Barton has been with the exchange for 12 years, masterminding the launch of
several of its products, including the Euroswiss futures contract, the BTP
futures and option contract, the Eurolira future and the Ecu future.
His position will not be filled directly, but his areas of responsibility
will be divided among members of the business development department, said
Daniel Hodson, LIFFE's chief executive.
Philip Bruce will be put in charge of strategic business development, while
Ralf Herklotz will be responsible for developing interest rate products.
Karin Forseke will remain in charge of equity products, he said.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Limits clarified on non-EU dentists /
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In two rulings last week, the ECJ clarified the rights of establishment in
the internal market of dentists who are member country nationals but who
obtained qualifications outside the 12.
In the first, the French Conseil d'Etat asked the ECJ to interpret the 1978
directive on mutual recognition of dentist qualifications. The minister of
social affairs had refused on May 2 1986 to authorise Mr Abdullah
Tawil-Albertini to practise as a dentist in France. The ECJ was asked to
clarify whether the provisions of the directive requiring member countries
to recognise certificates issued by another member country prior to the
directive coming into force also applied to dental qualifications obtained
in non-member countries recognised by a member as equivalent to its own.
In 1968, Mr Tawil-Albertini obtained a Lebanese dental diploma. In 1979,
before the mutual recognition directive, his diploma was recognised as
equivalent and he was permitted to practise in Belgium, followed by the UK
in 1980 and Ireland in 1986.
Mr Tawil-Albertini argued his Lebanese qualification had been recognised as
equivalent to another member country's and that he should benefit from the
mutual recognition directive implemented in France from 1980.
The ECJ said the directive (78/696) did not require member countries to
recognise qualifications other than those based on training in another
member. This was because mutual recognition was based on the guarantee
provided by a second directive on co-ordination (78/687) that minimum
training standards were satisfied.
As an exception, qualifications obtained in a member country before
implementation of the harmonised system must also be accepted by other
member countries, provided a dentist has practised for three of the
preceding five years. But this only covers qualifications issued by members.
Although the directive permits a member country to authorise a dentist to
practise in its territory with qualifications obtained in a non-member
country, such recognition does not bind others.
In the second case, the ECJ was asked by the Bundessozialgericht to
interpret provisions in the recognition directive permitting specific
training period requirements as a condition for registration as a dentist
under national health insurance schemes and the Treaty prohibition of
restrictions on the right of establishment.
An Italian national, Mr Haim, had obtained a Turkish dental qualification in
1946. In 1981, he was recognised as a dentist in Germany and permitted to
operate in private practice; in 1982, his Turkish diploma was recognised in
Belgium as equivalent to a local qualification; and he worked for eight
years registered under Belgium's national health system.
But in 1988, his registration application under a German national health
scheme was rejected as he had not completed two years training required by
German law.
He argued he was exempt because his Turkish qualification was recognised as
equivalent to a qualification listed in the recognition directive. But the
ECJ rejected his argument. It said the system of mutual recognition and
co-ordination of qualifications was established over eight years from the
date the member countries were notified of the 1978 directives. Only
dentists with qualifications listed in the directive were exempt from any
training period once the directive came into force. During the previous
eight years, only dentists with qualifications issued by a member were
subject to a reduced training period.
When a dentist with non-EC qualifications but recognised by a member country
had practised under the national health insurance scheme of another member
country, Treaty rules on the right of establishment required the German
authorities to take into account any relevant experience in deciding whether
its practical training requirements had been satisfied. Without such
verification, the prohibition of restrictions on the right of establishment
precluded national authorities from refusing registration.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Bill pulls the wrong punches - A
document likely to disappoint lawyers and businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's draft arbitration bill, described by Mr Neil Hamilton,
corporate affairs minister, as 'a key element of (the government's)
deregulation initiative', is likely to fall short of its ambitious aims.
Far from effecting much-needed deregulation, the bill would bring only minor
improvements in the substantive law. Its main merit is in consolidating in a
single statute the law now dispersed in three arbitration acts, some other
statutes and numerous judgments. In short, it would simply make it easier to
find the bad rules in the law.
The bill's main weakness is that it would leave untouched the intrusive -
and uniquely English - regulation of arbitration, which, after all, is a
private industry. If adopted in its present form, the bill would continue to
make English arbitration - particularly marine, insurance and commodity
contracts - unnecessarily slow and expensive, and to drive parties seeking
the resolution of their disputes to friendlier and cheaper shores. The UK
Department of Trade and Industry is inviting comments from the legal
profession and business by June 30.
English arbitration law lags its Scottish counterpart and its reform had
been considered for many years by a DTI departmental advisory committee. The
committee was originally chaired by Lord Mustil, a great believer in an
arbitration system regulated and dominated by the commercial court. His
succession in the chair by Lord Justice Steyn gave rise to a hope of a more
progressive attitude.
These hopes were boosted when the committee decided to follow the logical
structure of the model law of arbitration adopted by United Nations
Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); it commissioned private
lawyers to draft a bill.
However, though the logical structure of the model law survives in the draft
bill, the draft produced by the private lawyers had to be revised, at
Whitehall's insistence, to conform to the convoluted style of parliamentary
drafters. Though the bill is more lucid than the run-of-the-mill
legislation, it is still burdened by verbosity and is far from user-friendly
for the average businessman.
But the bill does contain some good points. The bill makes it clear that
there is no need for the arbitration to follow the procedure of the High
Court. The law never required that it should. It was the legal profession
which transformed the originally informal arbitration by businessmen or
technical experts into a wigless litigation.
The bill would also widen the range of admissible evidence and remove such
absurdity as the qualification of business and production records as
inadmissible hearsay.
It would confirm the principle that an arbitration clause survives an
invalid agreement of which it is a part - its inclusion in the model law
reflects an international consensus on this crucial issue.
This measure has already been taken on board by the Court of Appeal on the
grounds of the 'practical advantage of one-stop adjudication', but its
adoption by the bill is valuable: the inclusion of the measure at this stage
would protect it against attempts to excise it in the House of Lords where
the views of Lord Mustil carry weight on arbitration matters.
The bill also adopts the model law rule that an arbitrator, such as a judge,
should be immune from prosecution for negligence, unless he acts in bad
faith.
In contrast with such useful restatements and marginal improvements, the
bill would leave untouched the three main shortcomings of English
arbitration law:
the rejection of arbitration clauses enabling the arbitrator to decide
according to generally recognised principles of law, fairness and justice;
the impossibility of opting out from the right of appeal to the courts in
the arbitration clause of international marine, insurance and commodity
contracts and any domestic contracts;
the possibility of leaving to the very end of the proceedings objections to
the arbitrator's juris-diction.
The model law, now widely followed in Commonwealth countries, provides in
Article 28(3) that parties may authorise the arbitral tribunal to act as
mediator or to make an award according to what appears to him to be fair and
just. It is a pity that the advisory committee reached the conclusion that
this should not be followed.
While in German courts it is a duty of the judge to attempt settlement
before the opening of the trial or during the trial, in England mediation
cannot be part of the judicial process and some experts hold that an
arbitrator disqualifies himself by an attempt to mediate between the
parties.
Such a narrow concept of arbitration makes it confrontational,
lawyer-dominated, slow and costly. It is hardly surprising that special
agencies offering alternative methods of dispute resolution - mediation,
mini-trial, for example - are now mushrooming on both sides of the Atlantic.
Unless existing rules are relaxed, English arbitration is bound to loose a
good deal of work to alternative dispute resolution at home or to foreign
arbitration. Non-legalistic solution of business disputes is already common
practice in Japan and China and other emerging markets of south-east Asia.
The greatest objection to current English arbitration legislation - and one
most loudly voiced at international conferences - is the possibility of
appealing to the courts against the arbitral award on issues of law.
The 'escape by appeal' deprives the award of its finality; worse, a rich
party, or one backed by an insurance company or a ship-owners' club, can
force its opponent to give up by a mere threat of taking the dispute to the
High Court and from there possibly to the Appeal Court or even the House of
Lords. This is, of course, a mockery of the original purpose of arbitration.
It is regrettable that the bill proposes to uphold the present rule that
allows parties to exclude such appeal in their arbitration clause only in
international disputes and only if it is not a marine, insurance or
commodity case. In such international disputes, and in all domestic
disputes, such exclusion of appeal is allowed only after the proceedings
start.
Finally, Section 3(1) of the bill would retain the present rule which
enables parties to raise jurisdictional objections at any time, even after
the award was made. A defeated party can try to challenge an unfavourable
award, or at least delay its enforcement, by claiming that the arbitrator
had no jurisdiction. In contrast, the model law provides in Article 16(2)
that jurisdictional objections may be raised only at the outset of
arbitration.
This seems perfectly reasonable, but the consultative document states that
it cannot be done in England. This is backward looking and loses sight of
the much-needed deregulation.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Spate of actions against City law
firms - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A spate of legal actions against City law firms has raised fears that the US
trend towards suing lawyers and accountants - as the best available source
of compensatory damages when deals go wrong - is about to cross the
Atlantic.
Yeoman International, an Irish leasing company, has settled its Pounds 115m
action against Linklaters &amp; Paines and merchant bank S G Warburg arising out
of the offers made by Yeoman for CLF Holdings, a British leasing company, in
December 1988. Linklaters says it did not pay any money to either Warburg or
Yeoman in settlement.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd has issued a writ against Clifford Chance alleging
negligence on a deal involving the failed financial conglomerate, British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings; and Simmons &amp; Simmons is being sued for Pounds 50m by
Banque Bruxelles Lambert for alleged negligence in the handling of a
property deal.
And although no writs have been issued, Allen &amp; Overy and Clifford Chance
are believed to be footing the bills for investigations by Freshfields and
Lovell White Durrant into advice given by the firms to the troubled Queens
Moat Houses hotels group. The problem came to light when Allen &amp; Overy
realised it had made an error in interpreting QMH's articles of association
in 1993 and that Clifford Chance may have made the same error in 1989.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New life for old form of
financing - An unusual factoring technique has been revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Eddie George called on companies last month to find ways of
financing growth other than by overdraft, the factoring industry has been on
a roll.
This flexible form of finance is growing rapidly, albeit from a low base,
and appears to be shedding the poor image that has dogged it for years. The
industry has even persuaded George to speak at its annual dinner this year,
the first time a Bank of England governor has graced the event.
But the traditional factoring and invoice discounting product may be about
to receive a small shock. A start-up company backed by Mees Pierson, the
Dutch merchant bank which helped put the Netherlands on the map as a trading
nation, has re-introduced a form of debtor financing to the UK not seen
since the mid-18th century.
Foster Church was formed by Frank Horack, a former banker with Chase
Manhattan, and has some of the characteristics of factoring. Specifically,
debtor financing provides rapidly growing companies with a working capital
facility that grows as sales grow. This is an important attraction of
factoring - growing companies can find they are constantly bumping up
against their overdraft ceilings.
But there the similarity ends. Where a factor buys its clients' debts,
Foster Church buys their goods and effectively becomes the seller to the
customer. In return it gives the supplier up to 80 per cent of the value of
the sale in cash on a non-recourse basis and advances credit to the
customer.
What is more, unlike in a factoring arrangement, Foster Church allows its
clients to present as few or as many invoices as they like. A factoring
company will generally only factor the entire debtor book, so that companies
can find themselves paying for a service that they are not actually using.
And it does not seek personal guarantees from directors of the companies it
serves.
While the cost of Foster Church's finance is similar to that of factors  -
about 4 per cent over bank base rate - its commission is steep at 3 per cent
per transaction. Horack says this is justified as companies pay only for
services they use. But it also means its debtor financing service is
unlikely to be attractive unless a company is both growing rapidly and
enjoys healthy gross margins.
There is one other novelty. Because it is focused on higher-risk small
growing companies, Foster Church has the right to 'earn' options to buy an
equity stake. As the client's use of the service increases, so does Foster
Church's right to share options.
No one seriously expects Foster Church's so-called Excel-erator to mount a
single-handed challenge to traditional factoring. Debtor financing is
unsuitable for many companies and some businessmen and women remain
reluctant to give up equity, even if this financing method would speed up
the pace of development.
But the debtor financing method has proved effective for some companies
which have found factoring too restrictive. 'The factoring package usually
is an all or nothing situation - they take your entire debtor list. Foster
Church is more flexible,' says Alan Houston, managing director of Heritage
Food, which makes frozen desserts and has sales of Pounds 2m which are
growing by about 25 per cent a year.
He has also used Foster Church for acquisitions. 'You can accelerate cash
flow at critical times. If you seek a bank facility on buying a business,
the bank will look for six months' trading experience before lending.'
Charles Stacey, managing director of British Astec, which sells therapeutic
beds and chairs to the National Health Service among others, is another
enthusiast. 'Because of the expansion rate we have been able to achieve we
have had constant cash flow problems,' says Stacey. 'They can cure our cash
flow very quickly.'
Debtor financing will not work for every company but Eddie George would be
proud.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): European adventure -
Signs that Britain's 3i is preparing for a stock market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Passport Modevertrieb GmbH helped to launch a new adventure for
3i. The Stuttgart-based maker of ladies' knitwear became the first company
to receive equity from a Ecu 300m fund that 3i has raised for investment in
continental Europe's unquoted companies.
Important as the deal was to Passport Modevertrieb's owners, the investment
has a wider significance for 3i. The European fund is a departure for the
45-year-old institution in the sense that it is the first time it has raised
money to manage for other investors. It also signals a desire by 3i to
accelerate its expansion in the less developed and growing continental
European venture capital market. But, most intriguingly, it appears to put
in place one of the last elements necessary to prepare the UK's largest
venture capital company for a stock market flotation.
The fees 3i will receive for managing the new fund will boost the profit and
loss account, while the fund approach will allow expansion without undue
pressure on the group's balance sheet. The fund's launch also comes at a
time when venture capital investment trust shares, against which 3i would be
compared, are trading at a historically low discount to net asset values.
3i and its advisers deny the new fund was raised with any thought to
relaunching last year's hastily abandoned flotation. The group's
shareholders - the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England - may yet
decide they do not want to sell.
But even if 3i remains unquoted, its move into fund management is
significant on two counts.
Until now 3i has always invested off the strength of its own balance sheet,
unlike many UK venture capital providers which periodically raise funds to
manage for other investors.
That has now changed. Neil Cross, 3i's international director, makes it
clear the raising of a fund is not a one-off event. Depending on how
successfully 3i invests the first fund, the group could be back raising more
capital within two years. What is more, 3i does not rule out raising funds
for investment elsewhere, including the UK.
'We wanted to make a strategic development for the group into fund
management,' says Cross. 'I felt strategically it gave me a more assured
flexibility and it was a business 3i should be in.'
3i's move into managing other people's unquoted investment portfolios could
add to competition among venture capital companies for new funds. Some UK
institutions are already showing a reluctance to invest more in new funds
and the arrival of a group with 3i's reputation may be less than welcome,
particularly to the smaller venture capital providers.
Others disagree. Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Ventures, who is currently
in the US raising a new fund, says the supply of funds is not 'finite' and a
good record will always attract investors.
From the point of view of private equity investment in continental Europe,
3i's move also signals a more aggressive approach, though not without risks.
The group already makes 25 per cent of its equity investments on the
continent each year. But this market is greatly underdeveloped by UK
standards. In France, the market that is closest behind the UK, penetration
of investment capital as a proportion of GDP is barely more than a third of
the level of 3i's domestic market.
Italy, Germany and Spain, where 3i will also invest, are even less well
developed. But once the economies in these countries improve, the market for
unquoted investments could rapidly expand, says Paul Waller, 3i's European
director.
Companies like Passport Modevertrieb are likely to provide this growth. For
20 years, the company has been conservatively and profitably run. Then, like
thousands of other German companies, it ran into the issue of how to secure
succession as the founders moved towards retirement.
Wanting to maintain its independence, the owners turned to 3i to back a
management buy-out that left the founders with a substantial minority stake.
The succession issue is facing family-owned companies throughout continental
Europe.
'There are 15,000 family businesses that have to manage their succession
over the next 10 years so there is a massive market to tap into,' says
Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, managing director of 3i, Germany. 'We see the
opportunity to buy from large groups that are divesting of subsidiaries and
may have sales of DM200m-DM300m (Pounds 77m-Pounds 116m).'
But some venture capitalists say the continental European market is not as
developed as the UK for good reason. 'Europe is higher risk as well as
higher growth and higher reward,' says one UK-based venture capital
supplier.
'Motivation in Germany is different,' he says. 'Managers there have been
more interested in a large secure salary and a big position rather than
capital gain. Go to Italy and Spain and you don't know what books you are
looking at, while in France the Brits don't go down too well.'
Others believe 3i is hedging its bets in continental Europe by 'investing
other people's money'. 3i denies this and says the fund will allow it to
double the average size of transaction and will increase its ability to
underwrite deals.
But why raise the fund now, if the group's capital base is not yet
constraining growth? The industry is convinced 3i is preparing for flotation
and a closer look at 3i's funding supports this.
3i's investments in Europe will mostly be in the form of equity for
management buy-outs and buy-ins. They will bring 3i a relatively low annual
running yield - or return, from various forms of dividends.
By contrast, 3i's UK investments include a substantial number of loans in
addition to equity investments, which means the running yield is higher.
A rapid expansion in continental European investment off its own balance
sheet could lead to a gap between the cost of 3i's bank borrowings and the
lower revenue from the relatively low running yield on continental
investments. The profit and loss account might then suffer.
By expanding in Europe through a fund, 3i will be protecting its profit and
loss account. That way lies the route to a dividend large enough to support
the kind of valuation 3i's shareholders might want before floating the
group.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Suppliers under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditional venture capital suppliers are under threat from some of the UK
institutions which invest in them, says a report* from Initiative Europe, a
specialist publisher in the industry.
Competition is growing from other providers of finance such as banks,
insurance companies and other institutions, the UK Venture Industry Review
says.
'In the long term, the traditional venture capital suppliers are expendable
unless they can prove they really do add value by sourcing and structuring
exceptional deals,' says Antonia Millen, managing director of Initiative
Europe.
Venture capital suppliers must prove they are providing an efficient and
cost-effective conduit between the institutions and unquoted companies, she
says.
The report is billed as a strategic review of the UK's venture capital
industry and the structural changes that are likely by the turn of the
century.
One of the biggest threats is from institutions that are by-passing the
venture capital funds and 'investing directly' in the unquoted sector, it
says.
The latest to move in this direction are Eagle Star and Sun Life which have
set up their own operations, following a path trodden by Cinven and Legal &amp;
General a decade ago when they developed their own in-house investment
teams.
There is also an increase in the number of so-called captive operations -
venture capital suppliers that predominantly manage funds for their parent
organisations.
'Some institutions that used to make investments via funds are increasingly
saying we have learnt how to do it by co-investing and we will now do it
alone,' says Millen. Often the reason these institutions contributed to
funds in the first place was to learn how to invest in unquoted equity.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Technology: Radiation experiments come to light - Victims
may never receive financial compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, as in every week since early December, hundreds of Americans will
call the US Department of Energy to report that they were subjects of human
radiation experiments. Two months ago, Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary,
mentioned the word 'compensation' on national television in response to
press accounts of experiments in the 1940s in which terminal cancer patients
were injected with plutonium to see how it would affect them.
Since the plutonium experiments were revealed, other cases have come to
light: 17 boys in Massachusetts had been given breakfast cereal laced with
small amounts of radiation; in Oregon, scientists irradiated the testicles
of 67 prisoners. Some of the experimental subjects gave their informed
consent, others were never asked.
At her press conference, O'Leary said she was 'shocked and saddened' by news
of the experiments. She then set up a toll-free telephone number for the
public to report other 'abuses'.
So far, more than 18,000 have called; about half are armed forces veterans
who believe they have been exposed to radiation during nuclear weapons
tests. Of the rest, more than 2,000 believe they were the subjects of
experiments.
A federal task force is gearing up to review government experiments
involving radiation and humans from 1944 to 1974. By all estimates, most of
the research was legitimate. Yet some experiments were unethical by today's
standards, and perhaps even by the standards at the time.
The sheer magnitude of the review task, however, has turned an attempt to
'come clean' on previous government abuses into a paperwork nightmare that
may take years to complete.
Over the past month, officials have begun to back away from talk of
compensation. 'Financial compensation is just one of several models we're
considering,' says John Donnelly, a spokesman at the Department of Energy.
'There may not be any compensation at all.' At a congressional hearing on
the subject last week, administration officials said they were considering a
range of options, from monetary compensation to medical follow-ups or just
formal apologies.
The US has an ample history of paying compensation when it has wronged its
citizens, but it has usually done so only after pressure and years of
bureaucratic wrangling. The largest compensation payment - Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1bn) - went to Japanese-Americans who had been confined in
internment camps during the second world war. The government made its first
payments in 1989, more than 40 years later.
Perhaps the nearest thing to compensation for subjects of radiation
experiments is the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which aided
'downwinders' (members of the public who were exposed to fallout from
atmospheric nuclear test), on-site participants of nuclear tests and uranium
miners. To be eligible for a lump sum compensation of Dollars 50,000, the
downwinders have to prove they have developed one of 13 specified types of
cancer.
The on-site participants are eligible for Dollars 75,000 if they can do the
same. And the miners get Dollars 100,000 if they can prove they were exposed
to high levels of radiation and subsequently developed lung cancer or one of
four other respiratory diseases. Since 1992, the government has received
3,595 claims, of which it has approved nearly half, for a total of Dollars
112m.
Although it took the government more than 40 years to begin paying the
voluntary and involuntary participants of the nuclear tests, that programme
is now considered a model. Compensation for subjects of radiation
experiments could be a more difficult matter.
Unlike accidental irradiation of the public near nuclear tests, the jury is
still out on whether most of the experiments were cases of government
wrongdoing.
Although the standards of informed consent were often deficient by today's
standards, the rules were different then. Many of the experiments were
approved by ethics review boards before they began.
While potentially harmful research on prisoners is now considered unethical,
it was not until the late 1960s that this was generally accepted. Many
researchers also point out that, although it has little bearing on the
ethics of the experiments, most of the research was valuable; some of it led
to the radiation safety standards in place today.
Making the decision even more difficult for those who must determine whether
or not to compensate, none of the experiments questioned has been shown to
have caused lasting harm to their subjects.
Ruth Faden, a Johns Hopkins University bioethicist, has been named to head a
panel of independent experts who will review the radiation experiments. In
her writings, she has argued that before the early 1970s (when the first
comprehensive human subjects regulations went into effect in the US) the
scientific community's collective sense of ethics was insufficient to make
the phrase 'informed consent' truly meaningful. By that view, most of the
radiation experiments could be in for a beating.
But the panel has not met yet, and the completion of any substantive review
could be more than a year away. O'Leary, striking a more tentative note, now
says no compensation decision will be made before the review is complete.
Science ethics, it seems, are sometimes more complicated than they seem.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Technology: Plastic that grows on trees - The dream of a
harvestable biopolymer could be soon be a reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Picture groves of 'plastic bushes' that produce plastic in the same way
cotton plants make cotton. This is not an image from a whimsical Beatles
song. It is a dream that scientists say will become reality by the end of
the decade.
The goal is to create a harvestable polymer that can be used to make
everything from throw-away consumer plastics to car parts. 'Natural' plastic
is not a new idea. In the 1970s, the oil crisis spawned research in the
field when the future of petroleum-based plastics seemed under threat.
Later, environmental concerns heightened interest in the material, which
biodegrades rapidly. Petroleum-based plastic is not only one of the most
difficult materials to recycle, it also has an inconveniently long life,
often taking hundreds of years to decompose. With communities desperate to
cut down on landfill volume, biodegradable plastic is an appealing concept.
Early research into non-petroleum-based plastic faltered, but advances in
genetic engineering over the past few years have re-awakened interest in the
idea.
'Plants are the way to go because they would be the cheapest form of
production,' says Anthony Sinskey, professor of microbiology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an adviser to Metabolix, the US
biotechnology group. Sinskey says he and his colleagues have been able to
capture the genes in certain bacteria that are responsible for producing
biosynthetic material.
'Ten years ago, research in this area got stuck because the producing
enzymes were difficult to purify and control,' Sinskey says. 'Molecular
biology has changed the focus because now we can move the genetic
information around, either to bacteria which reproduce rapidly, or ideally,
to plants.
'Sunlight, which plants tap, is ultimately cheaper than petroleum or the
glucose or lactose used in today's fermentation methods, and the plants
don't have to make a lot of the material to make it economically
worthwhile.'
By transferring the plastic-producing genes to seeds, plants could
theoretically be made to make polyester fibres. 'Potatoes and mushrooms
might be good possibilities - we are experimenting with them,' says Tillman
Gerngross, a research scientist at Metabolix. 'But so far, we have only been
able to produce the reaction in a glass tube.'
Plastic-making plants still may be a dream, but several companies have
already scored successes with other methods. Britain's Zeneca, for example,
is making biodegradable polymers from bacteria. The company sells
biodegradable shampoo bottles under the brand name Biopol, and is exploring
other potential uses for the material, including plastic film.
US-based Cargill is also making biodegradable plastics, and plans to
dedicate much of a new plant in Nebraska to making plastics from cornstarch.
'We see a big market in plastic-coated cardboard and diapers (nappies),'
says Patrick Gruber, director of Ecopla, Cargill's biodegradable plastics
division.
Warner-Lambert of the US, which produced plastics from starch, even ran some
trials at Disney World with a line of biodegradable utensils. The company
also began selling peanut wrappers and composting bags. But these early
forays met with limited success. Warner-Lambert decided to back out of the
business in 1993 after several years of research.
'To get where we'd want to go with this, it would take a lot of money and
time,' the group said. 'So we decided to concentrate on our core businesses
instead.' Warner-Lambert, best known for pharmaceuticals, is still looking
for a buyer for its bioplastics technology.
There are two big problems with current biodegradable plastics. First, they
are expensive to make, running to three or more times the cost of producing
petroleum-based plastic. Second, early trials created weak materials that
began to disintegrate under moist conditions and stick to the hands of the
user.
Scientists hope the latest advances will not only improve the quality of the
final product but will also bring down costs. Petroleum-based plastic is
extremely cheap as well as highly versatile.
One of the keys to making natural plastics cheaper, says Dave Barstow,
general manager of the biopolymers division at Zeneca, is ensuring that the
plastics can be used easily in current moulding machines. 'Businesses won't
buy a new machine to accommodate this product, so that is key to our
long-term success,' he explains.
Many in the market believe they may eventually be helped by increased
environmental awareness. Companies concerned with their ecological image may
adopt the idea of using the materials for packaging, and local government
may step in.
'There is always the possibility that we may get some subsidies from
communities worried about landfills and the high cost of recycling plastic,'
says Edward Muller, chief executive officer of Metabolix.
Still, Muller insists that the real key to success is in producing a cheap,
easy-to-use material of exceptional quality. For that reason, Metabolix,
along with other groups like Zeneca, is looking beyond biodegradability to
plastics with superior performance qualities.
'We are exploring the material's advantages in electrical conductivity and
resistance at different temperatures,' Muller explains, 'to see if we can
find some potential new uses.'
Another important potential market would be in drug delivery systems.
'Because the materials break down quickly over time, they could be used as
capsules to release medicine over a short period to the body,' says David
Kaplan, senior scientist with the biotechnology division of the Natick Army
Labs, which uses US federal grant money to conduct research in the field.
With a number of hurdles to overcome, non-petroleum-based plastics probably
have a long way to go before they become a leading force in the worldwide
plastics market. Still, research in the area is advancing, and interest in
biodegradable plastics is strong. If all goes well in the laboratories, by
the end of the decade seasonal workers may be hired for the summer on
plastic plantations.

FT  15 FEB 94 / First group of lecturers agrees flexible contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further-education employers yesterday agreed with one lecturers' union on
the introduction of new employment contracts.
They also told other unions in the sector that they would receive no pay
rise this year unless they also accepted the contracts.
The deal with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers follows last week's
intervention in the dispute by Mr Tim Boswell, the further-education
minister. He said Pounds 50m would be withheld from colleges' budgets unless
more 'flexible' contracts were introduced.
But the largest union in the sector, the National Association of Teachers in
Further and Higher Education, refused to sign the deal yesterday. It
described the proposals as 'wholly unacceptable', and announced a one-day
strike on March 1.
The Colleges' Employers' Forum has been in dispute with unions since
further-education colleges were taken out of local authority control last
April.
The new contracts involved halving holiday allowances, adding an hour to the
working day, and cutting redundancy notice periods.
Mr Gerald Imion, assistant general secretary of the ATL, said the union had
felt it was necessary to negotiate unilaterally. He said: 'Our members were
telling us they didn't want strike action. They didn't think it was
relevant.'
The ATL claims about 4,000 members in further-education colleges. They will
receive a pay rise of 2.9 per cent, plus a discretionary rise of up to two
points in the lecturers' pay-scale (which would allow further increases of
Pounds 730 per year for those at the top)and discretionary one-off payments
of up to Pounds 500.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, described the settlement as
'extraordinarily generous'. He said: 'There can be no prospect of a salary
increase for those who do not sign the new contract.'
Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe's negotiating secretary, said that the government
and employers had found in the ATL 'a tame union with no base in further
education through which to foment division amongst lecturers.'

FT  15 FEB 94 / Performance pay goal ousts unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The goal of linking pay more closely to performance is the main reason given
for de-recognising unions and switching to personal contracts, says a survey
by Industrial Relations Services, the pay analysts.
Of 98 companies which responded to the survey, 25 said they had abandoned
collective bargaining in one or more areas of the company but only 10 had
abandoned collective bargaining for all workers.
Fifteen cited performance pay as the main motive for abandoning collective
bargaining, 12 said collective bargaining was no longer relevant for the
employees concerned, and 10 said there was already a low degree of union
membership among the people involved.
Asked to rate the success of de-recognition in terms of its impact on such
things as employee commitment and productivity most said it had been 'fairly
successful' a few 'very successful' and very few 'fairly unsuccessful'.
De-recognised unions often kept some form of representative or consultative
rights, especially over disciplinary and grievance procedures.
Sixteen organisations claimed to have introduced personal contracts, but
these appeared to vary little within individual organisations.
The highest levels of sickness absence from work in spring 1993 were
recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, the latest Labour Force Survey says.
Four per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women were absent because of
illness or injury for at least one day in the week during which the data was
collected.
In all regions - except East Anglia, which had the lowest rate of sick leave
 -the levels of sickness absence for women were higher. Overall, 4.2 per
cent of men were absent for at least one day in the week of the survey
compared with 5.4 per cent of women.

FT  15 FEB 94 / BR signal staff seek 11% pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail signalling staff are demanding an immediate interim 11 per cent
basic pay increase in return for improved productivity in recent years.
Unless the claim is met, their union - the RMT - says it will refuse to
negotiate a restructuring agreement for signalling staff with BR. 'We have
an overwhelming case for an immediate down payment', said RMT last night.
Union leaders have submitted their proposal and BR is expected to reply
shortly.
In a letter to RMT branches, the union's general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp
says BR has 'obtained significant productivity from its signalling grades,
but their rates of pay have remained unacceptably low in their own right and
even more so when compared to other BR grades and London Underground
signalling staff.' The RMT argues the number of signalling staff has fallen
by 35 per cent since 1980 and new equipment and responsibilities have been
introduced without any compensating cash reward.
The union says signalling staff work an average 52.4 hours a week for a a
basic Pounds 124 to Pounds 137. Average weekly earnings including overtime
are between Pounds 248 and Pounds 268.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Workers 'losing access to decisions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly unregulated labour market is returning to the way it was in
the 19th century before trade unionism, according to a
government-commissioned survey of workplace industrial relations published
today.
Its author - Dr Neil Millward of the Policy Studies Institute - argues the
country is approaching the position where most workers lack any any means of
influence in the way their workplace is run beyond their own job.
The report was commissioned by the Employment Department as part of a long
running inquiry into Britain's changing industrial relations.
The third report in the series says: 'The recent growth in inequality in
wages and earnings which has been widely observed to be greater in Britain
than in almost all other developed economies is being matched by a widening
in the inequalities of influence and access to key decisions about work and
employment.'
The study suggests the sharp decline in workplace trade unionism since 1980
(with a fall from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in membership) has not led to
any spontaneous move by employers to introduce alternative forms of worker
representation or joint consultation.
Instead, the author argues British industry and commerce 'appear to be
moving towards the situation in which non-managerial employees are treated
as a 'factor of production' '.
Management is growing increasingly autocratic in its wielding of unilateral
power.
At the same time, Dr Millward points out that no laws have been passed in
Britain - unlike in 'almost all other developed economies' - to 'provide a
basic floor of employment rights and minimum labour standards' for workers.
The comprehensive survey covers 1,500 establishments with more than 25
employees in industry and commerce in 1990.
Dr Millward found few companies were following human resource methods of
management. Only 10 establishments had 'new style agreements' that included
'management control over work organisation' combined with a functioning
consultative system; single status in benefits for blue and white collar
workers; and 'final offer' arbitration.
The survey found few companies had introduced profit sharing or share
ownership schemes to strengthen the commitment of their employees. It also
found human resource management techniques were more common in unionised
than non-unionised enterprises. 'We could find little evidence the very
substantial growth in non-unionism was accompanied by a growth in human
resource management or more 'progressive' management practices,' says
Millward.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Recorded music sales rise 13.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of recorded music grew 13.5 per cent last year to Pounds 785.7m, the
British Phonographic Industry said yesterday.
The strong growth ended a period of contraction. It came after a
disappointing 1992 when sales dropped 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m - the
first fall since 1980.
The BPI, which represents UK music companies, said compact disc sales
continued to grow at the expense of vinyl records and cassettes.
CD sales rose 31.7 per cent last year to 92.2m - the highest number of
albums ever sold in any format.
The previous record was for vinyl long-playing albums and was set in 1975
with 91.6m sales.
The number of vinyl LPs sold last year fell 25.6 per cent to only 5m. This
compares with 24.7m sold in 1990. The number of cassettes sold last year
fell by 1.3 per cent to 55.7m.
Sales of singles on cassette and CD grew last year. The number of CD singles
sold increased by 43.2 per cent to 23.4m, while cassettes rose 18.8 per cent
to 16.3m.
By contrast, the number of seven-inch singles sold last year fell by 38.6
per cent to 7.9m.
This compares with 28.9m sold in 1990.
The price of music did not increase as quickly as unit sales, the BPI
figures show. The value of CD album sales grew to Pounds 480m - an increase
of 26.1 per cent, or 5.6 percentage points less than the rise in unit sales.
The prices of CDs are being investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The price of both vinyl LPs and of cassettes fell more sharply than their
unit sales.
The value of LP sales fell by 31.8 per cent to Pounds 16.3m. The value of
cassette sales declined by 1.4 per cent to Pounds 204.1m.

FT  15 FEB 94 / Lamont backs referendum on Euro-currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday said a
national referendum should be held before any future UK government adopted a
single European currency.
Speaking at a Dow Jones conference in London on the foreign exchange
markets, Mr Lamont said: 'The last time Britain held a referendum on Europe,
the people were specifically told that monetary union was not envisaged.
Since the circumstances have changed, there would appear to be a case for
revisiting this matter in a national referendum.'
Mr Lamont said that, while he had not agreed with the idea of a referendum
on the Maastricht treaty itself, 'the issue of a single currency is a
clear-cut one and one which raises profound political as well as economic
issues. It strikes at the heart of sovereignty'.
The ex-chancellor said that the 'supposed economic benefits' of monetary
union 'are slender against the potential dangers. A single European monetary
policy would make structural adjustment more difficult and worsen
unemployment'.
Mr Lamont added that 'the real danger about monetary union is not that it
will happen. Rather it is that another attempt, doomed to failure, will be
made.'
Meanwhile, Sir Alan Walters, the former economic adviser to Mrs Thatcher,
was giving his views on the future of European monetary union at a meeting
organised by the pressure group City Concern over Federal Europe.
Sir Alan expressed the view that European countries would skip over the
second stage of monetary union (where countries strive for economic
convergence) and move straight to the third stage (full monetary union). But
he believed that full monetary union would be based on other currencies
having a fixed exchange rate with the D-Mark, with the Bundesbank acting as
a de facto European central bank. Already, he said, the Dutch guilder was
virtually fixed to the D-Mark.
Sir Alan said that it was foolish to imagine that the Germans would want to
give up their currency, or the Bundesbank its power, in order to create a
new European central bank based on the European currency unit.
Referring to comments made by the late Lord Ridley, he said the condemnation
of the exchange rate mechanism as a 'German racket' was not all that far
wrong. But he said that 'lashing yourself to the German economy is an act of
misplaced faith. Germany has increasingly become a corporatist state and its
performance has gone down'.
