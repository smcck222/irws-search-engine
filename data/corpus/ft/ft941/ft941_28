FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Footsie futures contract for March delivery moved to a sharp discount to
the underlying stock market at the start of trading yesterday and pulled the
stock market lower on unusually high turnover.
Traders looked for ways to shorten their positions at the end of the trading
account and ahead of key wholesale prices data from the US which were
expected to reflect a pick up in inflation. The March contract traded at a
persistent discount of between 12 to 14 points to the market compared with a
fair value estimate of parity.
However, the PPI figures from the US were far less disappointing than
anticipated and futures recovered to close at 3,371 on turnover of 27,715
contracts.

FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures sell-off leaves FT-SE 100
below 3,400 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market was hit by another bout of semi-panic yesterday amid
fears of renewed weakness across global bond markets. However, London picked
up towards the close of business as Wall Street opened on a steady note and
US bonds responded to encouraging inflation news. However, the FT-SE future
remained under heavy pressure all day, and traded consistently at a discount
to the cash market during the session.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the last session of the two-week trading account a
net 28.1 lower at 3,378.9, a fall of 96.5, or 2.8 per cent on the week. The
FT-SE Mid 250 index retreated 38.9 to 4,030.0, also down 2.8 per cent on the
week.
The bond/gilt market worries and at least two bearish views of the market
from leading brokerages triggered a substantial early slide by the UK equity
market. Lehman Brothers' US market strategist was said to have been
instrumental in prompting a bout of weakness on Wall Street, after
predicting that the Dow Jones Average could retreat by between four to seven
per cent.
The market was also hit by stories that Mr Nick Knight, the controversial
but highly successful strategist at Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, had
predicted a steep fall in the UK market as part of a global market slide.
Mr Knight said he expected a sharp correction in international markets,
possibly as soon as next week, led by Hong Kong and Continental Europe. 'The
Fed has provided a seismic shock to markets and you have to be concerned
that world markets are about to hit an air pocket; it could be very nasty
short-term,' he said. Mr Knight added that the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, should have cut rates by a half percentage
point or held them. 'He's generated uncertainty,' said the Nomura analyst.
Whilst maintaining his year-end FT-SE 100 forecast at 4,000, Mr Knight, one
of the UK market's biggest bulls in recent months, said the 100 index could
fall to 3,200 in the interim period.
Another bear story was put forward by Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned
stockbroker, whose market strategist, Mr Ian Harnett, pointed out to clients
that the valuation of equities compared with index-linked gilts had risen to
their highest level since mid-1992. Mr Harnett said that on the three
occasions this had happened during the 1990's the FT-SE 100 index had fallen
by between 250 to 400 points.
The FT-SE 100 opened below 3,400 - more than 24 points down following Wall
Street's overnight retreat - and continued to lose ground, led by the FT-SE
future, to reach a day's low point of 3,349.3 just ahead of Wall Street's
opening. With Wall Street coming in easier, but better than expected, after
the producer and retail prices data, and US bonds behaving well, the FT-SE
embarked on a determined rally which saw it claw back around half of the
day's biggest loss.
Turnover was a hefty 1,001.4m shares, with non FT-SE 100 issues accounting
for 65 per cent of the day's trading. The value of customer business on
Thursday dipped below Pounds 2bn to Pounds 1.974bn.
Marketmakers remained nervous but not overly perturbed by the day's events.
'At these levels the market is comfortable, certainly not in disarray,' said
one dealer. Others remain concerned about New York. One said: 'You don't see
Wall Street plunge almost 100 points without some serious worries.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Initially encouraging figures from Lloyds Bank were clouded by realisation
that an adjustment for third world debt had boosted 1993 profits by Pounds
193m.
Lloyds shares jumped 12 initially as investors responded to news of profits
up 29 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn and a 20 per cent dividend hike. However,
closer consideration of the results statement showed that they had been
distorted by receipt of bonds from Argentina in exchange for loans and past
due interest.
Cazenove led the selling and the stock ticked back to close only 2 better at
617p. Turnover was 15m.
Lloyds is the first of Britain's banks with a December year end to announce
1993 results. The others will report over the next four weeks.
Other banks responded better to the Lloyds figures. Mr Robert Law at Lehman
Brothers pointed out that strongly capitalised banks such as Abbey National
would pay good dividends. The shares rose 16 to 516p with the market also
focusing on Abbey's exposure to the high-margin mortgage market. Barclays
rose 3 1/2 to 584p and NatWest lifted 8 to 554p.
British Aerospace followers spent the day chasing speculation that Mr Bob
Bauman, currently chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, would replace Mr
John Cahill as chairman. Confirmation of his appointment came after the
market had closed.
BAe shares closed down 6 at 543p, but analysts were pleased with the
prospect. 'To find a chairman in a hurry is difficult; to find someone of
Bob Bauman's stature would be a good move,' said one. Mr Zafar Khan at
Strauss Turnbull said: 'An outsider in a non-executive capacity will be
well-received.' SmithKline shares slipped 6 1/2 to 409p.
GKN fell 3 to 557p as its Pounds 496m bid for helicopter manufacturer
Westland was damaged by an increase in Westland's share capital due to the
exercise of rights on preference shares. The combined holding of GKN and
United Technologies (which has agreed to sell its Westland stake to GKN)
only dropped from around 47 per cent to around 45 per cent, but Mr Martin
Roscoe at Charterhouse Tilney commented: 'That's a big fall when you're
trying to reach 50 per cent and the market's against you.' Suggestions that
GKN would raise its offer were not well received, with the GKN bid described
as 'lacking conviction'. Westland closed down 3 at 334p.
Other engineering stocks hit by the downturn included Vickers, off 6 at
180p, and IMI, down 8 to 349p, whose sell-off of Brook Street Computers was
not well received.
Tomkins rose 5 to 263p on buying from Salomon Brothers, which has included
the stock in a basket of call warrants focused on companies exposed to US
growth.
TI Group continued its gentle slide, down 3 to 407p, following problems with
aircraft landing gear manufactured by its subsidiary Dowty.
The Pounds 103m property sale by Ladbroke, which will help ease the
company's debt burden, helped the shares stay in positive territory, closing
a penny forward at 205p. Burford Holdings is to make a rights issue to pay
for the purchase. Its shares slid a penny to 121p.
A big buyer of Forte, said to be through NatWest Securities, helped the
shares gain 4 to 257p, with turnover reaching 9.5m. Alpha Airports, the
recently floated catering group in which Forte retains a quarter share,
remained in demand and the shares gained a penny to 173p on 6.9m traded.
Merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander gained 5 to 110p after an article in a
specialist magazine tipped the stock.
Internationally traded conglomerate Hanson fell 10 to 289 1/2 p as Goldman
Sachs removed the company from its European 'top priority' list. It also
shaved its 1994 forecast for earnings per share by a penny to 16.3p after
exceptionals, and cut its profit forecast by 50m to Pounds 1.15bn. However,
the broker said it was still positive on the shares.
Glaxo Holdings, hurt during the week by worries about its best-selling ulcer
drug, Zantac, fell a further 12 to 639p. However the market expects
encouraging profits and dividend when half-year results are published on
Thursday. Analysts say a big currency gain, should help the pharmaceuticals
group to report a rise of around 15 per cent in profits to between Pounds
910m to Pounds 980m.
Shares in ICI fell 17 to 787p after light selling in New York on Thursday.
In a surprisingly sturdy food retail sector, Argyll Group added a penny to
257p, with UBS suggesting that the shares may be looking oversold ahead of
next week's trading statement.
Elsewhere, Asda edged forward a half-penny to 58 1/2 p. with J Sainsbury
gaining a penny to 361p and Tesco steady at 225p.

FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Regulator move lifts generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief lifted the two English power generators above the sliding market
trend following the decision by Offer, the industry regulator, not to refer
the companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. PowerGen shares
surged 16 to 541p with 7.8m traded, while National Power put on 14 1/2 to
475 1/2 p with turnover hitting a hefty 21m.
The market was almost unanimous in its view that the two companies - which
had faced a potentially damaging MMC referral over pool pricing - had come
out of the situation well. Analysts said that even the divestments of power
stations demanded by the regulator could easily be met from the companies'
spare capacity. The pool price cap was also seen as undemanding.
With regulatory worries now removed, the shares are forecast to make further
gains. Hoare Govett sees a 10 per cent upside in the near term, and further
strengthening should the government decide to sell its remaining 40 per cent
holdings. Analysts said strong dividend growth over the next three years
would also underpin support.
The regional electricity companies (Recs) continued weak as investors shied
away in response to the view from some in the market that the shares were
overbought.
There was also talk that one US house had a large seller, prompted by the
improving US bond market. Eastern, which retreated 6 to 678p, announced
after the market had closed that it had bought a further 750,000 of its
shares at prices ranging from 676p to 678p.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Pressure on Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investor support for the dollar weakened yesterday following the release of
weak sales and inflation data and uncertainty surrounding trade talks with
Japan, writes Philip Gawith.
Market attention was focused on the Washington summit between President
Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Trade was initially directionless, but the
dollar started to slide when pessimism set in about the talks. It closed in
London at Y107.9 against Y108.450 on Thursday.
Sterling finished the week slightly stronger after earlier falling more than
5 pfennigs in a negative response to Tuesday's 25 basis point cut in
interest rates. It closed in London at DM2.5685, up from DM2.5625 on
Thursday.
The dollar lost ground against the D-Mark as the release of weak data
combined with scepticism about the likelihood of a Bundesbank rate-cut on
Thursday. It closed in London at DM1.7517, marginally down on Thursday's
close of DM1.7534.
Seasonally adjusted total retail sales fell by 0.5 per cent compared to a
forecast increase of 0.4 per cent. January producer prices rose by 0.2 per
cent, lower than the 0.4 per cent gain forecast. The market sold the dollar
reasoning that these figures made a further tightening in US policy more
distant.
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the figures which were
distorted by bad weather and an earthquake.
Against the yen, meanwhile, the succinct view of one observer was that 'most
people don't have a clue where the rate is going.' The tenor of comments
emerging from US and Japanese officials was not encouraging. Late yesterday
US Commerce Secretary Mr Ron Brown told a TV station that the trade talks
were not going well. 'We are very disappointed. They (the negotiations)
still don't look good.'
Earlier the yen rose against the dollar after a senior US official refused
to rule out retaliation if the talks failed. 'We want a good agreement or no
agreement. We won't settle for anything less,' the official was quoted as
saying. Earlier comments from US vice-president Al Gore also had an air of
preemptive damage limitation about them.
Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa sought agreements which offered cheaper foreign
goods to Japanese consumers and new export opportunities for US companies.
Some observers took comfort from the fact that both leaders have reputations
as dealmakers. Mr Paul Lambert, currency economist at UBS, said if a deal
emerged, attention would shift towards economic fundamentals which favoured
a stronger dollar. The recent strength of the yen has been largely a
function of political considerations, although foreign buying of equities
has also helped the currency.
Sterling fell below DM2.56 and Dollars 1.46 on news of a higher than
expected trade gap with the rest of world in November. It later recovered to
finish the day half a cent higher at Dollars 1.4663.
The D-Mark was firmer across the board in late European trade with the
prospect of a Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday increasingly discounted. It
closed at Ffr3.40 and L965.3 respectively against the French and Italian
currencies, marginally stronger in both cases.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 950m of
assistance in line with its revised forecast for the day.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Base metals suffer from
hangover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices were suffering the after-effects of over-indulgence late
this week as speculators backed away from markets that they been mainly
responsible for pushing higher since late last month.
Leading the retreat was zinc, which yesterday dipped to a two-month low of
Dollars 960 a tonne for three-months delivery at the London Metal Exchange
before steadying to Dollars 972.50, down Dollars 61 on the week. That sorry
performance reflected first rumours then confirmation that European zinc
producers' efforts to forge an agreement for jointly financed production
closures had collapsed. On Thursday Eurometaux, the Brussels-based
organisation that provided a forum for the producer negotiations, said that
they had been suspended and no new meetings were foreseen. It added,
however, that the overcapacity in Europe still had to be addressed and that
structural changes were needed within the European industry. 'Developments
over the last months are demonstrating that such changes are beginning to
take place,' it said.
Producers remained tight-lipped about the reasons for the failure of their
latest attempt at co-operation. But the general manager of the Netherlands'
Budel smelter said earlier in the week that there were still 'quite a lot of
legal issues involved', possibly a reference to anti-trust problems.
Financial troubles and top management changes at some big zinc groups may
also have complicated the situation.
The announcement yesterday of a sharp rise in LME warehouse stocks added to
the zinc market's woes, but the copper market took little comfort from a
proportionally much larger fall in its stocks.
A wave of investment fund, speculative and trade selling took the
three-months copper price to Dollars 1,844.50 a tonne at yesterday's close,
down Dollars 31 on the day and Dollars 44 on the week.
The aluminium market, already buoyed by recent production cut announcements
following last month's multilateral agreement in Brussels, began the week in
good heart. Monday brought news of the first cut at a Russian smelter (by
20,000 tonnes a year at Novokunznetsk in Siberia) as well as further
Australian and US reductions. At the same time a Russian official seemed to
succeed in reviving flagging confidence in his country's ability to deliver
the promised 500,000 tonnes of cuts this year; and the former Soviet state
of Tajikistan's smelter (which produced 280,000 tonnes last year) warned
that it would have to shut if raw materials from Uzbekistan remained blocked
at the border because of its failure to pay for earlier shipments.
But after that the supply of bullish news dried up and the market's euphoria
faded. A run of four daily price falls at the LME - ending with Dollars
13.25 yesterday after the announcement of another big rise in warehouse
stocks - left the three-months price at Dollars 2,265 a tonne, down Dollars
30.50 on the week.
At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa and coffee prices remained within
their recent trading ranges, but GNI, the London trade house, said in a
market report that coffee's fundamentals pointed to the market being 'on the
verge of a major rally'.
Oil prices surrendered some of the gains encouraged by the recent arctic
weather in the north-east US as temperatures there turned milder. In late
trading yesterday the London International Petroleum Exchange's April crude
contract was at Dollars 13.75 a barrel, down 52 cents on the week.

KNP BT, the Netherlands' leading paper and packaging group, reports
provisional after-tax net losses for 1993 of Fl 320m (Dollars 163.3m).
The group, which emerged from a three-way domestic merger last March,
attributes the weak performance to extraordinary costs associated with
integration, capacity downsizing and disposals, in a year otherwise
dominated by continued overcapacity and recession.
The preliminary operating result was put at a loss of Fl 23m. Definitive
figures and 1993 turnover will be announced on March 23.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, predicted a strong recovery for 1994,
particularly in the paper production sector, where the group recently merged
its activities with those of Leykam-Murztaler, the lossmaking Austrian group
which KNP BT acquired last December.
Mr van Oordt's optimism is based on a recent firming of prices in some
segments of the paper market, as well as a lower cost base achieved at the
cost of extensive restructuring.
In an unrelated development earlier this week, the group announced plans to
sell two Asian graphic distribution subsidiaries - BTI of Korea and Modern
Printing Equipment of Hong Kong - to the Danish-based East Asiatic group for
an unspecified sum.
The sale is part of KNP BT's attempt to unwind its conflicting interests in
graphic machinery which, after the merger, included competing Heidelberger
and MAN/Roland distribution franchises.
KNP BT will now represent MAN/Roland in Asia via its Votra distribution
unit.

FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: KOP lifts estimates of deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said it would
report a larger loss for 1993 than previously estimated. The warning follows
a decision to take an extra FM900m (Dollars 158.7m) in provisions for credit
losses, in keeping with a change in accounting policy.
KOP said its result would still be 'significantly better' than in 1992, when
its deficit reached FM3.7bn, but it indicated it would no longer meet its
target of halving the year-earlier figure. It still aimed to return to the
black next year.
The bank, which will announce its preliminary figures on Tuesday, said it
was taking the extra provision 'to prepare for future risks arising mainly
from developments in the Finnish trade and construction sectors'.

<TEXT>
Mr Andre Rousselet, chairman of the Canal Plus television company and one of
the most influential figures in French media, yesterday resigned as a
director of Havas, the leisure group.
He was protesting against at its plans to raise its stake in Canal Plus by
forming a concert party.
Canal Plus issued a statement saying that Mr Rousselet, 71, a close friend
and regular golfing partner of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president,
was in 'total disagreement' with Havas over the proposed concert party.
Havas had earlier announced an agreement with Generale des Eaux, the
industrial group, to pool their respective 23.5 per cent and 20.1 per cent
stakes in Canal Plus in a new holding company controlled by Havas. Societe
Generale, the bank, has promised to add its 5.1 per cent stake to the new
company.
The three groups will then collectively control 48.7 per cent of Canal Plus.
The announcement of their agreement, after months of complex negotiations,
follows a recent reform of French broadcasting legislation that raised the
maximum holding in a television company from 25 per cent to 49 per cent.
Under French law any investor, or concert party of investors, owning over
one third of a company must usually bid for two thirds of the shares.
However, Havas, Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale have persuaded the
Paris stock market authorities to waive this requirement.
Canal Plus's other institutional investors yesterday reacted angrily to the
news of the waiver.
'It's a classic French stitch-up,' said one London-based institution. 'It
depresses the value of everyone else's investment by taking away the bid
premium.'
Mr Rousselet had objected to the concert party's plans throughout the
negotiations. His split with Havas comes at a highly-sensitive time for
Canal Plus, which has just started to renegotiate the terms of its pay-TV
franchise with the French government.
The company, which until recently was a star of the French stock market, is
also under financial pressure after recently warning that it was set for a
sharp fall in net profits for 1994.
This follows a modest increase in profits to FFr1.2bn (Dollars 215m) in 1993
from FFr1.1bn in 1992.

Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services group, yesterday announced
increased net losses of FFr434m (Dollars 72.9m) for last year. It plans to
raise FFr1.5bn in new capital.
The results for 1993, which the group described as provisional, compare with
net losses of FFr333m the previous year, excluding exceptional capital gains
of FFr261m from the sale of a property near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
Sales in 1993 fell 7.4 per cent to FFr11bn.
The company forecast a gradual improvement in its performance. It was
looking forward to 'less difficult market conditions' and the impact of its
Genesis programme, involving a radical restructuring of the group's
operations and activities.
The programme, launched in 1992, is aimed at establishing a more efficient
system of management across the group's various geographical and business
activities. Under the new system, so-called 'strategic business areas' are
organised along both geographical and industry sector lines, allowing
different regions to specialise in the sector where they are strongest. The
group's US operation, for example, is the centre for the oil and gas
division.
Cap Gemini spelt out a further reorganisation of the group in 1994. It said
it would extend its programme of selling non-core assets, following the
disposal of its stakes in Sweden's Jacobson &amp; Widmark AB and Carelcomp of
Finland. In Germany, the company planned to integrate CAP Debis with Debis
Systemhaus, a subsidiary of Daimler Benz, which holds 51 per cent of CAP
Debis.
'The merger will reinforce the co-operation with Debis and create a company
with sales of FFr6bn and a complete range of services,' the company said.
The increase in capital, aimed at strengthening the group's balance sheet
and reducing financial costs, will be largely supported by Sogeti, the
principal shareholder in CGS. The company said Sogeti should participate in
the capital injection in line with its 61.5 per cent stake in CGS.
Details of the capital increase have yet to be finalised.

FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Weakened demand for elevators
hits Kone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Profits for 1993 tumbled sharply at Kone, the Finnish lifts and cranes
group, after its main European market was hit by falling prices and weakened
demand for new elevators.
Group income after financial items fell to FM328m (Dollars 57.8m) from
FM457m. The pre-tax result was FM430m after including a FM102m extraordinary
gain, arising mainly from the sale of the company's marine technology
division, MacGregor-Navire. Earnings per share fell to FM30.64 from FM46.09.
Selling MacGregor-Navire meant group sales fell 4 per cent to FM10.8bn from
FM11.3bn. Excluding the disposal, sales were up 4 per cent.
Kone said conditions were difficult in all its main markets, except Asia.
Europe accounts for 72 per cent of sales, followed by North America with 13
per cent, and Asia-Pacific with 11 per cent.
Conditions in Europe meant Kone Elevators, which accounts for 76 per cent of
group sales, had a difficult year, even though maintenance and modernisation
business developed favourably.
A conscious drive to develop maintenance operations helped the group end
1993 with 354,000 elevators under contract, compared with 338,000 at the
start of the year. Some 60 per cent of Kone Elevator's sales now arise from
maintenance work.
Deliveries of harbour and shipyard cranes quadrupled, allowing Kone Cranes
to lift its result compared with 1992. The group's third division, Kone
Wood, also improved.
Kone was encouraged by 3 per cent growth in new orders, to FM8.3bn.
'Elevator demand continued to decline in Europe, but industrial crane demand
bottomed out. Growth was pursued in east Asia, where both elevator and crane
demand remains lively,' it noted. The year-end order-book amounted to
FM6.4bn, up 5 per cent on 1992. A dividend of FM9 per A share and FM10 per B
share is proposed.

FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Havas profits tumble 14% to
FFr705m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Havas saw consolidated net profits fall by an estimated 14 per cent to
FFr705m (Dollars 118.5m) last year, from FFr823m in 1992.
The group, which has extensive interests in advertising, travel, and the
media, blamed the fall in profits on the 'persistently difficult economic
environment' and on high exceptional losses.
Havas, whose investments include a stake in the the Canal Plus television
company, mustered a 23.2 per cent rise in turnover, to FFr34.71bn during the
year, from FFr28.18bn in 1992. However, the increase was mainly fuelled by
the contribution of additions to the group.
The real rate of sales growth on existing businesses and on constant
exchange rates was just 2.8 per cent. The only area of its established
activities to show growth last year was advertising and free newspapers,
where Havas saw sales rise by 9 per cent to FFr19.03bn from FFr17.45bn.
Havas saw sales fall elsewhere. The outdoor advertising division suffered a
reduction in turnover of 13.2 per cent, to FFr3.08bn from FFr3.55bn the
previous year. Sales from tourism slipped by 1 per cent to FFr6.92bn from
FFr6.99bn over the same period.
The crux of the group's problems last year was the depressed state of the
French economy. However, its trading difficulties in France were aggravated
by exceptional losses of FFr115m during 1993, which negated the year's
exceptional profits of FFr100m.
Despite its problems, Havas pressed ahead with expansion plans, and made
FFr2.3bn of consolidated investments during 1993. This year, it plans to
pursue its long-term strategy of developing its audio-visual interests.

FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Italian banking scandals mar BCI
sell-off preview
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of Italy's biggest banks, yesterday
launched its privatisation roadshow against a background of mounting
criticism over the country's banking sector.
The past week has seen the temporary resignation of the heads of two top
banks, who were allegedly involved in corruption, and the release by
Moody's, the US debt rating agency, of a bearish report on the prospects for
the sector.
Mr Sergio Siglienti, BCI's chairman, sought to distance his bank from the
corruption affair, which has nevertheless embraced two former BCI
executives. He emphasised BCI's sound financial condition and the fact that
its bad-debt ratio was about half the national average.
The BCI float will be Italy's biggest privatisation, raising about L3,000bn
(Dollars 1.7bn) for the IRI state holding company. IRI is selling all its
571m shares, equivalent to 54.35 per cent of BCI's total share capital. The
bank's shares closed at L5,491 on the Milan stock exchange yesterday.
The sale, starting on February 28, will involve three segments. Domestic
retail investors, who have shown a strong interest in privatisation, will be
offered at least 200m shares, while 240m will be set aside for institutions.
The institutional tranche comprises 60m shares for Italian companies, 50m
for the US, and 130m for institutions in the rest of the world. A further
30.7m shares will be held back for possible market stabilisation purposes,
but may be added to the institutional tranche.
BCI, which is co-ordinating the deal with Lehman Brothers, said the precise
allocations would depend on demand. The domestic retail tranche, including
up to 40m shares for BCI employees, could rise to 300m shares, it noted.
The pricing will be announced on February 26, and the offer, which
officially lasts five days, may be closed ahead of schedule on the second
day if oversubscribed.
BCI is the third big bank to be privatised in the past three months. Its
sell-off marks IRI's exit from the banking sector.
In December, IRI raised almost L1,750bn by selling its stake in Credito
Italiano.
Separately, the treasury expects to make almost L2,400bn from this month's
disposal of about half its holding in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the
financial services group.
BCI, which will report 1993 group results next week, made net parent company
profits of L268.2bn last year, 1.7 per cent up on 1992.
Mr Siglienti said the group figures would mark a substantial improvement on
the L218.5bn made in 1992, thanks to restored profitability at BCI's French
and Canadian operations.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: On a second flight with the 146 - Profile
of Bob Bauman, the new chairman of BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the few black spots in the winning business career of Mr Bob Bauman,
outgoing chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the drugs company, was in
his dealings a decade ago with British Aerospace.
Mr Bauman was chairman and chief executive of Avco, the US aerospace
company, which supplied engines to the BAe 146 regional jet aircraft.
The relationship between the 146 and its engines was not a happy one. The
engines were underpowered, overheated and unreliable. Both companies were
the subject of at least one law suit in the US over the unreliability of the
aircraft.
Mr Bauman has since fared rather better than has the 146 aircraft, which is
still struggling to live down the reputation it earned in the 1980s.
When, in 1986, Mr Bauman was scooped up by Beecham, then a diversified
health and personal care company care, his foray into defence looked like
just another stepping stone in the career of a quintessential professional
manager.
Mr Bauman quickly became known in the drugs industry for his charm and
capacity for hard work. He looks younger than his 62 years and has a
penchant for 'feelgood' business-speak gathered, perhaps, from an MBA at
Harvard in 1955 and 23 years climbing the ranks at General Foods, the New
York-based consumer goods company. His stint there included selling Maxwell
House coffee and Gaines dog foods.
Now, 7 1/2 years working in London have left him with a reputation as the
pharmaceuticals industry's Mr Restructuring. When he took over as chairman
of Beecham in September 1986, he inherited a company which appeared to have
lost its way.
Once a byword for healthcare products, it had diversified with mixed
fortunes into foods and cosmetics. These activities were eventually to be
sold, but Mr Bauman's lasting great achievement was the successful merger of
two sprawling business empires, Beecham and SmithKline Beckman of the US.
At the time of the merger, SmithKline Beecham had annual sales of Pounds
3.7bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 544m. Its 1993 results, scheduled to be
presented on February 22, should show sales at Pounds 6.2bn for profits of
Pounds 1.2bn, according to forecasts from James Capel, the stockbroker.
Strong though that record is, taking over at the helm of British Aerospace
will present Mr Bauman with an entirely different set of business problems.
The company has already sold non-core businesses such as cars and executive
jets. A merger with GEC has long been rumoured and remains a possibility.
What is certain is that his personality and style are strikingly different
from those of Mr John Cahill, the man he replaces as chairman. Mr Bauman, a
year younger than Mr Cahill, is a veteran of three different industries. He
is an American running an Anglo-US company from London.
Mr Cahill spent his entire career before BAe at one company, conglomerate
BTR. And during his two years at BAe he stirred some controversy by becoming
known as the Briton who ran a UK company from a US base.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke makes Pounds 103m commercial
property sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke Group yesterday took the first step in disposing of its commercial
property holdings by announcing that it is selling 15 properties to Burford
Holdings for Pounds 103m.
The acquisition should springboard Burford - the company acquired by Mr
Nigel Wray's tipsheet group Chartsearch in 1988 - into the top 10 UK-listed
property companies by market capitalisation.
Burford is to raise Pounds 100m through a rights issue, and plans to use the
new properties as collateral to fund lower grade property purchases, where
it can add greater value.
Burford approached Ladbroke several months ago in the hope of securing the
deal, but it was only after the recent management changes that the hotels,
betting and DIY group would consider a quick sale.
Mr John Jackson, Ladbroke chairman, and Mr Peter George, chief executive,
who took over at the beginning of the year have made clear their intention
to take Ladbroke out of the commercial property business.
After the sale to Burford, Ladbroke's property portfolio will be worth about
Pounds 700m.
Ladbroke said it would receive a non-refundable deposit of Pounds 5m, with a
further Pounds 78m on April 8. The remainder will be received in deferred
payments. The portfolio had a net asset value of Pounds 95.5m at the end of
December.
Burford has expanded at an extraordinary pace. Listed in 1987 with a market
value of Pounds 8m, it went into the recession in a net cash position,
following some fortuitous property sales.
The management has now decided the time is right for expansion. In the past
year it has acquired close to Pounds 120m worth of property. This was funded
by a Pounds 42m rights issue last June, and the issue of mortgage debenture
stock.
Burford is now proposing a 3-for-5 rights issue at 92p a share.
The shares closed yesterday at 121p, having risen 14 per cent in the
previous six trading days. This compares with a net asset value of 72.3p
prior to the acquisition. After completion of the rights issue, the company
will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 327m.
About 70 per cent of the value of the new portfolio is accounted for by four
properties: Dalmore House in Glasgow, City Plaza in Birmingham, an office
block in Leadenhall Street, London, and a retail development in Falkirk.
The latter purchase is subject to the fulfilment of certain construction and
leasing requirements. The portfolio holds average unexpired leases of 20
years and a rental yield of 8.2 per cent.
Following the acquisition and rights, Burford's gearing will be reduced to
37 per cent. The company has a self-imposed ceiling of 100 per cent gearing
and could invest a further Pounds 148m within this limit.
Burford yesterday announced preliminary results for the year ended December
31, with pre-tax profits rising sharply to Pounds 5.93m (Pounds 52,000) on
turnover of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 10.3m).
Earnings per share came out at 3.42p (0.27p losses).
The company will pay a final dividend of 0.75p, lifting the total for the
year from 1.15p to 1.4p.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Westland steps up its offensive against GKN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday stepped up its offensive
against GKN's hostile bid by suggesting the engineering group had overstated
the size of its shareholding.
Launching its bid last Wednesday, GKN said it controlled 47 per cent of the
Yeovil-based company - comprising its existing 28.3 per cent stake and a
further 18.7 per cent acquired from United Technologies, the US parent of
Sikorsky helicopters.
Yesterday, however, Westland told the Stock Exchange that GKN's increased
interest had been diluted to 45 per cent by the issue on January 31 of 6.6m
ordinary shares.
The extra shares were issued to investors exercising annual conversion
rights on warrants and cumulative preference shares.
Shares in the engineering and industrial services group fell 3p to 557p on
the news.
Since launching the bid, GKN's share price has fallen by more than 4 per
cent.
Westland, meanwhile, has seen its shares climb steadily. Although they fell
4p yesterday, the 333p close represented a 14.8 per cent premium over GKN's
290p a share bid and a 29p rise on the week.
Nevertheless, the aggregate fully diluted interest held by GKN remains 40
per cent and the company said it remained confident of winning full control.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds rises 29% to Pounds 1.03bn -
Acquisition sought to make use of accumulating capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank yesterday gave a strong signal that it was looking for a
suitable acquisition after announcing a 29 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 801m to Pounds 1.03bn, accompanied by a 20 per cent
rise in its dividend.
The bank, which failed in its bid to take over Midland Bank in 1992, said
that it was seeking a use for its accumulating capital.
The equity base rose 14 per cent after the total dividend of 22.1p (18.4p),
including a proposed final of 15.5p, was more than twice covered by earnings
per share of 47.4p (35p).
'As we accumulate more capital, we remain watchful for an opportunity that
will enable us to use this for the further benefit of shareholders,' said
Sir Robin Ibbs, chairman. He said the bank would consider 'all types of
opportunity'.
Lloyds became the third bank to raise its dividend strongly after similar
moves by TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Its ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets nonetheless strengthened further to 6.6 per cent (6 per
cent).
Problem country debt contributed Pounds 260m (Pounds 193m) to profits,
including a net release of Pounds 46m debt provisions. Its portfolio fell
from Pounds 2.77bn to Pounds 2.28bn after receiving bonds from Argentina in
exchange for loans and past due interest.
Overall bad debt provisions fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 505m (Pounds
556m), covering 1.2 per cent of lending. Provisions in UK retail banking
fell to Pounds 389m (Pounds 506m), but Lloyds made a Pounds 45m (Pounds 35m)
general provision against credit losses this year.
The fall in bad debts helped the UK retail bank to return to a profit of
Pounds 74m (losses of Pounds 32m). Loan demand was weak, but Mr Brian
Pitman, chief executive, said there had recently been a 'very significant'
increase in demand for personal loans.
Mr Pitman said Lloyds was responding to low interest rates, which had led to
customers transferring Pounds 900m out of savings and investment accounts,
by training more staff to advise on equity and fixed income savings
products.
The post-tax return on shareholders equity rose to 21 per cent (17.1 per
cent). Mr Pitman said he thought it was possible to sustain this return
despite low interest rates.
Operating expenses rose slightly to Pounds 2.47bn (Pounds 2.43bn), but the
ratio of costs to income fell to 62.1 per cent (64.2 per cent). Mr Pitman
said costs would be under pressure because of the need to recruit more
highly trained advisers.
The bank capitalised on a firm opening in the gilts market to raise Pounds
400m of subordinated debt through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The bonds
were priced to yield 72 basis points over the 6.75 per cent gilt due 2004.
An official at lead manager Salomon Brothers said that although it was
well-capitalised it had room for lower tier two capital. It saved between 50
to 75 basis points by raising subordinated debt rather than upper tier two
capital.
Lloyds Bank shares closed 2p up at 617p.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson will net a reduced Dollars 175m from
Beazer US issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proceeds Hanson expects to receive from the flotation of Beazer Homes
USA, its US housebuilding business, and an associated debt issue have been
cut from about Dollars 200m to Dollars 175.2m (Pounds 120m). Beazer Homes
USA will retain about Dollars 25m from the two issues.
The reduction is understood not to have been caused by the rise in US
interest rates or the turbulence on Wall Street in recent days.
Beazer Homes USA had been due to buy some land in Hawaii, on which building
work had begun, from a Hanson affiliate for Dollars 15.9m. However, Hanson
has now sold this to a third party, thus reducing the projected earnings for
Beazer Homes USA.
This meant the indicated price range for the share sale has been reduced
from Dollars 17 1/2 -Dollars 20 to Dollars 16 1/2 -Dollars 18 1/2 a share.
The issue of senior notes has been cut from Dollars 125m to Dollars 115m.
Hanson aims to sell 6m shares in Beazer Homes USA, which would reduce its
stake to 33.3 per cent, with underwriters able to sell up to a further
900,000 shares, which would cut Hanson's stake to 25.8 per cent.
The flotation is expected to be priced on February 22 or later that week.
Hanson is also floating 100 per cent of Beazer Homes UK, its British
housebuilding subsidiary, in March. That sale is expected to net some Pounds
450m for the conglomerate.
Mr Ian Menzies-Gow, chairman of Hanson's building division, said Hanson
would have liked to sell 100 per cent of Beazer Homes USA but its US
advisers had said the flotation would fare better if Hanson retained a
stake.
Mr Brian Beazer, who was chairman and chief executive of Beazer when Hanson
acquired it in December 1991, is to have a one year contract as
non-executive chairman of Beazer Homes USA.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Green Property, the Dublin-based property investment company, is calling for
IPounds 25m (Pounds 24m) via a 3-for-4 rights issue at 150p a share.
The proceeds will be used to partly finance the acquisition of a IPounds 42m
property portfolio in the Irish capital.
The balance will be raised through bank borrowings, which will lift gearing
from 47 per cent to 56 per cent.
The property portfolio, which is being bought from the Merchant Navy
Officers' Pension Fund in Ireland, consists mainly of office buildings in
Dublin's city centre.
Mr Michael MacCormack, Green Property's chairman, said 98 per cent of the
portfolio was let - mostly on 35-year leases, with five-year rent reviews.
He said: 'The attraction of the deal is that most of those reviews will
happen between now and 1996, and many are currently at below market rates'.
Annual rental income is currently IPounds 3.69m.
On completion, the acquisition will result in a near-doubling of Green's
property assets with 77 per cent of them being held in Ireland. The
remaining assets are in the UK.
Some 80 per cent of Green's shares are held by institutional investors.
Mr MacCormack said: 'The view of these institutions was that they wanted our
main assets to be held in Ireland, as they are thinking in terms of their
Irish pension fund obligations'.
The cash call is being fully underwritten by the Investment Bank of Ireland.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Baldwin rises to Pounds 2.8m on back of
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baldwin, the tour operator, catering and publishing group, reported sharply
improved pre-tax profits in the 12 months to October 31 following increased
bookings for both holidays and restaurant tables.
The company said buoyant sales of its European camping holidays and
contributions from Simpsons of Cornhill and the Muswell chain, acquired
during the year, led to pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 1.33m).
The shares rose 22p to 130p.
The comparative figure was restated under FRS 3 to take account of a Pounds
1.14m loss, taken previously as an extraordinary item, arising from a legal
dispute over its shareholding in London Clubs Inter-national, the casino
group.
The pre-tax figure also benefited from profits on disposal of assets of
Pounds 694,000 (Pounds 363,000).
Turnover rose 19 per cent to Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 29.1m) of which Pounds
5.91m related to acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 468,000 to operating
profits of Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.33m), a rise of 6 per cent.
Of the three divisions, tour operations continued to account for the bulk of
profits - Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 2.23m) on unchanged turnover of Pounds 20.6m.
The improved results, however, were due mainly to a first time contribution
of Pounds 197,000 from the restaurant business and Pounds 305,000 (Pounds
123,000) from the print division.
Earnings rose to 10.1p (3p) and a final dividend of 1.9p makes a 3.5p (3p)
total.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pentos in reverse premia disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retailer that owns the Dillons, Ryman and Athena
chains, yesterday disclosed that its accounts for 1992, which showed pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4m, had included reverse premia of Pounds 6.3m.
At the same time, it announced the sale of 53 retail sites, trading as Ryman
Computer Stores, for Pounds 100,000.
Reverse premia are upfront payments by landlords, made when a client takes
on a new property. Pentos included the figure among other operating
expenses, which totalled Pounds 88.6m in 1992.
The company expects reverse premia for the 1993 year to be about Pounds
3.2m. It does not expect any further figure for 1994 or the foreseeable
future.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, yesterday
said it had been concerned about the adequacy of the company's accounting
treatment on reverse premia.
Directors had 'shared the Panel's view that it would be helpful to bring
forward the company's clarification of its accounting policy and information
in respect of amounts included in the 1992 accounts.'
The Panel is drawing the question of accounting for reverse premia to the
attention of the Accounting Standards Board.
It said existing legal and accounting requirements 'did not provide
unequivocal guidance.'
Pentos has agreed to describe in greater detail the existing accounting
policy in the accounts for the year ended December 1993.
The group is due to complete at the end of this month a strategic review
ordered by Mr Bill McGrath, who formally took over as chief executive at the
beginning of the year.
Yesterday it said the review had already determined that there was little
prospect of returning Ryman Computer Stores to profit without substantial
investment.
Pentos is selling the stores to Cellular Communications Corporation, which
trades as Peoples Phone, a leading independent mobile telephone company. It
will treat the Pounds 3.9m cost of the sale as an exceptional item in the
1993 accounts.
The computer chain last year incurred an estimated loss of Pounds 700,000
and had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.6m.
Peoples Phone is taking on the 160-strong workforce.
The disposal marks the beginning of the group's plans to cut its debt,
analysts suggested yesterday. They are expecting pre-tax losses of about
Pounds 40m for 1993, including about Pounds 30m of exceptional charges.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: O'Reilly takes further step in newspaper
empire-building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Dublin-based newspaper group chaired by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, has agreed to acquire a two thirds stake in Capital Newspapers for
Pounds 4.8m cash - the company's third newspaper deal in a week.
The Capital purchase, from Emap and Stantonmill, is subject to DTI approval.
Independent already owns Greater London and Essex Newspapers, which owns two
paid and six free titles. The acquisition of Capital will add another nine
paid and five free titles.
A week ago Mr O'Reilly's company paid Pounds 18.4m for a 24.99 per cent
stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent
on Sunday.
Earlier a consortium, backed by Mirror Group Newspapers, bid for the 52 per
cent stake in Newspaper Publishing it did not already own at 261.6p a share.
In the middle of the week Mr O'Reilly agreed to pay about IPounds 20m for a
controlling 31 per cent interest in Argus Newspapers of South Africa.

FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Maid sticks by Pounds 100m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maid Systems, a small on-line business information supplier, yesterday
insisted that next month's flotation would value the company at a minimum of
Pounds 100m.
The figure has been questioned by industry experts since news of the
intended flotation emerged in January.
Observers argue that Maid has few assets to justify the price. In addition,
they say it is at the mercy of companies which provide its data and faces
fierce competition from larger companies like Reuters and Profile, part of
the Financial Times group.
Mr Stephen Aulsebrook of Hill Samuel Bank, which is advising Maid on the
issue, said the price had not yet been fixed. It would be arrived at through
a book-building exercise over the next month but Pounds 100m was the target
valuation.
The company is coming to market by way of a placing on March 15. The
pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday and dealings in the shares are
expected to begin on March 25.
About 30 per cent of the company is to be floated. The expected net proceeds
of Pounds 16m will be used for product development and marketing expenses,
especially in the US, which the company believes will eventually become its
principal market.
Maid has contracts with information providers for data which it stores and
distributes over telephone lines to customers' personal computers. Its
existing services include Researchline, Newsline and Companyline. A typical
annual subscription rate for business information is Pounds 6,000.
Last year, pre-tax profits advanced 85 per cent to Pounds 603,176 on
revenues ahead 64 per cent at Pounds 5.7m. It has been profitable for the
past four years, according to executives.
Mr Dan Wagner, managing director, said that most of the company's revenues
would eventually come from a new product, Maid for Windows, planned for
launch in 1995.
Mr Wagner believed he had identified a gap in the market for the supply of
on-line business information to the mass market.
The aim is to provide a tailored information service to individuals at a
basic cost of Dollars 200 (Pounds 140) a year. The company provides a basic
service on which customers can add units to suit their needs.

FT  12 FEB 94 / View from the end of the ski run: The Winter Olympics, which
open in Norway today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Norway's Stein Gruben soars off the ski jump with flaming torch in hand
to open the Lillehammer Winter Olympics this afternoon, be prepared for an
explosion of Norwegian national pride and an exuberant celebration of the
country's folksy culture.
Snorting reindeer, swishing sleighs, galloping horses, frolicking trolls and
the music of massed fiddles will fill the snow-carpeted arena above the
postcard-perfect lakeside resort for the opening ceremony.
Above all, there will be dozens of men, women and children on skis. The
primitive-looking pictograms being used as symbols for the Lillehammer games
are derived from 4,000-year-old rock carvings of skiiers found in the Arctic
north of Norway.
More recently, skiing has even played a political role in a country -
notably when the ski-borne heroes of Telemark sabotaged a heavy water plant
crucial to Nazi attempts to make a nuclear bomb during the second world war.
So Norwegians expect great things of their winter athletes. They won no
fewer than nine gold, six silver and five bronze medals in the 1992
Albertville winter games, ranking third in the medals table behind Germany
and the CIS. This year at Lillehammer, they are widely tipped to do even
better.
Hosting the games has, therefore, been seized by Norway as a perfect
opportunity to present itself as a successful small country opening it arms
confidently to the wider world.
But there is a paradox to this picture - one that Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, the
foreign minister, described this week as the conflict between the missionary
and the viking.
To many Norwegians, the games exemplify their independence of spirit,
showing that Norway needs no help in living its life 'on the northern
outskirts of the globe', as Ms Ase Kleveland, the culture minister, put it.
These viking-like characteristics are best illustrated by Norway's stubborn
insistence last year on resuming commercial whaling, in the face of strong
international opposition, and its continued culling of baby seals.
It is also to be found in Norwegian resistance to joining the European
Union, due to be tested in a referendum before the end of this year. This
week, Norway's prickly nature was again evident in a spate of inhospitable
criticism from Norwegian athletes and the domestic media of Mr Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the Spanish president of the International Olympic Committee,
which oversees the organisation of the Olympics. Mr Samaranch was accused of
being undemocratic and was also publicly reminded of his past links with the
late General Franco's fascist regime.
But the Olympics are also a chance for Norway to show what Mr Godal called
its missionary side, evident in its efforts at mediation last year, which
helped produce the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Norway also has a long record of commitment to United Nations peacekeeping
operations and is a world leader in dispensing development aid, on which it
spends more than 1 per cent of GNP each year. Moreover, Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the Labour party prime minister, has been a champion of world
environmental awareness - notwithstanding her backing for Minke whale
hunting.
Mr Tore Hagebakken is one of those who hopes the games will promote Norway's
international instincts. The Labour mayor of Gjovik, an Olympic site close
to Lillehammer best known for its extraordinary ice hockey stadium blasted
out of the inside of a mountain, points optimistically to the latest opinion
poll, which shows that opposition to EU membership is falling sharply.
'It is difficult to win the (pro-EU) argument in Norway,' he says. 'People
are afraid they will lose their independence. But I hope the games will
change this a little bit. We wanted to bring the games here to be more
international - to show we have a lot of friends in Europe and all over the
world and there is nothing to be afraid of.'
Certainly, if the attitude of the 30,000 Norwegians who packed Thursday's
rehearsal for the opening Olympic ceremony is a guide, there is now great
national enthusiasm for hosting the games, despite initial disquiet over the
escalating costs incurred during a recession.
The Labour government has ended up spending NKr7bn (Pounds 632m) on the
games, more than three times the estimates made when Lillehammer won the
Olympics in 1989. A net deficit of NKr4.3bn is projected, and there are
doubts about the future economic viability of many Olympic sites. These
include two new ski jumps, a bobsleigh run, three skating rinks and the
Hamar Olympic hall, a speed-skating stadium in the shape of an upturned
viking ship.
But one factor in the high spending has been widely welcomed and has set a
standard for future Olympic Games, whether winter and summer. For the first
time a host city has made a priority of organising the games along
'environmentally friendly' lines.
After an acrimonious fight with the Norwegian Society for the Conservation
of Nature over the siting of the Hamar speed skating hall, which encroaches
on important wetlands for migrant birds, the Lillehammer Olympic Organising
Committee embraced the idea of running a 'green games'. A member of the
conservation society was employed to direct the environmental effort - which
was made one of the 'success criteria' for the games.
The results have been significant. The bobsleigh run was moved from its
original site to a less obtrusive position; the ski jumps were built below
the skyline; the athletes' village blends with local architecture and
includes several buildings that can be moved elsewhere after the games; and,
during construction, contractors were fined up to Dollars 7,000 for each
tree they knocked down.
The effort to be environmentally friendly goes well beyond the construction
of the games infrastructure. A huge recycling effort means all meals are
being served on plates made of potato and maize starch and eaten with
similarly-made utensils - all of which can be turned into compost. All the
bullets from the guns of the biathletes - participants in the cross-country
skiing and shooting event - will, for the first time, be collected for
recycling using special target backdrops.
The only aspect of the environment the organisers have no control over is
the weather. With 1.3m of snow already blanketing Lillehammer, the last
thing the Winter Olympics need is more winter weather. The Lillehammer
Olympic Organising Committee is praying for clear skies.

FT  12 FEB 94 / A 'shell too far' in Sarajevo: Nato's ultimatum may help to
redress the balance, but by itself it will not be enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why now? Why suddenly, after 2 1/2 years of war in the former Yugoslavia,
and nearly two in Bosnia, after so many thousands of deaths, maimings,
rapes, mass expulsions and other atrocities, did a single shell landing in a
Sarajevo street last Saturday galvanise Nato into issuing what many have
judged to be its first credible threat of military intervention?
At one level, the explanation is simple and familiar: it was the proverbial
last straw; a 'shell too far'. Western leaders have realised that they
already bear too heavy a weight of responsibility for what is happening in
Bosnia. They cannot get away with remaining passive as the death toll
mounts.
All of the following are up to their necks in Bosnia:
The European Union with its mediation efforts and white-coated observers;
Britain with its sponsorship of the London conference in 1992 and provision
of two successive mediators; France with the visit of President Francois
Mitterrand to Sarajevo in June 1992;
Half a dozen Nato countries with soldiers on the ground - soldiers taking
such invidious decisions as which starving village gets food from a convoy,
or who is allowed to fly out of Sarajevo; Germany and the US with their long
record of vocal political support for, respectively, the Croats and the
Bosnian Moslems; and
Nato itself with its previous, largely ineffective threats of air strikes.
None of these national and supranational bodies can escape damage if things
continue to get worse. All are obliged to react somehow when an event, even
a seemingly random event such as last Saturday's shelling of the Sarajevo
market, which killed 68 and injured more than 200, focuses public attention
on the utter grimness of the situation and their apparent inability to make
it any better.
But that situation is not new. In so far as the western reaction has been
different this time, it reflects not a pure knee-jerk reflex but a gradual
shift in the positions of some of the main governments concerned - France,
Germany and the US - that has been going on over a period of months.
The central role has been played by France, and more specifically by Alain
Juppe, foreign minister in the conservative government that came to power
last March.
Obliged to 'co-habit' with Mr Mitterrand, and inheriting a complex situation
in which France was involved with other countries, notably Britain, in
running the United Nations operation on the ground, Mr Juppe could not
change policy overnight. To begin with, France seemed to be following the
same approach as Britain, treating its military presence as a neutral and
purely humanitarian affair and leaving the political initiative entirely to
the EU and UN mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorwald Stoltenberg.
By autumn, however, Mr Juppe had reached the following conclusions:
It was too late for an ideal solution: no one was going to put the old
multicultural Bosnia together again by force of arms. There would have to be
a compromise peace.
But the compromise must give more to the Moslems than the isolated
ghetto-state offered by the Serbs and Croats in their joint partition plan.
The Serbs, especially, had somehow to be persuaded to concede more land.
The EU was supposed to have a common foreign and security policy. This would
be meaningless unless it included a plan for bringing peace to Bosnia.
That policy, in Bosnia as elsewhere, must be based on a clear Franco-German
understanding. In particular, the Germans must use their influence to bring
the Croats on board.
The US had to be smoked out of its self-righteous isolation and persuaded to
throw its weight behind a diplomatic initiative. Otherwise the Moslems would
continue to think they could do better by fighting on, believing that, if
not the US cavalry, at least US planes and weapons would sooner or later
come to their rescue.
From this analysis was born the 'Juppe-Kinkel plan' of November 8, which
became the 'European Union action plan' of November 22. In its original
form, the emphasis was on getting Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic to
extract concessions from the Bosnian Serbs, by dangling in front of him the
prospect that sanctions on Serbia would be lifted. 'This so-called trade-off
has too much carrot and too little stick,' was the predictable comment of
Mohammed Sacirbey, Bosnian ambassador to the UN.
Events were to prove him right. In December Serbia and Croatia pretended to
accept the plan, offering the Moslems one third of Bosnian territory (as the
EU plan suggested) but in a shape that could never have made a viable state.
The Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia would have been completely isolated,
Sarajevo virtually encircled and cut off from its suburbs, and the Moslems
would no longer have had the access to the river Drava they were previously
offered. Meanwhile, the shelling of Sarajevo intensified and there was
further Serb interference with relief supplies.
By the time Nato leaders met in Brussels on January 10 the need for stick as
well as carrot was widely admitted. President Bill Clinton did not want
Bosnia to spoil the summit, but the French insisted that it be addressed.
The alliance repeated its threat of last August to use airpower if the
'strangulation' of Sarajevo and other areas continued, and added a specific
warning to the Serbs not to obstruct relief of the Canadian garrison in
Sreb-renica or the reopening of Tuzla airport.
But the US was still reluctant to accept the role in which Mr Juppe had cast
it, of talking the Moslems into accepting the bitter fruits of defeat. This
led to a very public and embarrassing exchange of accusations between Paris
and Washington two weeks ago.
Now, however, indignation over the latest Sarajevo atrocity seems to have
acted as both catalyst and smokescreen for a tacit deal: Europe, led by
France, has agreed to use force or the threat of force to bring the Serbs to
reason, while the US has agreed to step up its diplomatic involvement,
effectively dirtying its hands with the 'sell-out' it was hitherto
determined to repudiate.
A division of labour is emerging. Each of the three parties in Bosnia has a
'big brother', who is expected to lean on his respective protege. Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has already leant on the Croatian president, procuring the
dismissal of the extremist Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban and Croatian
acceptance of an outlet to the Adriatic for the rump Bosnian state.
President Clinton will now be expected to lean on the Bosnian Moslem
leadership; and President Boris Yeltsin is positioning himself, by his
outspoken opposition to air strikes, to lean on Serbia. Britain, for its
part, has no proteges and no strategy. Mr Douglas Hurd's world-weary
neutralism has left him without friends and without influence.
But Mr Yeltsin is the weakest of the three protectors, while the Serbs, who
have perhaps as much as 50 per cent of their military equipment in reserve
for a spring offensive, are the strongest on the ground.
Even if the Russian president flies to Belgrade for an eyeball-to-eyeball
session with Mr Milosevic, there is no guarantee that the Bosnian Serbs will
take any notice. Nato's new ultimatum may help to redress the balance, but
by itself it will hardly be enough.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Work, rest and pay: Talks aimed at averting a German strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two hard men were yesterday locked in negotiations to head off a potentially
ruinous strike in Germany's recession-hit engineering industry.
In the blue corner, Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, 66, president of
Gesamtmetall, the German engineering employers' federation: blue-eyed,
tight-lipped and known to his adversaries as 'the hard man from Ennepetal'.
That is the picturesque little Sauerland valley, east of Cologne, where he
and his brother have built up a thriving business reprocessing aluminium
scrap.
Gottschol Aluminium is the archetypical successful small company from the
German Mittelstand, and Mr Gottschol, the archetypical Mittelstand
entrepreneur, the backbone of Germany's economic prosperity. He is a
no-frills businessman, whose arrival at the head of Germany's most powerful
individual employers' group in 1992 represented the revenge of his fellow
small-time entrepreneurs, after years of domination by the smooth-talking
heavyweights from big business.
In the red corner sits Mr Klaus Zwickel, leader of IG Metall, the
3.2m-strong engineering workers' union, pride of the German labour movement
and pace-setter for high wages, generous benefits and tough but reasonable
bargaining in the annual rounds of Germany's industrial relations bargaining
system.
At 54, he is 12 years younger than his rival, but also in his way, an
old-fashioned epitome of his breed: big hands, broad shoulders and
close-cropped grizzled hair around a bald head. He is a man who says what he
thinks, and does what he says, a lifelong trade unionist with a passionate
belief in the good and necessary role that the unions should play.
He was thrust unexpectedly into his job last year, after the embarrassing
and disastrous resignation of his high-profile predecessor, Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, over allegations of insider trading in Daimler-Benz shares.
These then are the two classic adversaries who met yesterday with their
immediate aides in a hotel in Darmstadt, just south of Frankfurt, in a
summit meeting to thrash out their differences.
They are faced with the threat of an all-out strike in an industry suffering
its sharpest recession since the postwar German economic recovery began.
Since 1991, 600,000 jobs have been lost in the mechanical and electrical
engineering, and automobile industries.
Everyone agrees that a strike would be suicidal, above all for the
engineering workers. Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the opposition leader, have appealed for good sense and compromise. And yet
the two sides have gone through negotiations in 34 rounds of regional pay
talks, without any sign of rapprochement.
For once, the traditional tables of industrial relations have been turned:
the employers are on the offensive, and the trade union on the retreat. It
was Mr Gottschol who last September served notice to terminate the current
wage and holiday contracts - an unprecedented move, intended to underline
employers' determination to win cost-cutting concessions.
'The fundamental cause of the growing unemployment is a profound cost crisis
in the German engineering industry,' Mr Gottschol maintains. Comparative
hourly costs in France and the US are 60 per cent of those in Germany. He
wants real cost cuts of at least 10 per cent.
The union came back with a demand for a package linking job security and
income preservation: in spite of an unrealistic 5.5-6 per cent wage demand,
it was obviously a defensive claim, with the emphasis on saving jobs, not on
raising pay.
As part of that, Mr Zwickel has thrown in a call for a temporary deal on a
four-day or 30-hour working week - to save jobs by persuading everyone to
work less.
Mr Gottschol says it is a policy of desperation: it may reduce the absolute
wage bill for those facing a disastrous slump in demand - like Volkswagen,
which has agreed such a deal - but it would actually increase unit wage
costs, aggravating the problem of German competitiveness.
The employers' stance represents the conviction of Mr Gottschol and his
fellow small and medium-sized employers that previous wage deals, including
shorter working hours and disproportionate pay rises for the low paid, have
had a devastating effect on wage costs.
The current engineering industry working week is 36 hours, with an agreement
to cut it to 35 from October 1995. Mr Gottschol says if there is to be any
change, it must allow individual employers to negotiate longer hours as well
as shorter. Only by going back towards a 40-hour week can they hope to cut
their unit wage costs, he says.
Mr Zwickel is terrified that by agreeing to a flexible deal - allowing
plant-level bargaining to decide between, say, 30 and 40 hours a week - the
concept of a national wage and conditions agreement will be terminally
undermined. He suspects that is precisely Mr Gottschol's intention.
The irony is that, behind the tough bargaining positions, both men are
standing on shifting sands: both face a decline in their membership, as the
industry shrinks and employers look for greater flexibility outside the
confines of the annual pay round. If Mr Gottschol and Mr Zwickel want to
preserve their positions, they are condemned to do a deal. If they want to
keep their membership on board, they must make that deal mutually
acceptable. They have more in common than might at first appear.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incentive schemes must meet
particular needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID M W BROOKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re the Lex column on executive pay (February 1), and as one who was
partly involved in the design of the Reuters executive incentive scheme, I
feel that the move from executive share options to restricted shares and the
use of relative total shareholder return as a measure (to quantify corporate
performance) are to be widely welcomed.
This approach breaks the 1980s mould of executive remuneration. In the last
decade, the long-term elements of executive pay have been shaped at least as
much by tax considerations as by the specific requirements of individual
companies. As a result, most quoted companies at present have long-term
incentive schemes which are all but identical.
The new Reuters scheme should certainly contribute to the debate on
executive remuneration. However, a risk exists that some companies will
simply see the new scheme as a template to be followed to introduce
executive incentive schemes in exactly the same format. They may not
question the suitability of such arrangements for their own circumstances -
failing to raise questions in that context may not be in their best
interests.
In considering changes in their long-term incentive schemes, companies
should seriously heed the joint statement, issued last year, by the National
Association of Pension Funds and Association of British Insurers (see
Letters, February 11). That statement requires the remuneration committee of
a company to choose a measure (and presumably a scheme) which is appropriate
for that company and to justify that measure and scheme to shareholders.
If Reuters is to be followed, therefore, it should be for the way that it
has approached executive remuneration to meet its own needs. David M W

FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK government stand on biodiesel hits
farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTER M FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You published two interesting articles, 'Trees branch out', about
coppicing on set-aside land for energy uses, and 'The cleaner choice', about
concerns on particulate emissions from diesel engines (both Business and the
Environment, February 9).
We would like to point out that the use of biodiesel (made from rape seed
oil) has been shown to reduce particular emissions from diesel engines by up
to 50 per cent. In 1994, about 250,000ha of set-aside land will be used to
grow oil crops for biodiesel production and the potential is much larger.
In France, Italy and Germany, tax exemption is given (under certain control
systems) to promote the use of biodiesel and hence the development of the
set-aside policy.
Unfortunately, the UK government has to date refused to apply the same
scheme, to the detriment of UK farmers, diesel users and the environment.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Centrally set pay rise for NHS
creates productivity paradox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ANDREW GREENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government's pay rise for the National Health Service creates a
productivity paradox with which hospitals are not yet equipped to deal. As
the government has indicated, hospitals must increase productivity to pay
for the pay rise ('PM concedes up to 3 per cent rises in public sector',
February 4). Productivity will only be increased if there is some reward for
doing so. Hospitals can only be rewarded if the more productive trusts get
more money for being more productive. The source of this money is of course
fund-holding GPs and regional purchasers, functioning in the 'internal'
market.
But the government will find it cannot rely on a market while it hands down
pay increases from the centre. After all, wage rises should follow
productivity gains, not precede them. Mortgaging someone else's future
productivity increases (notably the NHS trusts') to pay for the centre's
profligacy is bad policy. As the reforms originally intended, better to let
trusts decide for themselves what pay they can afford to give out.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Action against predatory pricing
essential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C M PURVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Anti-dumping' (February 10), dealing with European Union
policies on dumping really cannot be allowed to pass without comment.
Anti-dumping action is a legitimate and necessary defence, limited in nature
and circumscribed by internationally agreed General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade rules, against predatory pricing. More often than not, dumping comes
from countries which themselves prohibit, or tightly restrict, imports.
Remove these barriers, and the problem of dumping would sharply diminish.
Why on earth should the European Union, with 17m unemployed, remain supine
in the face of serious threats to European industry?
The EU has not only consistently respected Gatt rules on dumping, but has
also incorporated in its legislation additional constraints on its freedom
of action. The legislation is applied, in our experience, in an objective
way by the Commission, and your sideswipe at European public servants,
implying loose management standards, is both unjustified and - since their
status precludes them from answering back - unfair.
Your proposals would - deliberately? - add such complexity to anti-dumping
investigations that action would become impossible. They will, rightly, be
rejected by the large majority of member states as simply another expression
of Anglo-Saxon eccentricity about this issue.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Dangers of great expectations: Tony Jackson asks if the
investment plans of UK industry are failing to take account of low inflation
and interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK business, it seems, has a problem with investment. Inflation may be
beaten and money cheap, but managers have not adjusted to the fact. Before
they will sign up for a new machine or a new factory, they demand the same
high return on their investment as in the old days. As a result, they risk
underinvesting and being caught unprepared by economic recovery.
So, at any rate, says Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry. Investment intentions, he said on
Wednesday, are 'worryingly weak'. Companies still look for returns of 17 or
20 per cent, and may be missing opportunities as a result.
Two professors from the London Business School made the same point in the FT
on Wednesday. 'Our contacts with companies,' Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh
wrote, 'suggest that many have not responded sufficiently to falling
inflation and lower real interest rates. As a result, their managements are
demanding an excessive return from new investment projects.'
The statistics seem to back this up. One obvious measure of investment in
machinery is the home order book of the UK engineering industry. This is
still shrinking, and is now almost 30 per cent smaller than in 1990. The
output of the construction industry continues to dwindle as well.
Granted, the CBI's regional survey this week reported planned increases in
spending on plant and machinery almost throughout the UK. But the survey
also pointed to sharply lower investment in buildings. Most companies said
they were investing not to expand, but to improve efficiency. And the chief
factor limiting investment was - yes - 'inadequate return'.
On the face of it, this is curious. The apparent conquest of inflation means
UK interest rates are historically very low. The stock market is also very
high, since investors have been switching out of cash into equities. A
company looking to invest is thus offered the cheapest money for a
generation, in the form either of a loan from the bank or cash from
shareholders.
The collapse of inflation alters the sums in another way. Typically,
companies will calculate the return required on an investment in two parts:
the basic return, and a premium on top to reflect the risk of the investment
going wrong. The figures will normally be worked on a real (ie,
inflation-adjusted) basis, so falling inflation does not change the sums
directly. But inflation is a business risk in itself, since it leads to high
and unstable interest rates and a stop-go economy. If stable prices
represent lower risk, they also logically allow lower real rates of return.
But if the behaviour of companies seems irrational, it is not very
surprising. Inflationary psychology is hard to learn and equally hard to
forget. When inflation first took hold in the 1970s, portfolio investors
persisted for years in buying UK government bonds on yields below inflation,
because they could not believe inflation would last.
The same now obtains in reverse. After more than two decades of inflation,
business people are slow to accept that the dragon is slain. The stock
market may seem to think so, but portfolio investors have less to lose. If
inflation revives, they can simply sell the shares. A company committing
itself to a new plant with a 10-year payoff does not have that luxury.
One of the UK's leading industrial companies, GEC, says its real target rate
of return remains unchanged at 20 per cent. Mr David Newlands, GEC's finance
director, says: 'Clearly, if you got to the position where inflation really
was defeated, you'd have to adjust your sights downwards or miss
opportunities. But I don't think there is enough evidence yet that inflation
is really dead.'
Besides, some quoted companies say, their cost of capital is ultimately
determined by the stock market. The market may be high at present. But
history suggests equities' behaviour is largely independent of the level of
inflation over longer periods, such as five years. Mr Alan Spall, ICI
finance director, says: 'Inflation is only one of a huge number of elements
in the equation. The fact that inflation has come down doesn't at all mean
that our hurdle rates have come down as well.'
In addition, some companies show signs of taking rates of return on
investment more seriously than before. This is a sensible response to the
low-growth, highly competitive 1990s. In the boom years of the 1980s, there
was a better chance that an ill-judged investment would be bailed out by
economic growth. Indeed, inflation itself may have led to careless
investment decisions, since continuously rising prices had a way of covering
up mistakes.
In fairness to the stock market, it is worth pointing out that some City
commentators take a less gloomy view of what is happening to capital
investment than industry itself. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at the
brokers James Capel, says: 'I think we're beginning to see the conditions
fall into place for quite a strong expansion of capital investment.'
First, he argues, official figures show that corporate profits have
recovered from the depths of recession more sharply than expected, and
certainly faster than in the early 1980s. At the same time, dividend
payments have adjusted to lower inflation. 'So there's been a phenomenal
bounce in companies' retained earnings,' Mr Skeoch says. 'In the postwar
years, that's been a necessary condition in the UK for a revival in capital
investment.'
Second, though the level of investment may still be flat or even falling, it
remains strong by historical standards. Business investment as a proportion
of GDP is now a little over 12 per cent. Throughout much of the 1960s and
1970s, it was significantly lower.
But if the City is sanguine, it is largely alone. The Treasury and the Bank
of England appear to be uneasy. The CBI is about to undertake a survey of
its members, asking how they go about their investment appraisals and
whether their habits are changing. Conventional wisdom says the hesitant UK
recovery, hitherto led by the consumer, needs to be backed by business
investment if it is to be sustained. On the showing so far, it would not do
to count on it.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Shoot-out in the DC corral
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton believes that Japan is the bad guy of world trade.
It must change its ways, or else. Asked about the possibility of US trade
retaliation against Japan, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers announced
that US trade representative Mickey Kantor 'is not ruling anything out. We
want a good agreement or no agreement. We won't settle for anything less.'
The pity is that the agreement the Americans want is such a bad one. True,
US pressure has often been helpful to Japanese reformers. But the
quantitative indicators of market opening sought by the US are another
matter. They will be helpful to the Japanese only to the extent that refusal
to accede should increase Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's prestige back home. But the
price of this fight will be a high one. The Japanese prime minister must
choose between being shot by Mr Clinton in the front or, should he accept US
demands, by his compatriots in the back. Either way, he would lose. So, more
significantly, would the relationship.
What makes these conflicts over the Japanese external surpluses surprising
is that they have proved so enduring. In the second half of the 1980s, when
the political force of complaints about Japan started building to a
crescendo, the US economy, albeit growing steadily, was burdened by the
alleged calamity of its twin fiscal and current account deficits. Meanwhile,
Japanese gross domestic product grew by more than 4 per cent every year
between 1984 and 1991, except one.
How very different the 1990s have been. The Japanese economy has stagnated
since the last quarter of 1991, with little prospect of a strong recovery
this year, notwithstanding announcement of the fourth in a series of
emergency fiscal packages. Meanwhile, the US economy, after a shallow
recession in 1990 and 1991, has outperformed Japan in 1992 and 1993. It is
confidently expected to do the same again in 1994.
Melted away
Those twin US deficits have also melted away, partly because of the
successful efforts of the Clinton administration. In last December's
Economic Outlook, the OECD Secretariat estimated that the overall US
structural fiscal deficit peaked in 1992 at 4 per cent of GDP, but should
fall to only 2.7 per cent this year. How happy Mr Kenneth Clarke would be to
have such a prospect. Meanwhile, the federal deficit was forecast in Mr
Clinton's budget proposals this week, if on somewhat optimistic assumptions
about future spending, to fall further, from Dollars 234.5bn (3.5 per cent
of GDP) in fiscal 1994 to a trough of 2.3 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1996.
As a percentage of GDP the US current account deficit peaked at 3.7 per cent
in 1987. It disappeared in the early 1990s, but is still expected to be only
about 2 per cent this year, despite the recovery. Given that recovery and
given also the low overall US savings rate, this inflow of capital should be
welcomed as a benign boost to a confident US economy.
Why then are complaints about Japan so persistent? The short answer must be
sheer obstinacy. The long answer is that the overall Japanese current
account surplus, after falling from a peak of 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1986 to
a trough of 1.2 per cent in 1990, is once more over 3 per cent. More
politically significant perhaps is the fact that Japan's bilateral surplus
with the US, at close to Dollars 60bn in 1993, is at nominal levels last
seen in 1986 and 1987. But this is misleading. As a share of gross domestic
product, the Japanese bilateral surplus was 1.4 per cent of US GDP in 1986,
but only 0.9 per cent of GDP last year.
Home truths
Instead of pandering to domestic pressure, Mr Clinton should be telling his
compatriots some home truths: that the US economy is performing well and the
Japanese economy badly; that the US external position has improved; that the
bilateral deficit with Japan has shrunk as a share of US GDP, even though US
demand has been growing, while Japanese demand has not; and, last but not
least, he could ask why any sensible person should care about a bilateral
balance.
The president should also be telling the Japanese what they need to hear:
that recalcitrance over radical deregulation is damaging to themselves and
intolerable for everyone else; and that the Ministry of Finance and Bank of
Japan are making a mess of fiscal and monetary policies. The Japanese
finance ministry has already asked the government to follow the record
Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) pump-priming package announced this week with an
austere budget for the coming year. The question Mr Clinton must ask is why.
Japan has by far the strongest fiscal position of any major OECD country. It
makes no sense to deflate its still stagnant economy.
What with the US focusing on an unimportant bilateral trade deficit and the
Japanese determined to stick to outmoded regulations and inappropriate
fiscal and monetary stringency, these two giants deserve each other. But the
world deserves neither bit of folly. It would be better for everyone if
commonsense were to break out, on both sides.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Man In The News: In defence of half answers - Sir Robin
Butler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sir Robin Butler was appointed head of the UK civil service and
secretary to the cabinet in 1988, he was said by one admirer to have 'the
gift of disagreeing without causing offence'.
Yet offence is precisely what Sir Robin has caused this week following his
appearance before the Scott inquiry, which is investigating the
arms-for-Iraq affair.
In a prepared statement, he attacked the damage that he believed the
inquiry's procedures had inflicted on the 'system of government, to the
reputation of the civil service and to individuals'. Sir Robin also
criticised media coverage that had 'permitted wild allegations and
prejudging of issues'.
The first charge led Lord Justice Scott to urge him to think critically
'about the established practices and convention' of Whitehall. The inquiry
has already heard enough evidence to know that something went badly wrong in
the handling of policy over arms sales to Iraq and the prosecution of three
executives of Matrix Churchill, the machine tools company.
Yet it is Sir Robin's assault on press standards that has called down the
scorn of commentators. They have contrasted his concern for reporting
standards with his justification of the practice of giving 'half answers' to
parliament so long as they were accurate. This uncomfortably recalled the
tradition of 'being economical with the truth', famously defended by his
immediate predecessor, Sir Robert (now Lord) Armstrong.
Such public exposure has not, until recently, been part of the job
description of the head of the civil service. From his office in Downing
Street, Sir Robin heads an organisation of over half a million civil
servants who spend more than two-fifths of the national income.
He selects the top civil servants who run government departments, is
consulted on a wide range of appointments to quangos and other public
bodies, and oversees the honours system. He is also responsible to the prime
minister for the expenditure and management of the three intelligence
services. In his role as Cabinet secretary, he co-ordinates policy-briefing
for the cabinet and its committees.
Sir Robin is the perfect mandarin from head to toe. At Harrow, the English
boarding school, he was head boy. He took a double first in Mods and Greats
at Oxford and played rugby for the university.
He joined the Treasury in 1961 fresh from Oxford, became a founder member of
the Central Policy Review Staff (the Whitehall think-tank) and was in charge
of public expenditure in the mid-1980s. He served as private secretary to
three prime ministers. He also found time to captain the Whitehall Mandarins
cricket team for some years.
If all that were not enough, Sir Robin oozes charm, decency and
intelligence. He cycles to work from Dulwich, and gives his recreation in
Who's Who as 'competitive games'.
Such a pedigree might have marked him down as a traditionalist and defender
of the status quo. But Sir Robin has been at the top throughout the most
far-reaching revolution in Whitehall since the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan
report created the modern civil service.
In the past six years, two-thirds of civil servants have been transferred
into executive agencies, management has been devolved from Whitehall to
front-line managers, and performance-related pay introduced. 'Delegating
responsibility to managers and concentrating more on results appeals
temperamentally to me, and I've enjoyed doing it,' he says. 'Since there has
been bipartisanship over a large part of the programme, I have had no
problem in giving a public lead on it.'
However, there is a rising tide of public concern over the consequences of
these reforms for the standards of the public services. A growing band of
critics believes that he should be sounding alarm bells in defence of
independence, impartiality and probity.
'There is a feeling that Sir Robin is not doing enough to stand up for the
public service in Britain, to maintain the independence of the state,' says
one.
This band includes some of his fellow permanent secretaries, members of the
'College of Cardinals' who meet him weekly at the Cabinet Office. They have
been buffeted by the Citizen's Charter, market-testing and now
privatisation. From April, they will be required to lift the veils of
secrecy behind which Whitehall's business is conducted.
While Sir Robin denies that such worries were behind this week's statement
to the Scott inquiry, it will have been welcomed by those urging him to draw
a line in the sand over which the civil service will not be pushed.
Yet if that was their hope, it has not been fulfilled. Instead, Sir Robin
was made to look increasingly ill at ease under the sort of close
cross-examination rarely encountered in front of a parliamentary select
committee.
Mirth greeted some of his replies, laughter in which clearly he could not
share. The contrast between the openness of the Scott inquiry and the still
secretive ways of Whitehall was starkly displayed.
In one sense, Sir Robin has been placed in a difficult position. He became
involved in the arms-for-Iraq affair only in 1990 when the prosecution of
Matrix-Churchill became a possibility. He has, however, been called upon to
account for the actions of ministers and officials since the early 1980s.
Yet his for once uncertain touch may reflect the problem that gnaws at the
heart of Britain's public institutions. This is the strain they experience
in a prolonged period of one-party rule, during which public servants find
themselves ineluctably acting more politically.
'In his heart of hearts, I think he would have preferred the government to
change at the last election,' says Professor Peter Hennessy, Whitehall
chronicler. 'Not because he is a Labour supporter but for the long-term
health of the civil service.'
Without change, mandarins such as Sir Robin must take on the burden of
defending the public service against political corruption. It is not
surprising that he is ill-at-ease at being asked to discharge a task that is
more effectively exercised by the democratic process.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Finger-in-the-air method: Northern industrialists' plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are putting money into our businesses. We're not idiots,' says Mr David
Belton, finance director of Richardson Sheffield, which makes kitchen
knifes.
His comments sum up the reaction of many in Yorkshire and Humberside to the
charge this week by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation
of British Industry, that UK investment is weak because directors still want
rates of return as high as 17-20 per cent on capital.
Mr Belton believes he and his counterparts are doing everything they should
in the current economic climate. 'We aim to improve productivity by 5 per
cent each year. You can't do it by working harder. You can only do it
through investment,' he says.
But in the region identified by the CBI as among the most buoyant in the UK,
consideration of rates of return often forms little part of investment
decisions. More worrying for those who, like Mr Davies, are concerned about
Britain's long-term production capacity, the main driving force seems to be
a quest to push short-term unit costs constantly downwards.
The Engineering Employers Federation recently calculated the region is
working at only 72 per cent capacity - leaving room for production to expand
without new plants.
For Mr Andrew Cook, chairman of William Cook &amp; Sons, which makes steel
castings, cost cutting is first priority now that trading conditions are
more favourable.
'Leaving the European exchange rate mechanism saved all of us in our export
markets. The consequent low interest rates have enabled us all to afford
more debt for investment in efficiency,' he says. The company turns over
Pounds 100m a year with 1,900 employees.
It is investing Pounds 6m this year in streamlining its operations, buying
new machines and relocating plant. 'I don't work out rates of return. My
technique is more finger-in-the-air. The answer has to be yes to two
questions: have we got a fundamentally sound market? Do we want to stay in
it? We then invest in anything that keeps driving down costs to keep us in
the game,' he says.
Similarly, Mr Roy Pilgrim, finance director of Aurora, a Sheffield steel
processor which has a capital expenditure budget of Pounds 7m, says he has
'no rigid rules' about rates of return. 'What we expect is payback within
three years. We look at the security of the market for any product. We then
buy almost anything that takes cost out of making it.'
Mr Mike Hennesey, chief executive of Kalon, which makes paint for DIY retail
stores at its factory in Batley, West Yorkshire, says: 'We don't bother with
discounted cash flow analysis and all that nonsense. We look at how much
cash we have got and estimate how long it will take to get it back if we use
it to become more efficient. If it looks OK, we go.'
He says, however, that improved competitiveness has won the company
increased market share, so some investment is now going into extra
manufacturing capacity.
Among small manufacturers, traditional investment decision-making practices
are well entrenched. Mr Hugh Foulerton's family owns United Cutlers of
Sheffield, which sells mainly sterling silver cutlery direct from the
factory by mail order, cutting out retailers' margins. 'My niece estimates
our cash flow for six months and 12 months ahead and we then decide what we
can afford to invest,' he says.
Since 1991 the company has invested a total of Pounds 285,000 and annual
sales are 40 per cent up at about Pounds 2.5m a year.
Mr Charles Burton of Haines Watts, a Yorkshire-based accountancy firm, says
most investment decisions made by his small business clients are based on
unsophisticated principles.
'The smarter they work, the more profitable they will be. Very few
owner-managed businesses have got the resources or skills to work out a rate
of return. They rely on gut feel and come to us for help with the tax
allowances. They don't even work it out on the back of an envelope.'

first 10 days they were on sale, National Savings reported yesterday.
The amount involved is lower than the Pounds 93m attracted in a similar
period for the National Savings First Option bond almost two years ago,
although the number of savers, at 9,400, is higher. The clash between
societies and the government over the First Option bond culminated in its
temporary withdrawal.
When the pensioners' bonds were announced in November's Budget, there was
concern among building societies that their terms might act as a drain on
societies' retail savings. Yesterday's figures appeared to offer them some
relief.
The bond, which went on sale on 21 January, offers an interest rate of 7 per
cent gross fixed for five years for people aged 65 and over.
Total gross sales of all National Savings products in January amounted to
Pounds 840m.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Company insolvency down by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company insolvencies in England and Wales fell 15 per cent last year,
providing further evidence that economic recovery is under way, the British
Chambers of Commerce said yesterday.
Total company insolvencies in 1993 were 20,825 on a seasonally adjusted
basis, a fall of 15 per cent on 1992. Individual insolvencies fell by 0.4
per cent to 36,645.
In the fourth quarter the number of company insolvencies fell by 9 per cent
to 4,634 compared to the previous quarter, and the lowest figure since the
fourth quarter of 1990.
The number of individual insolvencies was down by 7 per cent to 8,513 on the
previous quarter.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said that the fall in insolvencies was good for the confidence of
both employees and consumers. 'It will staunch the decline in capacity and
will continue to ease the burden of bad debt on business,' he said.
'While insolvencies are still at a higher level than pre-recession, the
improvement has been clear and steady for over a year and looks set to
continue.'
For 1993 the number of company insolvencies stood at 2.3 per cent of active
companies and 2 per cent of registered companies.
Of the insolvencies 8,361 were compulsory liquidations, while 12,464 were
creditors' voluntary liquidations.
In Scotland the number of insolvencies fell to 107 in the fourth quarter
according to provisional figures that were not seasonally adjusted.
On the same basis Scottish insolvencies for 1993 amounted to 551 compared
with 670 in 1992. The number of individual insolvencies in Scotland fell to
411 in the fourth quarter (again on provisional non-seasonably adjusted
figures), compared with 404 in the third quarter, itself the lowest figure
since the third quarter of 1988.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Kent Tec merger dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed merger of Kent County Council's economic development unit and the
local Training and Enterprise Council has been abandoned.
Councillors, officers and Tec directors will instead set up a joint policy
group to 'identify and explore opportunities for closer executive action'.
The merger plan, which was strongly supported by Sir Alastair Morton,
co-chairman of Eurotunnel and chairman of Kent Tec, had been seen by local
authorities and Tecs as an important test of how obstacles to closer
partnerships between the public and private sectors could be overcome.
The proposed merger would have created one strategic body responsible for
writing Kent's economic development plan as well as promoting regeneration
projects and inward investment.
One issue involved in the collapse of talks was the question of how
councillors could continue to contribute to the strategy for local economic
development.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Foreigners hold 12% of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas investors held about 12 per cent, or Pounds 75bn, of all UK shares
at the end of 1992, figures from the Central Statistical Office showed
yesterday.
US investors accounted for just under half of the overseas total, at Pounds
36bn, while the Japanese represented 2.7 per cent. Continental Europeans
were the second largest overseas shareholders, owning about 17.5 per cent,
or Pounds 13bn, followed by Opec investors, with 6.4 per cent, about Pounds
5bn.
The figures appear in the CSO's annual share register survey, which includes
investors' countries of residence for the first time. The figures are
subject to uncertainty because the CSO was unable to allocate about Pounds
15bn of overseas holdings to particular areas.
UK financial institutions held the largest proportion, 56.6 per cent, or
Pounds 351bn, of UK shares. Among the institutions, pension funds were
dominant, with around Pounds 215bn - or a third of all shares - and
insurance companies with Pounds 103bn, about a sixth. Individuals owned 20.3
per cent.
The survey revealed that about 23,000 holdings, worth between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 50m, were held by individuals in the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man. Registers of 191 companies were covered by the survey, representing
about 79 per cent of the capitalisation of UK companies' ordinary shares
listed on the International Stock Exchange in London.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Trade gap rises to Pounds 1.04bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's visible trade deficit widened to Pounds 1.04bn in November as the
value of exports fell 5.5 per cent from October. Meanwhile, a net Pounds
700m revision to earlier figures pushed up the deficit for the first 11
months of 1993 to Pounds 11.2bn.
The figures, published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, show
that imports have been growing in volume terms while exports have been
falling over the last few months. However, the impact of this on the deficit
has been disguised by falling import prices. In the three months to
November, import prices were 2 per cent lower than in the previous three
months while export prices were 2 per cent higher.
The CSO estimates that the trend in exports is a 0.5 per cent decline per
month while imports are increasing at 0.5 per cent a month.
The visible trade deficit with European Union countries in November was
Pounds 262m. Added to the Pounds 773m deficit with non-EU countries, which
had already been reported, the November deficit was just under Pounds 1.04bn
 -up from Pounds 703m in October. The CSO said there had been a fall in
exports to France but an increase to Germany.
EU trade figures are now collected under the Intrastat system, which is
based on the collection of value added tax. Since the new system was
introduced at the start of last year, there has been a sharp divergence in
the trend of EU and non-EU trade. Many City economists believe this has been
caused by the under-recording of EU imports. The CSO said it was
investigating this possibility.
Meanwhile, the CSO gave more details of the so-called 'Rotterdam effect',
which it had previously used to explain the divergence. Before the
introduction of Intrastat, some exports may have been recorded as coming
from Rotterdam, when they had merely passed through the port. Under the new
system, such imports are now correctly being recorded as coming from outside
the EU. The CSO feels this factor may account for about Pounds 100m of
reclassified imports a month.
If oil and erratics are excluded, the November deficit was Pounds 1.42bn, up
from Pounds 1.21bn in October. In seasonally adjusted volume terms, non-oil
and erratic exports were 2 per cent lower in the three months to November
than in the previous three months while imports were 3 per cent higher.
Mr Robert Barrie, UK economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the rise in
imports could have been caused by stockbuilding and investment by companies
as the recovery became more broadly based.

FT  12 FEB 94 / MPs support ban on tobacco advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation to ban tobacco advertising crossed a tough hurdle yesterday
after a private member's bill gained the support in the Commons of more than
a third of MPs.
The tobacco advertising bill, proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, backbench Labour
MP for Rother Valley, passed its second reading in spite of strong
opposition from a number of government ministers.
The bill will now be debated by a parliamentary committee at which
ministerial opposition will almost certainly be stepped up.
The scale of support for the legislation on both sides of the house took the
government by surprise. In a free vote, a motion to close the day's debate
and push the bill to its next stage was passed by 227 votes to 17, a
majority of 210.
Under Commons rules, the Friday debate on a private member's bill must be
formally closed by the early afternoon if it is to make any more progress.
It must also be supported by more than 100 MPs - difficult to muster on a
Friday afternoon when members tend to be in their constituencies.
Mr Barron claimed yesterday that it was almost unprecedented for the
division on a Friday debate to be so well attended. 'It shows the concern
(MPs) have over the influence tobacco advertising has on the health of
children in the UK,' he said.
In recent months, the legislation appears to have gained support from
influential circles - overcoming opposition from the powerful tobacco
industry.
A leaked cabinet memorandum recently showed that three ministers - including
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - urged in November that
the ban should be supported.
They opposed Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, who told the
cabinet that she backed extending the limitations on advertising, including
adverts on posters, shop-fronts and women's magazines.

The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority announced yesterday
that it was ready to consider revised bids for both of its bus companies,
Charles Batchelor writes.
The authority is to consider a revised bid, thought to be worth nearly
Pounds 25m, for Greater Manchester Buses North from an employee buy-out
team. It has also invited British Bus, a private company that was initially
the preferred bidder, to resubmit its bid.
The authority has also given the employee buy-out team which has bid for
Greater Manchester Buses South until Tuesday to confirm they are able to
continue with their bid, thought to be worth about Pounds 15m. Stagecoach
Holdings, a Perth-based bus company, has made a bid believed to be worth
about Pounds 20m.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Power deal disappoints suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several electricity distributors were disappointed with Professor Stephen
Littlechild's settlement with National Power and PowerGen - but the Major
Energy Users' Association was full of praise for it.
The council said the agreement reached by the electricity industry regulator
delivered 'exactly' what they needed and was welcome news for heavy industry
as it struggled to recover from recession. It said power-plant sales by the
two generators would speed the transition to a proper competitive market and
the regulator had been right to insist on a price cap.
The regulator has agreed not to refer the generators to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission but complainants, including consumers' associations,
pointed out that the settlement would be of limited benefit to householders.
Losers include Nuclear Electric, the third big generator in England and
Wales, and, in the short term, other independent power companies.
Prof Littlechild's oft-stated intention is to bring as much competition to
the market as possible. It is ironic that the loudest complainants about
yesterday's settlement were from the very companies that he is trying to
encourage to improve the market.
'We do not understand why he thinks that artificially depressing prices will
encourage competition,' said Mr David Porter, representing the Association
of Independent Electricity Producers. The association argues that the lower
the rewards that generators can make from electricity the less likely they
are to want to build new plants.
Some of the regional electricity companies also felt aggrieved. They say
they were not consulted or warned about the changes in prospective pool
prices. The changes will have a considerable impact on contracts they have
been negotiating with users of 100kWh and above who from April will be able
to choose who supplies them with power.
Yorkshire Electricity was one of several companies inundated with calls from
100kWh customers who wanted to know the implications. Several regionals fear
pressure to renegotiate contracts.
Yesterday's settlement will have only a marginal effect on regional power
companies' profitability since most of the power they buy from the
generators is on long-term contracts backed by hedging agreements.
Some may even benefit because prices of electricity not covered by hedging
contracts will fall. All of the regional companies were relieved that Prof
Littlechild avoided a reference to the commission which would have disrupted
the whole market.
But perhaps the biggest sighs of relief yesterday were from the electricity
generators, the companies whose price-bidding behaviour sparked the inquiry,
the results of which were published yesterday. They had the most to lose.
Prof Littlechild's investigation found no evidence of abuse by either
company of their market position. More importantly, the settlement will be
less punitive than some analysts had feared and will leave both companies
with considerable market clout and profits at the end of the two years that
the deal lasts.
The two main elements of the agreement are a cap on prices that the
generators charge, and therefore the price in the electricity pool, and an
agreement that the generators 'use all reasonable endeavours' to sell up to
6,000MW of their generating plant.
The impact of the cap could be to reduce potential prices in the pool by
about 7 per cent but some analysts were suggesting yesterday that this
assumes that prices had continued at the high levels of the first half of
this financial year. Prices have fallen since then.
The companies were stressing that the cap was on prices rather than on
profits; National Power talked about a 'modest adverse impact' on its future
profitability.
Analysts were downgrading their profits forecast for the next two years,
when the cap will be in force, but not by amounts that would upset their
expectations on dividend growth, one of the main criteria by which
electricity companies are judged by the market.
SG Warburg Securities thought the settlement would cost National Power
Pounds 40m a year in profits over the next two years and PowerGen Pounds
20m. It expects National Power to make pre-tax profits next year of Pounds
650m, down on this year's expected Pounds 670m, and PowerGen to make Pounds
470m, about level with this year's forecast.
But the cap is temporary, a makeshift arrangement while competition develops
more fully. The success of the settlement will depend on how the generators
dispose of their plants in the future.
The regulator was yesterday putting a different gloss on the plant disposals
agreement than the generators. While he warned that he may renew his threat
to refer the generators at the end of next year if they had not made
satisfactory progress on the sales, PowerGen was warning that it was not
going to be rushed into a fire sale.
There could yet be significant arguments over the sale price of the plant.
The likelihood is that the generators will make at least some of the
disposals. But even if they do there is no guarantee that this will lead to
lower prices. This is because prices in the wholesale electricity pool are
determined by the most expensive plant needed to run the system. The most
expensive plants may still be in the hands of National Power and PowerGen
because anything they sell is likely to be offered at low prices by the new
owner to make the purchase economically viable.
If that were the case the generators would find it easier to lift their
prices again when the cap ends. Prof Littlechild's work is far from from
over.

FT  12 FEB 94 / 'Customers set to benefit by up to Pounds 500m'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extract from statement by Professor Littlechild on agreement with the
generators.
I have considered what a reasonable path of prices might be until a fully
competitive market can be achieved.
I have done this by assessing what average price would be necessary to cover
projections of the two generators' avoidable operating costs, other costs
including a programme of capital expenditure on low nitrogen oxides (NOx)
burners, flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) retro-fitting and new combined
cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) to meet environmental standards, plus an
allowance for interest and returns to shareholders.
The results are sensitive to the precise assumptions about each of the
components. However, the broad conclusion is that for the next few years the
two generators could achieve sufficient revenues at pool prices somewhat
below the average levels obtaining so far in this financial year.
The two companies argued that pool purchase price to date has not been
sufficient to cover the avoidable costs of much mid-merit and peaking plant.
My calculations suggest that the avoidable costs of mid-merit plant could be
met by higher peak prices more than offset by lower off-peak prices. There
does not need to be an increase in average pool price to cover these
avoidable costs.
The differential between peak and off-peak prices may well need to be
greater . . . to sustain mid-merit and peaking plant in a competitive
market. Such a greater differential would encourage new entry in this part
of the market and test whether peak demand could be met by cheaper plant.
There has been an increase in competition in generation, and more is in
prospect. However, experience suggests that the extent of competition is not
sufficient to restrain National Power and PowerGen if they wish to increase
prices. Nor is it certain that the additional baseload capacity under
construction will provide an adequate check. This capacity will in any case
not be fully available on the system much before the end of 1995. I
therefore proposed that National Power and PowerGen should undertake to use
all reasonable endeavours to negotiate the sale or disposal of about 4,000MW
and 2,000MW respectively of coal-fired or oil-fired generation plant for
operation in the England and Wales market within two years.
Such an increase in competition in generation would help to prevent prices
being held above a competitive level, provide greater choice and protection
for customers, and promote greater competition in supply.
I proposed that National Power and PowerGen should each undertake to bid
into the pool in such a way that, under reasonable assumptions of other
generators' bids and taking seasonal fluctuations into account, average
annual pool purchase price would in normal circumstances reasonably be
expected not to exceed 2.4p/kWh time-weighted and 2.55p/kWh demand-weighted
(both in October 1993 prices).
They should also undertake to agree prices in new electricity
supply-and-purchase contracts consistent with this, plus where applicable a
reasonable hedge against pool purchase price and a reasonable allowance for
uplift and their supply business costs.
These undertakings would represent reductions in pool purchase price of up
to 7 per cent from the levels obtaining so far this financial year.
Moreover, these reduced prices would be held for two full years. On this
basis, the reductions in average pool prices associated with these
undertakings would yield benefits to customers of up to Pounds 500m over the
next two years.
These benefits derive from a general reduction in pool prices rather than
from the revenues of National Power and PowerGen alone.
I have satisfied myself that such reductions in pool and short-term contract
prices would not reduce the revenues of National Power and PowerGen below
such a level. As to other generators, I am satisfied that these prices would
be above avoidable cost and not predatory or otherwise anti-competitive.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Industrial users to gain most from 7% reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All electricity consumers should benefit from yesterday's agreement, but big
industrial users will see the greatest gains. For smaller companies and
households, the difference will be small or negligible.
The agreement will reduce average pool prices by 7 per cent, but this saving
will go directly only to large companies, such as ICI and Blue Circle, that
buy electricity straight from the wholesale market and have been badgering
the government to force power prices down. There will also be savings for
companies that have contracts with distributors whose price is based on the
pool price.
The saving will be diluted for the great majority of smaller industrial
users, which buy their power from electricity distributors. In this market,
the pool price only accounts for about half the final price because other
distribution costs are added. However, from April 1995, smaller companies
will be able to negotiate their own terms with electricity distributors, so
they may be able to wrest some of this saving for themselves.
For private households, the pool price accounts for less than a third of the
quarterly bill, so a cut of 7 per cent would translate into a saving of
about 2 per cent.
However even this is unlikely because regional electricity distributors buy
their power from the generators under long-term contracts whose prices have
already been fixed.
Britain's electricity prices are about average for Europe, according to the
Electricity Association, the trade group, though its figures have often been
challenged by user groups. And yesterday's agreement will not alter the
ranking dramatically.
With an average industrial electricity price of 5.3p per unit, the UK is
well behind Germany with 7.6p but well above Denmark with 4.2p. Household
electricity is below the EU average at 9.3p in a range extending from
Belgium with 13p to Greece with 7.7p.
Even so, electricity distributors are under mounting pressure both from
politicians and from Prof Stephen Littlechild, their regulator, to reduce
electricity bills. Last week the National Consumer Council accused the
electricity industry of making 'unjustified' price increases of 13 per cent
between 1990 and 1993.
The Electricity Association's own figures show that while prices levelled
out in the 1980s, they closely tracked the rising retail price index once
privatisation was on the cards.
While the distribution companies have not cut their prices, they have tried
to woo customers with price freezes and rebates. On Monday, Eastern
Electricity, the largest of them, announced Pounds 50m of rebates. Eastern
claimed that its customers had seen a rise of 6.1 per cent, including
rebates, since privatisation against an increase of 15.4 per cent in the RPI
over the same period.

FT  12 FEB 94 / No stampede in power station sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no immediate rush yesterday to buy the power stations that
National Power and PowerGen have agreed to sell. This was partly because the
agreement includes measures to hold down the price of electricity, making
investment in the business less attractive.
Another reason is that the two are likely to prove tough bargainers with
future competitors. Being financially strong, they are also not interested
in transforming more assets into low-yielding cash.
Mr Christopher Rowland, utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch, who tried
unsuccessfully last year to buy a power station from the generators, said he
thought a foreign purchaser was most likely.
A generator from the US or continental Europe might be willing to exchange
stations to gain a foothold in the UK. This would also give the UK
generators a way to enter other markets.
Among potential UK buyers, analysts pointed to British Gas, which is being
forced to yield part of its market. Others might include the Scottish
electricity companies. Scottish Hydro-Electric said: 'We shall be looking at
the opportunities this announcement brings.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / PM asks top brains to enter industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday appealed for more of Britain's best brains to enter
industry and said more should be heard of the country's 'remarkable'
business successes, Andrew Baxter and David Owen write.
The prime minister said there was one school of thought which regarded
manufacturing as marginal, but a second saw it as fundamental. 'I take my
stand with the second school,' he said. 'I don't regard manufacturing as a
Cinderella industry. Making things matters.'
Mr Major was speaking at a lunch in St Ives, Cambs, to mark the 25th
anniversary of the Caparo Group, the steel and engineering business founded
by Dr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman. His speech came as senior
cabinet ministers praised the state of the economy and attacked Labour
policies for business.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour's
revelation that it believed Britain needed a business plan, would 'send
shivers down the spine' of anyone remembering the 'corporatist' policies of
the 1960s and 1970s.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the policies Labour
had signed up to would result in a huge burden on business and an end to
economic recovery.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Major to reassure Yeltsin over air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will seek to persuade Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
that threatened air strikes against Serbian forces do not signal a break
with the west's commitment to a negotiated settlement in Bosnia.
British officials said Mr Major, who arrives in Moscow on Monday for two
days of talks with the Russian government, would tell Mr Yeltsin that there
was no question of Nato 'taking sides' in the civil war.
Amid anger in Moscow over the Nato ultimatum, Mr Major will stress his view
that US commitment to a more active role in the search for a settlement will
enhance the prospects of an agreement.
He will also emphasise the limited nature of the threat to use military
force against the Serbian forces besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
In spite of denials from Downing Street, senior British ministers confirmed
yesterday that Britain had backed the Nato warning to the Serbs only under
intense pressure from the US administration.
Mr Major plans to deliver a calculated snub to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
ultra-nationalist leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic party, during his
visit. Officials said that representatives of all the main parties in the
Russian parliament had been invited to meet Mr Major at a reception at the
British embassy - except Mr Zhirinovsky.
In spite of the British prime minister's determination to emphasise western
support for Mr Yeltsin, he will deliver a firm warning that the Russian
leader must not slow the pace of economic reform. Mr Major will also signal
his desire for faster progress towards a market economy by holding talks
with Mr Yegor Gaidar. Mr Gaidar, the architect of the reform process, last
month refused to serve in Mr Yeltsin's government.
Officials said that Mr Major wanted to reinforce the message delivered last
month by President Bill Clinton of the US that western financial support for
President Yeltsin depends on the reform process continuing. The British
prime minister is expected to sign new political and economic agreements to
strengthen ties between the two countries.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, plans to combine the Moscow trip
with a meeting with the leaders of the three Baltic states in the Latvian
capital of Riga. This is said by officials to be the first visit by any
foreign secretary to the Baltic states.

FT  12 FEB 94 / BMA told to stop issuing private health fees guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday accepted a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
recommendation that the British Medical Association should stop publishing
fee guidelines for consultants' private practice.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said an MMC investigation had
established that, by following the guidelines, consultants could 'charge
higher fees than would otherwise be possible'.
The BMA immediately agreed to cease publication and distribution of its
guidelines, but attacked the decision as perverse.
It said the MMC's own research showed that 70 per cent of the private
healthcare market was influenced by the fees schedules of Bupa, the biggest
medical insurer, and other provident associations. The MMC decided that
publication of the Bupa fee scales could continue.
It found in its report, published yesterday, that a complex monopoly under
the 1973 Fair Trading Act existed because of the way some National Health
Service consultants fixed their charges for private work by reference to the
BMA or Bupa guidelines.
In 1992, says the report, about 6,600 consultants followed the Bupa benefit
maxima and 3,400 the BMA guidelines. Both were treated by the consultants as
tariffs, with the doctors setting at least half their charges within 2 per
cent of the BMA or Bupa figures.
The report recommends prohibiting publication of the BMA guidelines and
introducing greater clarity into the setting of consultants' charges.
It concludes that Bupa's published scales were not sufficiently connected
with the consultants who acted on them to be included in the complex
monopoly. A distinction should be drawn between insurers' benefits, 'the
publication of which we accept is a proper step for the carrying out of
their function as insurers', and the BMA guidelines 'which are designed to
help organise the market'.
Given the relatively weak position of patients in the private healthcare
market, says the report, Bupa and the other insurers were the principal
counterweight to the consultants. The Bupa benefits maxima, which were
generally lower than the BMA guidelines, 'have had a restraining effect on
consultants' charges'.
The issue of private consultants' fees was referred to the MMC in September
1992, after concerns over the introduction of the BMA guidelines in 1989.
Most treatment in private hospitals is carried out by NHS consultants. About
two-thirds of their charges are financed by medical insurance, which covers
about 12 per cent of the population.
Many consultants, says the report, find price competition distasteful or
even unethical.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Declaration on peace a failure, says Molyneaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, claimed yesterday
that the Downing Street declaration aimed at securing peace in Northern
Ireland had failed and he urged the British government to press on with
talks aimed at securing a political settlement in the province.
Mr Molyneaux's remarks described the London-Dublin initiative as an
experiment which had obviously failed. While the two governments might not
be ready to admit it, he was prepared to transmit the message 'loud and
clear'.
In a BBC interview he echoed the complaints of other Ulster politicians over
the decision by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to put his
proposals for a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland to the government of
the Irish Republic before constitutional parties in the north had been given
the opportunity to help in its formulation.
The government yesterday continued its efforts to step up its initiative
among the constitutional parties when Sir Patrick met Dr John Alderdice,
leader of the Alliance party.
After the meeting, during which Dr Alderdice was briefed on the ideas
submitted to Dublin, he said the session had been 'reasonably useful'.
Sir Patrick is expected to see Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic
and Labour party, early next week.
Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, again attacked the
joint declaration as a bar to further political progress. But in a
by-election for Belfast City Council yesterday, before which the DUP had
campaigned on a rejection of the declaration, Mr Paisley's party suffered a
fall in its share of the vote.
A continuation of the conflict in Northern Ireland will cost the British and
Irish governments an estimated IPounds 450m (Pounds 433m) per year with 75
per cent of the cost falling upon Britain, according to a study published
yesterday by DKM economic consultants in Dublin, Tim Coone writes.
DKM estimates that the greatest savings, in peacetime, would accrue in
security costs, amounting to IPounds 222m in the province and IPounds 91m in
the republic.

FT  12 FEB 94 / MGN pension case dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capel-Cure Myers, the securities house, has dropped its Pounds 6m legal
action against Credit Suisse arising from CCM's litigation with the Mirror
Group Newspapers pension scheme trustees over the Maxwell affair.
Capel-Cure Myers, one of the fund managers which acted for the MGN pension
scheme, had begun proceedings against Credit Suisse for alleged breach of
trust over the handling of assets it had passed to the bank.
The decision to settle is a direct consequence of last month's out-of-court
settlement of the main litigation when Capel-Cure Myers, Invesco Asset
Management and Lehman Brothers agreed to pay a total of Pounds 32m to the
pension fund trustees. Of this, Capel-Cure Myers paid Pounds 6m, Lehmans
Pounds 15m and Invesco Pounds 11m.
Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, Credit Suisse has continued not
to admit any liability. However, both sides have agreed to fund their own
legal costs.
A joint statement from Capel-Cure Myers and Credit Suisse said:
'Participation in the settlement is a commercial judgment by both parties
who believe this course of action to be in the best interests of their

Preliminary High Court hearings had begun earlier this week but were
adjourned whilst the out-of-court talks that led to the settlement were

FT  12 FEB 94 / City jitters on Clarke's cut in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's the first mistake Clarke has made,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, currency
strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation. The rest of the City seems to feel the
same about Tuesday's quarter-point cut in interest rates.
Mr O'Neill added: 'We're all entitled to one (mistake), but it undermines
the idea that he and Eddie (George, governor of the Bank of England) have
got it all worked out.'
Mr Derek Scott of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Eddie George and Ken Clarke
do not have the credibility of Alan Greenspan (the chairman of the US
Federal Reserve). It all depends now on whether Clarke will take pre-emptive
action to stamp out inflation.'
But if the City is jittery, Tory backbenchers are more confident about Mr
Clarke's stewardship of the economy - whatever they feel about his politics.
Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil
service committee, said yesterday that the Budget statement had been 'about
right' and well presented.
Like many at Westminster, he admires Mr Clarke's direct style but he is also
concerned about the chancellor's approach - he can occasionally 'charge into
a room and drop a scatter-grenade', Mr Watts said.
He believes the chancellor was unwise to tell a recent meeting of the
committee that the Budget had put an additional 7p on income tax. It played
into the hands of the opposition, Mr Watts said.

FT  12 FEB 94 / IMF support for Jordan hangs on controversial tax reform
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jordan's government this weekend embarks on a final attempt to implement a
controversial sales tax after more than a year of postponements.
The tax is the last move in the kingdom's economic restructuring programme,
sponsored by the International Monetary Fund. Its implementation is
essential for continued IMF support and further debt-rescheduling talks with
the country's creditors.
The tax, supposed to be a first step towards full value added tax, aims to
spread the burden of indirect taxes to make way for an eventual reduction in
the kingdom's high custom tariffs and protectionism. For the moment though,
it is to replace and expand the current consumption tax.
The draft, to be presented today to parliament, has three rates: 10 per cent
for most goods, 20 per cent for luxury items, and zero for food and
medicine. This will supplant a cumbersome eleven-rate consumption tax which
is levied on a limited list of consumer goods.
The government is trying to sell the reform as a 'neutral' tax which will
raise neither prices nor government revenues. But the private sector is not
convinced. Having successfully lobbied for its postponement throughout 1993,
it is appealing to parliament to block the sales tax altogether. One MP, Mrs
Toujan Feisal, had already called on the public to take to the streets in
opposition to the tax.
Local businessmen say they are already taxed heavily and the implementation
of a sales tax will hinder economic growth. The Chambers of Industry and
Commerce are pushing hard for a reduction in the general rate to 5 per cent
among other things. 'My concern is that the tax will increase the burden on
the citizens and have a negative effect on the economy as a whole,' argues
Mr Khaldum Abu Hassan of the Amman Chamber of Industry.
However, Mr Sami Gammoh, the finance minister, says the reform is necessary
to make Jordan more self-dependent. 'The whole philosophy of the sales tax
is that a wider base will allow government revenues to grow as the economy
grows,' he says. Jordan suffers from a budget deficit of 13 per cent of
gross domestic product, or a projected JD465m for 1994, which is mostly
covered by foreign aid. A prime objective of the IMF reform programme is to
reduce this to less than 3 per cent of GDP.
The government is nervous that a rejection of the sales tax would send the
wrong signal to the kingdom's creditors. Jordan's external debt of Dollars
6.8bn (Pounds 4.65bn) has one of the highest foreign debt-to-GDP ratios in
the world (129 per cent) and it is essential for the government to push the
tax through if it is to receive further assistance to support its fragile
economy.
The sales tax is the first of a number of economic reforms on the
government's agenda this year. The foreign investment law is also due to be
amended, or least made more transparent, in the next few months. This will
help facilitate non-Arab investment in the Amman stock exchange.
There are also plans to press on with privatisation. The national airline
Royal Jordanian is expected to announce this year a timetable for its sale.
The reform plans come amid the prospect of peace in the region and eventual
collaboration with a Palestinian entity and Israel. A recent World Bank
report concluded that Jordan would lose out unless it embarked on a
concerted effort of reform to reduce bureaucracy, loosen trade regulations,
and improve the climate for investment. But the sales-tax saga demonstrates
that such reforms will not be easy to push through.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Peace process is losing credibility says Arafat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TUNIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said
yesterday he was astonished at Thursday's statement by Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, that there were no sacred dates for implementing
the outline peace accord signed on September 13.
'I am astonished and very sorry to hear him say that. It is now nearly six
months since the agreement was reached in Oslo and five months since the
signing in Washington. Nothing has yet been implemented. What has been
signed on September 13 must be adhered to by both sides. It is very
important that we should quickly recover the credibility of the peace
process,' said Mr Arafat.
The PLO leader, interviewed at his headquarters in Tunis, also took issue
with Mr Rabin about the time needed to complete the present round of
negotiations, which has already been delayed well beyond the scheduled date
of December 13. He said that only 'some small items' needed to be finalised
by two committees meeting next week in Egypt and Paris.
Aides of Mr Arafat had been alarmed by Mr Rabin's statement that, despite
the successful conclusion of an agreement on the most important outstanding
issues in Cairo this week, at least another month might be required to
finish the negotiations over Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and
Jericho in the West Bank.
'The major problems have been resolved,' said Mr Arafat. He added that his
negotiations this week in Cairo with Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign
minister, had not been easy but they had eventually made the necessary
compromises. 'In my opinion if we continue working with the same attitude
then no more than two to three weeks is needed to sign the final agreement,'
he added.
Other PLO leaders in Tunis are becoming increasingly sceptical about Mr
Rabin's willingness to implement the Washington accord and complained that
new issues were constantly being raised in order to delay agreement. They
also sensed that Israeli army commanders were exerting greater influence and
feared that without external pressure from the US and members of the
European Union the start of Israel's withdrawal could be put off for several
more months.
Mr Arafat said yesterday that it was not his credibility that was at stake,
but that of the peace process. He also brushed aside criticism from
Palestinians in the occupied territories that he was abusing his authority
and failing to consult others.
'Such criticism is part of our democracy. I am not leading a herd of sheep,
but people who are freedom fighters,' he said. 'This criticism is proof that
we have democracy. They have the right to voice their opinions. And the fact
that they are saying these things shows that they wish to be fully involved
in the peace process, not that they are against it.'

FT  12 FEB 94 / EU withdraws offer to open up banana trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday withdrew its offer of increased access for
Latin American producers to the Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) European Union
banana market. The Commission's decision came as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade published a report condemning the EU's banana trade
arrangements.
The Commission's move is likely to sour relations between the EU and the
Latin American banana producers even further. Five Latin American exporters
have complained to Gatt about the EU's preferential trade arrangements for
bananas with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
The Gatt report yesterday upheld the Latin Americans' complaint, saying that
trade with ACP countries under the Lome convention is outside Gatt rules.
But since the adoption of the report can be blocked by any other Gatt
member, it will almost certainly not be acted upon.
To try to head off the Gatt report, the Commission had offered the Latin
Americans improved access to the banana market as long as they withdrew
their complaint. But the improved offer of an import ceiling for bananas of
2.1m tonnes this year rising to 2.2m tonnes in 1995 was rejected by Costa
Rica and Guatemala.
Costa Rica is looking for additional concessions. 'If we have to operate
under an illegal system without fair trade, we want to make sure our growers
get the best deal,' said Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign minister.
Ironically, now that the EU and Latin Americans have failed to reach
agreement on improved access, the banana regime implemented last July will
remain in place. This leaves the Latin American producers worse off.
However, some member countries led by Germany also oppose the EU's banana
trade regime - Germany has lodged a complaint with the European Court. The
Costa Ricans are hoping Germany will back them in pushing for a more open EU
banana trade.

FT  12 FEB 94 / US rice makes Tokyo debut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers crowded yesterday around a pile of packed Californian rice at a
Tokyo supermarket (pictured above) as US rice went on sale for the first
time at big supermarkets in Japan on a trial basis. The American rice was
being sold for Y1,850 (Pounds 11.78) per 5kg pack, about 10 per cent cheaper
than Japanese rice.
The import of foreign rice has been a serious political issue in Japan,
provoking protests from farmers. Japan's refusal to import rice has also
been a point of contention between the US and Japan in the context of the
Gatt Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation negotiations.
It reached the point where the round, which was largely completed after more
than seven years of talks, might have come to a halt over the rice imports.
However, to a great extent Tokyo's hand has been forced by a poor harvest
last year, which according to estimates by the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture fell by about 25 per cent to 9.7m tonnes.
Japan announced in September that typhoons and a cold summer would force it
to import at least 1m tonnes. The international rice industry has since
estimated that it might be in the market for up to 3m tonnes. Japan's entry
to the rice import market has triggered a near doubling in international
prices since September.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Murdoch to set up Indian TV company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday announced plans
to set up Star India, a separate television company in India, to augment his
Hong Kong-based Star TV.
Mr Murdoch, who met Mr Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, ruled out
any interest in Indian print media.
However, he is keen to expand his Star TV operations in India, which, with
an estimated 60m viewers, has emerged as Star's largest market since China
closed its doors on the network. Mr Murdoch attributes his interest in India
to the fact that the country guarantees media freedom and there is great
potential for advertising revenue.
The new company would be set up within a year, and be controlled by News
Corporation. 'We will be looking for investments with leading film and
software producers in India. And one day, we will build our own major
studios here,' he said.
Soon after he had acquired the controlling stake in Star TV in July last
year, Mr Murdoch bought 49.9 per cent of Asia Today, a Bombay-based company
which transmits Zee, a Hindi language channel transmitted alongside Star's
five channels.
Mr Murdoch also expressed keenness to start separate regional language
channels, including one in Hindi.
Mr Murdoch is using his week-long visit to Delhi and Bombay to meet
ministers, MPs, politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists. This week, he
met President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister,
and Mr Lal Krishan Advani, the president of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya
Janata party, besides Mr Rao.
Mr Rao cautioned that Indian society was very unlike the west, and that Mr
Murdoch's broadcasting needed to take that into account.
'The Indian government has welcomed Mr Murdoch very warmly, but he must
realise that this does not mean he has a carte blanche to do what he likes
here,' said an official in the prime minister's office.
The government, which accepted Mr Murdoch's gift of Dollars 10,000 to the
prime minister's National Relief Fund yesterday, has not been very happy
with Star's increasing audience - an estimated 10,000 households are added
every day in India - which undermines the influence of Doordarshan, the
state-owned network.

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, yesterday gave the strongest hint
so far that Israel might have to abandon certain settlements in the occupied
territories as implementation of Palestinian self-rule draws near.
Mr Peres' remarks, made on Israel Radio, will be welcomed by Palestinians
who see settlements in the occupied territories as a thorn in the side of
the peace process. But his statement will create a fierce backlash among
Israeli settlers who fear the government eventually intends evacuating
settlements from Palestinian lands.
Mr Peres said it was time to question whether some settlements should be
abandoned in the interests of making peace with Palestinians, although
Israel would not be forced to evacuate settlers under the pressure of
negotiations.
'What is the point of maintaining a settlement with 28 families that needs
workers from Thailand, that needs an army platoon to guard them, needs to
have their road guarded by patrols? Where is the logic? What is the point?'
he said.
Mr Peres was specifically referring to Netzarim, a tiny isolated settlement
in the heart of the Gaza Strip. In off-the-record remarks other ministers in
the government have said that Netzarim may have to be sacrificed.
Under the September Israeli-Palestinian peace accord all 125,000 settlers
living in the West Bank and Gaza are to remain in the occupied territories
and come under Israeli law. Palestinians say the existence of settlements,
particularly the 16 settlements housing 4,500 Israelis in Gaza, is a moral
outrage and could prove to be a flashpoint of future violence undermining
the peace process.
Already the peace process has got bogged down over complicated security
arrangements for the settlers in Gaza.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Koran-quoting businessmen campaign to work on Friday:
Pakistan's government is being pressed to switch the day of rest from Friday
back to Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Hasten earnestly to the remembrance of God, and leave off Business: That is
best for you, if ye but knew. And when the Prayer is finished, then may ye
disperse through the land, and seek of the bounty of God.'
These are the verses of the Koran - the Islamic holy book - which are being
quoted by a growing number of Pakistani businessmen who want their
government to change the weekly holiday from Friday to Sunday.
Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime minister toppled in a coup in 1977
and hanged two years later, changed the day of rest from Sunday to Friday
shortly before his downfall, in addition to other steps towards Islamisation
of the country, such as prohibition of alcohol. Those steps were introduced
in response to pressure from Islamic clerics who were leading an
anti-government campaign at the time.
But now, some businessmen want the government led by the late premier's
daughter, Ms Benazir Bhutto, to reverse the decision. If that happens, they
stand to gain from another day of dealings with businesses across Asia and
the western world. They argue that the Koranic verses only suggest the
closure of business during the Friday afternoon prayers, to allow Moslems to
attend prayer meetings, rather than observing it as a sabbath-style day of
rest.
'When the time for Jumu'a (Friday) prayer comes, close your business and
answer the summons loyally and earnestly, meet earnestly, pray, consult and
learn by social contact: when the meeting is over, scatter and go about your
business,' wrote Mr Abdullah Yusuf Ali, a famous Islamic scholar, in his
widely-read translation of the Koranic verses. Such interpretations have
only added to the determination of businesses seeking the change.
'Having the Friday holiday, we are cut off for 40 per cent of the week,'
says Mr Haji Ghani, a leading stockbroker at the Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE), Pakistan's largest stock market. Mr Ghani is among brokers who
support the change.
They argue that the market is in contact with big western markets for only
three days a week. For them, a normal working day on Thursday is a partial
waste due to the time difference with Europe and North America, because the
KSE closes before those markets open.
'The change will help to improve Pakistan's exports and improve our business
prospects,' says Mr Mian Habibullah, a leading Pakistani industrialist who
was recently appointed as the chairman of the government's Export Promotion
Bureau.
A growing number of business chambers and trade associations are either
formally or informally joining the call. Some have written letters to the
government seeking the change, while others are trying to lobby local MPs in
an effort to seek support.
Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, the commerce minister, concedes that there is a growing
pressure from the business community, but adds that the government cannot
reverse the decision, unless the issue gains national attention and there is
widespread support.
'They (businessmen) are building a lobby. I am sure that whenever there is
pressure from one community, and if they are able to convince the government
that Friday should not be a holiday, with the passage of time the government
may be forced to rethink,' he says.
Mr Mukhtar says that ultimately the government may seek guidance from the
National Council of Islamic Ideology. But he adds that it would only
consider doing so if the pressure intensifies further.
The government's caution is largely based on expected resistance from
Islamic nationalists, many of whom are convinced that the Friday holiday
should be retained in recognition of the day's traditional significance for
rest and prayers. 'I don't see any religious objection, yet its a very
important cultural issue,' says Mr Khurshid Ahmed, a leading scholar on
Islamic economics and a senator from the religious Jamaat-i-Islami party.
'It's a question of historical tradition, and from that viewpoint, there is
no reason for the Moslem world to just neglect its own traditions and
blindly follow the western tradition,' says Mr Ahmed. He is also convinced
that the change would carry few economic benefits.
Despite the large time difference between Japan and the US, the two
countries are still able to do business, which shows that such time
difference is not really a serious restriction in development of business
relations, he says. Mr Ahmed warns the government against a political
backlash if it takes steps to accept the demand from businesses.

<TEXT>
Serb and Moslem forces yesterday began handing over their heavy artillery to
UN peacekeeping troops in Sarajevo, as a new ceasefire held for a day
following intermittent shelling and sniper fire on Thursday night.
The UN commander in Bosnia, Lt-General Sir Michael Rose, said he was
'reasonably satisfied' with the ceasefire, but accused 'renegade military
units' of trying to sabotage it.
'A comparatively small number of rounds have been fired since the start of
the ceasefire - as far as I can judge, as many out of the city as into the
city,' Gen Rose said. Serb and Moslem forces blamed each other for the
violations, but the UN said both sides were guilty.
A UN spokesman said the Serb artillery would be collected at an army
barracks close to Sarajevo airport before being transferred out of the city.
The Moslem weapons, fewer in number, were being taken to another barracks in
the city centre.
The Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo agreed to place their heavy
weapons under UN control, in response to a Nato threat of air strikes,
provided their Bosnian Moslem antagonists did the same.
Despite concern over whether the ceasefire would hold, following bursts of
shelling on the city's outskirts, more UN troops yesterday took up positions
between the Serb and Moslem-led Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, who visited Sarajevo yesterday,
said he believed the Bosnian Serbs took the threat of air strikes seriously.
'I think they are now conscious of the danger facing them,' he said.
Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator at peace talks in Geneva between
the three warring parties, was unusually optimistic in his assessment. 'You
are seeing the demilitarisation of a 20 km exclusion zone in Sarajevo,' he
said. 'You can then go on to discuss the details of UN administration and
total demilitarisation of Sarajevo district.'
However, Bosnian Serb forces yesterday stepped up the shelling of other
Moslem enclaves in Bosnia under UN protection, according to local radio
stations.
There was heavy shelling of Bihac, in north-western Bosnia, while Serb tanks
and artillery moved against nearby Cazin, causing heavy casualties, Bihac
radio reported.
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva
said that three international aid workers detained by Bosnian Serbs in Banja
Luka were expected to be released today.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in Geneva for the peace talks,
has guaranteed the safety of aid workers. Bosnian Serb officials at their
headquarters in Pale, near Sarajevo, played down suggestions that the aid
workers were being held because of the threat of air strikes.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has remained silent on the Nato
ultimatum while public opinion in Belgrade appears sceptical that the air
strikes threat will be carried out. Mr Vuk Draskovic, leader of the main
opposition coalition, said the ultimatum would not bring peace in Bosnia,
but welcomed the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo as 'the very
least that should be done by both sides'.

Hungary yesterday hardened its opposition to international action against
the Serbs, saying it would bar overflights by Nato surveillance aircraft in
the event of an air strike against Bosnian Serb positions.
Awacs airborne radar aircraft have been flying over Hungary since late 1992,
but the Budapest Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Hungary had agreed to
overflights only for aircraft monitoring the no-fly zone over Bosnia.
'Awacs aircraft cannot be present in Hungarian airspace if it (an attack)
takes place, that is natural,' Mr Peter Boross, the Hungarian prime
minister, said yesterday. 'Hungary will not take part. We have to live with
Serbia and the Serbian people for hundreds more years.'
Mr Boross also said that sanctions against Serbia were ineffective, adding
to bitter government complaints that the embargo had cost Hungary Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), for which the international community had failed to make
compensation.
Mr Boross's statement, which western diplomats described as a 'departure',
coincides with a warming in Hungary's relations with Serbia. At the end of
January, Mr Geza Jeszenszky, the Hungarian foreign minister, met President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade. Hungary said it was taking a
'pragmatic' approach to relations with Serbia, but Belgrade hailed the visit
as a breakthrough in bilateral relations.
Hungary maintains that its policy is unchanged and strenuously denies the
suggestion that it is breaking ranks with the international community to
conclude a separate tacit arrangement with Serbia.
The Foreign Ministry said Hungary was seeking integration into western
institutions and could not risk its 'clean record and credibility'.
A rapprochement with Serbia, however, would ease the plight of the 400,000
ethnic Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Hungary fears they
are vulnerable to 'silent ethnic cleansing'.
Budapest has also asked Serbia to allow shipping to travel unhindered down
the Danube to guarantee landlocked Hungary's vital waterway access to the
Black Sea.

FT  12 FEB 94 / French public pressing for action

<TEXT>
The French government's high-pressure tactics to lift the Sarajevo siege,
reinforced by yesterday's dispatch of two ministers and the aircraft carrier
Foch to the Adriatic, are rooted in a growing domestic demand for firm
action.
An Ipsos opinion poll in today's Le Point magazine showed that 70 per cent
of the French believe their country's forces should participate in air
strikes on Serb positions. Some 54 per cent said Nato should bomb the Serbs
anyway, while 55 per cent said France 'should accept the risk of French
military losses' in possible Serb reprisals.
French forces in former Yugoslavia have already suffered 18 dead and 281
wounded, with about half the casualties the direct result of the war, as
distinct from accidents. This toll is not surprising, given that France - in
addition to the 2,600 troops steaming towards the Adriatic in the Foch naval
task force - has 5,793 in former Yugoslavia, 4,077 of them in Bosnia -
nearly half the UN total.
Almost as if to remind his frustrated countrymen that they were not going to
war, Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, underlined yesterday on his way
to Sarajevo that 'there is no military solution to the conflict.' The Nato
aim was not to 'throw the Serbs out of Sarajevo, where they have been for
centuries. . . but to remove the artillery batteries which are bombarding
it'.
The overnight shelling showed that ceasefires could 'only be a scrap of
paper unless the artillery was removed', he said.
France's frustration at its troops being sniped at and humiliated in
Sarajevo has hardened into a stronger desire for intervention than was
evident in the Gulf war, though the National Front and the communist parties
remain opposed to such action.
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the left-winger who resigned as defence minister
over French participation in the Gulf war, said this week he recognised the
need to threaten air strikes in Bosnia. A factor in his attitude, and that
of many French, may be that France is now leading the US into Bosnia, in
contrast to US leadership in the Gulf.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United States is expected to play a much greater role in pushing forward
the Geneva peace talks on the former Yugoslavia now that Washington has
backed the use of Nato air strikes against Serb-held positions around
Sarajevo, diplomats said yesterday.
The US seems likely to use its influence to try to persuade the Bosnian
government to accept the latest peace plan, they said.
'If the US wants to co-operate - and we need all the help we can get - it is
very welcome,' said an official involved in the peace negotiations headed by
Lord Owen and Mr Thorwald Stoltenberg. Mr Charles Redman, Washington's
special envoy, has been attending the recent round of talks in Geneva.
Any greater US involvement would give weight to the Geneva talks, despite
sharp differences of policy and style between President Bill Clinton and
Lord Owen. Last year, the Vance-Owen peace plan was openly rejected by the
Clinton administration on the grounds that the Serbs were being rewarded for
grabbing territory while the Bosnian Moslems were being left with an
unviable state. The US however failed to put in place any alternative peace
plan.
In Washington, officials denied the administration was shifting its policy.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said the US was not trying to
force the Bosnian Moslems to accept the plan. 'The idea that we would try to
force a settlement on them which they would not be comfortable with would be
just flat wrong,' she said.
The current plan, which envisages the creation of three ethnic mini-states
within a notional republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, has been partly rejected
by the Bosnian government. The Bosnians would be given a third of the
territory, the Serbs over a half, and the remainder allocated to the Croats.
All three sides have agreed that the Sarajevo government can have a
99-year-lease for the use of the Adriatic port of Ploce and access to the
port on the Neretva River, both crucial for conducting international trade
for the new Bosnian state.
But diplomats yesterday said a serious dispute over the status of 15
regions, mostly in eastern and north-eastern Bosnia, has prevented an
overall agreement. The Bosnians argue that the swathes of territory being
allotted to them by the negotiators are not a viable geographical entity.
As a means of creating such a state, the Bosnian government is proposing
that refugees who were forced to flee should be allowed to return to the
disputed territories. But the negotiators say this would mean more land
would have to be granted to the Bosnian government, while the Serbs, for
their part, yesterday said they would not make any more compromises.
Despite the threats of walk-outs, all three sides held bilateral talks
yesterday on the disputed regions, and today, the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian
Serbs will meet. 'We do not expect agreement in the coming days. So much
also depends on what happens on the ground, especially in Sarajevo,' an
official said.

<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday
agreed to work together to end the bloodshed in Bosnia, according to Mr
Clinton, speaking after a telephone conversation with Mr Yeltsin, Reuter
reports from Washington.
'We had a very good talk, and we agreed that we had the same long-term
objective, which is achieving a just peace agreement, and the same
short-term objective, relieving the shelling of Sarajevo, and we agreed
there would be further discussions today at the UN,' Mr Clinton said.
However, the United Nations Security Council, which was scheduled to meet on
Bosnia late yesterday, postponed its meeting until Monday. The meeting is
expected to discuss differing viewpoints, but not to issue any resolutions.
Russian parliamentary leaders have bitterly criticised Nato's threat of air
strikes in Bosnia. Mr Yeltsin has made no public comment on the ultimatum,
but he is clearly under pressure to prevent any use of force against the
Serbs, traditional Russian allies.

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas was yesterday acquitted on charges of
misusing a previous state office after the prosecution asked that the
charges against her be dropped, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
The case almost certainly means that Ms Hutchison, a Republican elected last
year to fill out the unexpired term of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now treasury
secretary, will be easily returned in November to a full six years in the
Senate. She was only the 10th sitting senator in US history to face criminal
prosecution.
The state withdrew its case after the judge had refused to rule on the
admissibility of certain evidence concerning the charges that Ms Hutchison
had misued her previous office as Texas treasurer for personal and campaign
purposes.

Talks to head off a strike in the German engineering industry collapsed last
night, with both sides accusing each other of a refusal to compromise,
writes Quentin Peel from Darmstadt.
Attempts to agree on more flexible working hours, as an alternative to the
current 36-hour week, failed, in spite of 10 hours of negotiations between
leaders of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and Gesamtmetall, the
employers' federation.
The union is keen to see a temporary reduction in working hours, as an
alternative to more redundancies in the recession-hit industry, but without
a full cut in earnings.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, leader of IG Metall, said no date had been set for further
negotiations, before the union is due to decide on February 21 on calling a
strike ballot.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the employers' leader, said they were prepared to
open the current wage contract to reduce working hours to 30 per week in
extreme cases, but the union was insisting on some compensation to maintain
earnings.

The Italian government yesterday approved a decree providing L800bn (Pounds
324m) to restructure the steel industry in order to comply with production
cuts agreed with the EU, writes Robert Graham from Rome. The approval came
in advance of Monday's important meeting in Brussels which will review
progress in implementing last December's agreement on reducing capacity in
the European steel industry.
It also came on the day that preliminary bidding closed for the
privatisation of Ilva, the state steel concern. Bids are being made on the
basis of Ilva being split into two groups - flat products and special
steels. The government undertook last December to complete the privatisation
this year.
The decree is mainly concerned with private-sector steel producers and
provides a series of financial aids and fiscal incentives to cut production
and switch to other product lines. The L800bn will be available for the
period 1994-97.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's main opposition party, Fine Gael, has been thrown into disarray
following a challenge to Mr John Bruton, the party leader, from four
frontbenchers within his party.
The move comes in the build-up to the European elections and follows the
publication of an opinion poll which shows support for the party at its
lowest in 70 years, and Mr Bruton trailing all other party leaders in his
personal popularity with the electorate.
The four frontbenchers asked Mr Bruton to resign on Thursday evening, and
when he refused they handed in their own resignations. A parliamentary party
meeting is to vote next Tuesday on whether Mr Bruton will continue as
leader. If he loses, it will be the third change at the top of the party
since 1987.
Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support, but
since the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January
1993, it has had difficulty deciding whether to become more social democrat
in outlook, or turn further to the right.
The opinion poll, in the Irish Times last Monday, showed Fine Gael with only
16 per cent support, down from 25 per cent at the time of the last general
election in November 1992 when the party lost 10 seats in the Dail
(parliament).
Mr Bruton, who became party leader in 1990, survived a confidence vote last
year. He said yesterday: 'I am defending the integrity of the Fine Gael's
party positions. I am fighting for a party that will take a decision, stick
to that decision and implement it, in other words for a party that can be
taken seriously.'
Last October Mr Des O'Malley resigned as leader of the other main opposition
party, the Progressive Democrats, and was replaced by Ms Mary Harney. The
latest opinion poll shows Ms Harney is currently Ireland's most popular
politician, alongside Mr Albert Reynolds the prime minister.

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gasprom, the monopoly Russian gas producer on which most of the former
Soviet states depend for their gas supplies, yesterday threatened to cut off
exports to the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The company said it was owed Rbs10.5bn from Estonia, Rbs32bn from Latvia and
Rbs51bn from Lithuania - 'enough grounds to stop supply of energy for
non-payment even at a time when the coldest weather is upon us.'
Temperatures have plunged sharply in the last two weeks, to an expected  -
30 degrees in Moscow this weekend and to even lower levels in the Baltics.
At the same time, Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, appealed to Mr
Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, to 'use his authority' to
force payment of energy debts, now totalling Rbs12,000bn. These debts have
risen by more than six times in the past year.
He said the energy sector was faced with twin crises of underinvestment and
soaring debts. Oil output fell to 354m tonnes last year - down 11 per cent
on 1992; gas output decreased by 23bn cu metres, or 3.6 per cent on the
previous year; and coal production was down 31m tonnes to 306m tonnes.
Much of the reason for the falling output was the sharp fall in investment,
he said, down by 27 per cent last year and by 200 per cent in the past five
years. Mr Shafranik emphasised that energy accounted for 38 per cent of
budget income and 60 per cent of the state's hard currency revenues.
The energy crisis was further dramatised yesterday with the publication of
details of an incident last December when an aircraft carrying President
Boris Yeltsin was put into danger when it lost radio contact with the ground
because electricity supplies to the radar facility near Rostov-on-Don were
cut off for non-payment of the bill.
Mr Gennady Bocharov, an Izvestiya correspondent, said the power was cut off
at a time when there were a large numbers of Russian and foreign planes in
southern regional airspace.
Mr Bocharov said that, while details of the incident were suppressed, the
power was again cut two days later. In the second period of power failure,
an aircraft carrying Mr Sergei Shakhrai, then a deputy prime minister, was
also put in danger.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, holding a meeting separately with leaders of the
mineworkers, promised them yet again that the government would pay back
wages, unpaid in some cases since the beginning of winter.
He ordered the Ministry of Finance to pay Rbs1,000bn in back pay - but said
an agreement on pay and prices was required in the industry to help address
the soaring budget deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French fishermen are planning demonstrations in Brittany ports today in
support of a two-week strike which has disrupted fish imports and drawn
protests from trading partners, writes John Ridding in Paris.
The demonstrations follow a vote on Thursday to continue strike action,
despite concessions from the government which include aid packages worth
FFr450m (Pounds 51.5m) and the imposition of minimum price controls by the
European Commission.
The striking fishermen are demanding an emergency meeting with Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, and further measures to protect themselves
against what they describe as unfair competition from cheap imports.
Government measures to placate the fishermen, however, have already run into
opposition from trading partners. The US has sent a written complaint about
the blocking of imports, following a decision by Paris to implement rigid

The US embassy in Paris said US fish imports had been blocked at Charles De
Gaulle airport and tonnes of fish had started to rot.
Norway said the situation facing its fish exporters had largely returned to
normal, following a decision to include members of the European Free Trade
Area on the list of countries excluded from certification procedures at
customs posts. But the Norwegian embassy said the situation was still
confused and lorry drivers were wary of bringing cargo into the country.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Slovak premier struggling after defections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Slovakia's coalition government was yesterday fighting for survival after a
series of defections left the prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, without a
working majority in parliament and facing calls for a vote of no-confidence.
The opposition, which until now has proved too weak and divided to oust the
increasingly unpopular Mr Meciar, appears to have been moved to action by
the growing paralysis of the government, which can no longer win sufficient
support in parliament to pass urgently needed legislation.
This latest crisis was precipitated by the defection on Thursday of 10
deputies from Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) who
announced the establishment of an opposition faction called the Alternative
of Political Realism (APR).
Though the 10 have not officially left the HZDS, their move effectively
leaves the ruling coalition between the HZDS and part of the Slovak National
party (SNS) with only 63 votes in the 150-seat parliament.
There has been a string of defections from the HZDS since it won almost half
of the seats in the June 1992 general elections, and in recent polls the
party's support has fallen to around 15 per cent.
The APR faction is calling for the formation of a non-partisan transitional
government to replace Mr Meciar's coalition until early elections can be
held. Such a government would be made up of 'politically non-aligned
experts' with the support of opposition parties.
Mr Meciar has proved a formidable opponent in the past when his position has
been under threat, and he wants to hold a referendum to prohibit defectors
from remaining in parliament once they have left a party. But for the first
time he appears to face the combined weight of almost all opposition forces
in the country and he would almost certainly lose a no-confidence vote,
making elections inevitable.

   OSLO

<TEXT>
The Norwegian government's hopes of turning around the deep public hostility
to joining the European Union will be boosted today by an opinion poll
showing a sharp increase in support for membership.
However, in Helsinki, Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, warned yesterday that
Finland's application to join the EU would fall unless its demands for
special treatment of Nordic agriculture were met. Finland, Norway and
fellow-applicants Sweden and Austria are engaged in accession negotiations
with the EU due to be completed by next month.
A poll published today in Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily newspaper,
showed opposition to EU membership slipping below 50 per cent for the first
time in months, to 48 per cent. Meanwhile, support has shot up since a
similar poll last month from 32 per cent to 37 per cent - well above last
October's low point of 24 per cent.
In a further encouragement for the Labour government, which has promised a
referendum to decide the issue, the poll showed that support for membership
in Norway would outstrip opposition if Sweden and Finland voted to join. In
such circumstances the poll showed 41 per cent in favour against 39 per
cent, with the rest undecided.
Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, foreign minister, said this week it was an 'unbearable
thought' for Norwegians that its border with Sweden might 'become our border
with Europe'.
But Mr Aho said the EU must change its refusal to grant special status to
Nordic agriculture quickly if the negotiations were to succeed. 'The EU must
understand these Nordic conditions of ours. A solution must emerge only on
this basis,' he said.

FT  12 FEB 94 / KIO case to continue, court rules in Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Madrid high court yesterday ruled that a lawsuit filed over a year ago
by the Kuwait Investment Office against seven former executives of its Grupo
Torras Spanish holding should go ahead, Reuter reports from Madrid.
The decision follows four rulings last year throwing out the case. The new
ruling cannot be appealed against or overturned.
The KIO put Torras into receivership in December 1992, claiming losses of
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn), and next month filed penal charges against the
seven for fraud and mismanagement, which it said had led directly to losses
of Dollars 1bn.
A spokesman for former Torras deputy chairman Javier de la Rosa, one of the
seven accused, said the ruling would provide a welcome opportunity to clear
the facts. Other defendants are Mr Fouad Jaffar, former KIO general manager,
former KIO chairman Mr Fahad al-Sabah, former Torras managing director Mr
Jorge Nunez Lasso de la Vega, former Ercros chairman Mr Narciso de Mir, and
former Torras officials Mr Juan Jose Folchi and Mr Miguel Soler Sala.
In addition, the KIO filed suit in London last year against 21 former KIO
officials.
In April last year, two companies controlled by Mr de la Rosa filed an
affidavit demanding the KIO declare a repurchase agreement on share
participations in the Torras group, and last September Mr de la Rosa, Mr de
Mir and Mr Nunez filed charges in Barcelona against Torras officials for
allegedly harming the companies' interests.
Spain's National Securities Market Commission last year investigated Torras
and found irregularities in its group share participations.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Balladur treads on colleagues' toes: How presidential
rivalry is affecting the policies of the right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's presidential election is still 15 months off, but is casting a
lengthening shadow over Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition
government and its policies.
Mr Balladur protests - and he may even be sincere - that he wants
presidential politics left until next year so that he can govern in peace
this year. But that leaves unanswered the question of whether he will
challenge his RPR party's leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the Elysee in 1995.
The growing likelihood that he will is proving divisive in the cabinet, in
the RPR and in the governing parliamentary coalition - in any case too large
to be very cohesive.
Apart from fomenting the bickering that comes naturally to any large group
of politicians, the presidential rivalry within the French right is now
affecting policy in the economy and elsewhere, at home and abroad.
With record unemployment so near to a presidential election, the pressures
on Mr Balladur are all for a softening of fiscal policy to revive the
economy, now that monetary policy is in the hands of the independent central
bank. So far Mr Balladur has made no big U-turn; he still aims to reduce
this year's budget deficit. But the imminence of the presidential poll is
clearly increasing Mr Balladur's innate tendency to buy his way out of
trouble.
The farmers got FFr3bn (Pounds 343m) last year to assuage their anti-Gatt
anger. The bill for caving into the Air France strikers is still not in, but
the state-owned carrier is expected to record one of the largest corporate
losses in French history, more than FFr 7.5bn for 1993. Last month more than
250,000 supporters of the state school system took to the streets and won an
extra FFr2.5bn over five years.
Using violent tactics, members of France's small, 16,000-strong fishing
industry this month got FFr365m (Pounds 41.8m) in aid out of the government.
Mr Balladur's repeated financial concessions to strikers have not stirred
much criticism in a country where grievances, by virtue of being strongly
felt, are frequently considered justified. But as an American politician
once remarked, 'a billion here, a billion there and soon you're talking
about real money'.
In fact, Mr Balladur has some 'real money' to play with from privatisation,
which brought in some FFr40bn last year and probably more this year. He is
extremely lucky to have for sale assets that the Socialists so expensively
nationalised a decade ago.
By contrast, Mr Balladur has been criticised by his own side for being too
timid in his measures to relaunch the economy. This criticism has come from
Mr Raymond Barre, a maverick member of the UDF coalition partner, but also
from Mr Jean-Louis Debre, the deputy secretary general of the RPR and a
totally loyal Chirac lieutenant. Mr Debre said Mr Balladur 'could have done
more' in his January 31 moves to boost consumption, car sales and house
buying. The effect was to undermine the prime minister, who was striving for
maximum psychological impact at minimum cost.
Presidential manoeuvring also explains recent incidents in France's internal
security and foreign policy. One of the murkiest of these was the prime
minister's decision in late December to send two suspected Iranian
terrorists back to Tehran instead of to Switzerland, which had asked for
them to be extradited to stand trial for murder.
In making this move, which raised hackles in Berne and questions elsewhere,
Mr Balladur sided with his interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, against Mr
Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, though all three are RPR men.
This squares with the curious alliance of political convenience which Mr
Balladur and Mr Pasqua seem to have struck up - the emollient, aloof prime
minister and rough-hewn, populist interior minister complementing each
other.
Because he appeals to much the same constituency as Mr Chirac, Mr Pasqua
appears for the moment to calculate that he would bring far more to - and
have more power in - a Balladur rather than a Chirac presidency. This is
also why, at a time when Mr Chirac is the only declared presidential
candidate on the right, Mr Pasqua backs the introduction of a US-style
primary election to choose the right's man for the Elysee in 1995.
But in the process, Mr Balladur has alienated perhaps the most important man
on today's French political scene - Mr Juppe, who is also secretary general
of the RPR Gaullists. Mr Balladur could have used Mr Juppe's desire to get
out from under Mr Chirac's shadow to his own advantage; instead, relations
between prime and foreign minister have steadily coolled. They fell out
first over Gatt.
To guard his own back in the event of failure, Mr Juppe annoyed Mr Balladur
by insisting on written instructions for anything he negotiated; Mr Balladur
later got his own back by handing out fulsome praise to all French
negotiators except Mr Juppe.
The prime minister then aggravated the situation by trying some 'freelance
diplomacy' in Saudi Arabia. In December Mr Balladur's chief aide flew out to
Riyadh, without telling the local French embassy, to prepare Mr Balladur's
visit there last month. That visit took place against the advice of the
local ambassador. To chortling at the Quai d'Orsay, there was no
mega-defence contract for Mr Balladur to sign, and the prime minister had to
return empty-handed. The FFr9bn contract was only sealed last week.
Mr Balladur is also seeking to enlarge the traditionally limited role of a
French prime minister by trying his hand at defence as well as foreign
policy; this month will see publication of a government defence white paper.
This is all part of the 'cohabitation' game of treading on the
constitutional preserve of Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. But
treading on Mr Juppe's toes is a more dangerous ploy.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Rise in US wholesale fuel prices
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US wholesale prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in January with a fall in
food costs offsetting the biggest jump in fuel prices in more than three
years, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Wholesale fuel prices jumped by 6.5 per cent in January, but food prices
fell by 0.3 per cent.
The Labour Department said the rise in its Producer Price Index, which
measures price rises before they reach the consumer, was the biggest gain
since a similar 0.2 per cent rise in September. However, economists had been
expecting a much higher jump, of perhaps 0.4 per cent. They said the more
moderate gain showed that inflationary pressures were remaining well
contained.
Economists believe that rises in both wholesale prices and consumer prices
will remain subdued this year even though the economy seems set to enter a
period of recovery.
However, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales fell
by an unexpectedly sharp 0.5 per cent in January, in the first decline in 10
months.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Generators in deal to sell plant and reduce prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest electricity companies reached an agreement yesterday with
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, to try to sell off
some of their power stations and reduce their prices in the wholesale
electricity market. They have avoided being referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Under the deal outlined yesterday, National Power agreed to dispose of
between 3,000 and 4,000MW of its generating plant within two years. PowerGen
agreed to dispose of 2,000MW of capacity. Prof Littlechild said the combined
total of 6,000MW was equivalent to six large power stations. He said that
unless the generators delivered on their undertakings there might still have
to be an MMC reference.
Both companies are to consider hiving off some of their generating plant
into separate quoted companies.
They also agreed to price capping measures which Prof Littlechild said would
reduce prices in the wholesale electricity pool by 7 per cent and were worth
Pounds 500m over the two years they are intended to last.
It also emerged yesterday that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, is
likely to suffer more than National Power and PowerGen as a result of the
agreement, in which it was not involved.
Analysts believe its profits could be hit by up to Pounds 250m over the two
years as a result of the price capping arrangements. The combined effect on
the profits of National Power and PowerGen is likely to be about Pounds 100m
.
Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said one option for the plant
disposals was a demerger under which shareholders could be offered equity in
a new company containing the amount of generating plant mentioned in the
agreement. One advantage was that shareholders could be certain they were
being offered value for money.
Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, said his company was also
considering the creation of a separate company which would have quite
separate management. Another option was an auction of plant.
Mr Baker said the company had been involved last year in serious
negotiations with two prospective buyers of plant. These had been put on
hold during the more than six months of Prof Littlechild's deliberations.
The level of plant disposals tentatively agreed to represents between 10 and
15 per cent of the companies' generating capacity. The disparity between the
effects of the pool price reductions on Nuclear Electric and the other two
generators arises because the state-owned company depends more on pool
prices for its income. National Power and PowerGen have more hedging
contracts in place which effectively protect them from vagaries in the pool
price.
Nuclear Electric said it still intended to be profitable before taking
account of the nuclear levy by 1995-96 but 'that's a tougher challenge than
it was'.
Imperial Chemical Industries said the price cap would save it between Pounds
4m and Pounds 5m a year.
Prof Littlechild acknowledged that reductions for domestic consumers would
be small.
Yesterday's agreement will enable the government to go ahead with plans to
realise more than Pounds 4bn through sales of its remaining 40 per cent
stakes in National Power and PowerGen. Shares in both companies rose.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Japan and US fail to reach accord: Rift casts shadow over
trade ties as Clinton and Hosokawa back 'cooling off' period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan yesterday failed to resolve disagreements over a plan to
give US goods and services greater access to Japanese markets.
President Bill Clinton, in sombre mood, told a press conference after his
summit with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, the Japanese position
'simply did not meet the standards' agreed in Tokyo last July. 'It is better
to have no agreement than an empty agreement,' he added.
Mr Clinton did not publicly threaten US retaliation against Japan, saying
'we need a period of reflection to assess where we are'. However, senior
administration officials said later there was a 'good-sized menu' of options
the US could now consider. They said US trade relations with Japan had
reached 'a turning point', implying an even tougher US stance in the future.
Mr Clinton noted: 'The rest of our relationship is in good shape, but this
is a serious problem.'
Mr Hosokawa also urged a 'cooling off' period after the intense negotiations
between ministers from both sides finally broke off in the small hours of
yesterday morning.
'Unfortunately, at the very end we were not able to clear the hurdle of
numerical targets, and I regret that very much,' he said.
'Numerical targets,' he went on, 'can acquire a life of their own and turn
into another semiconductor case' - a reference to the two-year-old bilateral
agreement aimed at giving the US a 20 per cent share of the Japanese chip
market. This has recently fallen to just over 18 per cent, threatening new
trade tensions.
The most contentious issue in the so-called 'framework' process, which also
embraces macro-economic policies, was the US demand that Japan open its
domestic market in measurable ways to US exports of telecommunications,
medical equipment, cars and car parts, and insurance services. A White House
official said Mr Hosokawa had offered 'continuing negotiations' on the car
sector, where US sales are tiny.
But Mr Clinton had said this would be pointless without 'a change of
attitude' on the Japanese side and without even 'a possibility' that
agreement could be reached. In the press conference, Mr Clinton disputed at
length the Japanese characterisation of the US position, often described as
'managed trade'.
He said the US was seeking 'objective criteria' by which progress could be
judged and which might encompass exchange rate variables, macro-economic
performance and the price and competitiveness of US products.
Mr Clinton's reference to exchange rates was taken in the foreign exchange
markets as a hint that the US might seek a higher yen. In limited futures
trading for March delivery the dollar fell by about one yen. Initial
reaction in political and business circles was to commend Mr Clinton for not
settling for a cosmetic agreement.
Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat, said that ultimately
the Japanese government would have 'no alternative but to open its markets'.
The American Electronic Association supported the administration's
determination to get 'full effective and measurable' access to the Japanese
market. An early test case may come next Tuesday when the US trade
representative is due to comment on complaints from Motorola about its
treatment in the Japanese cellular phone sector.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Equities hit by renewed selling pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market came under renewed heavy selling pressure yesterday,
leaving the FT-SE 100 nearly 100 points down at the end of a volatile week.
European markets were also sharply down amid fears that global bond and
equity markets could come under serious pressure next week.
The London equity market's uncertainty was increased by conflicting
predictions from equity stock analysts.
Most influential was a forecast from Mr Nick Knight, market strategist at
Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, of sharp falls across international stock
markets next week.
'Next week could be bloody; we see world markets hitting an air pocket,'
said Mr Knight, until recently one of London's most prominent bulls. He said
the Hong Kong market would be particularly vulnerable, as would continental
European markets.
However, other dealers in London said they were not overly worried. Mr
Martin Lupton, head of market-making at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK
securities house, said: 'We had a good shakeout but business was curtailed
by the bad weather in New York; I think we'll steady up next week.'
The FT-SE 100 index of leading UK companies closed 28.1 down at 3,378.9,
having been more than 57 lower earlier in the day.
Over the week the index has fallen 2.7 per cent, following the move by the
US Federal Reserve a week ago to tighten monetary policy, and the
quarter-point cut in UK base rates.
The FT-SE index was hit by an overnight slide on Wall Street, which ended
marginally lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 0.56 down at 3,894.78.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index fell 28.35 to 2,090.61 on the session, ending
2.2 per cent down on the week. In Paris the CAC-40 index fell 21.68 to
2,275.09, a week's loss of 2.4 per cent. Other European markets were also
weaker.
In currency markets sterling staged a late recovery. Having slipped from
Dollars 1.48 before Tuesday's rate cut to Dollars 1.45 on Thursday, it
recovered to close at Dollars 1.4663. It was also slightly firmer against
the D-Mark.
The Bank of England surprised the UK government bond market yesterday when
it opted for a maturity of six to 10 years for its next auction on February
23. Details of the specific stock, the amount to be auctioned and the terms
of the auction will be announced on February 15.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International,
interpreted the Bank's decision to go for a medium-dated maturity as a sign
it hopes to attract foreign investors.
After the news of the auction, long-dated gilts rose by  1/16 of a point and
short-dated gilts by  5/32 of a point.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Bauman to take over from Cahill as BAe chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chairman of British Aerospace has been confirmed as Mr Bob Bauman,
chief executive of the drugs group SmithKline Beecham. He succeeds the
present chairman, Mr John Cahill, who is stepping down after only two years
of his five-year term.
Mr Cahill's departure, which had been signalled in advance, is believed to
be partly due to dissent within the BAe board. He will walk away with
Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.21m) in the form of share options. It is understood
that he has waived payment on the final three years of his contract. He
holds options on 908,000 at an exercise price of 260p. BAe's share price
closed yesterday at 543p.
Mr Bauman, 62, will be paid Pounds 50,000 a year as non-executive chairman,
working one or two days a week on average. He will also receive options on
120,000 BAe shares at 550p. At SmithKline Beecham, where he is due to retire
in April, he was one of the UK's highest-paid executives, with earnings of
Pounds 1.5m in 1992.
He said last night: 'I think BAe has made progress, and they're starting to
sort out a management team and a strategy for the future. I've had the
chance to meet all of the board, and I feel good about my ability to work
with them.'
BAe last night played down suggestions that Mr Cahill, who had spent much of
his time as chairman living in the US, had been at loggerheads with his
colleagues, particularly those in the group's defence business. An official
said last night: 'John Cahill has made an important contribution in changing
the culture of BAe's defence business, and has worked as part of a team. He
has now accomplished the majority of the tasks he set out to do, and
therefore feels this is a sensible time to make a change.'
Mr Cahill's two years at the company have been a period of dramatic change,
after the departure of Professor Roland Smith. It culminated last week with
the announcement of the sale of Rover to BMW of Germany.
The appointment of Mr Bauman, who will continue to be based in London, is
likely to be well received in the City. He has experience of the aerospace
business, having been chairman from 1981 to 1985 of Avco of the US. His
replacement at SmithKline Beecham has already been announced as Mr Jan
Leschly, head of pharmaceuticals.
As Mr Bauman is a US citizen, BAe is having to change its articles of
association to allow him to be chairman.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metal group unit allays fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buderus, the German building material and heating technology company 80 per
cent-owned by the troubled Metallgesellschaft group, said yesterday the
near-collapse of the parent company had not affected its own activities.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Plaul, chief executive, said yesterday the parent's crisis
had not changed how customers and suppliers sought to do business.
Buderus had no 'contractual ties' with the parent company, Mr Plaul said,
reiterating comments made a month ago as Metallgesellschaft's problems came
to a head.
Buderus' aim was to pay all shareholders a sound dividend, he insisted.
Buderus, acquired by Metallgesellschaft as part of its purchase of the
non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel in 1991, is commonly regarded as a
jewel in Metallgesellschaft's crown, one of the more robust of the group's
some 260 subsidiaries.
In its 1992-93 financial year it made pre-tax profits of DM133m on turnover
of DM2.77bn. It announced yesterday profits for the three months to December
of DM41m (Dollars 24.1m), up from DM30m in the comparable period.
The company has often been mentioned as a potential sale candidate for
Metallgesellschaft. However, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of the
metals, mining and industrial group, has explicitly ruled out such a
measure.
Another possibility is that Metallgesellschaft will reduce its stake. Mr
Plaul, however, said yesterday he was not aware of any such moves.
More details are likely to emerge on February 22 when Mr Neukirchen will
outline his strategy for the future of the group.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: SAS to axe 2,900 jobs in
shake-up

<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System intends to cut 2,900 full-time jobs, one in
seven of its workforce, as part of an intensified cost-cutting drive.
The aim is to slash costs by almost SKr3bn (Dollars 374m) by the middle of
next year to restore profitability and meet increased competition.
The airline, which has made a loss in each of the past four years, also
plans to streamline group organisation, close routes and reduce the number
of aircraft types operated. Two models, the Boeing 737 and Saab 340, will
disappear from its fleet.
SAS said the moves would assist future expansion plans and allow it to enter
alliances or co-operation agreements with other airlines.
SAS is looking to save SKr2.02bn by the end of 1994 and a further SKr894m in
the first half of next year. This expands the programme announced last
November when the airline signalled savings of up to SKr2.5bn. It has
already sold six Boeing 767s for a SKr800m capital gain and disposed of a 42
per cent stake in the Chilean carrier, LanChile.
'This is an ambitious and necessary action programme, on which I and my
successor, Jan Stenberg, completely agree,' said Mr Jan Reinas, SAS interim
president. Mr Stenberg takes over as SAS president on April 1.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Qatar gas export project ends over price
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANAMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of Qatar's big three gas export projects has collapsed because of a
price dispute with Italian customers, Qatari sources said, Reuter reports
from Manama.
The government's Qatar General Petroleum Corporation is taking over the
shares of its two western partners in Qatar Europe LNG Company (Eurogas),
forcing a rethink of how to proceed, said Eurogas chairman Abdul-Aziz
al-Dulaimi.
The agreement collapsed because Qatar could not agree with the 30 per cent
shareholder, Italy's state-owned Snam, on how much it should pay for the
gas.
QGPC is taking over Snam's share as well as the 5 per cent held by the US
company, Nelson Bunker Hunt.
Eurogas was one of three huge liquefied natural gas projects Qatar had
planned to cash in on its North Field reserves and diversify from reliance
on oil.
It was to have exported 6.1m tonnes LNG a year. But construction work has
not started and there have been no exports, although North Field gas is used
in local industry.
The project - to have cost at least Dollars 5bn with one estimate running as
high as Dollars 8bn - could not proceed at least for now without being
assured of Snam's purchases, though other European customers were being
pursued, the sources said.
One option being considered is to expand the other two LNG projects if
demand merits it. Technically this is possible though commercially it is
complicated because of existing shareholding and marketing agreements.
'We in QGPC are rethinking the whole gas market scheme and the projects we
have, certainly on the European side,' a Qatari official said. 'As far as
Qatar is concerned, we will continue to pursue the European market.'
The memorandum of understanding under which Eurogas was set up in 1992
stipulated that the two sides had to agree by the end of 1993 on matters
such as pricing, Mr Dulaimi said. That agreement was not forthcoming, with
the consequence that QGPC becomes the sole owner, he said after the Eurogas
board met on Wednesday.
'If the parties failed to reach an agreement by the end of December (1993),
the agreement is nul. In this case the shares go to QGPC,' Mr Dulaimi said.
Snam, which benefits from relatively cheap Algerian gas at the price of
Dollars 2.50-Dollars 2.60 per million BTU, had objected to the price it
would have had to pay for the Qatari LNG. It had also failed to win improved
Suez Canal transit fees.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Palestinian self-rule accord 'ready in a month', says Rabin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday welcomed
the Cairo accords which secured a crucial security agreement on Palestinian
self-rule, giving much needed momentum to the peace process after months of
delay.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, called the partial agreement
'an important step forward', adding that he expected 'another month will be
needed to complete the details of the agreement . . . I hope a month will be
enough. It could take a little more'.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said the documents went a step beyond
the peace agreement signed in Washington last September, although some gaps
still needed to be filled in.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton called the Cairo understandings
'another big milestone'.
The set of principles and agreement included resolution of the two most
sensitive security issues - control over the Egypt-Gaza and Jericho-Jordan
border crossings and security arrangements for Jewish settlers in Gaza which
would divide the strip into three zones.
Officials said this meant exclusive Palestinian control in the largest zone,
exclusive Israeli control in another zone around the Jewish settlements and
joint patrols, under Israeli control, in a third, smaller zone.
Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said there was an agreement
in principle on the third major obstacle of the past three months - the size
of the Jericho area - but that a final decision would be taken when Mr
Arafat meets Mr Rabin.
After marathon talks and a last-minute crisis which threatened to derail the
negotiations, Mr Peres and Mr Arafat initialled the documents shortly before
midnight. The agreements, negotiated according to one Israeli official
'paragraph by paragraph, line by line, word by word', broke a seemingly
interminable deadlock over the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
'All the problems that we had before us we solved either completely in
details or in principles and some details were left over for later,' Mr
Peres said. Hinting at the difficulties over finalising border issues, he
added: 'It was not simple because what we called security the Palestinians
called dignity.'
Mr Arafat said the two sides still had some issues outstanding and he had
agreed to work with Mr Peres to overcome the remaining problems. Further
talks are expected to resume at delegation level next week in the Egyptian
resort of Taba.
The breakthrough will unblock suspended talks on economic relations and the
transfer of civilian administration to Palestinian hands. Once the remaining
issues have been resolved, the stage will be set for Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat
formally to sign a comprehensive protocol leading to an Israeli troop
withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho, which was to have begun on December 13.
Although last night's documents must be approved by the Israeli cabinet and
the PLO executive committee, this is expected to be a formality.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Hata wants to heal trade rift with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, yesterday said that both Japan
and the US were determined to settle their differences over trade. But both
nations insisted privately that they could not compromise on US demands for
measuring the progress of access to Japanese markets.
Mr Hata's visit was an attempt to avert confrontation before last night's
scheduled arrival of Mr Morihiro Hosokowa, Japanese prime minister. It
injected into the trade talks the vital military and foreign policy
relationship between the two economic superpowers.
Ahead of Mr Hosokawa's summit with President Bill Clinton, Mr Hata is
understood to have raised national security concerns to stress that trade
problems were not the only important bilateral issue.
Mr Hata had a two-hour breakfast with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative. He was also scheduled to meet vice-president Al Gore; Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state; Mr Anthony Lake, the national
security adviser; and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary. President
Bill Clinton was scheduled to attend during one of the meetings.
A Japanese embassy official said talks this week had produced satisfactory
progress on three main areas of contention - medical equipment,
telecommunications, and insurance - but in no sector is there agreement on
numerical criteria. 'There is a difference of opinion on a matter of
principle; there can be no compromise,' he said.
An unnamed senior US official was quoted by Reuter last night as saying the
odds were 'pretty high' against a deal in time for today's summit,
describing them as at least 70-30 against.
On Capitol Hill, where the administration is finding broad support for a
tough stand, Senator Max Baucus suggested that compromise might be reached
because the framework agreement on bilateral trade contained no enforcement
provision if Japan failed to achieve the negotiated 'benchmarks'.
However, he also suggested that a resurrected version of the Super 301 law,
which carried severe penalties but which has expired, would provide a
mechanism to ensure that Japan kept to agreements. Such threats have in the
past prevented Japanese negotiators from agreeing to 'indicators'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy BP trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Initial reaction to fourth-quarter figures from BP saw the share price shoot
through the 400p barrier, but after the company's meeting a more sober
reaction saw the stock slip back. Hefty two-way business led to
exceptionally heavy turnover of 24m shares.
The results showed BP back in profit, with a historic cost net profit of
Pounds 615m after exceptionals, against a loss of Pounds 458m in 1992, and a
replacement cost net profit of Pounds 896m, compared to a loss of Pounds
352m previously. Despite this, one analyst said: 'David Simon (the chief
executive) reminded the market that BP is sensitive to oil prices.'
Even the most bullish analysts argued that it was time BP paused for breath,
while Mr John Toalster of SGST, and the renowned bear of the stock, said:
'The shares are massively overbought. When reality does set in, I would see
them fall below 300p.' Yesterday, BP shares swung back from a high of 407p
to end a net 4 1/2 down at 386p, shrugging off confirmation of a large oil
find west of the Shetlands. Shell Transport picked up to close 3 higher at
734p.
International stocks with strong US exposure held up well against a weak
market as Salomon Brothers, the US brokerage, launched a Pounds 130m warrant
on stocks geared to US recovery.
The house issued 10m call warrants, which give holders the right to buy
underlying stock at a fixed date at 128p. Holders of 20 warrants can buy a
basket of shares made up largely of shares in Hanson, the UK conglomerate,
which generates more than 45 per cent of its turnover in the US. Hanson put
on 1 1/2 at 299 1/2 p.
The other companies are Carlton Communications (off 10 at 996p), Grand
Metropolitan (down 11 at 450p), RTZ (8 cheaper at 866p), Siebe (3 easier at
579p) and Tomkins (up 3 at 258p).
Mr Marcus Grubb, Salomon's chief strategist, said: 'As a basket the shares
have underperformed the London market by 12 per cent over the past year and
they all have a big exposure in terms of sales, profits and assets to the
US.'
The warrants expire in two years' time, when they will be exercisable into
share baskets costing Pounds 258.60 each, a discount to yesterday's
collective share price of Pounds 290.
A successful market debut for Alpha Airports, the airline catering group
spun off from Forte, saw the shares open at 165p, a premium of 25p, and
advance to end at 172p. Dealers said the shares were oversubscribed six
times and Forte retained a 25 per cent stake. They also pointed out that the
equity market had made gains since the shares were priced last week. Forte
firmed a half-penny to 253p.
Initial enthusiasm to first-quarter results from BOC dwindled away as
analysts returned from a very cautious meeting with the new management.
Realisation that profit margins were still under pressure in spite of
volumes picking up saw the shares swing from a gain of 14 to end a net 17
lower at 681p.
Third-quarter results ahead of market forecasts saw BT shares move smartly
forward, only to be clipped back by profit-taking. They closed 1 1/2 adrift
at 455p on 9.3m traded. Most brokers raised full-year forecasts after the
company reported improved inland calls and business connections.
Vodafone was one of the day's best performers, the shares jumping 15 to 630
1/2 p on talk of strong US buying and imminent upgrades in London. The
mobile telecoms operator recently unveiled new connections for January at
27,500, more than twice the figure in the previous year.
Exploration and production group Enterprise Oil fell 15 to 449p in the wake
of a strong sell recommendation from Nomura, the Japanese securities house,
which has argued that its premium to the net asset value is unjustified.
Textiles were firm on the back of a sector conference hosted by SG Warburg,
but Dawson International was down 7 at 134p after touching 123p on an
announcement that the group would have to make provisions.
The day's biggest retreat in the market was recorded in motors group
Jessups, which initially tumbled 36 to 80p after stating that it would
report a loss for the 16 months to the end of last year. Bargain hunters
later helped the shares claw back some of the earlier loss to finish a net
20 down at 96p.
Reports that international trading group Lonrho was planning a Pounds 100m
convertible bond issue within the next few weeks did the rounds. The shares
relinquished 3 1/2 to 162 1/2p, as 5.6m were dealt. Announcement of an
acquisition saw Starmin, the aggregates group, rise 1 3/4 to 5p, or more
than 50 per cent - the biggest percentage gain in the London market.

FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Regulator concern hits Recs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulatory worries upset the power generators and regional electricity
companies (Recs) yesterday, prompting sharp retreats across the board.
The Recs were worst hit as NatWest Securities raised concern over their
vulnerability to adverse news during the discussions with Offer, the
industry regulator. The broker also believes selected stocks have been
overbought, particularly in the light of what it considers 'overstated'
values put on the National Grid, owned by the Recs and set for flotation,
possibly next year.
NatWest, which remains positive on the sector in the medium term, singled
out Seeboard and Manweb as particularly vulnerable. Seeboard dropped 22 1/2
to 386p and Manweb 38 to 796p. The negative sentiment also saw Yorkshire
down 29 to 682p, Midlands 36 to 702p and Northern 36 to 738p.
In spite of the steep falls, the broker said it believed the shares are due
for a further correction. However, others disagreed, among them Hoare
Govett, which had the sector marked as a hold, and yesterday moved to a buy
on selected stocks.
PowerGen was another big casualty as the market fretted over today's
decision from Offer on whether to refer the company and National Power to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the issue of pool electricity
prices. 'It could go either way,' said one seasoned utility dealer. 'The
shares are either going to rocket or fall out of bed.'
Another said: 'A referral would mean a 10 per cent downside - minimum.'
Yesterday's big fall in Powergen - down 17 to 525p - was said to be
influenced by one leading house putting its money on just that outcome.
National Power declined 12 to 461p.

FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poor gilts sector in both the UK and the US undermined early strength in
Footsie futures that followed the good overnight Wall Street performance,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Wednesday's New York market advance, coupled with favourable results from a
clutch of leading UK stocks, helped the March contract on the FT-SE 100 to a
firm start at 3,447. But doubts about that early strength set in within
half-an-hour of the opening, leading to sporadic selling.
March drifted for the next few hours, pulling the underlying cash market
lower, with the fall by UK gilts accelerating the decline.
With the weakness in European markets and US bonds leading to a further
retreat in the afternoon, March finished at 3,399, a 7-point discount to
cash. Volume at the official close totalled 16,741 contracts.
Turnover in the traded options rose to 57,352 lots, against Wednesday's
52,745. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 option showed a slight decline at
18,000 contracts.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 6,868 lots traded.
Dealers said implied volatility was particularly high, indicating that a
sharp decline was in store.
Dealings in the OMLX futures on the FT-SE Mid 250 were negligible and a mere
250 contracts were dealt.

FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market worries trigger big falls
in equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market came under further pressure yesterday, weakened by
persistent selling of the FT-SE future and continuing worries about
international bond markets.
The latter rallied in afternoon trading yesterday, dealers said, but
remained nervous ahead of news of the US bond auction and amid wild rumours
that one of the big US investment banks had taken a big loss on its
international bond trading desks and that there had been departures from its
bond trading team in London as well as sackings on its German and Japanese
bond trading teams.
The speculation centred on Goldman Sachs. The investment bank said it would
not respond to market rumours, but sources close to the bank said the
stories were totally untrue. Talk that Goldman had suffered big losses in
its trading activities since the US Federal Reserve increased its Fed Funds
rate has been circulating in markets all week.
Dealers said a late slide on Wall Street, which was down almost 20 points
after the London market had closed, and talk that one of the New York
market's most influential commentators was expecting a 4 to 7 per cent
short-term setback for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, would have a
sizeable impact on London this morning. After hours saw the FT-SE 100 future
trading at 3,386, indicating that the cash market would open well below
3,400.
'It is the last day of the account tomorrow and the market has been taking
on lots of stock,' said the head of trading at one top UK securities house.
He said the market would be unable to hold the 3,400 markk and that the next
level of real support would come at 3,350.
The FT-SE 100 began the session on a firm note, opening almost 16 points
higher and edging up to a day's best of 3,441.1 within an hour of the
opening, supported by a solid start by gilts and sterling. However, a
gradual deterioration in gilts, said to have been prompted by heavy selling
from the US, upset those stocks and undermined sentiment in equities, where
US houses were said to have been aggressive sellers of stock.
The Footsie fell away thereafter, testing 3,400 on the downside and reaching
a session low of 3,400.7 before stabilising and closing a net 22.1 off at
3,407. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also reflected some determined selling in the
marketplace, retreating 32.2 to 4,068.9.
Turnover in equities picked up again, reaching 995m shares, with non-Footsie
stocks accounting for 671.7m shares, or 68 per cent of the total. The value
of customer business yesterday was Pounds 2.04bn.
NatWest Securities, one of the London market's most influential securities
houses, caused substantial weakness in the utilities area of the market
after telling clients to take profits in the electricity sub-sector. A
decision on whether the two English/Welsh generators will be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission is expected this morning and could produce
a big move in either direction, depending on the decision of the industry
regulator.
BP, meanwhile, could not maintain an early strong rise triggered by good
fourth-quarter figures and news of drilling success west of the Shetland
Islands and closed lower on balance. But there were strong rises for
National Westminster Bank, after reports of switching out of Barclays, for
Reuters, after its recent bumper figures, and for Vodafone, after big US
support.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides on program sales,
policy worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks tumbled yesterday under the weight of program selling and mounting
concern over US monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 36.58 lower at 3,895.34, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.83 at 468.94. The American SE composite
shed 1.46 to 479.13 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 3.11 to 783.42. New York
SE volume, at 327.2m shares, was heavy. Falls outnumbered advances by 1,306
to 811.
Stocks opened on a mixed note in spite of the overnight improvement in
Tokyo. The morning's economic news, though favourable, was largely shrugged
off. The Labor Department said claims for unemployment benefit had fallen by
47,000 last week, in line with expectations.
Meanwhile, cautiousness prevailed in the bond market, in spite of the
success of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in new 30-year bonds.
Prices across the yield curve retreated as traders prepared for unfavourable
readings on inflation and retail sales tomorrow.
By mid-morning, a clear direction for equities was established when a
computerised sell order was activated. The broad-based downturn soon
accelerated as investors became nervous once again about the implications of
the Federal Reserve's move last week to lift short-term interest rates for
the first time in five years. Until now, the mood had been sanguine, in view
of the market's solid recovery from Friday's 96-point rout.
Automobile stocks were hit hard for a second day running. General Motors, a
Dow Industrial component, retreated Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on 7.7m
shares traded when its announcement of net income of Dollars 1.28 a share
failed to satisfy investors. Ford Motor, whose strong results disappointed
Wall Street in the previous session, shed a further Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars
66. Chrysler, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 59 3/4 , also fell out of
favour.
Among the blue chips, Procter &amp; Gamble receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57
5/8 and Philip Morris Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 . Cyclical issues were
not spared: Caterpillar fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 106 1/8 , Alcoa
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 and Du Pont Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54.
Brazil
Brazilian equities surged 11.1 per cent, boosted by heavy foreign buying and
a perception that a widely expected market correction might not take place.
A redenominated Bovespa index closed 1,002 up at 10,009. Turnover was
Cr331bn.
Canada
After a mildly firmer morning session, the Toronto market turned down
sharply, succumbing to the Wall Street weakness. The TSE 300 index ended
21.2 off at 4,442.0 and declines led rises by 460 to 343 after volume of
91.2m shares.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei boosted by late
arbitrage buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Late afternoon arbitrage buying left Japanese equities higher at the end of
the day, although many investors stayed on the sidelines, and others were
cautious in adjusting their positions ahead of the long weekend, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average showed an improvement of 149.32 at 19,990.70 after a
day's low of 19,787.28 and high of 20,007.00. The Topix index of all first
section stocks closed 10.12 up at 1,608.14.
Prices fluctuated narrowly throughout the session due to uncertainty over
the Hosokawa-Clinton meeting in Washington today. Reports of tough rhetoric
by US trade negotiators dampened sentiment; a breakdown of the US-Japan
bilateral framework talks could mean upward pressure on the yen, which would
be a blow to Japanese exporters.
Volume came to 350m shares, against 452m, with increasing caution also
expressed over next Monday's listing of Nikkei 300 stock futures contracts
on the Osaka stock exchange. Advances outscored declines by 647 to 370, with
140 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.86 at
1,333.48.
Foreign buying supported multimedia linked issues, including leading
consumer electronics companies at the end of the session. Sony moved ahead
Y100 to Y6,290 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y50 to Y1,720. Brother
Industries, the sewing machine maker, gained Y55 at Y565.
Environmental shares were up on expectations that the US president and the
Japanese prime minister will address environmental problems during their
meeting. Tabai Espec, a meteorological environmental testing equipment
maker, rose Y130 to Y1,200.
Steels were lower on profit-taking. Kawasaki Steel slipped Y6 to Y351 and
NKK Y4 to Y256. Mining issues, which had been higher on firm gold prices,
lost ground. Sumitomo Metal Mining shed Y21 to Y879 and Dowa Mining Y4 to
Y518.
Telecommunications linked stocks were stronger. Fujitsu, the most active
issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y1,050 and Nitsuko added Y60 at Y1,600.
Zexel, a car parts maker, jumped Y60 to Y640 on reports that it will supply
car navigation systems to General Motors, of the US, on a original equipment
manufacturing basis.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 74.78 to 21,779.62 in volume of 47.1m
shares.
Roundup
The lunar new year closed several markets in the region. Elsewhere, although
there was some response to Wednesday's Wall Street rally, some investors
were in two minds about the Dow.
AUSTRALIA fell on nervousness, a wavering futures market and weaker resource
stocks, the All Ordinaries index closing 36.6 lower at 2,234.3. A fund
manager said Sydney was still in profit-taking mode, destabilised by the
96-point fall in the Dow six days earlier.
Among resource stocks, North Broken Hill was 24 cents down at ADollars 3.60
after the Robe River iron ore project said it would take a 14.5 per cent
price cut for ore to Japan, in return for guaranteed tonnage.
NEW ZEALAND drifted in the absence of holidaying Asian investors, the
NZSE-40 index finishing 4.34 off at 2,364.82 after an intraday high of
2,377.50.
MANILA celebrated the Chinese new year by staying open and breaching the
3,000 level, the composite index ending 18.43 higher at 3,013.76.
Brokers said there was renewed foreign buying. Philippine National Bank
gained 20 pesos at 605 pesos and PLDT 10 pesos at 2,190 pesos.
BANGKOK and JAKARTA closed firmer in dull trading, the SET index rising 6.90
to 1,410.53 in turnover of Bt9.1bn and the JKSE composite index putting on
2.82 at 583.47. The latter saw buying in selected issues; Sampoerna
continued to capitalise on its optimistic 1994 net profits forecast, adding
6.2 per cent at Rp16,400 in thin volume.
KARACHI rose on government incentives for the textile industry announced
yesterday, the KSE 100 index finishing 15.50 ahead at 2,339.70.
BOMBAY ended higher, although early sharp gains were eroded by profit-taking
by the Unit Trust of India, as well as by other Indian financial
institutions. The BSE index was finally 20.98 up at 4,039.90, after touching
4,203.70.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Denmark looks ahead to resurgence of
new issues - The market is awaiting the privatisation of Teledanmark later
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance of shares listed on the Copenhagen stock exchange may not
match that of other Nordic countries over the past year but, given that
profits expectations for Danish companies have received no beneficial boost
from foreign exchange depreciation, it remains remarkably good.
The all-share index rose 39 per cent in 1993, climbed a further 13.7 per
cent to reach a new high on February 2, and is currently about 11.2 per cent
ahead since December 31.
Den Danske Bank's equity analysts predict an increase in profits averaging
13 per cent in 1994 and 19 per cent in 1995, only a fraction of the
expectation which the bank has for profits in Norway, Finland and Sweden.
This year is expected to see a resurgence in new issue activity after a long
period with little action.
Danisco, the food conglomerate, led off with a highly successful DKr1bn
(Dollars 149m) convertible - later raised by DKr150m - while Unidanmark, the
banking group, announced a new share issue, which will raise about DKr1.3bn,
following a return to profits in 1993 after three years of losses.
There will be a strong focus on the Teledanmark privatisation issue, due
before mid-summer, when 49 per cent of the stock in the state's monopoly
telecommunications group will be sold. The issue will be a record for the
Copenhagen market, with estimates of the amount to be raised ranging from
about DKr7bn to almost double that figure.
Another, much smaller, privatisation issue, the sale of 25 per cent in
Copenhagen Airport, is also under preparation for this spring, and could
raise about DKr750m.
The resolution of ownership of Baltica, the country's largest insurance
group (including life assurance), will be another major event this year.
Brought to its knees by ill-judged property and other investments, Baltica
was rescued by Den Danske Bank last year, leaving Danske with a 32 per cent
stake; the former Baltica Holding, now known as Gefion, has 24 per cent.
These shares are up for sale, and it is an open question whether Danish
investors have the means or the inclination to take on the domestic giant.
If not, both Denmark's two top insurance groups (the other is Codan) will be
foreign-owned.
Unidanmark's return to profit of DKr885m in 1993 after a DKr4.66bn loss in
1992 is an indication that the worst is over for the finance industry.
The strains on the sector, however, are still showing, as the insurance
concern Topdanmark was forced to concede this month after the Finance
Industry Supervisory Authority told it to increase bad loss provisions in
its banking subsidiary Aktivbanken, which will, therefore, make a loss
again; the group's profits forecast was reduced from DKr148m to DKr100m.
Among the larger and more liquid shares, FLS Industries, supplier of cement
mills and technology, aircraft maintenance services and building materials,
has put on 18 per cent since the end of the year.
The share price was helped by comments from Mr Birger Riisager, its chief
executive, who told analysts that the market was undervaluing the group,
which has a large order book for cement mills around the world. But FLS
Industries 'B' shares, presently priced about DKr554, are still way off
their 1993 peak of DKr615.
Among smaller companies, a return to profits in the half-year ending
November 30 by Bang &amp; Olufsen, the manufacturer of up-market television and
audio equipment, sent the 'B' stock to a high of DKr780, compared with a
1993 low of DKr110 and a year-end DKr552, before receding to its current
DKr703.
The group implemented a tough rationalisation programme and introduced a new
product strategy at the end of 1992 under a new chief executive, Mr Anders
Knutsen, which paid off with first-half profits of DKr30m, after several
years with losses, and a sales surge of 18 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee 'on verge of major
rally'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices are on the verge of a major rally, according to brokers GNI in
its latest 'Market Alert', reports Reuter.
Forecasting a possible medium-term target of 95 cents a pound for the New
York July contract, which yesterday was trading just below 79 cents, the
report said estimates of lower Central American and Colombian crops this
season had combined with signs the producers' retention scheme was starting
to bite.
'The timing of any move in commodity markets can often be distorted by
physical flows, and we believe the time is now right to look for a major
rally in coffee.'
GNI said doubts over Brazil's political ability to hold its retention scheme
together had been a major factor in preventing prices from rising over the
past eight months. But there were signs that the government had nearly
caught up with its retention obligations for the October-December period and
the decision to hand the scheme over to exporters should prove effective, it
added.
The government would still be responsible through the auction system for
retaining coffee registered before February 3, 'and consequently two
programmes will be working at once. . . this will soak up the remainder of
the 1993-94 crop'' the report said.
In addition, the 1994-95 crop was expected to be 4m bags (60kg each) lower
than this year's estimated 23m.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks stay under pressure as
carmakers rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets move in sequence, said Mr Robin Griffiths of James Capel
yesterday, and on that basis the big buying of continental European stocks
has yet to come, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Griffiths's technical analysis, broadly, backed up Capel's fundamental
choice of markets in 1994. In Europe, ex the UK, they include France,
Sweden, Italy and Spain to the exclusion of Switzerland and Germany, in
particular. Mr Griffiths, however, pointed out that technical analysts look
strongly at the fundamentals. 'If the world moves as it should,' he said,
'the two should talk with one voice.'
FRANKFURT reflected the prevalent loss of faith in bank shares, and the
global upsurge of confidence in automotive industry stocks. The Dax index
rose 33.67 on the session to 2,118.96 - consolidating Wednesday's
post-bourse gains - and held its ground to finish the afternoon at 2,119.69.
Turnover eased from DM10.6bn to DM9.9bn. Rises of just over 1 per cent at
Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank were only weak on the margin, but they
followed a bad day on Wednesday. In carmakers BMW kept the bulk of its short
covering gains on Wednesday afternoon, but it was still up DM26 to DM803 on
the session with Daimler almost alongside at DM819, up DM18.20, and
Volkswagen DM9 higher at DM450.
Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that banks had been waiting just too
long for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. Kleinwort likes BMW, which
rose again to DM816 in the post-bourse, looking for intrinsic earnings
growth as Rover sales increase over the next two years, and synergy benefits
thereafter as BMW and Rover are put together; but Daimler, said Mr Liddy,
might find it hard to justify the gains currently coming piggyback on the
BMW story.
PARIS took a breather after Wednesday's break through 2,300, and the CAC-40
index closed off 5.29 at 2,296.77.
Turnover was FFr4.9bn.
Peugeot stood out with a FFr23 gain to FFr870. There have been a number of
conflicting recommendations on the car group this week, with one US broker
moving downwards and a French house taking the opposite tack yesterday.
Elf Aquitaine ended down FFr6.50 at FFr424.30 as the public offer period
came to an end, with estimates suggesting that it was at least 2.5 times
subscribed. The results of the public offer will be made known on Monday
after the bourse has closed; the offer price for institutions will also be
revealed at the same time.
AMSTERDAM was interested in KNP BT and Nedlloyd although the AEX finished
barely altered, off 0.08 at 437.32.
KNP BT, the paper group, advanced to a day's high of Fl 52.00, before
finishing up Fl 2.50 at Fl 50.50 ahead of today's results. The stock was
assisted by bullish comments by the company chairman yesterday, reiterating
a view that a return to profit would be seen this year.
Hoare Govett put out a buy recommendation on the stock recently and
suggested that restructuring measures should enable the group to achieve a
20 per cent return on investments by 1996-1997.
Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group, a strong performer so far this
week on forecasts that it will return to profit this year, notched up a
further Fl 1.90 to Fl 80.40.
ZURICH was marked 1.4 per cent lower as domestic institutional investors saw
firm early prices as an opportunity to launch another round of
profit-taking. Late foreign selling also helped to push the SMI index 42
lower to 3,012.2, taking the cumulative fall this week to 4.9 per cent.
Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers, topping the actives list,
shedding SFr26 to SFr1,439. Roche certificates, widely viewed as having led
the recent rally, lost SFr140 to SFr6,950.
Motor-Columbus added SFr25 to SFr1,750 after the chief executive was quoted
as saying that there were potential buyers for the telecommunications and
energy group, after its recent comprehensive restructuring.
Sulzer rose SFr21 to SFr936 in response to the engineering group's
announcement that it was merging its worldwide paper activities with those
of Germany's Voith.
MILAN absorbed technically inspired selling ahead of today's end of the
February account as renewed demand emerged for the recently overshadowed
telecoms sector. The Comit index edged 0.29 lower to 679.83.
Stet was L106 higher at L4,739 after remarks by its Stet chairman were
interpreted as suggesting that Sip would retain its mobile telephone
business - and profits - throughout this year. Sip added L80 to L4,407.
Ferruzzi rose L38 to L2,042 in heavy volume of 43m shares after the
conclusion of its capital raising exercise. IMI gave up L344 to L13,086 on
profit-taking after after last week's privatisation and Wednesday's market
debut.
STOCKHOLM, strongly tipped by a number of analysts as a star performer this
year, fell 2.1 per cent on interest rate and corporate worries. The
Affarsvarlden index shed 32.7 to 1,533.5. Ericsson B shares were SKr5 lower
at SKr356 in spite of its more than doubled pre-tax profits.
ISTANBUL tumbled another 10.2 per cent, down 1,697,89 to a provisional close
of 14,087.82, for a cumulative 51.2 per cent fall since the all time high of
January 13.
TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index recovered by 4.35, or 1.8 per cent to 240.22 in
response to the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo.
However, dealers said that the broad market was still on a downtrend. Many
small-capitalisation stocks, they said, closed the week with heavy losses
after Wednesday's disclosure that two Israeli portfolio managers had been
arrested on suspicion of manipulating shares in eight companies.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Sterling still depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWAITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's weakness in the wake of Tuesday's interest rate cut continued
yesterday as it tested an 11-month low against the dollar, writes Philip
Gawith.
The UK currency continued to look vulnerable, trading as low as Dollars
1.4545, although it staged a late afternoon recovery to end in London at
Dollars 1.4615, marginally up from its Wednesday close of Dollars 1.4605.
Volumes, however, were much lower than on Wednesday and trading steadier.
Elsewhere, market attention was focused on Washington where last minute
trade talks took place ahead of today's planned trade summit between
President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister.
Sterling has not managed to shake off the negative sentiment attached to
Tuesday's rate cut. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said an
additional factor preying on sentiment was the comparison being drawn
between the contrasting UK and US interest rate changes in spite of fairly
similar inflation backgrounds. He said spare capacity was a crucial
determinant of inflationary pressure and it was not clear that the gap
between the two countries was that large.
Also weighing down the pound was the relative strength of the D-Mark across
the board. Sterling finished in London at DM2.5625, down from a previous
DM2.5708 close. This represents a fall of nearly five pfennigs from the UK
currency's level before the rate cut. It has now retraced all the gains it
made against the D-Mark in the new year.
Sterling's trade weighted value finished at 80.8, unchanged from Wednesday
evening.
A Reuters survey of 20 City economists showed that 60 per cent felt the cut
came at the wrong time. Half felt the authorities' justification for
reducing rates was incomplete and unconvincing.
The dollar ended slightly firmer against the yen yesterday at Y108.450,
compared with Y107.845 on Wednesday. It declined against the D-Mark,
however, closing at DM1.7534 after a previous DM1.7603. The US currency
finished New York trading at Y108.25 and DM1.7533.
Analysts said that for the dollar to appreciate further the market needed to
see an interest rate cut from the Bundesbank. Failing that, the settlement
of the IG Metall wage talks or the release of German M3 data might give the
D-Mark new direction.
Trade on the yen/dollar cross remained uncertain ahead of today's summit.
Some comfort that there might be a meeting of minds came after Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, met US trade representative Mr Mickey
Kantor. After emerging from talks, Mr Hata commented: 'Both of us are
determined to come up with an agreement.'
This optimism was dampened yesterday evening when a senior US Administration
official was quoted as saying the odds were running 'pretty high' against a
trade deal ahead of the summit. 'We are pretty far apart on everything,' the
official was quoted as saying. The market access talks will focus on four
sectors: cars and car parts, insurance, and procurement of
telecommunications equipment and medical equipment.
Dealers said the yen was hard to trade in the short term as it was beset by
uncertainties about the strength of the government and the long-running
trade policy dispute with the US. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency
research at JP Morgan, said a number of investors were, as a result, taking
flat (neutral) positions on the yen.
With no fresh economic data to give the market direction, the EMS grid went
through another day of little activity.
The Italian lira, the week's best performing currency, remained firm,
closing at L964.5 per D-Mark. The lira has risen almost 4 per cent in six
weeks since starting the year near the L1,000 level.
Mr Persaud cited the lira's performance as evidence of the progressive
decoupling of the performance of the high yielding European currencies, such
as the lira and the Spanish peseta, from the so-called 'hard-core' ERM
currencies, such as the French and Belgian francs.
By contrast with the lira, the French franc continued to struggle to
progress against the D-Mark, trading around the FFr3.40 level where it has
been since late December. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said
technical indicators suggested that the franc had lost momentum. Should a
resurgent dollar dissuade the Bundesbank from cutting rates, this would
'raise the question again of the sustainability of European policy'.
The market obtained no guidance from the Bank of France's newly independent
monetary policy council, which met for the fourth time but issued no
statement about its deliberations.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with help for the day of
Pounds 1.444bn. This compared with its forecast of a Pounds 1.55bn liquidity
shortage, revised from an earlier Pounds 1.5bn. The market was fairly
liquid, reflected in money market rates falling to 3 1/2 per cent before
picking up later to 6 1/4 per cent.
Outright assistance was provided at an interest rate of 5 1/8 per cent,
while the Bank bought Pounds 1.2bn of bills for resale to the market at an
interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc prices fall sharply as
closure plan collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zinc prices fell sharply yesterday after European producers admitted that
their attempt to end over-capacity by the co-ordinated closure of one or two
smelters had collapsed.
The price had been in free-fall since Tuesday as rumours spread that the
closure plan was to be abandoned, but it continued to retreat and touched
Dollars 963 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange at one point yesterday,
nearly 7 1/2 per cent below the Dollars 1,040 it reached last week when
optimistic noises about the so-called smelter shut-down agreement were still
emerging from the industry.
In late trading zinc for delivery in three months regained some ground to
close at Dollars 969.75 a tonne, down Dollars 13.25, or more than 1 per
cent, from Wednesday's close.
Analysts suggested there was strong technical support between Dollars 940
and Dollars 960 a tonne but even this level might be vulnerable if
investment funds returned again as determined sellers.
There was considerable disappointment among producers that a second attempt
to deal with the structural overcapacity that had plagued the European zinc
industry for 20 years had come to nothing.
Only a week ago Mr Jacques Spaas, secretary-general of Eurometaux, the
Brussels-based organisation that has provided a forum for the producer
talks, said a formula had been worked out and producers now only had to
agree to support it. The arrangement would have involved one or two European
smelters being closed and the expense being shared by the industry as a
whole - provided the European Commission gave its approval.
Yesterday a short statement from Eurometaux said the talks had been
suspended and no new meetings were foreseen but added: 'It is still believed
that the overcapacity in Europe has to be addressed and that structural
changes within the European zinc industry will have to occur. Developments
over the last months are demonstrating that such changes are beginning to
take place'.
Producers refused to discuss the reasons for the collapse in negotiations.
It is known that they were particularly concerned about anti-trust problems.
Mr Wim de Graaf, general manager of the Budel smelter in the Netherlands,
said on Tuesday that there were still 'quite a lot of legal issues
involved'.
Also, since discussions started in June, the industry's outlook has been
transformed by the financial problems of two big European groups -
Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which owns the Rhurzink smelter, and the
Spanish banking combine, Banesto, which controls 58 per cent of Asturiana de
Zinc. These are now under new management. Metaleurop, the French offshoot of
Germany's Preussag, has also reported big losses recently.
Zinc stocks on the LME have doubled in the past year and moved above 1m
tonnes for the first time last week. Industry-wide stocks are over 1.5m
tonnes and Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals,
suggests that annual output cuts of 500,000 tonnes are now required to bring
the market back into balance.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway accused of 20% subsidy
on salmon farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A study of Norwegian salmon farming by the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young
has concluded that over the past five years the industry has enjoyed a 20
per cent subsidy on its cost of production from the Norwegian government.
The study also shows that over that period the Norwegian industry has
consistently lost money. The losses have mostly been absorbed by the four
big banks, which since 1991 have come under the control of the government. A
further expected surge in Norwegian salmon output is likely to be financed
by the government and its associated banks.
Ernst &amp; Young says that Norway's high level of production at low prices
could not have been achieved without direct grants and subsidies to
producers; loans and guarantees awarded but subsequently written off;
overpayments to the statutory marketing organisation, the debts of which
were later written off by the government; and the continuing bankrolling of
fish farming by the state-controlled banks.
The Scottish Salmon Growers Association and Sir William Lithgow, a leading
businessman, commissioned the study in response to the crisis in the
Scottish salmon industry, caused, they say, by Norwegian over-production and
dumping.
It intends to use the report to press the UK government to take stronger
action against Norway through the European Union, and to stimulate an EU
investigation into unfair subsidies to fish farmers by the Norwegian
government. It has already complained to the EU that Norway is dumping
salmon.
Because of a surge in Norway's production, salmon prices in the EU collapsed
last October. Norway produced 180,000 tonnes of salmon in 1983 compared with
Scotland's 45,000 tonnes. Some 85 per cent of Norwegian salmon is exported
to the EU.
In November the EU imposed a minimum import price of Pounds 2.64 a kilogram,
but Scottish farmers said this was insufficient to restore their
profitability. Last weekend the minimum import price was increased to Pounds
2.74.
The study says that the Norwegian salmon industry received more than Pounds
230m in state subsidies over the past four years.
The money came principally from Norway's Industrial and Regional Development
Fund, which made loans that were not repaid and guaranteed 50 per cent of
bank loans on which the fish farmers defaulted.
In addition the Norwegian government in 1991 wrote off the Pounds 177m debts
of the Fish Sales Organisation, the statutory salmon marketing body which,
the study says, had been overpaying salmon farmers for their fish.
A further Pounds 35m was spent financing a programme to freeze salmon and
sell them outside the EU.
The report points out that following a series of banking crises up to 1992,
the state now controls the four biggest Norwegian banks and through them 50
per cent of the salmon industry. It suggests that the bank-controlled and
bank-financed farms are effectively being 'bank-rolled pending a return to
more favourable market conditions'.
It calculates that direct subsidies averaged Pounds 295 a tonne in 1991 and
1992, while the writing off of the debts of the FOS was worth another Pounds
172 a tonne, making a total subsidy of Pounds 467 a tonne. That was 20 per
cent of Norwegian farmers' average cost, calculated by the Norwegian
consultants Kontali, of Pounds 2,370 a tonne.
The Norwegian government has consistently denied allegations of unfair
subsidies and dumping. It argues that it makes no specific subsidies to
salmon farmers and that the general subsidies available are in accordance
with EU rules on state aid. Its assistance to the freezing programme was to
the benefit of Scottish as well as Norwegian farmers.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A pause in the wool market rise showed signs of developing at closing sales
last week, and was confirmed at the only two selling centres operating in
Australia this week. Price declines did not go far and the official market
indicator managed to rise one cent to 539 cents a kilogram yesterday, only 7
cents lower than a week before. Of some importance to wool buyers were
interest rates changes which included a rise in the US and a reduction in
the UK. Resulting currency changes put up the cost of most of the
internationally traded wool since the Australian dollar continues to gain
ground against the US dollar itself. The trade is unsure about the immediate
outlook for wool prices, with offerings heavy in Australia but a possibility
that Chinese buying may soon revive after a recent lull.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium falls as output cuts
slow - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM prices were depressed yesterday by a slowing in the production cut
bandwagon, following statements by Norway's Elkem and Sweden's Granges. News
that France's Pechiney was to temporarily curb production at some stage
cushioned the fall, however, and the London Metal Exchange three months
delivery price closed Dollars 11.25 off the day's low at Dollars 1,278.25 a
tonne, down Dollars 10.50 on balance.
The three months LEAD price broke below the Dollars 500-a-tonne level, in a
culmination of this week's downtrend, with some sell stops pushing it to
Dollars 492 a tonne at one stage. By the close it had steadied to Dollars
498.50 a tonne, down Dollars 4.75 on the day and Dollars 25 since the end of
last week.
LME NICKEL largely traded in the plus column, with a dip below Dollars 5,800
a tonne for three months delivery reversed by keen buying interest. At the
close the price was up Dollars 32.50 on the day at Dollars 5,835 a tonne.
Precious metals continued to trade in their established ranges at the London
bullion market after New York markets opened largely in line with forecasts.
GOLD ended 45 cents higher at Dollars 382.25 a troy ounce, while cash SILVER
was unchanged at Dollars 5.30 1/2 an ounce. PLATINUM fared better, widening
its premium over gold with a Dollars 2.50 rise to Dollars 392 an ounce.
'The lack of Far East interest overnight didn't help the markets today,' one
dealer commented. Borrowing (buying cash and selling forward) against
possible production disruptions during the South African all-party elections
in April tightened physical platinum's liquidity, dealers said.
PALLADIUM, platinum's sister metal, saw continued strong physical interest
and some investment fund buying on the futures.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar crop estimate reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodities trading company has cut its estimate of
this year's world sugar crop by 1.6m tonnes to 110.8m. Its latest report on
the market outlook puts consumption at 113.3m tonnes, leaving a deficit of
2.5m tonnes.
The sugar crops in Thailand, Cuba, India and South Africa have failed to
recover fully from last season's reduced output. In addition, shortfalls
have emerged in China, Argentina and Mauritius.
New York sugar prices have remained at about 11 cents a pound, however,
reflecting uncertainty about the prospects for demand. Flat consumption in
east and central Europe and rumoured changes to the Russian import tariffs
for sugar have had a dampening effect on prices.
Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit says improved prospects for most
soft commodities are holding, though the impact of adverse weather in North
America on grains and oilseeds is fading.
In the February issue of its World Commodity Forecast, the EIU says it sees
little prospect of physical demand for metals picking up this year but that
demand from futures markets has been booming.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton trade to lobby against
export bans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International cotton traders will travel to India and Pakistan next week to
try to persuade the governments of those countries to lift export embargoes
on cotton shipments. The Indian government suspended shipments on Tuesday
following shortfalls in domestic production.
The cotton that is being held up by the export ban had been sold by tender
to international traders. Those trading companies say they will now have to
turn to the world spot market for higher-priced supplies to fulfil their own
contractual obligations.
World cotton prices have risen sharply in recent weeks in response to news
that production in China, the US, India and Pakistan - the world's biggest
cotton growers - would be affected by bad weather and disease. Prices on the
New York Cotton Exchange increased from about 50 cents a pound last
September to 76 cents yesterday.
The US Department of Agriculture estimates that this year's world crop will
fall by 2.5m bales from 1992-1993's 82.8m bales.
'The action of the Indian government is so short-sighted when it has spent
so long building it's reputation as a reliable source of cotton,' said Mr
Colin Bernhardt, chairman of Liverpool-based cotton traders Ralli Brothers &amp;
Coney.
The Indians are holding back 200,000 bales - equal to about a week's
consumption by domestic mills. This is a tiny fraction of the overall world
cotton trade, which accounts for 23m bales, but the World Cotton Exporters
Association - a group of international traders - is concerned about the
precedent the move will set.
The Turkish government slapped on high export sales taxes on cotton last
month in an effort to hold back shipments. But after protests from the
European Union, Turkey agreed to suspend the tax on cotton contracted for
export prior to its imposition.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts hit by jitters as traders await
auction announcement
</HEADLINE>

UK government bonds and futures traded nervously yesterday as traders took
bets on whether the Bank of England would announce a February gilts auction
today. The March long gilt future rose as high as 116 1/4 before dropping
back to close at 115 5/8 , down  9/32 on the day.
Some dealers believed that the market's weakness since the base rate cut
earlier this week would discourage the Bank from issuing more paper,
especially since it had almost completed its funding programme for the
current 1993-1994 year.
But others decided that the Bank would announce an auction of short-dated
gilts today in order to make inroads into next year's funding programme and
to be seen to be consistent with its auctions. They expected the Bank to
re-open the benchmark 6 per cent gilts due 1999 by about Pounds 2.5bn. The
closing yield on these gilts was 6 per cent.
German government bunds and futures ended little changed after a volatile
day's trading. The March bund future traded between a high of 99.36 and a
low of 98.84 before ending at 99.12, down 0.08 on the day.
Analysts said the market continued to dwell on the timing of an interest
rate cut by the Bundesbank.
Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg said that an interest rate cut could come as
early as next week now that the D-Mark was firmer and there had been some
pay settlements with the IG Metall engineering union.
However, Mr Neil Williams at Daiwa Europe said he did not expect the
Bundesbank to move on interest rates until the end of March and that the
market would remain under a cloud until then.
Italian government bonds started to suffer a little after their recent
strong performance. But traders put the weakness down to a temporary
correction.
The March future ended at 118.09 down 0.41 point on the day and in the
middle of the day's trading range of 117.88 to 118.65.
Meanwhile, Banca Commerciale Italiana said in a report that it expected the
Italian treasury to issue a net L127,700bn of paper this year which should
contribute to containing the budget deficit at L150,800bn, slightly below
1993's L153,000bn but still above government targets of L144,200bn.
French government bonds came off the day's highs in disappointment that the
Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.20 per cent at
yesterday's securities repurchase tender. The March notional future ended up
0.22 point at 128.98, off the day's best level of 129.16.
Japanese government bond futures closed slightly easier in light trading as
dealers squared their positions ahead of today's public holiday.
The March futures contract ended at 114.53 in Tokyo, up from a previous
day's close of 114.66, and traded around 114.50 in London.
Mr James Greener, analyst at Tokyo Trust International, noted that JGBs rose
on the week for the first time in a month and broke above an important chart
resistance point.
He added that the ministry of finance's funding plan for the next year was
well received by the market and appeared to calmed some fears of rampant
over-supply.
US bond prices retreated after the Treasury's 30-year debt auction
yesterday, as traders prepared for tomorrow's data on producer prices and
retail sales.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at
97 17/32 , with the yield rising to 6.433 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down 3/32 at 99 5/16, to yield 4.435 per cent.
In early activity, prices ebbed as the market awaited the outcome of the
final leg of the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding programme. News
of a decline of 47,000 in weekly claims for unemployment benefit had no
impact on sentiment.
In the afternoon, the auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year securities, the
first new issue in six months, proved a success. The bonds were awarded an
average yield of 6.43 per cent, in line with expectations.
Afterwards, prices dropped further as attention turned to tomorrow's figures
on producer prices and retail sales in January. The data will provide a clue
to the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to boost short-term
interest rates.
Analysts said the market had already priced in an unfavourable PPI reading,
but was counting on a soft reading on consumer purchases.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: India Fund aims to raise up
to Dollars 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The India Fund, a newly-launched closed-end fund, hopes to raise up to
Dollars 400m from international investors looking for exposure to the Indian
stock market.
The liberalisation and deregulation of the Indian economy during the past
couple of years - and the prospect of strong economic growth - has sparked
considerable interest in Indian equities from international and emerging
market investors.
The India Fund, which has a New York Stock Exchange listing, will
concentrate on investing mainly in medium-sized companies.
'We think the medium-sized companies are better able to adjust to the reform
process, and also they are much cheaper,' said Mr Jeff Chowdhry, fund
manager at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management which is acting as
investment adviser to the fund.
Mr Chowdhry said the sectors which are likely to be of particular interest
are those related to infrastructure projects (such as the telecommunications
and power sectors), as well as tourism-related stocks, for example companies
in the hotel business.
The fund hopes to raise up to Dollars 400m through the sale of 2.666m shares
priced at Dollars 15 per share, according to the prospectus. It is aiming
for long-term capital growth.
Advantage Advisers, a subsidiary of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, will act as investment
manager to the fund, while Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd,
an Indian company, will act as country adviser to the fund.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Marathon bond takes the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond sector came back to life yesterday, absorbing some 20 new
issues denominated mainly in US dollars and sterling.
The highlight of the day, however, was the widely expected Greek drachma
bond, dubbed Marathon bond by the lead managers, for the European Investment
Bank.
The Dr10bn of 17 1/2 per cent five-year bonds - the first
drachma-denominated foreign bonds - met overwhelming retail demand and
closed at 104.5 bid, well above their par issue price. The lead manager
reported strong demand from European retail investors and offshore US
investment funds.
'In this low-yield environment, if someone offers you a 17 1/2 per cent
coupon, you take the money and run - hence the name,' quipped a London
syndicate official. The issue was lead managed by Midland Bank Athens and
the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank.
In the Eurosterling sector, the financing subsidiaries of two leading German
banks took advantage of a swap window in the five-year sector.
Dresdner Finance issued Pounds 200m of 6 per cent bonds due December 1999,
with a maturity slightly exceeding that of the 6 per cent gilt due August
1999 over which they were priced at 20 basis points above.
According to one of the lead managers, the issue got a strong initial
response, especially from continental European investors seeking exposure to
sterling after its recent slide. But placement slowed as the gilt market
grew choppy and Commerzbank launched a rival five-year issue, the official
said. BZW and UBS arranged the Dresdner deal.
Commerzbank Overseas Finance issued Pounds 150m of 6 1/4 per cent bonds due
December 1999 via Natwest Capital Markets and Commerzbank, priced to yield
27 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due August 1999.
After the issues were freed to trade, the yield spread on the Dresdner deal
widened to around 24 basis points on the bid price and to about 32 basis
points on the Commerzbank issue. But according to one of the lead managers,
'this type of deal can take weeks to place, and we'll probably start seeing
the spreads tighten in over time'.
Welsh Water Utilities Finance got a more positive response for its two
sterling deals, Pounds 100m of 7 5/8 per cent partly-paid 20-year bonds
priced at 77 basis points over gilts and Pounds 100m of 7 1/8 per cent
10-year bonds yielding 48 basis points over gilts at the re-offer price.
According to an official at lead manager Baring Brothers, the deal saw
strong investor demand, especially from UK accounts.
'This is the first core water company issue in two years, and coming after a
wave of mainly financial issues this utility issue was very well received,'
he said.
Other dealers reported solid demand for the paper, citing the borrower's
rarity value and the deal's fair pricing.
In the dollar sector, Swiss Bank Corporation lead-managed three deals
totalling Dollars 1.1bn. General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars
400m of 5 1/2 per cent five-year bonds and Dollars 400m of 5 per cent
three-year bonds via SBC and Toyota Motor Credit Corporation issued Dollars
300m of three-year notes, paying a coupon of 5 per cent. While the GECC
five-year bond was said to have met fair demand, the two three-year deals
were dogged by the recent glut of supply in that maturity, traders said. The
yield spread over US Treasuries on all three issues widened slightly after
they were freed to trade, traders said.
Thompson-Brandt BV, the large French electronics company, issued FFr1.5bn of
10-year 6 3/8 per cent bonds via CCF and J. P. Morgan. Priced at 62 basis
points over the 5 1/2 per cent OAT, the paper found good demand from French
and other continental European investors, a lead manager said.
Lonrho, the international conglomerate, is rumoured to be planning a Pounds
100m convertible bond issue in the next two weeks, with CS First Boston or
Nomura tipped as possible lead managers.

<TEXT>
Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), a Malaysian conglomerate involved mainly in
the property, media and power sectors, has won a MDollars 1.6bn (USDollars
579.7m) contract to install power transmission lines for Tenaga Nasional,
the country's partially privatised electricity utility.
National Grid, of the UK, is a leading contender to take a 20 per cent stake
in a new company formed to undertake the project.
MRCB and Permodalan Nasional, the Malaysian state investment corporation,
will each take a 40 per cent share in the new venture.
MRCB has risen to prominence over the past 18 months and is seen as a
company closely allied to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister
and finance minister. Early last year, MRCB took control of the New Straits
Times group, Malaysia's biggest publishing company, and TV3, the country's
only independent TV station.
Last year a unit of MRCB was also awarded the licence to build a 1,300MW
power plant in the north of Malaysia. The plant forms part of the country's
programme of privatising a substantial portion of its power generating
facilities.
National Grid yesterday would not comment on the Malaysian transmission
project. However, recently it said it was prepared to invest up to Pounds
350m (USDollars 511m) in overseas ventures. The Pacific rim offered
considerable investment opportunities for the company, it said.
Ekran, a Malaysian timber and construction company, has signed agreements
with the Philippines government to develop a USDollars 100m tourist resort
on Samal island, in the southern Philippines, writes Kieran Cooke.
Ekran says it will be building hotels, a golf course, a casino and other
facilities on Samal.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Problems at the Euro Disney theme park near Paris yesterday cost Walt Disney
its double-A credit rating from Moody's, the US rating agency.
Moody's downgraded the US entertainment group over concerns that the poor
performance at Euro Disney would continue, increasing Walt Disney's
financial risks. The rating agency said it expected the company's debt
restructuring talks to result in Walt Disney and the theme park's bankers
agreeing to share the financial burden.
The loss of a double-A credit rating can lead to higher debt costs, since
many bond investors are prevented by their articles from holding bonds which
do not carry a double- or triple-A rating from one of the leading agencies.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading US rating agency, is also considering
whether to remove Disney's double-A rating.
Moody's said it expected Euro Disney's operating results to remain under
pressure 'in the intermediate term,' even if the restructuring resulted in a
reduction in the theme park's debt servicing costs.
EuroDisneyLand has been forced to cut its prices to attract visitors, and
has postponed a planned expansion.

Trans-Natal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trans-Natal, South Africa's biggest coal exporter, suffered a 28 per cent
slide in pre-tax profit to R68m (Dollars 19.8m) in the half-year to
end-December from R94.2m a year earlier. Continued productivity gains at the
Gencor-owned company's collieries were outweighed by lower export and inland
coal prices.
Mr David Murray, managing director, warned that although the interim
dividend was held at 23 cents, the final payout was likely to be reduced.
This was because earnings would fall by the year-end after the 10 per cent
cut in 1994 export contract prices the group had so far negotiated with its
customers.
Overall sales tonnage rose to 13.8m tonnes from 13.6m tonnes but revenue
fell to R820.5m from R826.6m.
Mr Murray said a near 1 per cent fall in unit production costs was 'a rare
achievement,' cushioning the fall in operating income to R109m from R119m. A
reduced tax liability left after-tax income only 22 per cent down at R43.1m
compared with R55.5m.
Distributable profit improved to R43.1m from R34.5m, flattered by the R22m
provision made in 1992 in writing off some coal-mining assets.
Earnings rose to 54.1 cents from 43.3 cents per share.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sharp advance at Bergesen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bergesen, Norway's biggest shipowner and one of the world's largest tanker
operators, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in 1993 pretax profits to
NKr132m (Dollars 17.4m) from NKr20m a year earlier, helped by gains on
securities and disposals. But the group warned of another weak year for
shipping operations in 1994.
Operating revenue rose by NKr285m to NKr2.93bn while operating profit
advanced by only NKr67m to NKr270m, reflecting a weak spot market for
tankers and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) vessels.
An unchanged dividend of NKr1 a share is proposed.
Bergesen charged 1993 accounts with NKr200m in net financial items, up from
NKr184m in 1992, after unrealised currency losses of NKr221m. But it booked
realised gains on securities of NKr94m, against NKr8m, and said unrealised
gains on the group's share portfolio had increased to NKr1.43bn from
NKr225m.
Bergesen also booked realised gains of NKr61m on the disposal of two dry
cargo vessels. The tanker division cut 1993 operating losses to NKr121m from
NKr218m and said that overall, the value of its fleet in dollar terms was
little changed from 1992 but that a stronger dollar had led to a 10 per cent
increase in the krone value of its vessels.
Vessel operations last year were satisfactory but the group forecast another
weak year in 1994. It added that it saw a weaker year in 1994 for LPG
vessels operating in the spot market and a soft market for dry cargo
vessels.

Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a 21 per cent
advance in 1993 pre-tax profits to NKr12bn (Dollars 1.58bn) from NKr9.9bn
the previous year, boosted by a reduction in operating costs, improved
financial results and a good performance by the securities portfolio.
However, the group said it would cut its dividend payment to the state to
NKr1.08bn from NKr1.25bn.
Group operating revenue rose by NKr6.6bn to NKr81.1bn as operating profit
dipped to NKr12.24bn from NKr12.6bn.
'The Statoil group achieved a good result in 1993,' said Mr Harald Norvik,
chief executive. 'Production from the fields we operate was good. Efforts to
improve recovery from these fields is yielding positive results. Measures by
all our business areas to cut costs have also contributed to the good
result.'
Mr Norvik warned, however, that market developments indicated low prices and
narrow margins in 1994. 'As a result, improvement programmes will continue
with undiminished vigour to secure the group's competitiveness and long-term
profitability,' he pledged.
Operating costs in 1993 were NKr68.63bn, against NKr61.95bn, but the group
expanded operations last year when a new gas field came on stream, a new
pipeline became operational and when several oil fields in which Statoil has
substantial shareholdings started producing.
Net financial charges were reduced by NKr2bn to NKr700m, reflecting reduced
currency losses on long-term debt and securities gains. Net interest
expenses were cut by NKr300m in 1993 while currency losses on long-term debt
fell to NKr1.7bn from NKr2.3bn.
Gains on securities and bonds in 1993 reached NKr500m, against a loss of
NKr580m in the previous year.
Statoil noted that Brent blend reference crude achieved an average price per
barrel of Dollars 17 last year, down from Dollars 19.30 a year earlier.
However, in domestic currency terms the price per barrel of crude was NKr1
higher at NKr121.
Daily crude oil production slipped to 414,000 barrels a day from 418,000 due
to reduced output from the prolific Statfjord field. Group investments rose
to NKr13.4bn in 1993 from NKr10.6bn.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Elkem bounces back into the

<TEXT>
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced that it had
bounced back to a pre-tax profit of NKr166m (Dollars 21.9m) in 1993 from a
loss of NKr673m in the previous year. Results were helped by improved prices
and volumes for the group's ferro-alloys' products, a cut in domestic energy
taxes and a higher dollar/krone exchange rate.
Nevertheless, Elkem plans to omit its dividend payment for the fourth year
running.
Group net sales were lifted to NKr7.83bn last year from NKr7.3bn in the
previous year as operating costs increased to NKr7.13bn from NKr7bn. Elkem's
operations swung to a profit of NKr397m from a loss of NKr86m, allowing the
group to post a net profit of NKr133m in 1993 against a net loss of NKr610m
in 1992.
Price developments in the second half were positive for ferrosilicon and
ferromanganese and unchanged for silicon metal, but were weaker for
ferrochrome and aluminium, the company said.
Elkem explained that while its cost-savings programme made a significant
contribution to last year's advance, extensive operational interruptions at
some plants had prevented cost targets from being met.
Net financial expenses in 1993 were NKr324m, against NKr511m, which included
net interest expenses of NKr301m, against NKr431m.

Lamborghini, once the pride of Italy's sports car manufacturers, is taking
the fast lane to the East.
A consortium of businessmen from Malaysia and Indonesia are putting the
finishing touches to a deal believed to be worth in the region of USDollars
40m giving them full control of the Lamborghini marque.
Hit by the recession and a fall off in orders in the luxury sports car
market, Lamborghini has been struggling for several years to keep production
going.
Since the late 1980s Lamborghini has been controlled by Chrysler of the US.
Lamborghini's new owners have an interesting pedigree. Mr Hutomo Mandala
Putra, the youngest son of Indonesia's President Suharto, has a 50 per cent
stake in Megatech, a Bermuda registered company which is taking control of
Lamborghini.
The remaining shareholders in the enterprise are Mycom, a listed Malaysian
gaming and property company, Koperasi Polis DiRaja, the Malaysian police
investment fund, and Mr Setiawan Djody, an Indonesian entrepreneur who
controls the country's Setdco group of companies.
Exactly what the consortium intends to do with Lamborghini is not clear.
Mycom says it likely that the engine technology of Lamborghini will be used
to develop commercial vehicles in Indonesia.
However, industry analysts say Mycom is more interested in forming a
business alliance with the younger Suharto, a person of considerable
influence in the world of Indonesian business.
The Suharto children are a considerable force in the fast expanding vehicle
market in Indonesia.
A company controlled by a daughter of President Suharto recently entered
into an agreement with Malaysian interests to import the Malaysian made
Proton car into Indonesia.
Another son of the Indonesian president controls one of the country's
biggest vehicle assembly operations.

<TEXT>
The USDollars 116m deal for Reynolds Metals of the US to sell its 40 per
cent stake in the western Australian Boddington gold mine to Poseidon Gold
(PosGold) is to be challenged in the courts by Newcrest Mining, another
Boddington shareholder.
News of the challenge came as PosGold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's
Normandy Poseidon group, announced that it had placed 23.5m new shares at
ADollars 3.40. The placement, mainly with existing institutional
shareholders, raised ADollars 80m (USDollars 57.5m).
The placement is designed to help PosGold - which is already in the throes
of a hostile takeover bid for Aztec Mining - to fund the Boddington purchase
for USDollars 116m plus delivery of 30,000 ounces of gold over seven years.
Yesterday, however, Newcrest, which has a 20 per cent interest in the
Boddington mine, said the joint venture agreement was governed by various
conditions, including certain pre-emption rights for existing partners if a
stake was divested.
Reynolds, it said, had begun court action to determine the applicability of
the joint venture agreement to the proposed PosGold sale. Newcrest said it
had joined the action 'with a view to determining the status of Reynolds'
obligations through the courts in due process'.

Petrobras, Brazil's government-controlled oil company, reported net profits
of Dollars 673m for 1993 compared with Dollars 53m for 1992. The company
said the improvement was due to increased productivity and cost savings.
Mr Marcos Menezes, head of Petrobras's accounting division, said the company
increased production from an average 653,000 barrels per day in 1992 to
671,000 last year. He added that Petrobras saved Dollars 600m in operational
costs in 1993, Dollars 400m of which was due to lower financial costs after
a switch from expensive long-term financing in the local market and
comparatively low interest rates in international markets.
Net turnover for the period was Dollars 13.79bn.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Western Mining boss keeps his
cool - The improving position of a leading Australian mining group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Hugh Morgan, the controversial boss of Western Mining Corporation, is
fazed by calls for his head, his style gives nothing away. How long does he
intend to remain as managing director of one of Australia's largest mining
groups, he was asked yesterday. 'I haven't given it a moment's thought,'
came the immediate reply. There was just a touch of bravado.
Admittedly, Mr Morgan is batting on an improving wicket. WMC's interim
figures showed a 25.1 per cent increase in equity-consolidated profits after
tax but before abnormals, thanks to a strong contribution from the 48.25 per
cent interest in Alcoa of Australia. By the time the Alcoa contribution
turns down in the current calender year, says WMC, higher earnings from its
nickel and copper operations should be showing through.
The WMC share price, meanwhile, has benefited hugely from the improved
sentiment towards resource stocks and the booming Australian stockmarket. It
has rallied from a low of ADollars 3.83 some 15 months ago, to reach
ADollars 8 this week.
But whether this will disperse the question marks surrounding Mr Morgan's
tenure is a moot point. They have persisted for many months now - and every
time the clouds start to lift, a new storm seems to come along.
To recap, back in the 1980s WMC made a disastrous foray in to the North
American mining sector. As part of this strategy, it acquired a company
called Seabright for around CDollars 92m (USDollars 124m). Within weeks, it
had described Seabright's main asset, the Beaver Dam deposit, as hopeless.
WMC eventually wrote off its investment and proceeded to sue Seabright
directors, who counter-sued WMC. Last year, a Canadian court delivered a
judgment which was scathing about WMC's behaviour, and ordered the
Australian company to pay damages and costs. WMC proceeded to appeal.
The second, and arguably more serious, debacle concerned the rich Ernest
Henry copper/gold deposit in Queensland. WMC was forced to relinquish it
this year to Savage Resources from whom it had bought options over the area,
after it was disclosed that a WMC exploration team trespassed on the lease
area and then failed to advise Savage of its work.
WMC also took a ADollars 20m charge to cover legal and settlement costs
related to the affair.
Finally, in November, there was Lady Bountiful. WMC and Ord Minnett paid
ADollars 20m to settle a case in which it was alleged that a report by an
Australian stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest
in the Lady Bountiful gold mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent.
The settlement cost was split equally between the broker and WMC. WMC's
interim figures carry a ADollars 10m abnormal charge as a result.
Then, just as this series of adverse settlements came to an end, the
Seabright issue resurfaced. WMC's appeal was turned down last month amid
more condemnatory comments, and WMC is still deciding whether to take the
matter to the Canadian Supreme Court.
The price of these mishaps has been large. In legal and settlement costs
alone, the three episodes have produced charges of ADollars 40m. Ernest
Henry has been lost, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on the
now-aborted North American foray.
But, to date, few heads have rolled. In the wake of the Ernest Henry affair,
WMC appointed Mr Ian Burgess, deputy chairman of the Australian Mutual
Provident Society, to the board, who duly carried out an internal inquiry.
As a result, the board decided that WMC's management structure was
'satisfactory'.
It did, however, recommend a further review of internal corporate
procedures, and a reduction in workload for senior executives. Mr Morgan,
notoriously outspoken, was required to 'minimise his involvement in outside
activities'.
Uneasy though the current situation is, the extent to which it bears on the
company's stock market performance is a matter of debate.
Certain institutions are reportedly shy of the shares while the current
regime persists. But at least some analysts think that perspective is being
lost.
'Morgan's not favoured by everyone,' says one Sydney-based pundit, 'and if
he was replaced maybe you'd see 10 or 20 cents on the share price, but it's
not a big issue.'
So, for the time being at least, Mr Morgan is left to spell out a strategy
which sees WMC aiming for size and cost competitiveness. 'The concentration
has to be on becoming a large, low-cost operator . . . we have to get
bigger,' he says.
WMC has already spelt out its thinking in the nickel and copper areas.
Throughout the recent plunge in nickel prices, the company has adhered to a
planned overhaul of production facilities, with a view to substantially
increasing capacity by 1995. The recommissioning of its Kalgoorlie nickel
smelter took place in December, and the division, says Mr Morgan, has been
trading profitably in the current half-year.
On the copper front, the purchase of BP's 49 per cent interest in the
Olympic Dam project, means that this is now wholly-owned and the first
'optimisation project' to increase output is also under way.
The fate of some of the smaller interests is less clear. Mr Morgan admits
that the oil and gas assets are under rolling review, and that some minor
properties might be discarded.
On the gold front, which remains a significant part of the business, he
notes that 'in Australia, there are not many large low-cost operators . . .
which means you might have to go elsewhere'.
In the meantime, WMC has the advantage of a strong balance sheet, with the
debt to equity ratio standing at around 11 per cent at the half-year.
That will increase, perhaps 20 per cent, by end-June, with the annual
ADollars 780m capital expenditure programme weighted to the second half. But
on this score, at least, headaches do not loom.

<TEXT>
Merck, the world's largest drugs group, will today reveal it is developing a
new compound to treat enlarged prostate, a condition that affects 50 per
cent of men over 60 and 70 per cent over 70. More than 10m Americans are
affected by the disease.
Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, and Dr Edward Scolnick,
president of Merck research laboratories, will present analysts with early
clinical data about the new compound showing that it is effective. The new
drug, if successfully developed, will prove an important element in Merck's
growing prostate franchise.
Merck has already developed a compound called Proscar to treat the
condition, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, the drug has
struggled to generate expected sales. Specialists have been concerned about
the drug's effectiveness, although they admit the safety profile is
excellent.
The condition, which involves the enlarged prostate obstructing the flow of
urine from the bladder through the penis, causing the need for frequent and
urgent urination, is normally treated by surgery.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P says Italian bank ratings
under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-term credit ratings of Italian commercial banks are under
considerable downward pressure because of worries about the quality of bank
assets, the US ratings agency Moody's Investor Services said yesterday.
In a strongly pessimistic report on Italy's 280 commercial banks, Moody's
said that they were suffering from poor asset quality, mediocre control of
operating expenses, and pressure on margins between deposit and loan
interest rates.
Moody's said that the median long-term debt rating of banks had already
fallen three notches from the Aa1 level of a year ago. Although the
immediate cause was the lowered ceiling rating for Italy, it might have
happened in any case.
The Moody's report says that difficulties facing Italian banks due to
domestic recession and exposure from rapid loan growth in the past few years
are an extreme case of those experienced in other deregulated banking
markets.
The pessimism of Moody's assessment is likely to reinforce concerns over the
effect on continental European banking systems of the prolonged recession.

Western Mining Corporation, the large minerals and metals group which has
faced a series of adverse legal settlements recently, yesterday announced a
25.1 per cent increase in operating profits after tax, on an
equity-consolidated basis, to ADollars 66.3m (USDollars 47.6m), in the half
year to end-December, writes Nikki Tait.
After abnormal items, the figure for the first six months stood at ADollars
56.3m, up from ADollars 34.6m in the same period of 1992-1993. Total
revenues were 3.3 per cent lower at ADollars 779.8m.
The large part of the improvement was due to a higher contribution to
profits from WMC's 48.25 per cent interest in Alcoa of Australia, which
contributed ADollars 89.6m, compared with ADollars 56.5m last time.
The company acknowledged that Alcoa's contribution was likely to fall
'significantly' - perhaps halve - in 1994, but said any reduction 'should be
offset by increased profitability from nickel and copper' assuming a
'reasonable' recovery in prices of these metals in 1994.
Although commodity prices were weak in the first half, WMC claimed that it
was 'in an excellent position to take advantage of the upturn . . . which
seems to be under way'. Nickel capacity had been 'substantially' increased
and unit costs reduced. Unit costs of gold sales should also fall in the
second half. The interim dividend, it added, was going up by a third, to 4
cents a share.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese developer to reduce
holding of properties overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and developer, is to sell a large
number of its overseas properties and post an extraordinary loss to the
parent group of Y21bn (Dollars 195m) this financial year.
More than Y10bn of the extraordinary loss is accounted for by the sale of
one building, the Thames Exchange in London, which was sold to Scottish
Amicable, the insurance and investment group, last December. Losses will
also arise from its plans to liquidate some overseas units, and write off
some loans to them.
However, Kumagai says the extraordinary loss will not influence profits for
this accounting period because of profits generated elsewhere. The company
hopes to be able partially to offset the loss with an extraordinary gain of
some Y5.8bn, from cost-cutting and the sale of redundant land.
Kumagai is planning to reduce its holdings of unsold overseas properties
from more than Y600bn to about Y540bn by the end of March this year. The
unsold properties are concentrated in the UK, Australia and the US.
The group has been trying to reduce its overseas holdings for some time, but
the sluggish international property market has made this a slow process.
The slightly better state of the UK commercial property market means that
British assets have been easier to sell than those elsewhere.
Last May, the debt-laden company reported a drop of almost 40 per cent in
pre-tax profits for the year to end March 1993.
There was a further 74.5 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits last
November.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Marcelin yesterday resigned as chairman of SCOA, the trading
company controlled by the Paribas banking group, after a disagreement over
strategy.
SCOA, which is in the red with heavy debts, has abandoned a plan devised by
Mr Marcelin to expand its interests in the French supermarket sector in
order to concentrate on reducing its debt and on developing its core trading
activities.
The change in policy was discussed at a board meeting yesterday. Mr Marcelin
objected to the company's new direction and resigned the chairmanship. He
will remain a director of the company and has been replaced on a temporary
basis by Mr Guy de Narbonne, the present chief executive.
SCOA, which is 53 per cent owned by Paribas, has been badly affected by the
French recession and the devaluation of CFA franc, the currency used by
former French colonies in central and western Africa. It made a net interim
loss of FFr598.7m (Dollars 100.2m) in the first half of 1993 and is believed
to have stayed in the red for the full financial year.
Paribas, which is set to raise its stake to 85 per cent after the completion
of a capital increase, said the new strategy would make no difference in the
relationship between the two companies.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pressure on Italian bank ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-term credit ratings of Italian commercial banks are under
considerable downward pressure because of worries about the quality of bank
assets, the US ratings agency Moody's Investor Services said yesterday.
In a strongly pessimistic report on Italy's 280 commercial banks, Moody's
said that they were suffering from poor asset quality, mediocre control of
operating expenses, and pressure on margins between deposit and loan
interest rates.
Moody's said that the median long-term debt rating of banks had already
fallen three notches from the Aa1 level of a year ago. Although the
immediate cause was the lowered ceiling rating for Italy, it might have
happened in any case.
The Moody's report says that difficulties facing Italian banks due to
domestic recession and exposure from rapid loan growth in the past few years
are an extreme case of those experienced in other deregulated banking
markets.
The pessimism of Moody's assessment is likely to reinforce concerns over the
effect on continental European banking systems of the prolonged recession.
UK banks have already started to recover from similar problems.
Moody's said that despite worries over asset quality, competition in the
Italian banking sector was rising and deposit and loan pricing were coming
under pressure.
At the same time, expenses were being poorly-controlled, with the number of
bank branches rising from 15,600 in 1989 to 20,800 in 1992 and reductions in
staff numbers being largely offset by wages increases for the remaining
staff.
Moody's expressed concern about the consistently rapid increase in banks'
assets, with an average rise of 15 per cent per year between 1988 and 1992.
This asset growth was the main reason that banks managed to increase
operating profits.

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australia-based soft drinks company which is
controlled by Coca-Cola of the US but is also listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange, yesterday reported a 45 per cent rise in profits after tax but
before abnormals, to ADollars 95.4m (USDollars 68.5m), writes Nikki Tait. In
the previous year, it made ADollars 65.9m.
Revenues were slightly lower, due to disposals, at ADollars 1.99bn against
ADollars 2.17bn and operating profits virtually flat, at ADollars 198.4m.
However, the after-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges, and the
company also benefited from a ADollars 234.5m extraordinary surplus
following the sale of its snack food operations to United Biscuits.
Bottom-line profits, therefore, stood at ADollars 329.9m compared with
ADollars 65.9m a year ago.

<TEXT>
Noranda, the Canadian resources group, eked out a small profit last year,
and has forecast a 'modest' improvement in 1994.
But the 1993 profit of CDollars 3m (USDollars 2m) excluded various one-off
charges stemming from the sale of MacMillan Bloedel, the west-coast forestry
group, and the closure of a pulp mill. There was also an unusual gain of
CDollars 46m from the sale of Noranda Forest shares.
Including these extraordinary items, Noranda suffered a CDollars 37m loss,
equal to 41 cents a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 79m, or 10
cents, in 1992. The 1992 figures are partially consolidated to show
MacMillan Bloedel's earnings on an equity-accounted basis. Revenues dropped
to CDollars 5.27bn from CDollars 5.55bn.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 1m, down from CDollars 4m, equal to
losses per common share of one cent and six cents respectively.
Earnings from mining and metals fell to CDollars 21m from CDollars 153m. Oil
and gas earnings dropped to CDollars 47m from CDollars 59m.

R. H. Macy, the bankrupt US department store group operating under Chapter

months' extension of its exclusive right to come up with a reorganisation
plan.
Macy faces a takeover threat from the Federated Department Stores group,
owner of Bloomingdale's, which last month procured part of Macy's secured
debt and won the right to come up with its own reorganisation plan. But it
has indicated that it will wait for Macy to file a plan before it comes up

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T plans 15,000 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecoms group, is to cut
14,000-15,000 jobs, signalling the growing competitive pressures in the
market for long-distance telephone services in the US.
The job cuts, out of a total of 96,500, are intended to save the company
Dollars 900m a year, shoring up the profitability of its long-distance
services.
Although AT&amp;T's call volumes rose by 5 per cent last year, its telephone
services revenue grew by less than 1 per cent, to Dollars 39.9bn. This was
due to the increased use of discounts and special promotions to attract
business, the company said. US long-distance rivals MCI and Sprint recorded
revenue increases of 13 per cent and 7 per cent respectively last year.
Some 8,000 managers will lose their jobs in the cuts, which will take place
over the next two years. Most individuals to go will be notified by the end
of March.
AT&amp;T said the costs of the job cuts were covered by a Dollars 1.3bn charge
included in its results for the last quarter of 1993.
In addition to the job cuts announced yesterday, around 3,500 telephone
operators are to lose their jobs by the end of this year under plans
announced previously.
Despite the low revenue growth, AT&amp;T improved its profit margin from
telephone services last year by two percentage points, to 38 per cent, as it
cut costs by Dollars 550m.

   NEW YORK, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MG Corp, the US arm of Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and
manufacturing group, has suspended debt payments to its banks and raised
Dollars 300m in additional credit lines.
The news suggests that MG Corp has come under growing financial pressure in
recent weeks, even though Metallgesellschaft reached an agreement with its
bankers at the group level last month which saved it from bankruptcy.
MG Corp said it had been granted a 90-day moratorium on debt payments,
intended to give it time to restructure its debts.
In a brief statement, Mr Karl von der Heyden, chief executive, said: 'With
this new facility, we are confident that we will have adequate liquidity and
that we will reach agreement with the banks during the 90-day period on a
long-term debt restructuring.'
Some Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m, or two-thirds of MG Corp's total bank debt,
is subject to the restructuring talks. The other third, which was owed to
the group's bankers rather than those of the US subsidiary directly, will be
converted to equity under the terms of last month's agreement, MG Corp said.
MG Corp said the new facility provided by its bankers was not needed to
finance additional losses in its oil trading business, but would support its
normal business while talks were under way with banks.
Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft,
has called off its hostile takeover bid for International Musto
Explorations, the Vancouver-based company which controls a prized copper and
gold deposit in Argentina, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Metall said that it is withdrawing its proposed CDollars 232m (USDollars
172m) offer in view of an joint-venture agreement which Musto signed last
week with MIM Holdings of Australia to develop the Bajo de la Alumbrera
deposit.

Strong lumber prices and an improved market for building materials helped
MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian west-coast forest products group, return to
profitability last year. Net earnings were CDollars 53.2m (USDollars 39.7m),
or 42 cents a share, compared with the 1992 loss of CDollars 48.8m, or 52
cents. Revenues rose 24 per cent to CDollars 3.76bn.
The sale of a stake in a UK corrugated paper business contributed CDollars
39m to last year's earnings.
Fourth-quarter income was CDollars 5.1m, or 3 cents a share, against a
CDollars 16.5m loss, or 17 cents, a year earlier.
Macblo said yesterday it would invest CDollars 200m in the first lightweight
coated-paper machine in western North America. The machine, at Port Alberni
on Vancouver Island, will produce 160,000 tonnes of paper a year for
magazines and other publications requiring high-quality colour.
Earnings were also boosted by the lower Canadian dollar but the improvement
was contained by lower pulp and containerboard prices.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spectrum files against Sculley -
The computer company's counter action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Sculley conspired to drive down the share price of Spectrum
Information Technologies in order to mask the impact of his resignation as
the company's chairman and chief executive, the company has alleged in a
Dollars 300m law suit.
Spectrum charges Mr Sculley with breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, mismanagement and theft of trade secrets. The suit was filed late on
Wednesday, two days after Mr Sculley abruptly resigned.
Mr Sculley, former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, surprised
the industry last October by joining Spectrum, a little-known, loss-making
company.
On Monday, Mr Sculley resigned and filed suit against Mr Peter Caserta,
Spectrum president, charging that he had been duped into joining the company
by 'fraudulent misrepresentations'. Mr Sculley says that Mr Caserta
concealed the fact that Spectrum was under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and that the company had used 'questionable'
accounting practices.
Spectrum's counter action refutes these charges. Mr Sculley was informed
about the SEC investigation during a dinner with Mr Caserta and others at a
New York restaurant three days before he joined the company, it claims.
Mr Sculley must also have known about the company's accounting methods, the
suit asserts. A press clipping concerning the company's accounting was
'uncovered in the due diligence file that Sculley left at Spectrum when he
resigned,' the company says.
Mr Sculley has also expressed outrage at the profits achieved recently by Mr
Caserta and two other Spectrum officers when they sold substantial portions
of their stock, taking advantage of a rise in the share price when Mr
Sculley joined Spectrum. Spectrum, however, says that Mr Sculley signed an
agreement acquiescing to the stock sales.
Through a spokesman, Mr Sculley called Spectrum's allegations 'a work of
fiction'.
Both sides in this dispute appear to be keenly aware of the potential for
damaging shareholder suits. Spectrum's share price has fallen by more than
50 per cent this week. While Spectrum has accused Mr Sculley of ignoring
shareholders' interests, Mr Sculley has accused Mr Caserta and others of
insider trading.
Although Spectrum's legal action is directed only at Mr Sculley, it
identifies KMPG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm and a member of a venture
capital company, as alleged co-conspirators with Mr Sculley in hatching a
'secret exit strategy' that would enable him to minimise embarrassment and
potential shareholder claims upon his resignation.
'The references to Peat Marwick are totally outrageous,' said the accounting
firm, which this week severed its relations with Spectrum. 'Peat Marwick
acted independently and was in no way involved in Mr Sculley's resignation.
These appear to be desperate claims.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: CBS completes record year with
profits of Dollars 326m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS yesterday announced a 39 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to
Dollars 46.4m as the top-rated US broadcast network completed a
record-breaking financial year on a strong note.
Full-year profits ended at Dollars 326.2m, up from Dollars 81m in 1992 and
the best result in the company's history. While the latest three-month
earnings failed to match CBS's accomplishments in the third quarter, when
the company earned Dollars 118.3m, profits in that period were boosted by
several one-off factors.
Once again the best performance within the group came from the CBS
Television Network, which has consistently led the other three networks  -
ABC, NBC and Fox - in recent viewing figures. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman,
said CBS was now close to being the most watched network in prime-time,
daytime and late night television, a feat achieved only once before by a US
network. Higher ratings usually lead to bigger profits because they allow
networks to charge higher rates for television advertisements.
CBS has been particularly successful in late night programming since
September's debut on the network of an 11.30pm weekly talk show.

Broderbund earned Dollars 13.6m on sales of Dollars 96m.
Electronic Arts does not expect job losses as the result of a merger. 'There

about 1,100 and Broderbund 400.

Hasbro to 12% rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Good sales in the run up to Christmas helped Hasbro, the biggest US toy
maker, report a 12 per cent increase in fourth-quarter turnover to Dollars
932.2m. But a charge to cover the cost of closing its factory in the
Netherlands, announced last month, limited profits growth to 8 per cent.
Net income was Dollars 70.7m compared with Dollars 65.6m last time, while
earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead at 78 cents. Hasbro said if it had
not been for the Dollars 15m charge it took against pre-tax profits for the
plant closure, net income would have risen by 22 per cent.
Hasbro said some of its biggest domestic successes came from its Kenner
division, which handles its Littlest Pet Shop and Jurassic Park lines.
Hasbro Toy, after difficulties earlier in the year, saw good sales of
Tonka's Talk 'n Play Fire Truck and The Real Power Tool Shop.
The Playskool operation was buoyed by successes with Talking Barney and
traditional products like Play-Doh and Tinkertoy. The games division saw
good sales of new products like Don't Wake Daddy, Ask Zandar and Jenga, and
traditional games like Monopoly, Scrabble and The Game of Life.
Internationally, the company saw strong performances from its operations in
Canada, Mexico, Britain and Germany, but suffered the currency translation
effects of the rising US dollar.
For the full year, revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn, net income
rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 200m, and earnings per share rose by 10 per
cent to Dollars 2.22.
Hasbro will join other US toy manufacturers in unveiling its new products

Kraft Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss-based foods group which is part of Philip
Morris of the US, has purchased 82 per cent of Poiana-Produse Zaharoase,
Romania's biggest chocolate producer, for Dollars 4.4m, the company
announced in Bucharest yesterday.
Under the deal, Suchard will invest Dollars 17m on top of the purchase price
in Poiana over the next five years and maintain the present workforce level
at 1,220 for two years.
The remaining 18 per cent of shares will be offered to employees.
Poiana, which operates two factories in the Transylvanian town of Brasov, is
Suchard's eighth acquisition in central and eastern Europe and lifts its
capital committed to the region to Dollars 200m, Mr Bernhard Huber,
vice-president, said.
Suchard plans to develop some of Poiana's existing 80 brands and initially
concentrate on expanding sales in the large domestic market rather than on
exports, Mr Huber said. With a population of 23m, Romania is the region's
second-largest market after Poland.
The deal is only the second sale to a foreign company by the State Ownership
Fund, the main engine of Romania's privatisation drive, since it was set up
15 months ago.

Gaz de France, the state-owned utility, announced net profits of FFr1.1bn
(Dollars 184m) last year, a fall of about 30 per cent compared with the
FFr1.59bn reported in 1992.
The results, achieved after a dividend payment of FFr575m to the state, were
based on stable sales of FFr49.1bn. Investments increased from FFr4.9bn to
FFr6bn, while debt was reduced from FFr16.4bn to FFr13.2bn.
Gaz de France said the results reflected its strategy of increasing
productivity and expanding its presence in international markets.
Last year, for example, Gaz de France took a stake in Noverco, the principal
shareholder of Gaz Metropolitan, which has a substantial presence in Quebec.
The French gas company also developed in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, opening representative offices in Kiev and Budapest.

Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, has recorded its first profit since
its formation in 1990 from the merger of Den norske Creditbank and Bergen
Bank. In a sharp reversal of fortunes, DnB posted a 1993 pre-tax profit of
NKr982m (Dollars 129.7m) against a loss of NKr3.06bn the previous year.
The result was helped by a reduction in credit losses, a rise in net
interest income, and gains in the securities and bond portfolios. In spite
of the marked improvement, DnB A shares closed NKr0.50 lower at NKr21 on the
Oslo bourse.
'The results for the year form a sound basis for the share capital increase
which is under preparation,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing
director.
DnB said earlier it was planning for a capital increase of NKr1bn through
the issue of new shares. The state also has plans to dispose of some of its
shares in the bank to raise another NKr1bn. Norway became DnB's biggest
shareholder through cash injections made to prop it up during Norway's
biggest banking crisis since the second world war. The bank had suffered
successive years of high losses.
Group net interest income shot up by NKr697m to NKr5.37bn as other operating
income advanced NKr797m to NKr3.5bn. 'Along with a significant reduction in
loan losses and a downward trend in the volume of non-performing loans, it
is gratifying that the figures for net interest income and other operating
income are strong,' Mr Hvistendahl said.
However, losses on net loans and guarantees remained substantially high,
though an improvement in the domestic economy helped cut them by NKr1.73bn
to NKr3.11bn, helped by
The bank said losses on loans to small- and medium-sized companies were more
than halved last year. In the private customer market, they were cut by
one-third.
However, DnB said losses in 1993 in the corporate division were higher than
in the previous year. This was blamed on increased loan-loss provisions in
the first half of 1993 on specific commitments.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cinderella of steel causes a
scene - Klockner's return to form could be embarrassing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Klockner Stahl, the Cinderella of the German steel industry, is back in the
black as a viable, profitable integrated steel plant, thanks to a drastic
reduction in its debt burden, and harsh job cuts.
That was the potentially embarrassing message yesterday from Mr Hans
Christoph von Rohr, chief executive of Klockner-Werke, the parent company,
on the eve of tough negotiations between the European steel industry and the
European commission in Brussels.
It is embarrassing to both sides, because they urgently need to agree on
further sharp capacity cuts in European steel production. Closing the
Klockner plant in Bremen appears to many of the rival producers as the ideal
solution.
Mr von Rohr, the elegant but ruthless architect of the plant's survival
plan, disagrees. 'Klockner Stahl in Bremen is making profits right now,' he
said.
'If we have overcapacity in Europe, by closing one plant we must improve the
average cost situation in the European steel industry. By closing one of the
best-performing plants, we won't improve the average at all. We will make it
worse.
'Bremen is in the top group of European plants, especially of the German
steel plants.'
This is the argument that Mr von Rohr will put, against strong objections by
fellow steel producers such as Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive
of British Steel, at next week's negotiations in Brussels.
The secret of his success, he says, lies in the composition proceedings  -
the last step before bankruptcy in the German financial process - declared
by Klockner-Werke for its steel operations last year. These not only halved
the debt burden carried by the steel plants, but quickly rationalised the
operations.
'Under the whip of the composition proceedings, we were able to re-engineer
that company more profoundly and much more quickly than our competitors,' Mr
von Rohr said.
In the first place, the workforce will have been reduced by one third - from
6,000 to 4,000 - by the end of June. Capacity at the plant will be cut by
500,000 tonnes, to 2.7m tonnes, with the closure of one blast furnace. The
estimated annual saving on the wage bill is more than DM40m (Dollars 22.7m).
Secondly, the company forced Ruhrkohle, Germany's dominant coal and coke
producer, to sell 30 per cent of its coke requirements - 300,000 tonnes a
year - on the much cheaper international market, saving roughly the same
amount as the job cuts.
And the creditors' agreement to write off half the company's debt, which
once stood at DM2.7bn for all its steel operations, will save more than
DM70m in a full year.
Additional savings have come from the opening of direct deliveries of iron
ore and coke to the Bremen plant, and from the full operation of its modern
Bregal zinc galvanising plant.
'Instead of having a loss of more than DM160m, which was the rate it was
running at in the last quarter of our last financial year, we will have a
profit of around DM70m,' said Mr von Rohr.
'Nobody has realised how quickly things have changed at Klockner, or else
they have simply tried to suppress the thought. Klockner Stahl was the
Cinderella of the German steel industry. In the meantime, it has become
quite an attractive and self-confident dancing partner.'
Earlier this month, Klockner signed the contracts for its rescue plan, as
negotiated with the Bremen city state. It leaves Klockner-Werke with an
interest of just 33 per cent, while Hibeg, the Bremen government's
industrial holding company, has 32 per cent. Stadt werke Bremen, the city
power utility, has 13 per cent, the Bremer Vulkan shipyard 13 per cent, and
the Hegemann shipyard group 8 per cent.
Negotiations are continuing with Sidmar, the Belgian subsidiary of the Arbed
steel group, to take a 25 per cent stake, and so reduce Klockner's own
exposure to 25 per cent.
'We are in very detailed talks,' Mr von Rohr said. 'There is a very positive
drive in the negotiations. We are not at the point yet of being able to say
if they will join.'
The new partners have injected capital of DM250m, and the question, being
investigated by the European Commission, is whether that cash involves a
subsidy by the Bremen state. Mr von Rohr insists it amounts to a purely
commercial decision to invest in a viable operation.
'We feel perfectly relaxed,' he said. 'The question can be answered with the
figures. Bremen is simply doing what a reasonable private investor would do.
'It should be obvious to anybody that a company able to make a profit even
in the present disastrous conditions of the steel market is a good
investment.'

Ericsson profit rise

<TEXT>
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, more than doubled profits in
1993 on the back of booming sales of mobile telephone equipment.
The company's pre-tax result climbed to SKr3.1bn (Dollars 388m) from
SKr1.3bn, as sales soared 34 per cent to SKr62.9bn. The dividend was raised
by SKr1 to SKr4.50 per share as income per share rose to SKr10.30 from
SKr3.20.
In an upbeat statement about prospects, the group promised a further rise in
earnings in 1994. 'Despite uncertainty in the international marketplace and
intensified competition, I feel optimistic about our development,' said Mr
Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson president.
The pre-tax result was struck after a SKr305m extraordinary goodwill
write-off. This held back profits in the fourth quarter, when they only rose
5 per cent to SKr1.24bn from SKr1.18bn.
Excluding currency movements, full-year sales were up 20 per cent on 1992.
Orders also benefited from the weaker krona, rising 27 per cent to
SKr67.6bn. The order intake has risen for nine consecutive quarters.
Radio communications, which includes cellular operations, has overtaken
public communications as Ericsson's largest business area. Sales there rose
more than 70 per cent last year. Ericsson is the world leader in sales of
mobile telephone systems, with a market share of more than 40 per cent for
analog systems, and 50 per cent for GSM digital systems.
Mobile phones will again be a key component to profits growth this year,
with the public telecommunications side proving more sluggish. The group
warned: 'There is substantial uncertainty in the international market for
public telecommunications, which is characterised by lower investments and
intensifying price competition particularly in the major industrialised
countries.' It hopes to compensate for this by picking up orders in other
markets, particularly Asia.
Ms Angela Dean, telecoms analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said:
'Ericsson's growth has to come on the mobile side and improved margins. In
public telecommunications, the group will have to do the best to keep sales
stable while controlling costs.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paper technology deal agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sulzer, the Swiss engineering group, and J. M. Voith of Germany are to merge
their worldwide paper technology operations. The new company will have sales
of DM2bn (Dollars 1.18bn) and employ 9,000.
Voith, a family-owned company based in Heidenheim in Baden-Wurttemberg, said
yesterday the move was a response to a drastic deterioration in the paper
technology industry over recent years.
The two companies came close to reaching a similar agreement in 1991, but
the deal was abandoned after disagreements within the Voith family over the
nature of the co-operation. The present deal will leave Voith as a majority
shareholder with a 60 per cent holding.
Voith said conditions in the paper technology industry had worsened since
the merger was first mooted. This reflected the problems of paper
manufacturers as well as increased competition within the sec-tor.
The fusion would create economies of scale in production, distribution and
marketing, Voith said, leading to a 'substantial strengthening' of their
combined activities and a return to profitability.
The companies are making a profit overall, but are losing money in the paper
technology area. In the year to September 30 1992, paper technology
accounted for around half of Voith's DM2.55bn turnover.
Both sides stressed the agreement affected only the paper technology area -
for example, machines for making and finishing paper - and not the groups'
other activities, such as equipment for hydro-electric power stations.
The merger is in line with steps taken by other machinery manufacturing
companies in Germany. The sector is dominated by family-owned companies,
classic 'mittelstand' enterprises which have for decades resisted the
pressure to consolidate to form bigger groups.

Buderus, the German building material and heating technology company 80 per

near-collapse of the parent company had not affected its own activities.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Plaul, chief executive, said yesterday the parent's crisis

Buderus had no 'contractual ties' with the parent company, Mr Plaul said,
reiterating comments made a month ago as Metallgesellschaft's problems came
to a head.
Buderus, acquired by Metallgesellschaft as part of its purchase of the
non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel in 1991, is commonly regarded as a
jewel in Metallgesellschaft's crown.
It announced yesterday profits for the three months to December of DM41m
(Dollars 24.1m), up from DM30m in the comparable period.

FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volvo starts shedding non-core
activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo yesterday underlined its new commitment to core vehicle activities
when it announced the sale of its entire stake in Custos, an investment
group, for SKr1.74bn (Dollars 218m).
It is the first big disposal since the group's plans to merge with French
carmaker Renault collapsed in December. It will produce a capital gain of
SKr916m.
The sale to Swedish and foreign institutions comprises 10.5m A shares and
1.5m B shares, equal to 25.4 per cent of Custos's capital and 29.1 per cent
of its votes.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said: 'The transaction is part of
Volvo's concentration on its core operations and a way of reducing our debt.
We believe that broader distribution of Custos's shares will benefit
Custos.' Volvo's net debt stood at SKr14.3bn at the end of the first nine
months of 1993.
Volvo bought its Custos shares between 1985 and 1990 as part of an elaborate
cross-ownership structure to thwart a hostile takeover, particularly from
arch-rivals in the Wallenberg sphere. Its allies in the network were
Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest construction group, and two other investment
companies, Cardo and Protorp.
The alliance started to dissolve after Custos sold its 9 per cent holding in
Volvo last year, and it is likely it will disintegrate further. Analysts
expect Volvo to sell its 47 per cent holding in Cardo and 43 per cent stake
in Protorp in due course.
Volvo, which is also steadily dismantling many of its links with Renault,
sold its Custos stake for SKr145 per share, against a bourse price of
SKr149. Skanska remains Custos's biggest shareholder.
Custos has significant stakes in a clutch of leading Swedish blue chips,
including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank, SCA,
the forestry company, and Skanska.

black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Ireland has finally staunched the financial haemorrhage at its US
subsidiary.
New Hampshire-based Bank of Ireland First Holdings has cost the group over
Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) since 1988 when the clearing bank first ventured
into the US market.
BOIFH yesterday reported its first-ever pre-tax profit of Dollars 8m for the
1993 year, achieved on income of Dollars 200m.
In 1992 a loss of Dollars 77m on income of Dollars 228m was reported, while
losses in 1991 amounted to Dollars 123m.
Loan loss provisions were reduced from Dollars 64.6m to Dollars 23.7m, while
non-performing assets have been cut from Dollars 136m to Dollars 31m.
Mr Pat Molloy, chief executive, said that the US subsidiary was now
'well-positioned' to take advantage of a gradual economic recovery in the
New Hampshire region, and is expected to make 'a significant contribution to
group profitability in 1994-95'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Uncertainty reigns in absence of a
transaction - The greatest concern over Lloyds Bank: what it will do with
its money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No bank which made a Pounds 1bn profit last year, as Lloyds Bank is expected
to announce this morning, can exactly be said to be in trouble. Yet Lloyds'
mantle as the most successful and profitable of Britain's banks shows signs
of slipping.
The clearest evidence of this is in its share price, which although it
outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index last year, rising 23.6 per cent,
lagged behind the rises of other banks. As investors bought the shares of
banks with the most obvious recovery potential, Lloyds was gradually
de-rated.
It is appropriate that Lloyds should lead the results season for the big UK
clearers, for it is already demonstrating the challenges that others could
face in the next two years as they recover. Investors question whether it
will hand back its strong capital in dividends, or expand by acquisition.
'People wonder about what Lloyds will do next, and some of that uncertainty
is reflected in the share price,' says Mr Rod Barrett, bank analyst at
Goldman Sachs. But he argues that the underperformance is due mainly to
growing confidence that other banks can replicate Lloyds' past successes.
Lloyds' manoeuvres under Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive, have been both
negative and positive. Negative ones were to exit from poorly-performing
businesses such as international banking and merchant banking in the 1980s,
and to refrain from selling its portfolio of problem country debt.
Mr Pitman's achievement was to focus earlier than others on domestic retail
banking, and its spread into the French model of 'bancassurance.' He did so
by acquiring a 60 per cent stake in Lloyds Abbey Life, and rooting a life
insurance business within it.
These moves helped raise return on equity to 21.3 per cent in the first half
of last year. The release of problem country debt provisions smoothed the
effect of the UK recession. Some Pounds 122m was released in the first half,
and Pounds 80m of interest arrears is expected to be written back in the
second half.
Yet analysts point to the underlying sluggishness of the core retail banking
business. Lloyds is expected to report virtually flat operating profits
before bad debt provisions because its margins are under pressure, and it
will not have the gains enjoyed by other banks from buoyant securities
trading.
The results are expected to show a continuing slackness of UK loan demand,
which is holding back the revenue growth of all banks. Lloyds Abbey Life
also faces difficulties selling products to Lloyds customers because of
controversy over the selling of life insurance products and pensions.
Mr Barrett argues that Lloyds is unlikely to repeat its early growth.
'The idea of bancassurance will be questioned. Banks thought that it was an
easy way of making money through branches, but it gets harder as they sell
more complicated products to sophisticated customers,' he says.
For all that, Mr John Leonard, a banks analyst at Salomon Brothers in
London, says that Lloyds still has 'further to go' in cutting costs and
raising revenues in its core business. He believes it is also likely to gain
more than other banks from recovery in the south-east of England.
The problem with simply continuing to squeeze profits from Lloyds' existing
network and products is that analysts expect a further fall in margins as
other banks rebuild their capital and are able to compete aggressively. This
could mean pressure on Lloyds' historically high equity returns.
This problem bears on what remains the greatest uncertainty over Lloyds:
what the bank will do with its money. Since its failed attempt to acquire
Midland Bank in 1992, there has been speculation over which financial
services operation it might buy to expand its customer base and squeeze unit
costs.
There are two difficulties in doing so. One is that it has set a high return
on equity hurdle for an acquisition in order to prevent a dilution of its
own shareholder returns. A second is that other banks have become much more
expensive in the past two years, and would now test Lloyds' purse.
The first difficulty may have been eased by the fact that its target return
on equity for an acquisition may have to fall because of reductions in
interest rates.
The second difficulty means that Lloyds may be more likely to take on a
building society, despite the regulatory barriers.
Mr Leonard believes that Lloyds feels under no immediate pressure to do
anything. 'I have not got the sense that they feel themselves to be in a
strategic box.'
Yet Mr Pitman has said that Lloyds would become over-capitalised if its
ratio of equity to assets rose above 6 per cent.
Other things being equal, this could happen by 1995, which is also the year
in which Mr Pitman is due to retire. This is itself becoming a pressing
issue, because he has no obvious successor. Unless a clear signal emerges
today, questions over the future are only likely to increase.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Machine Tool interested in buying part of
FMT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Machine Tool Services (GB), a small Lewes-based company which supplies spare
parts for machine tools, has expressed interest in buying parts of FMT, the
machine tool maker which called in the receivers last week.
MTS would not say which parts it was interested in but it is believed it is
most likely to want the spares operation.
News of the approach comes less than a week after Mr Alan Bloom and Ms
Maggie Mills of Ernst &amp; Young were appointed joint administrative receivers
at Brighton-based FMT, whose annual sales have fallen from nearly Pounds 20m
in 1990 to Pounds 10m.
The receivership has shocked the UK machine tool industry and customers of
FMT, although Mr Bloom said: 'We are putting plans together with a view to
continuing the business as a going concern.'
The number of employees at FMT had fallen from more than 400 to about 150
before the receivership, and more than 40 jobs have been cut by the
receivers - 30 at the main Brighton plant and the rest at FMT's other
operations in Manchester and Newcastle.
MTS' potential involvement is somewhat ironic. It comes a few weeks after
the Office of Fair Trading dismissed a case against FMT filed by the Lewes
company, which had alleged that FMT had restricted its access to spare parts
for its range of machining centres.
Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday that the receivership was the result of four
years of recession, and there was no single 'flashpoint'. Gearing was also
heavy, and included borrowings against property.
Meanwhile, the Machine Tool Technologies Association confirmed yesterday
that it had been helping Mr Bright set up meetings with the Department of
Trade and Industry to recover Pounds 1m lost on a contract with Iraq.
According to The Engineer magazine, Mr Bright has blamed the government for
not revalidating export licences originally issued by the Department before
the Gulf war.

Shares in Alpha Airports Group, which provides flight catering to airlines
and retail services at airports, rose sharply on their first day of trading
yesterday.
They closed at 172p, against the flotation price of 140p.
Alpha was formerly the airports division of Forte, which has retained a 25
per cent stake in the company. A total of 113.09m shares were offered, of
which half were firmly placed with institutions. The remainder were subject
to clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The public offer
was subscribed 6.1 times.
For the year to January 31 1994, Alpha is forecasting a 19 per cent rise in
operating profits to Pounds 20.6m on turnover of Pounds 423.1m.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Jessups warns of loss and replaces director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, said yesterday that it expected to
report a loss for the 16 months to December 31 and also announced a board
restructuring under which the managing director has been replaced.
The shares fell 20p to 96p.
The results, expected to be released on March 9, will show that trading in
the motor dealerships in the last four months of 1993 was significantly
below target and although vehicle leasing operations performed well, an
overall loss resulted.
The disappointing showing has led to a board restructuring under which Mr
Ron Joseph has been replaced as managing director by Mr Stan Thompson,
managing director of the vehicle leasing operations. In addition Mr Ian
Harris, who joined the group recently from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been
appointed finance director.
Mr John Ganney will remain on the board and will continue as company
secretary.
In the 12 months to August 31 Jessups increased pre-tax profits to Pounds
707,000 (Pounds 506,000).
The company said yesterday that trading so far in the current year had been
promising.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging placing and offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Templeton Emerging Markets, the largest UK investment trust in the emerging
markets sector, hopes to raise new capital through a placing and offer for
subscription of conversion shares.
The public offer is likely to be in March. On conversion, one warrant will
be attached to every five new ordinary shares.
The trust subsequently plans a scrip issue in October, giving shareholders
two new shares for every one they hold already. This should improve the
liquidity of the shares, which are currently priced at about 450p.
A savings scheme attached to the fund allows investments of as little as
Pounds 30 a month, so a lower share price would make it easier for those
savers to invest.
Existing warrants for the trust expire in September. After the scrip issue,
the trust plans to issue new warrants, with a 10-year life, on a 1-for-5
basis for all ordinary shares except those resulting from the conversion
share issue, which will already have warrants attached. The terms of those
warrants will be adjusted to put them on an equal footing with the new
warrants.
Shares in the trust, which has assets of about Pounds 420m, have been
trading at a premium to net asset value of as much as 17 per cent in recent
months, but this has now fallen to about 7 per cent. Templeton raised Pounds
85m of new capital, through a placing and open offer, less than a year ago.
The trust has a wide geographical distribution between 21 countries.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Canning's Pounds 1.4m Italian costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
W Canning is to make a special provision in its 1993 accounts of up to
Pounds 1.4m for bad debts, in respect of certain substantial customers of
its Italian electronic components business.
The Birmingham-based company, which also has speciality chemicals interests,
said the provision would be out of a total exposure of Pounds 1.93m. After
tax and minorities, it will reduce attributable earnings by about Pounds
500,000.
Canning said that overall sales and orders in its electronics components
business continued to be very good and it did not, therefore, anticipate
that sales or operating profits would be materially affected in 1994 by the
Italian problems.
The shares, however, fell 8p to 185p yesterday.
A maintained final dividend of 4.35p is forecast, making an unchanged total
of 7.29p.
Interim pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 3.02m) after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 942,000 relating to the sale of an offshoot.
Final results are due to be announced on March 23.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad declines to Pounds 1.75m - Sugar
warns of possible deficit for full-year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, warned shareholders yesterday that the
consumer electronics group might report a full-year loss and said the level
of final dividend would be 'considered in the light of the second-half
trading results.'
The profits warning - the second in three months - came as the group
reported an unexpected first-half operating loss and sharply lower pre-tax
profits, reflecting fierce pressure on margins and a 31 per cent decline in
turnover.
'Margins in the consumer electronics industry continue to be under pressure,
due to an oversupply of product, price cutting and depressed demand,' said
the chairman. 'Retailers are striving for higher margins on lower retail
prices to compensate for excessive competitiveness in the market.'
Pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 fell from Pounds 5.61m to
Pounds 1.75m. Despite this the interim dividend is maintained at 0.2p.
The shares closed 4 1/4 p lower at 40 3/4 p.
Turnover, including Pounds 7.03m from its Dancall mobile telephone
acquisition, fell to Pounds 139.9m (Pounds 202.2m). Mr Sugar said the fall
was due partly to the decision 'to reduce activity in product categories
with little or no margin.' These included low margin personal computers
which accounted for Pounds 23m of the sales decline, and video-recorders.
Nevertheless, even after a Pounds 455,000 three-month contribution from
Dancall, the group incurred a Pounds 1.89m operating loss, compared with a
Pounds 9.1m profit.
Although Mr Sugar said the UK market, traditionally Amstrad's largest, had
suffered the most, the group has also wound down its Spanish subsidiary and
rationalised Australian operations.
The group was also forced to make Pounds 2.5m provisions to cover losses and
bad debts reflecting difficult market conditions in Italy.
Despite the operating loss, Amstrad was able to report the modest pre-tax
profit because of Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 3.75m) of net interest earned on its
substantial cash balances.
By the end of the period cash balances had grown from Pounds 112m to Pounds
143m. However, although Amstrad is continuing to look at possible
acquisitions, particularly in the telecommunications area, Mr Sugar said the
group 'would not be rushed or intimidated into making any bad choices to try
to bolster the results of the company.'
The group's 'best expectations' for the full year would be to try and
maintain a break-even position. However, he cautioned: 'As the second half
is traditionally lower in sales volume, the target we have set will be
difficult to achieve, particularly if the much heralded upturn in the UK
economy does not translate into consumer confidence.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Spending on Tower Wharf hits Seacon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution group, reported a
25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 1.72m for
the year to September 30, on turnover ahead 3 per cent at Pounds 19.3m.
Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said the figures partly reflected heavy capital
spending on the modernisation and development of Tower Wharf, in Kent, prior
to it commencing trading.
In addition, profits from fleet and cargo handling operations were lower,
caused by tighter margins reflecting depressed levels of inter-European
trade.
However, Mr Roth said that there had recently been some evidence of
improving margins in the short-sea trade.
He pointed out that an exceptional charge of Pounds 972,898 had been made to
cover potential losses on arrangements for the sale of the Golden Lion
Hotel, where it appeared that the purchasers would be unable to fulfil their
obligations.
On prospects, the chairman said that with the coming on stream of Tower
Wharf, he hoped for a marked improvement, though trade in general was only
slightly livelier than a year ago. Export shipments were generally higher,
but competition for freight contracts was fierce.
The recommended final dividend is increased to 3.4p making a total of 5.7p
(5.1p). Fully diluted earnings per share dropped from 14.9p to 11.46p.
To improve marketability, the 25p ordinary shares are to be split into 10p
shares.
The shares fell 6p to 235p.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Starmin agrees to acquire private
construction group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
cabinet minister, announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire a 'large
privately-owned construction group.'
Starmin's share price climbed 1 3/4 p to 5p on the news.
The acquisition was described as 'significant in relation to the size of
Starmin.' It will be funded through a combination of new shares and cash,
through a placement or rights issue.
If the deal goes ahead, the Abdullah family, the main shareholders, face
greater dilution of control, as the owners of the construction company would
take new Starmin shares and seats on its board.
It is understood that the family speaks for more than 25 per cent of
Starmin's shares, but it has not indicated whether it will support the
transaction.
The deal follows a period of great uncertainty for Starmin.
The Abdullah brothers resigned last July, when it was announced that the
1992 results would be re-examined due to accounting irregularities.
Subsequently, the figures were restated, and the final dividend rescinded.
Mr Raschid Abdullah has since been re-elected to the board. But his brother,
Osman, the former chief executive, is seeking Pounds 500,000 in compensation
for loss of office.
The Abdullah family built up Evered, the aggregates company. But the
brothers resigned in 1989. Taking control of SI Group in the same year they
renamed it Starmin and launched numerous acquisitions.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Harry Ramsden's advances 34% to
Pounds 815,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip restaurant operator, increased pre-tax
profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 815,295 in the year to October 3, on sales
ahead 15 per cent to Pounds 3.29m.
The Yorkshire-based group now has eight restaurants in the UK, following
successful openings last summer in Edinburgh and Birmingham. It plans to
open another five this year - in Bristol, Liverpool, Nottingham, Cardiff and
Dublin.
Site searches continue with existing joint venture partners in Belfast and
Aberdeen and the group has made new commitments to joint venture franchises
with partners in Southampton and Chester.
It said: 'Our experience in Hong Kong has enabled us to secure a franchisee
in Singapore and we anticipate concluding a franchise agreement shortly with
an operator in Melbourne. Our franchise partner in Jeddah has now acquired a
site for development.'
Net debt increased from Pounds 237,379 to Pounds 1.65m, giving gearing of 35
per cent, as the group invested in new joint venture franchises and
purchased for Pounds 600,000 an amusement arcade and fairground beside its
original Guisely Restaurant on the outskirts of Leeds.
The group invested in Welbourne Ramsden's, a new fish and chip take-away
chain of 11 small outlets in the south of England, which will not trade
under the Harry Ramsden's name. It also completed an agreement with Ross
Young's, a member of the United Biscuits group, to endorse the batter used
on a new range of frozen fish sold under the Ross Chip Shop brand.
Earnings per share rose to 6.7p (5.4p). The final dividend is held at 3.5p
for a maintained total of 4.5p.
Because group pre-tax profits had exceeded Pounds 800,000, the 2m B ordinary
shares this week converted into ordinary shares, which are eligible for the
final dividend.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BP makes second large oil discovery off
Shetland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hours before British Petroleum unveiled its results yesterday, the group
confirmed recent speculation that it had made a second significant discovery
off the Shetland Islands.
The find is only about 15km from an existing discovery and has estimated
recoverable reserves of between 250m and 500m barrels of oil.
BP said it intended to develop the discovery in a phased programme to ensure
that it remained 'robust at a low oil price'. The company said it was
proposing an early-production schedule which could produce up to 100,000
barrels a day within a few years.
BP holds a 50 per cent interest in the field, with the balance owned by
Royal Dutch/Shell. The companies jointly own 10 blocks covering 1,500 sq km
and intend to drill up to six wells in the area this year.
Confirmation of the field's potential on the day of BP's results may have
been a calculated move aimed at reassuring shareholders that the company
remained committed to investing in longer term opportunities, in spite of
the squeeze on capital investment.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, was at pains to stress yesterday that lower
capital expenditure did not necessarily mean fewer projects. The group's
drive towards efficiency meant that many projects were running substantially
below budget.
'We are getting more bang for the buck in most of the projects coming
forward,' he said. This year capital spending is targeted at between Dollars
4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) and Dollars 4.5bn.
The results were widely greeted by analysts as a substantial achievement in
a difficult climate. 'These were storming figures given the external
conditions,' said one.
However, the question remained of whether such performance could be
sustained at a substantially lower oil price.
Mr Simon stressed the group's focus on margin improvement to help survive
volatile price fluctuations. Year on year the company had made savings of
about Pounds 500m through rationalisation, disposals and restructuring.
BP beat its target for disposal proceeds by raising Pounds 2.1bn in the
year, compared with Pounds 1.1bn. Mr Simon said he expected a further
Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn to be raised from asset sales in the current
year.
Debt at the end of the year was Dollars 12.4bn, a fall of Dollars 4bn from
its peak in 1992. The year-end figure represented 85 per cent of
shareholders' funds.
BP benefited from a stronger dollar which contributed exchange rate gains of
Dollars 200m and gained a further Dollars 135m as a result of revisions in
petroleum revenue tax.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: First quarter loss of Pounds 8.9m for BOC -
Pounds 85m provision for restructuring programme which will take three years
to complete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC Group fell into loss in the first quarter of its financial year as the
result of an Pounds 85m provision against restructuring. The charge,
announced to shareholders last month, left a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m for
the quarter.
BOC's shares rose initially on relief that the figures were not worse - some
analysts had forecast a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 10m, but they
closed down 17p at 681p.
The company warned that pressures on profit margins in industrial gases
would remain strong until economic recovery in its markets gathered
strength.
Nor was there any indication of the company's progress towards finding a
successor to Mr Patrick Rich, the chairman who last month said he would be
retiring almost two years early in April.
Losses per share were 7.18p compared with earnings of 11.81p. Earnings per
share before exceptional items were 9.42p.
Operating profits for the three months to end-December 1993 were Pounds
97.1m - 11 per cent less than a year ago but slightly more than in the
previous three months to end-September.
An indication of the difficulty the company is having with its profits
margins in gases is illustrated by virtually unchanged profits in the
division - Pounds 75.4m against Pounds 74.7m last time, while turnover
expanded from Pounds 545.3m to Pounds 610.7m.
Total turnover for the first quarter was Pounds 843.5m (Pounds 776.8m).
Profits from the healthcare division fell sharply on a year ago because of
generic competition for its anaesthetic, Forane, on which US patent
protection expired in January last year.
Healthcare turnover was Pounds 136m (Pounds 152m) with operating profits of
Pounds 14m compared with Pounds 32.6m.
Sales growth from Forane's successor, Suprane, are still well short of
bridging the gap.
Medical systems, medical devices and speciality products divisions all
performed well, said BOC.
Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court, said that the
results had done little to clarify the long-term prospects for the group and
that the growth in turnover was the result of acquisitions in Germany and
Poland.
The provision includes Pounds 25m for restructuring BOC's gases business
worldwide and the balance will be largely for the healthcare side.
The restructuring programme begins this year and will last about three
years. When complete it should produce annual savings of Pounds 60m a year,
says BOC.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Provision warning trims Dawson Intl share
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, yesterday warned
that difficult trading conditions in the US would lead to 'a very
substantial exceptional provision' this year.
The shares fell to a low of 123p before recovering to close at 134p, down 7p
on the day.
One analyst described the announcement as 'very disappointing and extremely
unsatisfactory.' Estimates for the size of the provision ranged between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 40m.
Dawson promised a detailed announcement 'within the next few weeks when the
size of the exceptional provision has been finally quantified.'
Last December the group cut its interim dividend almost in half as problems
in the US reduced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 25 by 41
per cent to Pounds 9.23m.
The group commissioned an independent review of its troubled US businesses -
Dawson Home Fashions, which makes items such as shower curtains and bath
mats, and JE Morgan Apparel, which makes mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts for
what is known as the fleece and jersey market.
The board is now considering the most effective way of implementing the
review.
Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, said yesterday that Dawson Home Fashions had
suffered from increased import penetration as US retailers fought for market
share. The battle between US retailers had also squeezed the fleece and
jersey market, said Sir Ronald. Margins were very tight, volumes were down
and there was a lot of spare capacity.
Dawson, which used to supply K - mart with fleece and jersey, has already
closed four US plants. The two US problem sectors make up about half of
Dawson's business in the US. The other half is taken up by thermal underwear
manufacture, where the group has substantial market share.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers shows 15.6% underlying
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Carriers Group, the parcels and freight distribution company which
will be floated next month, yesterday said that its underlying profitability
increased by 15.6 per cent last year.
The pathfinder prospectus for the group, which is expected to have a market
value of just over Pounds 50m, said operating profit on continuing
operations before exceptionals rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.3m in the
year to December 31.
Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 93m to Pounds 106.4m,
including Pounds 11.2m of sales from Carpet Express since its acquisition in
March. Parcels volumes were up by 7-8 per cent, but part of the specialist
distribution business suffered from lower car sales in continental Europe.
A placing will raise about Pounds 7m of new money. In the short term, the
proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet,
which has gearing of 42.5 per cent.
However, Mr Allan Binks, chairman and chief executive, said the group would
invest about Pounds 7m over the next two to three years in the further
development of the United Carriers depot network, which specialises in the
distribution of heavy consignments, from 25kg to 250kg.
United Carriers and certain other businesses were acquired from Bunzl in a
management buy-out in 1989, supported by institutional investors led by
Phildrew Ventures.
The management team - which currently has a 20 per cent stake in the company
 -rationalised the core parcels and freight distribution business and
improved profitability by focusing on the higher weight segment of the
market.
The group also operates specialist transport and distribution businesses,
covering Vauxhall automotive components and cars; Carpet Express, which
supplies retail and wholesale outlets; and Homelink, which provides a home
delivery service for large mail order houses. It also supplies dedicated
distribution services for corporate customers.
The listing is being sponsored by Lazards, with UBS acting as broker to the
placing. The prospectus is expected to be published on February 24 and
dealing in the shares should start on Thursday, March 3.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: OFT asked to seek undertaking from MAI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has asked the Office
of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from MAI to remove competition concerns
over its planned acquisition of Anglia Television.
The demand is similar to that made in the case of both Carlton
Communications' acquisition of Central TV and Granada's hostile bid for
London Weekend Television.
In both cases, it was decided not to refer the deals to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, as long as the enlarged groups reduced their advertising
sales operations to 25 per cent of the total television advertising market
by August 1995.
Anglia's advertising is sold by TSMS, a sales house that also sells
advertising for Central and Ulster Television. MAI's broadcasting company
Meridian, the south of England ITV company, sells through Merlin.
Mr Heseltine said that on the basis of current advice, he expected to be
able to resolve competition concerns without a reference - presumably on the
25 per cent principle.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising has called on Granada to
divest itself of some of its television advertising sales interests well
before next August if it succeeds in taking over LWT. Allowing current
arrangements to continue until then, would needlessly increase uncertainty.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview):  Results will shed light
on broader trends - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply
companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and
slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The table below shows some of the expected highlights of this year's results
season. The figures and trading statements from these companies are awaited
keenly, not only for their own significance, but partly for the light they
should shed on broader trends.
The classic bellwether stocks, such as ICI, BTR and Reckitt &amp; Colman, will
provide useful pointers to the health of the world's main economies.
The historic and forecast figures, which have been supplied by stockbrokers
James Capel, need a little explanation.
The forecasts for pre-tax profits and earnings per share are not necessarily
the numbers Capel expects companies to report under FRS 3, the financial
reporting standard for the profit and loss account which is now mandatory
for British companies.
Capel's analysts follow the Institute of Investment Management and
Research's definition of 'headline' earnings, which often requires
adjustment of figures prepared under FRS 3.
For example, the headline numbers, designed to provide a better guide to
underlying profitability, exclude gains or losses on the sale of a
discontinued operation. These would be included in figures calculated under
FRS 3.
Capel has also adjusted the figures the companies reported last year on the
same basis to make the comparison more meaningful.
The price/earnings ratios the Financial Times calculates for the newspaper's
London Share Service and the earnings in the FT-SE Actuaries indices are
also based on the Institute's headline earnings definition.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview): Hopes rest on answers to
crucial questions - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply
companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and
slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects

Many in the City believe that the UK corporate earnings outlook has rarely
been so positive. The forthcoming round of results will test this optimism.
Inflation is dying, or at least dormant, business surveys are optimistic,
and the prospect of sustained output growth and gradually declining
unemployment stretch out ahead, or so the high stock market valuations
indicate.
The fundamental question is: can companies rapidly expand their earnings in
a low inflation, low growth economic environment? The stock market seems to
believe they can.
With hopes so high, analysts and investors will be paying close attention to
the commentary on prospects accompanying results statements.
'The key thing will be chairmen's statements. The market is increasingly
moving towards recovery stories,' one market strategist said. 'If we get
down-beat statements on 1994, it could severely effect the market.'
Answers to a number of crucial questions will help determine whether or not
investors' hopes are speeding ahead of commercial realities. Among the
issues are:
What is the outlook for sales growth?
The volume of new orders is growing at the strongest rate for five years,
encouraged by a gradual revival in demand, according to the latest
industrial trends survey by the Confederation of British Industry.
J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, recently demonstrated how crucial
performance statements can be. Its comments on shrinking margins resulted in
a one-day drop of 11 per cent in its share price.
What is the exposure to overseas markets?
Exports to the US are already benefiting from its economic upturn and the
relative strength of the dollar. By contrast, in the late 1980s, many
companies had expanded into continental Europe hoping to benefit from the
single market. But with economic recovery on the Continent lagging behind
Britain's, some companies are finding weak export sales offsetting the
domestic pickup.
Is restructuring paying off?
The recession forced many companies into hefty restructuring of their
operations and balance sheets. Are the benefits coming through to the bottom
line? If they need to restructure further, can their balance sheets take the
hit? In a low inflationary environment, lower unit costs are crucial, given
the economic pressures against raising prices.
This results season has been preceded by three years of severe
rationalisation. Warburg Securities' Smallco, a portfolio of 162 industrial
companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 20bn, gives a strong
indication of trends, since smaller companies tend to react more rapidly to
economic changes.
The portfolio suffered total exceptional losses of Pounds 674m during 1991
and 1992, because of restructuring costs and balance sheet write-downs. This
figure is forecast to drop to Pounds 90m in 1993 and Pounds 3m in 1994, as
costs have been pared to the bone, and asset prices stabilise.
How much spare capacity is there?
The recession triggered a substantial reduction in industrial capacity
through business failures, mergers and plant rationalisations. Just how far
the process has gone is difficult to judge. Capacity utilisation data are
notoriously unreliable.
However, there are signs of more manufacturing companies operating at or
near capacity. If this is the case, it could undermine confidence that the
inflationary dragon has indeed been slain.
According to the latest CBI figures, 57 per cent of companies are operating
below capacity - the smallest percentage since October 1990, and well down
on the 70 per cent levels reported during 1991 and 1992.
Of even more concern, one in eight companies currently expect capacity
constraints to limit output in the short-term.
If capacity is tightening, will companies try to push up prices? Some
building materials suppliers, for example, have already pushed through
modest price increases.
For some capital intensive industries, production capacity has already
become an important issue. The cement industry, for example, cut production
through the recession, but now finds demand rebounding. Cement makers are
suggesting they will import surplus stocks from recession-hit European
manufacturers when they run out of capacity rather than invest in new plant.
This implies inflationary bottle necks at a later stage.
What are the impediments to increasing output?
Job cuts continue in some sectors, notably financial services and
manufacturing industry. Yet, unemployment fell below 10 per cent of the
working population in December, for the first time since July 1992. Indeed,
in some sectors, labour shortages have emerged.
Last month, Magellan Industries, a lingerie and swimwear manufacturer
(mainly for Marks and Spencer), issued a profits warning because it could
not cope with demand.
So far, such examples of pressures on unit costs are rare. More companies
expect unit costs to fall than rise, thanks to low inflation and increased
productivity. This was only the second time such a response was recorded in
36 years.
Is capital spending rising?
If optimism is well-founded, there should already be signs of spending on
new plant and machinery, as excess capacity diminishes. The CBI found a
balance of companies anticipating increased expenditure on non-property
fixed assets.
Yet surprisingly, Warburg's Smallco is forecast to show a 5 per cent drop in
capital expenditure in 1993, and a further 2 per cent dip in 1994. This
would reflect falling prices of productive assets, and slack production
levels.
But it has negative implications for the capital goods sector and raises
questions over whether optimism will turn into investment. It also suggests
that some managers are holding back from investing in new plant because they
are demanding an unrealistically high rate of return given the low inflation
environment.

FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview): Downgrading of forecasts
again outstrips upgrades - Profits are rising. But high share valuations
imply companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation
and slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects

The stock market approaches the coming results season with the hope that the
economic recovery which officially began in the second quarter of 1992 will
at last be feeding through to corporate profits.
It is, however, not an entirely confident expectation. While there were high
hopes for 1993 early in the year - with stockbrokers BZW, for instance,
seeing analysts upgrades exceed downgrades in the second quarter of the year
for the first time in many quarters - that was reversed in the second half.
Profit forecasts were hit by some severe downgradings towards the end of
last year - for instance on stocks as diverse as BTR, GEC and food
retailers.
Mr Richard Kersley, market analyst at BZW, notes that the downgrades of 1993
had a different character to those in 1991 and 1992, when it was usually a
case of the downturn in the economic cycle hitting profits.
In 1993 the downgrades had little to do with the cycle, more with companies'
ability to increase prices.
While businesses in some sectors, such as building materials, were able to
raise prices reflecting a cyclical upturn, it was sectors such as food
retailers and pharmaceuticals that were hit by their lack of pricing power.
Trading statements from companies have continued to lower analysts'
expectations. There is a new spirit of disclosure by companies which should
mean that those which can see that estimates are significantly different
from the likely outturn put out a statement to that effect.
That might be expected to prevent any nasty surprises coming out in the
results as they are reported.
Yet analysts are less sure than they once might have been about their
forecasts, since many have been wrongfooted by such warnings.
More important, perhaps, for the value of the stock market, will be the tone
of chairmen's statements about current and future trading.
However, as the numbers appear on dealing screens there is the possibility
for much confusion as sizeable exceptional items are likely to continue to
distort profits and the implementation of FRS 3 last year has, if anything,
made the reported profit figure more difficult to inter-pret.
In general, 1992 was a year of restructuring, rationalisation and redundancy
costs with the addition of write-downs of asset values. By contrast 1993
figures will reflect a bounce in reported profits, simply because of the
absence of such negatives.
Mr Robert Buckland, market analyst at NatWest Markets, points out that the
absence of large write-offs from three large companies alone, British
Petroleum, British Aerospace and ICI, will account for a Pounds 2bn profit
rise, equivalent to 10 per cent of the market's earnings base.
On top of that, the benefit of cost-cutting measures and the ability to make
higher profits from written down assets - such as housebuilders which have
cut the value of their land banks - should be coming through in higher
profit margins.
The profit rise from the former is exceptional, but the gain from the latter
can be argued to be either unrepeatable or to reflect underlying growth.
Or as Mr Roger Barker of UBS, the brokers, puts it: 'We are now starting to
see more of the profits increase generated from higher demand rather than
productivity'.
As a result of the large write-offs in 1992, there is a wide difference in
forecasts of reported 'headline' numbers and profit rises excluding
exceptionals.
A further complication is that write-offs are likely to have continued into
1993. While it might have seemed that the 1992 results included the kitchen
sink, many companies will have found further causes of one-off costs in
1993.
While the headline number could show a rise for industrial stocks of 20 per
cent or even 30 per cent, most forecasts for underlying, adjusted profits
growth percentages lie somewhere in the teens.
Most brokers focus on growth in profits and earnings from the industrial
group, which excludes oil and gas, and the financial sector.
The oil and gas and financial areas are likely to show much better growth
than industrials, if only because of the bounce back from difficulties.
Banks, for example, are recovering from the massive bad debt provisions they
were forced to take in the recession.
Expectations of earnings growth in 1994 are for about 15 per cent from the
industrial sector, although as one market strategist said: 'If it turns out
that people were not in the right place for 1993, that could undermine
confidence in 1994 forecasts'.
The 1994 estimate is likely to be a more 'real' figure than the 1993 number
which will reflect recovery more than growth. As one analyst puts it: 'The
quality of earnings is rising'.
It must be remembered too, that forecasts of percentage earnings growth in
the mid-teens for both 1993 and 1994 compare with inflation forecasts in low
single figures. The combination of 1993 and 1994 will produce a sharp rise
in real earnings, which many strategists believe underpins the stock
market's current valuation.
Most expect a much slower rise in dividends than in earnings, as companies
seek to rebuild cover which sank to low levels in 1992. While earnings were
falling in 1991 and 1992, dividends at the end of 1992 were at the same
level as they had been in 1990.
Forecasts centre on a 4 per cent rise in 1993 and 6 per cent in 1994,
although some are higher, such as BZW at 6 and 8 per cent respectively. This
is based on the increase in the net dividend. Gross dividends will be
distorted as the change in the rate of tax credits on dividends works
through.
Another distortion comes from the prevalence of enhanced scrip dividends in
1993, with companies paying 50 per cent more in shares than in cash, which
makes it harder to calculate an average number.
Further, the rise in dividends is expected to be heavily weighted by
increases from the utilities, and to some extent by pharmaceuticals. Among
financials, banks are due to reward their shareholders' patience with bigger
pay-outs.
Even so dividend cover, which according to Mr Mark Brown, strategist at
brokers Hoare Govett, has sunk to 1 1/2 times if utilities are excluded,
will take some time to get back to average levels of 2 1/2 times.
Investors will be looking for signs of whether companies want to return to
that level of cover.
With balance sheets strengthened by rights issues, companies have more
flex-ibility to decide whether to channel cashflow towards financing
recovery or to be more generous to their shareholders.
With inflation at low levels, there is an argument that companies can live
comfortably with slimmer dividend cover than they have wanted in the past.
Another feature of the results season could be more rights issues, although
the number of companies calling on shareholders for cash is likely to fall.
Much work has already been done to rebuild corporate finances. But with a
recovery to finance, companies may take advantage of the high level of the
stock market which makes it attractive to issue shares.
If such issues are combined with optimistic statements from company chairmen
about the economic recovery, and profit forecasts are met, then the stock
market should survive the results season without much damage.

Bearing bad tidings is never an enviable role, but companies which reveal
unexpectedly poor figures in this reporting season are likely to find the
market in particularly unforgiving mood.
Even bullish analysts and investment institutions are not immune to
misgivings that some individual shares have been over-rated in the recent
market surge. Companies which do disappoint are likely to find their fall
from grace all the steeper as a result.
Christian Salvesen, the distribution, specialist hire and food services
group, got a foretaste of the market's mood last week when it announced a
profits warning. The shares fell 16 per cent on the day and have
subsequently drifted down to 25 per cent below their peak level in January.
The Edinburgh-based group struck a downbeat note when announcing flat
interim results in December, but analysts were still disappointed last week
by the extent of competitive pressure on Aggreko, the group's specialist
hire business, which had been a star performer in recent years.
An important cause of the market's twitchiness was a greater wariness by
companies towards contacts with analysts. This tightening up follows last
year's censure by the Stock Exchange of LIG, the world's leading branded
condom maker, for warning selected investors about a profits shortfall.
While the authorities have made it clear they will jump on any attempt to
'drip-feed' bad news to the market, some companies have responded to this
stricter reporting environment by issuing more regular trading statements.
However, some groups, who might previously have tried to massage down
expectations, may have baulked at issuing a full-scale profits warning.
These restraints apply equally to the transmission of good news and some
companies may indeed surprise the market with the quality of their results.
However, the scope for upgrades is inevitably limited. At current market
ratings, the immediate risk appears to be on the downside.
Another important consideration is the performance of the sectors in which
companies appear. Property groups and building and construction stocks have
outperformed the market by nearly 50 per cent since the begining of last
year, so there is room for short-term disappointment.
By contrast, any cheer from food retailers, which have underperformed by 40
per cent over the same period, would be as welcome as it would be
unexpected.

FT  11 FEB 94 / BP defies price fall to return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum fought off the effects of falling oil prices to announce a
return to the black as it reaped the rewards of a wide-ranging restructuring
and disposal programme.
Pre-tax profits last year on a replacement cost basis - which excludes the
effects of changes in inventory values - were Pounds 896m after exceptional
items, against losses of Pounds 352m for 1992. Exceptional items for the
year totalled Pounds 240m. BP saw a 56 per cent improvement in comparable
fourth quarter profits to Pounds 315m.
The group also substantially improved its cash flow, recording a positive
contribution of Pounds 1.95bn before financing, against a Pounds 607m
outflow in 1992.
This was partly due to the success of BP's disposal programme which has
raised more than Pounds 3bn since 1992.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the group had 'really been tested. We
have shown a steady improvement in our financial performance in spite of the
oil price.'
Average oil prices declined during the year by more than Dollars 2 to about
Dollars 16 a barrel. Since early December they have fallen to about Dollars
13.50, but Mr Simon said BP's larger oil fields had remained profitable. He
did not hold great hope for a revival of oil prices in the near future and
said BP would have to 'find a way to live in a Dollars 13 to Dollars 14
world'. This would mean greater efforts to maintain margins, rather than
relying on the oil price for profits. The group announced it intends to find
a further Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) savings in the next three years, but
there were no firm plans for further redundancies. There was room for
cutting variable costs, Mr Simon said.
The main exploration and production business returned operating profits of
Pounds 1.9bn, against Pounds 1.7bn last year. Mr Simon said this had been
achieved through margin management and increased gas production, as well as
cost-cutting.
Refining and marketing jumped from Pounds 304m to Pounds 810m. The
improvement largely resulted from Pounds 265m of cost reductions.
The chemicals division was hit by low petrochemical prices and incurred
losses of Pounds 68m, against a Pounds 24m deficit last year.
The fourth quarter dividend was 2.1p (against 2.1p), for a total of 8.4p
(against 10.5p). Earnings per share on a replacement cost basis, before
exceptionals rose from 9.9p to 10.7p.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Rise in call volumes takes BT up 8.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady growth in call volumes enabled British Telecommunications to lift
pre-tax profits 8.5 per cent in the three months to December 31, allowing
for increased redundancy charges and other one-off items.
At Pounds 698m, pre-tax profits were notionally down on the Pounds 705m made
in the third quarter of last year, but redundancy charges totalled Pounds
142m against Pounds 17m.
The payroll on December 31 was 164,600, some 6,100 down on March. BT
projects a net reduction of 12,000 for the year as a whole and a similar
loss next year. It has shed 80,000 posts since March 1990.
Turnover for the quarter was up 4.5 per cent at Pounds 3.43bn, and for the
first nine months it was 3.9 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.2bn.
Analysts showed some concern at BT estimates that long-distance weekend call
volumes had risen by only 20 per cent since rates were slashed by nearly
half in early December, implying a significant revenue shortfall.
BT emphasised that the 20 per cent figure was based on only eight weeks'
traffic and volumes could be expected to rise as familiarity with new
tariffs grew. But analysts saw it as indicating difficulties ahead as BT is
pushed into more aggressive price competition with Mercury, and with new
entrants such as the cable companies building combined phone and television
networks.
Benefiting from lower prices and a reviving economy, inland telephone call
turnover rose by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, against 2.3 per cent for
the first nine months. Increased volume outweighed the effect of discounts
introduced by BT to fend off growing competition.
International traffic growth was strong, with call turnover up 8.3 per cent
in the first nine months. The recent boom in mobile telephony benefited
Cellnet, BT's cellular joint venture with Securicor, helping turnover in the
'other services' sector to rise by 3 per cent in the nine moths to Pounds
2.28bn. But increased marketing expenses restrained profit growth.
Earnings per share in the third quarter were 7.3p (up from 7.2p), but 6.3
per cent up allowing for redundancy payments and other one-off items.
BT will soon have to pay Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.39bn) to close its deal for
a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US long-distance carrier. It
stands to gain about Dollars 2bn from the sale to AT&amp;T of its stake in
McCaw, the US cellular operator. At December 31 its gearing stood at only 10
per cent, with net debt of Pounds 1.38bn.
Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said: 'It is encouraging that we continue to
achieve steady volume growth despite growing competitive pressures'.
The results were in line with City expectations. BT shares closed 1 1/2 p
down at 455p.

FT  11 FEB 94 / How GM steered clear of the abyss: The US group's success in
limiting Europe's recessionary damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' European operations suffered a 54.6 per cent decline in net
profits last year, but the US group is expected to remain Europe's most
profitable volume carmaker.
Apart from GM, only Renault of France among the big six European volume
carmakers is expected to report a profit for 1993. Volkswagen, of Germany,
and Fiat, of Italy, have both plunged into loss, while Ford, GM's US rival,
disclosed this week that its European automotive operations had suffered a
third successive loss in 1993.
New car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent to 11.45m
last year, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period, which has
left much of the European motor industry awash with red ink.
GM, now firmly established in second place in the west European new car
market, has remained in the black throughout the recession, however, and
believes the worst is over. Mr Paul Schmidt, GM Europe finance director,
said yesterday: 'We are counting on 1994 being more profitable than 1993.'
GM's net profits from its European operations declined to Dollars 604.7m
(Pounds 414m), from Dollars 1.3bn in 1992. Its results were burdened by
one-off exchange rate losses of about Dollars 450m and by some Dollars 400m
in restructuring charges.
The net profit of the core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle
operations fell to about Dollars 600m from Dollars 1.4bn. Opel fell into
loss in Germany, but GM made profits at Vauxhall in the UK and in Spain.
In contrast to its fortunes in the US, where it is still a high-cost
producer, GM's Opel/Vauxhall operations are among the most productive in
Europe. It has gained a big advantage over Ford of Europe, for example, in
the capital efficiency of its new model development programmes, and it was
the first carmaker in Europe to discover the profits potential from driving
down purchasing costs.
The success of its model range has allowed it steadily to increase market
share - to 13 per cent last year - while avoiding the worst excesses of
heavy marketing costs. Its main marque - Opel in continental Europe and
Vauxhall in the UK (the cars are technically identical) - is the biggest
selling make in the west European market, and GM has achieved a more even
spread of market share than its rivals.
While Fiat and Volkswagen are still heavily dependent on their home markets,
GM has secured a share of at least 10 per cent in 12 countries in west
Europe, and is among the top three in 12 out of 17 national markets.
While it moved much earlier than Volkswagen and Fiat to increase
productivity in Europe - unfortunately the lessons only penetrated belatedly
into GM's North American bureaucracy - it was still forced to cut its
European workforce last year, to keep pace with the steep decline in the
overall market and to bring down stock levels.
GM's overall European workforce declined to 131,000 at the end of 1993 from
141,000 a year earlier, but this includes all GM activities from EDS data
processing to Hughes Electronics and vehicle components manufacture.
The workforce of the Opel/Vauxhall operations fell by 8 per cent to 85,000
(including 16,000 salaried employees) at the end of 1993, from 92,000
(including 17,000 salaried employees) a year earlier. It also imposed
widespread short-time working at its European assembly plants and was forced
to cut a total of 450 shifts.
GM car and light commercial vehicle production in Europe, including small
volume assembly in Hungary and Turkey, fell last year by 16.9 per cent to
1,435,520.
Having started later on painful slimming courses - and with less success in
the marketplace to soften the blows - GM's rivals in Europe have been forced
to make more swingeing cuts in their workforces, often at the cost of
sinking morale. The German auto industry, including components, lost an
estimated 70,000 jobs in 1993 following a 60,000 reduction in 1992.

FT  11 FEB 94 / City to scrutinise corporate results for earnings prospects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most telling UK corporate reporting seasons in years is getting
under way with the investment and business communities paying even closer
attention than usual to the progress of companies.
Mr Robin Aspinall, chief economist and strategist at Panmure Gordon, said:
'This results season will probably tell us more about the health of
companies than any other in a long while.'
Shares have rarely traded at such high valuations. The price/earnings ratio
of the 855 stocks in the FT-SE-A All-Share index is 25.21, implying high
hopes for rapid growth in corporate earnings.
Mr Robert Buckland, a market strategist with NatWest Securities said: 'It
will be more of an earnings-driven market this year than last, which was
interest rate-driven.'
Profits are beginning to benefit from economic recovery but the stock market
has set a stiff challenge to companies: rapid earnings growth will be
difficult in a low inflation and low growth economic environment.
Thus, the City will pore over chairmen's outlook statements with the arrival
of companies' results. Share prices will be marked down sharply on
disappointing results or prospects.
A string of weak results could cause a sharp sell-off, but Mr Aspinall
argues that more powerful factors are at work. Money has poured into
equities as interest rates have fallen. 'What really matters, is whether
that cash keeps coming in.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / Tring is sued over music copies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the recording group which is to be listed on the stock
exchange, is being sued by a US company which alleges that unauthorised
copies of its recordings appear on more than 10 per cent of Tring's albums.
In correspondence last year with the US company, K-Tel International, Tring
said it based its rights to the recordings on an agreement in the US between
Mr William Carr and Mr Stan Shulman. A Texas court ruled last month, in a
case to which Tring was not a party, that the purported Carr/Shulman
agreement was a forgery.
Tring said yesterday that the correspondence was written before it had
precise details of K-Tel's allegations.
Tring faces legal action from several music groups, including PolyGram and
MCA. Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music, which had sued
it for breach of copyright.
Trading in Tring's shares is set to begin on February 23. It says the legal
claims will not have a significant financial impact.
K-Tel wrote to Tring last year alleging copyright infringement. In September
and October Simon Olswang, Tring's solicitors, wrote to Denton Hall, K-Tel's
UK lawyers, saying Tring's right to exploit the recordings depended on the
validity of the Carr/Shulman agreement. Mr Shulman, who died in 1985, had a
joint venture with K-Tel.
On October 25, Tring issued a writ in the UK against K-Tel, asking for a
declaration that Tring was not infringing its copyright. Last November,
K-Tel issued a writ against Tring, alleging 48 of its songs - by such
artists as Little Richard and Percy Sledge - appeared on Tring albums.
K-Tel alleges that 88 of Tring's albums contain one or more of its songs.
Tring's catalogue contains 800 albums.
The US District Court in Texas last month ordered Mr Carr and two other US
defendants to pay K-Tel Dollars 616,300 damages.
Tring said yesterday that when its solicitors wrote to K-Tel last year, it
did not know which recordings were the subject of the allegations.
Subsequent investigations showed that the 48 recordings did not depend on
the Carr/Shulman agreement. Even if the titles appeared in K-Tel's
catalogue, Tring believed it was selling different recordings.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Guy's role to be cut in London hospitals shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guy's, the London teaching hospital that was the standard bearer of the
government's market-based health reforms, will cease to provide everyday
hospital services under a plan to reshape the capital's health services
unveiled yesterday.
The package announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, included
Pounds 85m to improve primary care in London. The Royal Marsden, the London
cancer centre in Chelsea, and the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond
Street, will become trusts. Charing Cross and Hammersmith hospitals may
merge on a single site.
The announcement, the latest in a string of decisions aimed at reducing
hospital capacity in the capital, will be a setback for Guy's supporters in
the City of London.
Guy's, which is just south of London Bridge, will not close altogether.
Parts of the site, including an as-yet unopened Pounds 140m new wing, will
be used for teaching and research. It will continue to provide local health
services. But services such as cardiology and oncology will be transferred
to its sister hospital St Thomas's, in Lambeth opposite the Houses of
Parliament.
The decision is a remarkable reversal of fortunes for one of the first
hospitals to take advantage of the government's reforms when it became a
trust hospital in 1991. Guy's was run by a management team that ministers
regarded as enthusiastic supporters of their health reforms.
The trust board responsible for both Guy's and St Thomas's had wanted to
retain the two sites. But Mrs Bottomley decided that, while this would have
represented some short-term savings in capital costs, it would have
increased revenue costs in the longer-term.
Some Guy's medical staff are threatening to resign over the decision and
there are likely to be disputes about whether or not the government should
return charitable funds that have been used to finance recent developments
at the hospital.
The Guy's announcement was part of a package on the restructuring of London
health care. Following the recommendations of last year's Tomlinson report,
ministers are transferring resources from hospitals to primary and community
services. Mrs Bottomley said that, to help achieve this, Pounds 85m will be
spent in 1994-95 on GPs' premises, new health centres and other forms of
community-based care.
The Royal Marsden would be given 'every opportunity to shape its own future
responding to patient choice' as a trust hospital, Mrs Bottomley said.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Unit trust industry set to demand single pricing: Threat of
international competition prompts proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unit trust industry is set to call for radical change to the way unit
trusts are priced in order to meet the threat of increasing international
competition.
In spite of record Pounds 9.1bn unit trust sales last year, the industry
believes the existing 'dual pricing' system, under which investors buy units
at an 'offer' price and sell at a lower 'bid' price, is a barrier to its
performance, especially outside the UK.
It hopes that 'single pricing' will make unit trusts easier for UK investors
to understand and more accessible to customers in US and European markets.
A draft paper from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds calls
on the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, to
introduce rules for the single pricing of trusts on the basis of a
'mid-price' valuation.
Demand for change has intensified following the Treasury's announcement late
last year that single pricing would be used for the open-ended investment
company (OEIC), a form of pooled investment which will be introduced into
the UK, perhaps as early as next year. The OEIC is already common in other
European countries and in North America.
Many believe it could be very damaging for the unit trust industry if this
single-priced investment product became available while trusts continued to
use the dual pricing system.
The AUTIF paper has yet to be finalised. However, it is the result of
extensive consultation among association members, who make up about 90 per
cent of fund managers, and is unlikely to change substantively.
Standard Life, which makes up most of the other 10 per cent, agrees with the
call for single pricing.
The paper comes in response to the SIB's consultation document in October
last year on ways of deregulating the Pounds 84bn unit trust industry. The
SIB said that given the lack of consensus in the industry at the time it
would not impose single-pricing.
The AUTIF response seeks to take account of concern that the move to a
single pricing system could lead to extra costs being borne by the fund
itself and prove unfair to those who continue to hold units.
Under the existing system, the difference between the bid and offer prices
reflects the fund's charges and costs.
With single pricing there is a risk of 'diluting' the fund because, by using
a mid-price, the whole cost of a particular transaction would not be met by
each buyer or seller but would fall partly on the fund itself.
The association suggests that fund managers who want to reduce dilution
should be allowed to make separate payments into the fund, perhaps from
their own charges or from an entry or exit charge.
Any such charge would have to be disclosed in advance to the potential
investor.

FT  11 FEB 94 / E Europe nuclear plants face legal delay on repairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY PLASKETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western European nuclear companies are refusing to carry out urgent nuclear
safety repair work in eastern Europe and the CIS until they have protection
against liability in case of accidents.
Foratom, the European federation of nuclear trade associations, has written
to Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's external economic affairs
commissioner, warning that unless western nuclear companies are protected
against legal action they will withdraw from nuclear repair work in the
region.
The companies are concerned that they would be liable if there were an
accident during work to repair or replace ailing Soviet designed nuclear
reactors.
The move will delay the flow of European Commission nuclear safety funds to
the region under its technical assistance programmes. It will also prevent
companies from signing large repair contracts under the Nuclear Safety
Account, the multilateral aid fund set up by the Group of Seven
industrialised countries after the July 1992 Munich summit.
International experts have identified a number of Soviet-designed reactors
that are in urgent need of repair, in particular the first generation
pressurised water reactors, the VVER 230s and the RBMK Chernobyl design. In
December 1993 the EU's economic and finance commissioner Henning
Christophersen described the nuclear safety situation as a 'time bomb
ticking away in eastern Europe'.
While western nuclear companies have been prepared to participate in studies
and training at the plants, they will not replace equipment until they have
legal protection against the consequences of accidents.
Most of the countries with VVER 230s and RBMK reactors in operation have not
signed the 1963 Vienna Convention, which ensures that full responsibility
for damages caused by accidents falls exclusively on plant operators.
The Commission has said it cannot guarantee to pay damages. Instead, it has
asked countries receiving aid to sign bilateral agreements with nuclear
companies protecting them against legal action. The nuclear industry argues
that such deals do not give it sufficient legal or economic protection.
Foratom met Commission officials yesterday in the first of a series of
meetings to find an interim solution which would allow vital safety work to
go ahead. One option could be for recipient countries, western European
governments and possibly the industry itself to set up a fund which could be
tapped if an accident occurs.

FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Sugar refrained from saying 'I told you so' in his comments
accompanying Amstrad's interim results. But the trading picture is certainly
every bit as dismal as he forecast when trying to take the company private
in 1992. Amstrad may have chosen to axe a fair chunk of products, such as
low margin computers and videos, which were not worth persevering with. Even
so, sales have been shrinking at an alarming rate. Competitive pressures on
the high street have remained intense while rival manufacturers have been
eating into Amstrad's few remaining areas of strength, such as satellite
dishes. Only interest income enabled Amstrad to remain in the black at the
pre-tax level. But the first half of the year is traditionally the stronger.
A full-year loss now seems a real possibility.
Following yesterday's 11 per cent slide, Amstrad's shares appear to be
heading back inexorably towards Mr Sugar's offer price of 30p - although
they should find some support from the company's Pounds 143m cash pile,
which equates to about 24p a share. The visibility of Amstrad's earnings
stream was never good at the best of times. Now, even the management cannot
see from where it will come. Mr Sugar has wisely refrained from embarking on
a panic-driven shopping spree. Shareholders must therefore pin their hopes
on Dancall expanding aggressively in mobile telephones. That market is
certainly attractive. Amstrad aims to launch a new product later this year.
But it is a slender thread by which to hang so many doubts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's third-quarter profits show that the cash generator continues to purr
away. What is perhaps more interesting is the way in which the marketing
battle is hotting up between BT, Mercury and the other new competitors. The
RPI-7.5 per cent price cap which BT now endures means substantial price
cuts. BT seems to have decided to turn necessity into virtue by making price
cut a marketing weapon. This week's abolition of peak rate tariffs is aimed
at business users. But the weekend low rates and 'family and friends'
promotion is aimed at domestic users, implying that Mercury and the cable
television companies are having some impact.
The fight will intensify as new services and products are launched, and next
year BT must come up with further price initiatives. Cable television, which
has plumbed in its own lines, has substantial flexibility over how it
structures its marketing push. Mercury, by contrast, operates primarily
through BT's own system and pays for this through a price structure which
mirrors the retail tariffs. That makes it difficult to offer radically
different options, such as free evening calls. Mercury is legally
challenging that structure. If it succeeds, marketing expertise is going to
change the nature of the retail telecoms battle.

FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilts' poor response to Tuesday's base rate cut has put the Bank of England
into a quandary. Normally it would be expected to announce an auction today.
But with sterling weaker and the March future down almost two points over
the past week, it cannot be certain how well the announcement would be
received. Since it has virtually completed this year's funding programme, it
could skip this month's auction. But this could be perceived as an admission
that the market was too weak to absorb new paper. That would only drive
prices lower.
A better approach might be to launch an auction of short-dated paper, which
has proved less vulnerable than long gilts to swings in sentiment. With
five-year yields of around 6 per cent and base rates at 5.25 per cent, there
is limited downside risk and some chance of capital gain if the authorities
do move to cut interest rates again. The short end of the market also
attracts a broad range of buyers including banks and securities houses
involved in the swaps market.
Yet the Bank also needs to find a way of resuming its borrowing at the long
end of the market. It has avoided doing so for a long time for fear of being
seen to pay high real rates for 20- to 30-year money when inflation is
supposed to remain low. The weakness of long gilts in recent days might
suggest it has missed the boat altogether, but there is still a chance that
confidence will return once world markets have adjusted to the Fed's new
policy stance. If so, present market weakness would present a buying
opportunity the Bank could exploit with a long-dated auction in March or
April.

FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BP strikes cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in BP's share price and profitability since the dark days of
1992 has been remarkable. Perhaps most impressive has been the reduction in
costs and the repayment of 25 per cent of its Dollars 16.5bn debt mountain.
The real touchstone of renewed stability is, however, for the company to
generate sufficient cash from underlying operations to pay for capital
expenditure, tax, and its dividend. BP achieved that state of grace in the
second half of 1993.
It must then be galling for the management to have had so little help from
the market. If oil prices had remained around Dollars 16 a barrel, the
company could have maintained a steady cash flow and set the seal on its
improved fortunes with a dividend increase this summer. With oil now nearer
Dollars 13, that is much harder. If crude prices remain weak, the company
can keep pressure on costs and tweak the timing of its capital spending to
keep underlying cash flow neutral. But with the emphasis on prudence, the
management will not want to send the wrong signal by increasing the dividend
until the crude price firms and stabilises.
While that may cause understandable disappointment, it is hardly a serious
problem. A dividend increase can be afforded at a relatively low cash cost.
Even then, there is a strong argument for redeploying most of the improved
cash flow within the company. The choice is between increased capital
spending and further debt reduction. Since it has plenty on its plate, it
may well choose to pay off more borrowings in the short term. But it is a
measure of its transformed prospects that BP can now make choices between
the dividend, debt and capital spending, which threatened to crush it barely
18 months ago.

Will the entrepreneur drop in by balloon, perhaps? Apart from the fact that
his wife is not keen on him ballooning, the streets off London's Haymarket

The embattled wind power industry has decided that offence may be its best
defence.
This month's issue of Windpower Monthly, the industry journal, has on the
cover a grisly picture showing a man holding a dead bird by its battered
feathers. In the background are several wind turbines.
The scene is Tarifa in southern Spain, where Europe's largest wind farm with
269 turbines has been accused of slicing up migratory birds. A long article
inside contains the disturbing admission by Francisco Serrano, director of
Spain's renewables energy agency IDAE, that there was 'a very unfortunate
lapse of memory' at the planning stage. 'Nobody thought about migratory
birds. Only the resident fauna was taken into consideration,' he says.
The article also describes how the European Commission has warned Spain to
review its wind-farm policy until a long-term bird study is completed. The
edition has led to howls in some corners of the wind-power industry because
it may only stoke further hostility towards wind farms. But Lyn Harrison,
who edits it from Denmark, tells readers: 'There is method in our madness.'
Better to air the problem in a wind energy magazine where it is more likely
to get balanced treatment than in other media. 'The situation should never
have arisen, and the industry ought to be kicking itself.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / Observer: Island package tour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone fancy running a small country? The job of chief executive of the
Falkland Islands government is up for grabs. It pays well - Pounds 50,000 a
year - and there are the usual perks, unlimited fishing, rough shooting,
free limo etc . . .
Ronald Sampson, the boss since April 1989, is leaving when his contract
expires. He's returning to the family home at Stratford upon Avon, so far
without any other job lined up. Faced with the messy task of untangling
20-odd companies involved in a fishing fiasco, which left the Falkland
Islands with losses of some Pounds 25m, he's acquitted himself well. 'We've
been scandal-free for five years,' he adds - no mean achievement given the
islands' history.
Potential replacements will be required to strut their stuff in front of an
interviewing board consisting of Sampson; Sukey Cameron, the islands
government's London representative; Gordon Jewkes, a former governor; a bod
from the Foreign Office; and Paul Stevenson, former Royal Marines'
commander.
The job involves managing 200 civil servants (10 per cent of the population)
and representing the islands in commercial and overseas contexts. It could
be a particularly sensitive post given the flurry of excitement over the
islands' oil potential, although exploration is unlikely to start before
1995. Sounds like just the sort of challenge for Bob Horton, the deposed
boss of British Petroleum, if he were not tied up back home trying to make
sure that Britain's railway privatisation runs on time.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Bosnia needs more
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The situation for the population continues to be dramatic and unacceptable.
There should be no doubt about the firm determination of Nato and its member
nations to act against those responsible so that the resolutions of the UN
Security Council are respected and the suffering brought to an end. In this
context, it is essential that the Bosnian Serbs lift without delay the siege
of Sarajevo and that the heights around the city and the means of access are
placed under the control of Unprofor.'
So said the North Atlantic Council (NAC) on August 9 1993. A week earlier it
had decided 'to make immediate preparations for undertaking, in the event
that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues, . . . stronger
measures including air strikes against those responsible'.
Six months later, the siege has not been lifted. The heights and means of
access remain under Bosnian Serb control. The 'strangulation' of Sarajevo
and other areas continues. So did the shelling, more or less continuously -
until, last Saturday, one shell landing in a Sarajevo street market brought
the city's agony back to western television screens and, thereby, jolted
Nato into . . . well, not action exactly, but a new meeting and a new
ultimatum.
'No one should doubt Nato's resolve,' says President Bill Clinton. On past
form that is exactly what one should doubt. True, this time there is a
precise deadline. The Bosnian Serbs have been given 10 days, not to end the
siege of Sarajevo but - 'with a view to ending it' - to withdraw, or
'regroup and place under Unprofor control' their heavy weapons located
within 20km (12 1/2 miles) of the city centre. After that, such weapons not
under Unprofor control will be 'subject to Nato air strikes'.
Inhibiting factors
No further meeting of the NAC is required, and the 'request' from the UN
secretary-general has already been received - though 'close co-ordination'
with him, as the person to whom UN commanders on the ground are answerable,
will still be necessary.
Last year, the concern of UN commanders for the safety of their troops was
one of the main inhibiting factors. Now, it seems, that factor has changed
sides. General Jean Cot, the overall Unprofor commander, and General Sir
Michael Rose, the commander in Bosnia, both favour a tougher line to restore
some credibility to their mandate. They see air strikes, or at least the
credible threat of them, as a useful, perhaps even essential, element in
that strategy. Nato's excuses for not acting, if its bluff is called, are
running out.
One familiar excuse has reappeared, in the shape of strong protests from
Russia. But western governments can hardly allow good relations with Russia,
however desirable in themselves, to be their only objective. And Russia, for
its part, should consider the effect on western and Moslem public opinion if
it appears to aid and abet the Serbs in a policy of starvation, massacre and
conquest.
Maximum confusion
So the Serbs would be unwise to call Nato's bluff, and the signs are they
are not going to - at least not directly or immediately. They have promised
to move their guns and observe a ceasefire. But they are masters of
prevarication. (Remember their symbolic but tactically meaningless
withdrawal from Mount Igman last August.) It would be altogether in
character for them to move some weapons, invite Unprofor to take 'control'
of others in circumstances which make UN soldiers effectively their
hostages, and then accuse the Bosnian government either of breaking the
ceasefire or of concealing some of its own weapons, or both, so creating
maximum confusion. It is equally likely they will increase the pressure
elsewhere in Bosnia, most obviously on the Canadian garrison at Srebrenica.
Relief of the Canadians by a Dutch contingent had been proceeding more or
less smoothly. It seems incredible that Nato's latest decisions make no
mention of this, nor of opening the airport at Tuzla, the two specific
demands made by the Nato summit exactly a month ago. If Nato had a strategy
in Bosnia it should have reiterated these two demands and made them subject
to the same deadline. The airport at Tuzla, especially, offers the only real
hope of relief for suffering civilians in central Bosnia and thus also the
only hope of restoring credibility to the entire UN operation - as the
letter on the opposite page, from the Oxfam representative there, points
out. It is also crucial to any strategy for maintaining even part of Bosnia
as a viable state under government control, which must be the centrepiece of
all peace plans and mediation efforts.
But Nato does not have a strategy. It has only a spasmodic reflex of
reacting to events under public pressure.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Governance and the Asians
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few doubt that the world economy's centre of gravity is shifting away from
the members of the OECD club towards the fast-growing countries of east and
south-east Asia. There is also a broad consensus that Europe is a high-cost
region which will have to change its ways to adapt to a novel distribution
of economic growth. More difficult is to decide which ways have to change.
Where corporate governance is concerned, is one model likely to be better
than another in coping with the shock of adjusting to the Asian competitive
challenge?
In an interim report entitled Tomorrow's Company, a team put together by
Britain's quaintly named but influential Royal Society for the encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) is critical of the Anglo-Saxon
tendency to define business success in terms of a single 'bottom line'.
While acknowledging the importance of profit, the RSA, which involved 25 of
Britain's top companies in the study, seeks a wider definition of business
success. It puts a case for a version of the stakeholder approach, which has
more in common with the German and Japanese corporate cultures than those of
the English-speaking world.
Important internal and external relationships such as those with employees,
customers and suppliers, as well as investors, are identified as being
fundamental to competitive performance. And the report calls for the
development of non-financial performance targets, as well as corporate
reporting on all stakeholder relationships.
Not new
While this is not new, it is certainly ahead of current boardroom thinking
in much of British industry and commerce. Whether it is right is harder to
judge. While it is tempting to identify correlations between successful
macro-economic performance and systems of corporate governance, the
causality is vague. Nor are styles of corporate governance readily
transplanted from one country to another.
The strength of the German system of insider corporate control in today's
context is that it permits companies to increase expenditure on R&amp;D and
employee training when they are undergoing restructuring, while cutting
dividends. By contrast, in the Anglo-Saxon system, where outside
shareholders have a much less firm commitment to support the company through
difficult times, the dividend tends to be sacrosanct whereas investment is
not. Implicit contracts between the company and its stakeholders are all too
easily broken under the discipline of hostile takeovers.
Big changes
That said, systems like the German or Japanese, where big changes in
corporate direction have to command support or even agreement throughout the
organisation, are cumbersome. A successful response to the Asian challenge
lies in facilitating rather than postponing structural adjustment. Labour
market flexibility is thus a prerequisite. All the signs are that Europe's
highest-cost producer, Germany, is struggling to overcome the handicap of
labour market rigidities that have contributed to social cohesion in the
past, but now inhibit economic growth. Meanwhile, Japan's ability to adjust
its employment practices to the requirements of fast-changing economic
circumstances appears dependent on the length and depth of its present
recession. It is unable to make significant changes without shock
treat-ment.
The merit of the RSA's approach, in this context, is that it acknowledges
the importance of human capital and the need to inspire people to new levels
of skill and creativity; also the inability of conventional accounting to
capture such things. But a foolproof methodology for measuring non-financial
performance may prove elusive. That is a tough test for the final report.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sparring partners in a new game: Economic and political
upheavals make today's US-Japan summit unpredictable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the good old days BC (Before Clinton), there used to be a comfortable
ritual to annual US-Japanese summits. American congressmen would rant and
rave about Japanese trade practices, and perhaps do violence to some
Japanese product on the lawns of the Capitol; US negotiators would talk
tough in the pursuit of processes known by acronyms, such as MOSS or SII,
whose letters mean less with the passing years; and a Japanese prime
minister would arrive gift-laden, with an economic stimulus package here, or
a trade concession there, to be told by the US president, concerned above
all with cold war geopolitics, that the US had no more important bilateral
relationship in the world than with Japan. He would then go back to Tokyo to
bask in the warm glow of a Ron-Yasu or George-Toshi friendship, secure in
the knowledge that, whatever enemies existed in America, there was a firm
protector in the White House.
No more. There has never been a less predictable US-Japanese summit than
that scheduled today between Mr Morohiro Hosokawa and President Bill
Clinton. Their common political lineage - a pair of progressive regional
governors now intent on reforming their nations against entrenched
opposition - is itself an unusual ingredient: none of the Liberal Democratic
prime ministers who presided over the Japanese system for 38 years can be
said to have come from a stable comparable to his US presidential
counterpart.
Now all the old economic and political certitudes are in question. Japan is
in the throes of a political revolution, the outcome of which is unclear.
But it is definitely stuck in the third year of an economic recession. The
US, in contrast, is in the third year of expansion and is flexing its
economic muscle on the global commercial stage. It no longer looks at
Japanese achievements with envy, devising ways of protecting US industry
from tidal waves of Japanese products.
Instead, under the banner of open markets, the US seems more determined than
ever before to extract from Japan significant changes in the way it goes
about its own business at home. Criticised though this US approach may be in
classical free trade and academic circles, it is pursued by clear-headed,
hard-nosed negotiators, with a taste for brinkmanship. Most have minimal
prior experience of Japan but all are flushed with the successes of the
Nafta and Uruguay Round agreements and enjoy the full confidence of the
president, a majority in Congress and the support of a preponderance of
business and labour leaders.
The pre-summit perspectives from Tokyo and Washington reflect these changed
circumstances. The Japanese message is that foreign pressure still helps get
things done in Tokyo, but much less than it used to. The US reading is that
nothing less than measurable results will count.
This is not to say that the summit will result in abject failure. Mr
Hosokawa, no doubt relieved to get away from his domestic political tangle
for a few days, will obligingly promise Mr Clinton much of what he wants on
deregulation, tax cuts, government spending and reductions in barriers to
imports. This alone could furnish a sufficiently acceptable veneer for the
president and prime minister to sell to their domestic markets.
Mr Clinton might even be pleasantly surprised that Mr Hosokawa has had to
defer plans for a rise in sales tax, criticised by the US as an unnecessary
damper on Japanese consumer spending. But that is thanks to resignation
threats from the Social Democratic party, the biggest and prickliest member
of Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, rather than Washington's menaces.
Beyond this point, however, Mr Clinton will find his Japanese visitor more
obdurate than might be expected in one hanging on to power by his finger
nails. In fact, the Japanese coalition's disarray obliges Mr Hosokawa to
take a rigid line against US pressure for numerically measured decreases in
Japan's record trade surplus and increases in the market share of imported
goods.
Opposition to numerical targets is one of the very few things that - almost
 -unites an otherwise fragmented Japanese establishment. All members of Mr
Hosokawa's diverse coalition, stretching from the far left to the religious
right, want him to say no to targets. The opposition Liberal Democratic
party agrees - and Mr Hosokawa now depends increasingly on its co-operation.
But the strongest opponent of targets is the finance ministry, whose power
has been greatly increased by the destruction of the LDP's authority and its
replacement by the weak and fragmented coalition. On this issue the finance
ministry has an unlikely ally in its one-time rival, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, weakened by internal arguments and unable
to stand up to its bigger neighbour in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall.
On the surface, Japan's point against numerical targets is economic. A free
market cannot be rigged, and Tokyo cannot abandon deregulation to suit the
special interests of a trading partner, the well-rehearsed argument goes.
Accepting targets would amount to admitting the so-called 'revisionist'
argument popular in the US, that Japan is so different from other
industrialised countries that foreign pressure is the only way to bring
change. Moreover, last July's economic accord between Mr Clinton and former
prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa spoke only of a 'highly significant' cut in
the trade surplus and 'quantitative' measures.
Yet under the surface, the argument denotes a change from an old generation
that alternated between aggression and subservience to the US, to a new one
able to take a consistent, independent line. Mr Hosokawa symbolises that
change. At 55, he is a generation younger than most former LDP prime
ministers. His straight-talking style goes down well with the Japanese
public and with Mr Clinton - even if it upsets some coalition partners.
'Nakasone and Miyazawa were the only LDP prime ministers that could deal
with Washington intelligently, without being stubbornly pro-US,' says a
former Japanese foreign ministry mandarin. 'But even they were affected by
the US Occupation. Hosokawa doesn't suffer from this,' he adds.
'This is not the Japan that can say No,' says a senior Miti negotiator,
referring to a nationalistic book of the same title by Shintaro Ishihara, a
maverick LDP member. 'Now it is time for us to say No sometimes and then
make counter-proposals.'
In this case, the counter-proposal emerging in the Tokyo bureaucracy over
the past few days is for a system to monitor imports, measured on past
criteria, but with no commitments. The idea owes something to former
vice-president Walter Mondale, the new US ambassador in Tokyo, whose
moderate proposal for non-binding indicators has won respect in
Kasumigaseki. Whether the final agreement looks like that is another matter.
'We don't trust them with numbers and they don't trust us without numbers,'
says the Miti negotiator.
Japan's generation change is, however, gradual. US pressure has, in some
ways, advanced not only Washington's but also Tokyo's interests in the past
few chaotic weeks. It made possible the last-minute clinching of a Y15,250bn
(Dollars 141bn) package of tax cuts and government spending. The US may
since have dismissed the package as modest and too concerned with the short
term, but the impending summit did focus the minds of Mr Hosokawa's fragile
and bickering coalition.
US pressure has also helped Mr Hosokawa pursue his deregulation drive
against entrenched interests in an increasingly powerful government
bureaucracy and a small business community whose taste for protection has
been sharpened by recession. Accordingly, officials see no real difficulties
in agreeing on three of the four priority sectors in the talks to enact last
year's US-Japan framework economic agreement: insurance, and government
procurement in medical equipment and telecommunications. The government
wants to deregulate these sectors, irrespective of the US. The fourth, cars
and car components, is more difficult as government influence there is
weaker than in the other three, argue officials.
Accordingly, Mr Hosokawa will tell Mr Clinton talks on US car exports to
Japan should be left to industry associations, not officials. Even here, the
US can expect some kind of a deal, following the appointment of the
diplomatic Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the chairman of Toyota, as new boss of the
Keidanren business federation. At 68, he belongs to the pro-Washington
generation. He opposes US demands for numerically measured increases in
market share, yet he does not want to harm relations with the US, if only
for the sake of his company's joint venture with General Motors.
The US position, in contrast, appears both less subtle and more solid. Its
equally well-rehearsed argument, in the words of Mickey Kantor, the trade
representative, is that 'Japan's markets are closed by any measure you may
choose'. No trade agreement in the last 20 years has reduced the Japanese
trade surplus (it was Dollars 59bn with the US last year) or increased its
propensity to import.
Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the treasury, says the US approach, with
both a macro-economic and sectoral focus, is predicated on the fact that
'Japan is out of step with the rest of the industrialised world'. The charge
of managed trade, he says, is 'a canard - it is not managed trade to ask
that Japan deregulate its insurance and pension fund management markets'.
The US is merely insisting on 'the eligibility to compete', not demanding a
predetermined share of any given market.
This suggests, again, some small wiggle room for compromise on the vexed
issue of numerical targets in the four sectors under negotiation, especially
the three where Japanese government procurement and regulation most impinge.
In any case, Mr Kantor insists that the US has never asked for 'one
numerical target'. But these sectors are merely the first wave of a process
which the US sees stretching out indefinitely. 'I reject the 'turn the other
cheek' philosophy,' Larry Summers, the Treasury undersecretary, told the
Washington Post this week. 'If we do that, we will never have any political
constituency in favour of keeping our own markets open.'
This constituency - the US Congress - has been, by its standards, relatively
quiet towards Japan of late. This is partly because of other preoccupations.
But Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, warned the other day
that, even though he thought the legislature should not take narrowly
targeted action against specific countries, it was within its prerogatives
to pass additional 'process' bills. These would permit the US to take
retaliatory action against countries deemed to have unfair commercial
practices. Mr Kantor, for one, has shown no reluctance to threaten to invoke
such laws.
On balance, there is no intent to humiliate Mr Hosokawa in Washington, as Mr
Miyazawa arguably was last April, just three months before he lost office.
But the US side has been watching Japan's unfolding political dramas with
acute interest, if tinged with suspicion. According to Mr Kantor and Mr
Bowman Cutter, the presidential adviser, the prime minister represents the
forces of progress, at least in contrast to Tokyo's bureaucratic mandarins,
because of his clear commitment to deregulation. If his political condition
is fragile, Mr Kantor goes on, 'we're trying to strengthen it'.
On non-economic and non-trade issues, which do still exist in the bilateral
relationship after the cold war, President Clinton may do the same,
including assuring Mr Hosokawa of the continuing US security involvement in
the region. There are clear areas of co-operation and common interest with
respect to North Korea's nuclear potential, while the two leaders have
plenty to discuss about China, Cambodia and other global issues.
The president might even note, approvingly, one remarkable development in
Japan's involvement in the wider non-commercial world. Two of its citizens -
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, and Mr Yasushi Akashi,
the UN special envoy - are playing leading roles in Bosnia, a distant
country in which Japan has no direct stake.
At the end of the day, Mr Clinton may even intone the magic words about
Japan's importance to the US. But his meaning will be different because
American expectations of Japan have changed. So have Japan's expectations of
itself.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bonus to let doctors sleep in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER VOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To add a twist to recent correspondence on GPs' working hours (Letters,
February 5/6), l would like to suggest an improvement to benefit both
doctors and patients. Why not introduce a no-claims bonus system by which
patients who have made fewest calls on the doctor in the previous year are
given a priority on choice of appointment times? Perhaps for busy people, a
special early morning reserved slot could be introduced. Naturally,
night-time calls would lead to rapid loss of bonus points. Genuine
emergencies would be unaffected, provided the doctor agreed with the need
for an emergency call after attending the patient.
Now that most practices are computerised, this system should be relatively
easy to run, with perhaps three priority categories for patients.

FT  11 FEB 94 / The FT Interview: Wily moves by grand master - President
Leonid Kravchuk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was delivering an impassioned warning
about the consequences of a war between his country and Russia when an aide
interrupted him: 'Chancellor Kohl is on the telephone, Mr President.' Mr
Kravchuk wrapped up his sentence with the words 'nuclear nightmare', shook
his lacquered white helmet of hair and was gone.
A telephone call from the German chancellor is one sign of the international
attention being paid to Ukraine. Another is Mr Kravchuk's forthcoming visit
to the US, which has been moved forward from March 16 to March 3.
Ukraine is in the spotlight because various factors - resurgent nationalism
in Russia, last month's victory for Russian separatists in Ukraine's
breakaway Crimean peninsular, and economic collapse - have converged over
the past few weeks. Many observers, from the CIA to Britain's Royal United
Services Institute, a defence think-tank, have come to a worrying consensus
that 'a probable conflict' is looming between Ukraine and Russia.
Mr Kravchuk, the first democratically elected president in the 1,000-year
history of this nation of 53m, makes clear that the effects of war would be
widespread. 'Remember that Ukraine still has 176 nuclear missiles and that
Russia has three times as many,' he told the FT yesterday. 'Let no one
imagine that if a war were to explode between two such countries, he could
be somehow immune to the nuclear poison that would be released.'
For Ukraine, keeping the peace with Russia is a particularly tricky
balancing act. On one hand, as Mr Kravchuk repeats again and again, Ukraine
is eager to have 'good neighbourly relations with Russia', which is, after
all, its single biggest trading partner. On the other hand, he is equally
emphatic that Ukraine will not surrender a single inch of sovereignty.
'I repeat again what I have from the very beginning: I will never take a
single step in the direction of reducing Ukrainian independence. I will
never change my position on this issue,' Mr Kravchuk insisted in the
cultivated Ukrainian which he pointedly speaks at all public appearances.
This deep-seated commitment to independence, which is shared even by the
Russified and Russian-speaking members of the Ukrainian elete, is why Mr
Kravchuk rejects the steps neighbouring Belarus has taken to ensure friendly
relations with Russia - rejoining the rouble zone and re-entering Russia's
foreign policy sphere of influence.
Although Ukraine's inflation rate of 80 per cent in December gives some
indication of how rocky Kiev's road to independence has been, Mr Kravchuk is
adamant that the Belarussian route 'is not a resolution of the problem. It
is a just a return of the old ways.' Worryingly, economic chaos is prompting
a similar desire for reintegration with Russia in Crimea and eastern
Ukraine.
Walking the tightrope between friendly relations and reabsorption is a task
to which the wily Mr Kravchuk is perhaps particularly well suited. Since
1991, when he underwent a conversion from communist ideologue to nationalist
leader, Mr Kravchuk has won a certain notoriety as a man who has elevated
vacillation into a political philosophy.
Now the politician who prides himself on his ranking as a chess Grand Master
believes he has discovered a move which will help Ukraine maintain its
precarious geopolitical balance - a strong relationship with the west. Mr
Kravchuk's opening gambit came last month when he signed a historic
tripartite agreement with the US and Russia, under which Ukraine pledged to
give up all its nuclear weapons. He succeeded in an even more difficult move
last week, when he persuaded Ukrainian parliamentarians - many of whom
greeted the initial agreement with cries of treason and calls for
impeachment - to remove obstacles to ratification of the accord.
Mr Kravchuk and US diplomats in Kiev, who are effusive in their praise of
the president's 'remarkable political skills', say the nuclear issue is
decided. They believe Ukraine will surrender all its nuclear weapons and Mr
Kravchuk himself thinks it is just a matter of time - perhaps later this
month - before the Ukrainian parliament joins the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
But the president has not orchestrated this newly amenable stance on the
nuclear issue without expecting something in return. In addition to upwards
of Dollars 1bn, which Ukraine is slated to receive from a company sponsored
by the US government for the enriched uranium in its nuclear warheads, Mr
Kravchuk is also counting on massive western assistance for the economic
reforms he believes are crucial.
'We have no alternative but the market,' he says with the zeal of a convert.
'Without economic reforms Ukraine as a state will not survive.'
Heart-warming words, but when asked to name a target monthly inflation rate
for December 1994, Mr Kravchuk says he would be happy with 50 per cent.
While this would be an improvement over December's figure, it is hardly
likely to be what the International Monetary Fund team, due to arrive in
Kiev on Sunday, has in mind.
Just as he hopes to find a narrow middle road in his relations with Russia,
Mr Kravchuk is searching for a path towards economic therapy without the
shock. He says the Ukrainian National Bank cannot stop printing money
because 'that would stop the entire economy', yet he wants to stabilise the
currency, the Ukrainian coupon, and speaks of introducing a harder national
currency this year.
To bridge the gap between the market reforms that he would like to get under
way and the social stability he is intent on maintaining, he is counting on
hefty aid from the west. 'We will need a stabilising fund of between Dollars
3bn and Dollars 4bn to introduce our new currency,' he says.
Mr Roman Shpek, the young, urbane minister of the economy charged with
conducting negotiations with the IMF, said Ukraine would like a 'bridge
loan' of Dollars 300m from the US, a Dollars 700m 'systemic transformation
loan' from the IMF, and Dollars 400m for sectoral reform from the World
Bank.
In future conversations with the German chancellor, and when he visits
Washington, Mr Kravchuk will perhaps try to explain that a few billion
dollars are a small price to pay if the alternative is war between Ukraine
and Russia. But if he fails to persuade the west to give him money, as
Russia's experience suggests he might, it is hard to imagine what sort of
gambit Mr Kravchuk could devise next to preserve his country's independence.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A lesson in the need for capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON J BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a certain irony in your article 'Equip us for competitiveness'
(Management: The Growing Business, February 8), concerning the visits which
our association organised for Treasury officials to see for themselves the
need for high-tech investment by small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the very day of the visits, a leading British machine tool manufacturer,
FMT Holdings, with technology and expertise in advance of US and European
competitors and equal to any technology employed by the Japanese, was being
forced into receivership by a lack of working capital which prevented it
from taking advantage of any upturn in business.
The company manufactured the kind of state-of-the-art technology in which UK
companies should be investing to remain competitive - but are not doing so,
especially in the SME bracket.
There is a serious lesson in this for the banks and the government in that,
having weathered such a long and deep recession, we are finding many
examples of companies which are falling short of working capital, or which
are unable to raise the finance for the crucial investment they need to make
to improve their prospects for new business and markets.
The message which came over very clearly from the companies visited by the
Treasury is that UK industry has an opportunity for growth which it has not
had for more than a generation. Such an opportunity can only occur if the
investment in competitive technology follows. It is an opportunity that must
not be missed through lack of finance.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I did not state, as you report (February 10), that 'tax increases in
April will not harm the recovery'. What I said was 'tax increases in April
will not halt recovery' - quite a crucial difference.
I acknowledged that the economy might not grow as rapidly as it seems to
have done in the last quarter of 1993. But I also argued that analysis of
past large tax increases in 1967-68, 1973-74 and 1981-82 did not suggest a
slowdown in consumer spending was inevitable if the savings ratio fell.
Our forecast for 1994 envisages growth of 2.5 per cent, taking the impact of
the budget tax increases into account.

<TEXT>
If the succession of British political scandals bewilders you and perhaps
makes you nauseous, clutch two simple handrails. One: no general election
need be held before April 1997. The Conservatives may have overstayed their
welcome, but they are not about to depart. Two: as in the US, political
discourse has become muddied by an obsession with private behaviour. The
word 'morality', which should mean an awareness of the difference between
right and wrong in all spheres of life, is treated as if it applies only to
the realm of the senses.
Let us take these statements in reverse order. Senses first. Look around. In
developed democracies the sale of titillation is more than merely a
by-product of prosperity. It is of the essence in a free-market,
individualistic, open society in which religious observance has declined and
traditional social structures have begun to wither away. Life is longer than
ever. There is not always enough to do. Time is filled by contemplating a
bewilderingly copious selection of temptations. The growing mountain of
goods and services must be sold retail, a task that is most easily
accomplished by appealing to the supposed desires, or the easily stimulated
imaginations, of jaded consumers. We need not linger long over the endless
list of examples. Just let us say Haagen-Dasz ice-cream, fast cars graced by
fast women, holidays for romance, Jaffas for warm sunshine. Those should
suffice.
There is, however, one significant and relatively recent addition,
comprising an entire category of products. Entertainment, which is a highly
profitable sub-sector of the increasingly dominant information industry,
constantly massages our subconscious minds with images that Freud would not
have had the audacity to conceive, and Kraft-Ebing might not have believed.
We see the results on film, in videos and on TV. We may wring our hands, but
we keep our eyes and ears wide open. We await with nervous eagerness the
advent of unified electronic devices, virtual reality, armchair shopping,
love on a microchip. We cannot be surprised if in such circumstances a
section of the media has replicated the Roman circus, with real victims.
On both sides of the Atlantic, writers and broadcasters manufacture and
peddle cruel and salacious gossip about individual politicians. Some of it
is even true. Relevant or not, it is the stuff of commerce, at least in
Britain and the US. The precise configuration varies, but titillation is a
hot seller everywhere in the west. In most continental European countries
tittle-tattle about government ministers may not sell as well as stories
about stars of sport or showbusiness. French or German late-night TV amazes
British visitors who are unprepared for it. In the US the trade in political
gossip has changed, for the worse. Nothing was said in public about
President John Kennedy's behaviour during his lifetime; today everything is
surmised about President Bill Clinton's private life. Perhaps it has
something to do with feminism.
In Britain the victims of journo-porn are well-known: Diana, Charles,
Parkinson, Mellor, Caithness, Norris, Milligan. Each is a special case. For
every name there is a self-interested, puffed-up 'justification'. What all
have in common is that someone's reputation has become the stuff of a
lucrative trade. Maligning it has sold newspapers, enlarged TV audiences.
The peculiarly British elements of this traffic in tortured souls need not
detain us. The point is that none of it should have anything to do with
politics. Links between private behaviour and public competence or
acceptability are indeed made, often by a gullible public, but that is
everyone's loss.
Things that really matter are subjected to an excess of reticence, not its
absence. This week the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler has appeared
before the Scott inquiry into the sale of armament-manufacturing equipment
to Iraq. One question before Lord Justice Scott is whether ministers misled
Parliament about the sales; another challenges the issuance by ministers of
'public interest immunity certificates'. To use Sir Robin's definition,
these 'put in the hands of the court the decision whether the information
covered by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence'. Withholding
the information might have led to the unjust imprisonment of the defendants
in the Matrix Churchill trial.
The straightforward approach would be to confess that there has been
hocus-pocus, and to defend it on the ground that selling arms is not a
business that would be successful if managed by nuns. Sir Robin issued a
statement castigating the press for what he believed to be wild allegations
based on what has been said at the inquiry; in particular to the depiction
of immunity certificates as 'gagging orders'. What would you call them?
So far as can be told, Sir Robin is a decent official. He is, however,
running a system whose decency is no longer self-evident. As I understand
it, he is a proponent of the civil service doctrine that, where needs
dictate, only part of the truth about a particular matter need be told. This
thesis is not new. It long predates the present cabinet secretary. British
officials are not only economical with the truth; they are positively
parsimonious. They rarely lie, perhaps never. Instead, most of them
instinctively avoid complete candour. Lord Justice Scott has been invited to
tell us whether in the Matrix Churchill case they played this ancient game
according to its indefinable rules. With luck, he will tell us whether the
game should be played at all.
His report could have more effect on the Conservatives' fortunes than the
latest surge of scandal-mongering. Comparisons are made with the last days
of Harold Macmillan's government, when the Conservatives were rotting on the
vine. The principal victim was John Profumo, who lied to the House of
Commons. He resigned in June 1963; the election followed in October 1964.
Labour won, by a whisker. If history repeated itself in, say, June or July
1995, the Tories would probably lose. Barring a rush of blood to the prime
minister's head, or an unprecedented rash of by-elections resulting in the
loss of the government's majority, there is little chance of a contest
before 1996. This week's character assassination should mean nothing now; it
will certainly mean nothing then.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opening Tuzla airport is vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDY CHADWICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just returned from Tuzla in central Bosnia where I work for
Oxfam, and I was struck by the force of your editorial, 'Something must be
done' (February 7). You are right, I believe, to pinpoint the reopening of
Tuzla airport as the most important action that the UN could take at this
time.
If decisive action is not taken to defend civilians in all of the safe areas
(including Sarajevo and Tuzla) and to ensure relief supplies get through,
then the relief effort will collapse. At present the greatest danger to aid
workers is from angry and frustrated civilians who perceive that the UN is
weak, ineffective or biased. It is time governments made plain that the UN
can be strong, effective and impartial in its delivery of humanitarian
relief.
The plight of civilians in Tuzla is severe. Although it is nominally a 'safe
area', an effective blockade allows only 20 per cent of food needs to be
provided. A single egg costs Pounds 1. As in Sarajevo, sporadic shelling is
a tactic designed to catch people unawares and in the open and therefore
cause maximum civilian casualties.
Not only will reopening Tuzla airport relieve immediate suffering, but it
would also help restore the battered reputation of the UN throughout former
Yugoslavia. The UN should immediately announce that, by a set date, Tuzla
airport must be opened to relief flights. The UN must state that that
objective and deadline are non-negotiable. What can be negotiated are
measures to ensure that all parties can be satisfied that only relief
supplies will be flown in.
Once the deadline is passed, General Sir Michael Rose must, as your
editorial makes plain, reopen the airport and be able to call on close air
support from Nato to defend aid flights.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Managers must earn their options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANGUS W MATHESON and MR DAVID M SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Attention continues to focus on share options as a means of motivating
company management, the size of reward such options can generate and whether
shareholders can reasonably expect that such reward is related directly to
the underlying financial performance of the company in question.
It is perhaps worth restating, therefore, the purpose behind the joint
statement last summer by the National Association of Pension Funds and the
Association of British Insurers on executive share schemes and performance.
Investors quite reasonably encourage management to achieve sustained
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the companies in
which they have invested. The statement by the two associations promotes
that aim. It recognises that performance requirements may need to be
tailored to the circumstances of an individual company. For this reason, the
statement makes quite clear that it is for the remuneration committees to
determine the most appropriate criteria to measure management performance.
Linking the exercise of options to the achievement of sustained underlying
financial performance by a company must be in the best long-term interests
of both the company and its long-term shareholders. If shareholders
understand the basis on which the chosen criteria have been set, they will
understand and appreciate the effort and achievement of the management in
question.
The joint statement is not prescriptive and it is encouraging that companies
are increasingly acknowledging the desirability of relating the significant
returns that can be realised from executive share options to a sustained
level of performance by the management in question and not simply the
general level of share prices from time to time.

Sir, Certain points in your article ('Fly in Jo'burg soup', February 9) need
clarification. I was prepared to cancel the lunch if the ANC refused to
attend because of Nigel Bruce's presence. The ANC knew this, as did Bruce.
Bruce communicated only once with Pallo Jordan on the matter. He expressed
his regret and also withdrew from the lunch. The olive branch was not
extended to secure a place at a lunch, it was extended to heal a
relationship.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: ENO to invest in new productions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English National Opera has decided to invest its way out of its
financial problems. The new general director, Dennis Marks, believes that
only by freshening up the repertoire with new productions can he raise
audiences and attack an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.4m, and an annual
deficit of around Pounds 500,000.
In the 1994-1995 season the number of new productions is to be increased
from six to eight. There will be two new 'core' operas, Tosca and Don
Giovanni; two newcomers to the ENO repertoire, Mussorgsky's Khovanschina and
Massenet's Don Quichotte, plus Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny; and two British
works, Tippett's King Priam and Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Finally
there will be a UK premiere for Schnittke's Life with an Idiot.
The policy will be paid for by economies which will mean redundancies; and a
New Stages Appeal this season to raise Pounds 250,000.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: A living picture of Hinduism - Patricia Morison finds
much more than sacred cows at the British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hinduism is not well understood in the west, even though many of its
individual features are familiar. One thinks of sacred cows, many-armed
dancing gods, Hari Krishna, titillating stories of tantric excesses, TV
epics and yogis who stand for years on one leg. The difficulty most people
have is fitting these colourful elements into a coherent picture of the
everyday religion of modern India.
For Deities and Devotion at the British Museum, Richard Blurton, its curator
of oriental antiquities, has trawled the Museum's magnificent resources of
Hindu art, and borrowed some others - in particular from the scandalously
inaccessible hoard in the Victorian and Albert Museum. His aim is simple and
admirably achieved: to explain and 'demystify' Hinduism.
By the end of this century, Blurton points out, the Indian population will
outstrip China's. Since the majority of Indians are Hindus, it behoves us
all to form a picture of Hinduism as a living, evolving faith - although the
resurgence of intolerant, militant Hindu fundamentalism is rather
overlooked.
It is a beautiful show; but, more importantly, it sets out examples of Hindu
devotional art, ancient and modern, to teach the essentials of the religion.
The gallery looks stunning in red and saffron yellow, a remarkable
improvement on the BM's customary boring world of grey and white. I
particularly liked the calligraphy by Sehmi Satwinder of Alphabet Soups.
An exceptionally large quantity of Indian paintings is on view, lit dimly to
protect them but brilliantly colourful. In the first section introducing the
principal gods, there is a series of miniatures from Rajasthan of around
1800 depicting Vishnu in his ten orthodox incarnations. Here we find
battling Rama of the Ramayana epic, playful Krishna, and Buddha, an example
of a historical individual subsumed into the pantheon. Few of us would
identify the splendid white parade-horse with a parasol attached to his
saddle as the last incarnation of Vishnu as horse-headed Kalki, as he is yet
to show himself.
Cruder images of gods abound from all over India; on comics, palm-leaf
books, on the scrolls used by professional story-tellers, and on cheap and
cheerful prints sold to pilgrims. The textiles are gorgeous and two in
particular. An enormous 17th-century silk cloth made in Assam is cunningly
woven with little images and text describing Vishnu's incarnations. Until
last year it was in storage at the Museum of Mankind, misclassified as
Thibetan.
As for a painted cotton hanging from Rajasthan, the BM should have it copied
and put into production. On a sky-blue ground five rows of spritely white
cows advancing towards each other, three to a side. Their horns and humps
are coloured orange in honour of the festival which marks Krishna's erotic
encounter with the milkmaids, or gopi.
Instead of the gopi, the cows are being urged on by images of a turbanned
figure, the 15th-century holy man, Vallabhacharya. His devotion to Krishna
helped push him into the first league of gods. At the same time but in a
different corner of India, a holy man called Chaitanya founded the Hari
Krishna sect whose accolytes now jingle their way along Oxford Street.
So one learns from Richard Blurton's helpful and attractively illustrated
book, Hindu Art (British Museum Press, Pounds 14.95). Vallabhacharya's
followers in Rajasthan have a tradition of making marvellous temple hangings
like the cow-cloth, because they believe Krishna must live as elegantly and
comfortably as possible. Their personal aim is 'to live as full a material
life as possible', making this one Indian sect FT readers might like to
explore further.
By the end of Deities and Devotions, we have learned a lot. We have been
introduced to some dozen gods, from amiable elephant-headed Ganesh to Kali
the Destroyer and Jagganatha of Puri, whose festival car gave us the word
juggernaut. Photographs and exhibits have evoked pilgrimages, rural
religion, temple architecture, the rituals of worship, and Hinduism today.
Crucially, we have learned about the concept of darshan, the supreme moment
of devotion when the Hindu believer makes eye-contact with the image of the
god enshrined in the inner sanctum of the temple. Darshan is represented in
the centre of the exhibition, in the adoring gaze fixed by a statue of
Nandi, Shiva's patiently waiting bull-mount, on his master.
Shiva is here represented by an extremely fine 15th-century statue of him as
teacher, but by this point we have understood something of the many faces
and paradoxes of Shiva. He is both auspicious and inauspicious, male and
female, represented as linga and yoni, which is to say phallus and vulva,
the god of ecstasy and of transcendance. In this statue, his face is benign,
and under his foot he treads the dwarf who symbolises Ignorance.
It was such an image which Diderot misunderstood to show a god who tore
apart young children. This exhibition stands in an honourable tradition of
dispelling ignorance and bringing Indian religion to a wider public.
Until April 19, sponsored by Bajaj Auto, Birla Technical Services and
Mukand.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: Luscombe goes solo - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We give too little honour to certain supporting actors. It is a rare artist
who, in the tiny role of Moth, gives the most definitive performance in
Love's Labour's Lost: which is precisely what Christopher Luscombe has been
doing in the RSC's current production at Stratford. Likewise in The Merchant
of Venice his Launcelot Gobbo is outstanding. Luscombe makes line after line
register with new impact, and lends a sharper focus to every scene in which
he belongs.
Alas, the RSC is not the ensemble it once was. How come the company employs
artists like Luscombe on the one hand, and certain desperately unready and
misguided supporting actors on the other, is a puzzle. An altogether simpler
pleasure may be had from watching Luscombe solo in Half Time, a one-man show
he has co-devised with his fellow-actor Richard Bonneville, and which is
currently being presented at the Donmar Warehouse, late night at weekends.
The title Half Time is a multiple pun on the word 'half', for the show's
first half occurs at a Cambridge college during an alumni reunion while the
students are away (in 'the half'), and the second half occurs backstage
while actors are preparing (in 'the half') before a performance of Hamlet.
In 90 minutes, Luscombe plays nine characters, of both sexes and of all
classes, making only the merest adjustments to his one basic outfit,
perfectly gauging in every case the accent, vocal tone, and emotional lows
and highs. Each character is presented as if talking to Luscombe himself;
who plays all of them with a remarkable blend of malice and compassion.
Take the Master's suave-voiced upper-class wife: 'You're our Thesbian' (sic)
'of the evening? . . . Have you got a job? . . . A proper job? . . . Done
any television? . . . Have you met David Attenborough at all? . . . He was
at prep school with the Master.' Awfully gracious, she is more dowdy and
provincial than she knows. But it is her behaviour to her dog that is the
real giveaway: it induces the only flash of real energy she ever shows. More
in body language than in parlance, Luscombe invests this sourly
condescending lady with a dash of real pathos and loneliness.
And Luscombe reveals each character in physical as well as vocal terms.
Wonderful how, as the slow and self-important old college porter, he
creakily bends and kneels to find a register book (and then forgets to pick
it up as he heaves himself up again). Or how, as the young actor ('Sexpot')
who plays Rosencrantz and is having an affair with the cast's Gertrude, he
carefully adjusts the ghastly little tuft of hair he has sticking out
through a gap in the baseball cap.
By such details, Luscombe brings to life more than just individual
characters. You sense the atmospheres of different rooms, various
relationships, and the mental climate of each milieu. Meanwhile each
situation keeps getting funnier. Hamlet, apparently, is set in Art Deco
scenery; and a voice over the tannoy says, 'Everyone get ready for the first
court scene, please. Dancers, stand by for the charleston.' Meanwhile, the
college's befuddled old senior tutor has arranged to see Jurassic Park a
second time rather than suffer through the entertainment being presented to
the alumni by - yes - Luscombe.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: Marvellous Mukhamedov - Clement Crisp finds this
dancer in excellent form at Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheers - and several more than three - for Irek Mukhamedov in his short
season at Sadler's Wells: for his dancing (which is stunning), for his
colleagues (well chosen, gifted, and on best form), and for his enterprise
(which in these hard times might have seemed foolhardy).
Like many Russian dancers, he knows that the public wants to see stars, not
just in a formal opera house repertory, but showing off their gifts in more
relaxed fashion, and simply showing off. Thus his first sorties in 1992/3
with a concert group, here and in Europe, reliant upon the drawing power of
his name, of course, but encouraging new works and giving fresh
opportunities to his colleagues in the Royal Ballet. Now he has brought a
programme to Sadler's Wells for four nights, and its opening performance on
Wednesday was excellently judged, and cheered to the echo.
A second purpose to the evening was also evident: Mukhamedov's need for new
roles, valid settings for gifts which are unrivalled today. MacMillan gave
him two tremendous ballets, and Mukhamedov has claimed almost everything
else he has danced here as his own, by right of genius. So he has inspired a
new Othello from Kim Brandstrup, and this forms the first and most
significant part of the programme.
Brandstrup has used his favoured collaborators: Ian Dearden for music
(synthesised, atmospheric); Craig Givens for design (a grand setting of
massive pillars; long dresses for the women that swirl and move exquisitely;
simple period costume for the men); Tina MacHugh for lighting (intensely
responsive to the action).
Brandstrup's choreography for the early scenes is like a commentary on the
narrative. It is characteristically clear, restrained, and slightly too
uniform in tone. We know what is happening, but the charting of events is
more illustrative than illuminating. It is when jealousy takes hold, when
Brandstrup and Mukhamedov show us Othello's torment, that the dance claims
its rightful identity as a language and not as accompaniment to some
existing action. Once exposition is done - Brandstrup might edit with
advantage - the tragedy takes its headlong course on dance terms.
Brandstrup's Arc Dance company provide a touching Desdemona (Leesa Phillips)
and an insinuating Iago (Daniel Belton), but the work is Mukhamedov's and
his Moor is a tremendous study of anguish. For the earliest moments there is
an innocence to his reading which is very sympathetic; as the mood darkens,
so does Mukhamedov's playing, and he brings off the killing of Desdemona and
Othello's remorse with a tense, heart-tearing power. The portrait is
harrowing, true. Its setting is handsome.
The rest of the evening might be considered as Beecham-esque lollipops, but
these were of the best quality, and rather less familiar than is usual.
Mukhamedov and Miyako Yoshida nipped through the Balanchine Tarantella in
happy fashion, and then Leesa Phillips and Paul Liburd performed Darshan
Singh Bhuller's sinuous erotic raga Interlock, first seen with London
Contemporary Dance, with bodies entwined, bodies seeming one body. Some
entwining also came in two Argentine Tangos, by Juan Carlos Copes, danced
with a nice and mocking wit by Maria Mukhamedova (whom we remember as a
character soloist with the Bolshoi) and her husband.
Very welcome, too, a new duet by Michael Corder for Lesley Collier and Paul
Chalmer. Piano music by Poulenc; Corder's musical sensibility and stylish
way with steps; Lesley Collier at her most elegant, and Chalmer a ideal
partner - these made for a dance lyric whose discretion did not disguise its
emotional force. Collier's dancing is now all virtues: watching her we see
grace of means, purity of manner, the academic language beautifully nuanced.
She is our most rewarding ballerina.
Maria Mukhamedova also appeared in a pretty solo from the Russian repertory:
Kasyan Goleizovsky's Russian dance. A Tchaikovsky melody, Mukhamedova in
long dress and kokoshnik head-dress, with the beguiling skill, that only
Bolshoi dancers possess, to show the charm of the piece. And as the
statutory closing fireworks, Mukhamedov and Yoshida in Diana and Actaeon. It
is the pas de deux with which Mukhamedov first came to fame. He brings to it
now a grandeur of scale - the Wells stage is far, far too small for him -
and a bravura which are the stuff of legend. He also brings to it
distinguished schooling: the tricks are never cheap, the technique is
superbly sure. Yoshida darts and spins with uncanny ease: together the
couple make roaring good sense of it. The audience, very properly, roars for
more.
The Mukhamedov season continues at Sadler's Wells until February 12.

Perhaps the UN ought to have designated a Day Of The Family rather than a
Year: those not sick to death of the family before the year began are pretty
sure to be by the time television has finished with it. Today C4 begins
Faces Of The Family, a series in which Mavis Nicholson interviews various
members of one extended family. She begins with Pauline Crabbe, a black
social worker who is on her third husband. Clearly an expert (8.00).
With television nothing succeeds like excess. Last Friday Alexei Sayle was
the main guest on The Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller, a conjuring show
(10.30 C4). Yesterday BBC2 gave us 'The All New Alexei Sayle Show'. At 8.50
this evening BBC1 brings us Drive with Alexei Sayle telling us how to make
the roads safer. Then, at 9.30, BBC2 gets Alexei Sayle to launch the BBC
Design Awards 1994. Why not just give him John Birt's job and have done with
it.
BBC2 ends its rerun of Series 1 of Red Dwarf at 9.00. Then, at 10.00 BBC2
repeats an unforgettable episode of Blackadder II.

By being unmasked as a guilty party in triggering peptic ulcers - as a
bacterium, H pylori can be killed by antibiotics, which are much cheaper
than existing ulcer treatments.
This week, the US National Institutes of Health, a federal body based near
Washington DC, decided the evidence that H pylori at least partly caused
ulcers was so strong that doctors should alter their prescribing habits.
This is a radical change from the traditional view that excess stomach acid,
produced by a variety of disorders including stress and smoking, causes
ulcers. The traditional treatment is a class of drugs called H antagonists
which interfere with the acid-producing mechanisms of the body.
Since about 25m people in the US alone will suffer from ulcers at some time
in their lives, ulcer treatment is a multi-billion dollar industry. Zantac,
made by Glaxo of the UK, has been the world's best-selling drug since the
mid-1980s and now has sales of more than Pounds 2bn a year. Tagamet, from
Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham, was formerly the world leader but sales
are declining rapidly as its patents run out.
All is far from lost for H antagonist makers in the wake of the NIH
recommendations. H pylori is not present in all ulcer sufferers and is found
in some healthy people. So doctors will test for it only in patients who
already have ulcers and will administer both the traditional treatment (to
cure the ulcer) and an antibiotic (to get rid of the cause).
Once the cause has gone, there is a sharply reduced risk of relapse, and
therein lies the rub for the drug companies: some 25 per cent of Zantac
sales are in 'maintenance therapy' designed to prevent a relapse, according
to analysts at Lehman Brothers.
If the result of the NIH report is that doctors increasingly abandon
maintenance therapy, Glaxo is facing the stressful prospect of losing up to
Pounds 500m a year in sales.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology: Let the lifeblood flow freely - Ericsson's
approach to research and development has lessons for the rest of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lars Ramqvist, the chief executive of Ericsson, has some incisive words to
say about the power of innovation. He also has plenty of hard-won experience
to back them up. In a nutshell, they are: invest to the utmost in developing
new products or services, forget about short-term profits and be willing to
take risks.
Compelling though these points are, companies often ignore them, especially
in Europe. Yet innovation is the lifeblood of industry, creating growth and
jobs. If the Swedish telecommunications group had not accelerated its
spending on new products in 1991 at the expense of earnings and dividend
growth, Ramqvist says, 'we would not be sitting here'. Not surprisingly, it
was a move the group's US shareholders, who hold 40 per cent of the equity,
found it hard to accept.
Ramqvist, a 54-year-old physicist and chemist, has been chosen to deliver
next Tuesday's 1994 Innovation Lecture in London, partly sponsored by the
UK's Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British
Industry. Last week in Stockholm, he explained why he thought Ericsson's
recent history held some important lessons for his audience.
Some of his views are not likely to be palatable to UK executives, although
the lecture will be couched in diplomatic rather than provocative language.
Ramqvist admires the US approach to innovation, with its creativity,
flexibility and willingness to take chances, but does not think enough
people in Britain have yet got the message.
'In the UK, I have the impression, I'm sorry to say, that you have been
extremely good at the first part of innovation - a lot of innovations were
made in Britain - but you never managed fully to make them an industrial
success,' he says. The UK has been weaker in the final stages of innovation
by failing to commercialise many ideas.
'You have been too prudent, too logical, you've done everything
step-by-step. But in the end, the world has moved faster.' Clearly, that
charge does not apply to all companies. But it is no secret - and patent and
R&amp;D statistics back this up - that Britain lags behind much of the
industrialised world and that Europe as a whole is behind the US and Japan.
Ericsson's single-minded approach to innovation, which meant spending 15
times more on R&amp;D than on dividends, was risky in the tough, fast-moving
telecoms market. 'We only had one bullet in the gun, one shot - in mobile
communications,' Ramqvist says. 'Because of the enormous spending, if we had
missed on any aspect - microelectronics, the market niches or the timing -
we would have been a dead duck.' As it turned out, Ericsson hit the target.
It developed new products - a third of its orders are for products less than
two years old - and yesterday announced pre-tax profits for 1993 of SKr3.1bn
(Pounds 265m), more than double those of 1992.
But the struggle to compete by bringing new products to the market more
cheaply and more rapidly is by no means over. It never will be, Ramqvist
says: 'Innovation has no end.' This is part of the message he will bring to
his London audience. Innovation, he will stress, is both continuous and
involves a number of activities at once - in research, development,
production and marketing.
Ramqvist uses the vogue term 'concurrent engineering' to describe what this
means and the challenges it involves.
It takes around 15 months to develop a new microelectronics system and 12
months to order and install specially designed manufacturing equipment. So
production engineers must be closely involved from the start. 'If they were
waiting for the silicon (chip) guys, it would take 2 1/2 years.' The
software developers, of which Ericsson has 10,000, also need to be brought
into the process early. 'They want to see a chip in only a few weeks. They
can't sit and wait.' By following this method, Ericsson has saved time and
money and brought its products out much more quickly than before. Four years
ago, the time from order to delivery for one of its AXE switching systems
was six months; now, it is 10 days.
Today, Ericsson has a 40 per cent share of the world market for mobile phone
systems and one of over 50 per cent in digital cellular equipment. It is up
against competitors such as Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany, Motorola
and AT&amp;T of the US and Canada's Northern Telecom. Thus Ericsson will not be
able to let up on the pace of its R&amp;D spending, totalling Kr13bn last year,
20 per cent of sales (double the rate of its competitors) and more than
double the level of five years ago.
Of course, Ericsson is favoured by the fact that voting control is in the
hands of long-term shareholders, the Wallenberg family and Svenska
Handelsbanken. Thus when Ramqvist stresses the importance of risk capital,
he is speaking from a basis of loyal shareholder support, something not all
companies enjoy to the same degree.
Ericsson does not do everything right, as Ramqvist admits. Its move into
office equipment in the 1980s was a costly failure. And it was late in
cutting costs, notes Tim Hirst, telecommunications analyst with Kleinwort
Benson. But Hirst admires the company's investment drive, initiated at a
time of dwindling profits. 'They stuck to their guns and spent money on
their product, although they were going through a difficult time.'
Ramqvist sees no let-up yet in the pace of development spending. Ericsson is
working hard on new systems for the next generation of multimedia
communications combining sound and vision, where the computer and
telecommunications industries converge: 'We need new technology in the
network, we need better and faster switches, we need powerful transmission
networks.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / People: GRE picks Robins from Willis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, is breaking new ground by
appointing its new chief executive, John Robins, from outside the group.
Robins, who is 54, is joining GRE from Willis Corroon, the insurance broker,
where he has been group financial director since 1984. Before that he had
spent most of his career in the food industry (at Fitch Lovell) and shoe
businesses (at Bally Group). He replaces Sid Hopkins, 62, who will retire in
August this year after completing 46 years with the group.
'The whole approach to the chief executive position has changed,' explains
Keith Lugden, director of corporate communications, who says proven skills
in management are now seen as more important qualifications for GRE's senior
positions than expertise in insurance. GRE made its first senior appointment
from outside the insurance industry when James Morley was made finance
director in 1990.
Robins leaves Willis at the end of March; he will be replaced by Richard
Dalzell.

'decriminalised'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
People who think their passport photo makes them look like a criminal rather
than a tourist will be pleased to know that Societe Francaise de
Technologies (Soft), of Pleuhiden, France, has come up with a high-tech
photo booth which claims to produce a far more flattering photo.
To begin with the client chooses his or her 'best side' by looking at
possible shots on television mini-screens. The absence of a flash means the
model will not look startled. And because the photo is produced by
chemical-free thermal imaging the photos emerge from the machine dry, and so
do not stick together. Soft: France, 96 83 29 49.

<TEXT>
In the US colour photocopying is being adapted to replace traditional
silk-screening to print images on everything from T-shirts to boxer shorts.
The Xerox Digital Textile Imaging service (XDTI) feeds images - generated on
a PC screen or from any paper source - through a Xerox copier and prints
them on to special transfer paper. The paper copy is then sent to the XDTI
production centre near Seattle, where the images are heat-transferred on to
the textile items.
The printed image has a resolution of 400 dots-per-inch, compared with an
average of 80 dots-per-inch for silk screen printing. It also eliminates the
need for multiple screens and inks. Xerox: US, 716 423 5090.

abnormalities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pregnant women in Europe and East Asia could be offered a blood test as
early as this autumn to determine definitively whether the child has genetic
abnormalities. The new probes, developed by Aprogenex, of Houston, work on a
simple blood sample removed from the mother's arm.
One probe identifies the foetal cells by their RNA, a unique marker showing
which genes are active in the cell. RNA can be used to differentiate between
two cells in the same person, where the DNA is identical - an eye cell and a
hair cell, for example.
Further probes then check the chromosomes on the foetal cells for
abnormalities. Aprogenex: US, 713 748 5114.

One million dollars (Pounds 650,000), one of the largest medical prizes, is
to be given by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York for the development of
a low-cost and easy-to-use diagnostic test for two sexually transmitted
diseases, gonorrhoea and chlamydia.
Applicants must develop a test for use in the developing countries, where
there is neither refrigeration nor electricity. The operators of the scheme
believe the test will also be widely used for screening in the developed
world. Rockefeller Foundation: US, 212 869 8500.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Computers consume more than 5 per cent of all industrial energy. Now, Korean
electronics company Samsung has developed a range of screens that, the
company says, reduce energy use by 70 per cent.
The screens, the most power-hungry element of the PC, include a power
management system operating at four levels: on, standby, suspend and off.
When the machine is not used it moves into standby mode and the screen is
switched off, reducing power consumption by up to 30 per cent. If unused for
longer, the machine moves into suspend mode, when the main components also
switch off, reducing power consumption by 85 per cent. This could prove
particularly effective with people who forget to switch their PCs off
overnight. Samsung: Korea, 822 727 7114; UK, 081 974 2782.

The publisher Hodder Headline has appointed Malcolm Edwards, 43, as a

two operational roles; managing director of the company's Australian wing
and chairman of its New Zealand subsidiary. Edwards is leaving his job as
managing director of HarperCollins' subsidiary in South Africa, where he has
spent most of his career.
Headline was founded in 1986 by Tim Hely-Hutchinson and two collaborators
but merged last year with Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Paul Coley, the company's
finance director, explains that Hodder Headline alighted on Edwards largely
as a result of HarperCollins' South African outpost having handled Hodder
Headline's books on an agency basis. The Australian and New Zealand
operations, he says, are the most important non-UK operations for the
company.

FT  11 FEB 94 / People: CISCO challenge for Morris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City Group for Smaller Companies, known by the acronym CISCO, has
appointed Katie Morris, 39, as its new chief executive. She will replace
Richard Balarkas, one of CISCO's co-founders, who will be joining Barclays
de Zoete Wedd.
Morris, most recently with UBS, will take on the role just as the group
debates whether or not it should form an exchange for smaller,
entrepreneurial companies that would compete with the Stock Exchange. Morris
is well acquainted with the Stock Exchange, having been seconded for a year
to its ill-fated Taurus project for paperless settlement. 'I'm not afraid to
put my head above the parapet,' Morris says.
She may have to. In December, the Stock Exchange put on ice a proposal from
one of its own working parties, which included several Cisco members; this
recommended that the Exchange operate the new exchange itself, though it
said it was not sure that demand exists.
Cisco argues that there is overwhelming evidence of demand and that one way
or another, a new exchange will be formed. Of course, Morris says: 'It would
clearly be so much better to run the market under the supervision of the
Stock Exchange.'

profits growth.
He will work with current managing director Jean-Baptiste Tefra as a
part-time consultant before taking over later this year. Tefra is returning
to parent group La Redoute, the French mail order group which acquired
Empire in May 1991, although Empire says he will retain active links with

FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: China's new wave - The growth in multinationals'
Chinese ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of foreign companies have tested the Chinese water with a joint
venture or two. The China wave, however, is moving fast as many companies
learn from their experience, decide they are seriously committed, and
examine how to proceed.
Stephen Shaw and Johannes Meier, in the latest McKinsey Quarterly, say it is
too early to develop a set of broadly applicable best practices for
companies wishing to expand their Chinese operations. But their survey of
companies with ventures in China does reveal a pattern in 'second
generation' ventures. They also suggest that some advice often given to
companies may already be out of date.
One factor separating the first and second generations is the amount of
money they are committing. Companies still experimenting have an exposure of
an average Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) and plan to raise this to Dollars 50m
by 1997. Those at the stage of accepting the many frustrations of doing
business in China have already invested an average Dollars 50m and plan to
increase their exposure to Dollars 200m within three years.
'No longer is experimentation the goal; the new objective is to build and
hold a dominant share of the Chinese market, and to pre-empt, if possible,
entry by other multinational corporations - and, very importantly, to do so
while making good money along the way,' write Shaw and Meier.
The Chinese economic infrastructure is so poor that getting bigger
necessitates more ventures rather than larger factories and a national
distribution network. Second-generation investors have at least four
ventures, and some are into double figures. If you want to dominate in one
particular industry, you need to establish links with producers spread
around the country.
The usual 'know-your-partner' guidelines for new entrants mean
time-consuming negotiations with many parties. But the McKinsey writers
suggest that experienced companies are increasing their clout, which reduces
the need to find complementary objectives with each partner.
'The value added by local operating partners is usually quite low to begin
with and steadily declines over time,' they say. Instead, companies are
forging relationships with the 'mother-in-law' - the commissions and bureaux
which stand above Chinese companies. 'These potential mothers-in-law
represent the best route to the permissions, tax concessions, 'locked-in'
customers, and central funding they need.'
Some companies, such as AT&amp;T and Northern Telecom, have signed agreements
with the ultimate mother-in-law, the State Planning Commission. More typical
will be relationships with the ministry or bureau overseeing an industry.
The McKinsey authors note two ways in which companies are mitigating
organisational complexities.
First, keep product and marketing strategies simple: concentrate on products
with proven success around the world and tailor them for the Chinese as
little as possible. Most companies have focused on the three leading urban
markets of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing and have kept their production
facilities in as few places as possible. But they are increasingly seeking
to build their own sales forces and distribution networks.
Second, the Chinese government has begun to allow foreign companies with
several ventures to set up an 'umbrella' enterprise which helps them to
co-ordinate the activities and to appoint senior managers to oversee Chinese
operations.
The purchasing power of Chinese consumers has soared. The market is huge and
offers good returns. Shaw and Meier conclude that for those multinational
corporations 'that are not yet second generation players, being left behind
has become a real and urgent risk'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Property: Bargain buys in Europe - Renewed interest by
investors suggests that the market may be turning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where are the best opportunities in Europe for property investors? After the
uplift in the UK property market, investors are watching the continent for
signs that other markets are emerging from recession.
Cross-border investment activity is still at a low ebb - except for the UK
where the property market attracted overseas investment totalling Pounds
2.2bn in 1993, with Germans leading the way.
Many advisers believe that pan-European investment will pick up this year.
'As markets move to the bottom of their cycle there will be clear
opportunities during the year, ahead of an economic upswing, to do business
at extremely attractive prices,' says Jones Lang Wootton, chartered
surveyors. Dutch and German investors, together with some UK investment
funds, are likely to set the pace, it says.
Mr Richard Mully, managing director in charge of European real estate for
Bankers Trust, reports strong interest from so called 'bottom-fishers' -
investors willing to buy properties with serious problems such as letting
difficulties, if the price is sufficiently low. In some instances, prices
have fallen by 80 per cent. 'Bottom-fishers', which include US funds, are
showing particular interest in Paris, Madrid, Milan and Portugal.
The carrot for prospective investors is the prospect of buying at close to
the bottom of one of the deepest property recessions in recent memory.
Average capital values of prime offices in Europe's 14 largest property
markets have fallen by a third from their peak in March 1991, according to
Jones Lang Wootton. Property values are now at their lowest levels in real
terms since 1986.
The case for renewed investment is largely based on the prospect of further
interest rate falls across Europe and property's relatively high investment
yields.
Against this there are problems in the letting market. Rents are falling and
vacancy rates are rising in most markets. Since tenants on the continent
generally sign short leases, investors cannot achieve the same security of
income as in the UK, where leases run for 25 years.
Footloose investors may be tempted to look beyond Europe. In particular,
parts of the US are attracting attention as the economy continues its
expansion. Germans, the biggest overseas investors in the UK last year, are
'likely to shift from the London market to North America during the course
of this year',according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors.
Within the main European markets, investors face a choice of cities with
varying prospects. In Brussels, the presence of the European Commission has
insulated the city's commercial market from the worst of the downturn
affecting other continental markets.
Belgium's recession and European Union expenditure controls may soon end
this immunity. Vacancy rates have increased to about 8 per cent from a low
of about 3 per cent in 1989, while rents fell by 15 per cent and capital
values slumped by 13 per cent over the past year.
However, falling interest rates have stimulated new activity in the
investment market, which nearly doubled in 1993 to about BFr30bn.
In Paris's central business district, rents have fallen by some 30 per cent.
Capital values have dropped by an estimated 44 per cent from the market's
peak in 1990, according to Jones Lang Wootton. However, the investment
market has remained stagnant as vendors have refused to accept reduced
values.
In Germany, demand has been weak, although some activity is beginning to
return to the Frankfurt office sector, which is likely to benefit from the
establishment of the European Monetary Institute in the city.
In spite of the downturn in the letting market in Germany, the investment
sector has remained strong, as lower interest rates have increased
property's attractions compared with bonds and equities.
In Italy, both capital and rental values of Milanese offices have fallen by
up to a third, according to Jones Lang Wootton.
The investment market has been inactive, but with interest rates at their
lowest level for 17 years, property deals by domestic investors may soon
pick up. Foreign investors, however, are likely to be deterred by Italy's
political uncertainties.
In Spain, rents have fallen by about half since their peak in 1990-91. This
has encouraged some investors to conclude that the market is through the
worst of its downturn. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley reports that the
investment market will not pick up until sellers are prepared to be more
flexible on prices.
One of the largest investment deals in recent years was struck in Madrid
last month when Fomenta de Construcciones y Contratas, one of Spain's
largest private corporations, bought a portfolio of office buildings and
retail centres for Dollars 350m. The price paid per square metre -
Pta400,000 - was about a third of the portfolio's estimated peak value two
years ago. In the Netherlands, take-up has fallen, vacancy rates have risen
and rental levels could come under pressure this year. The investment market
has been quiet, but the emergence of a positive yield gap could encourage
investors to return to the market. The UK economy is now growing faster than
most other EU competitors, fuelling hopes that the rental market will begin
to stabilise over the next 12 months. These hopes, together with sharp falls
in bond and equity yields have fuelled a strong recovery in the investment
market.
It is not clear how far the overseas-led revival in demand for London office
property will be repeated in other European cities as they emerge from
recession. The liquidity and size of the London market, the city's
prominence as an international business centre, together with security of
income derived from long leases, make the UK capital a prime target for
foreign funds.
Recovery in the continental markets may not be so pronounced or rapid as
that of London. Nonetheless the interest being displayed by international
investors for pockets of Europe's property markets suggests that the turning
point of the cycle may be near.
'There are opportunities for investors to buy at yields which are
historically high,' says Mr Mully of Bankers Trust. 'I think it is the first
sign that investors are anticipating recovery.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: How to join an 'inclusive' club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies must abandon their obsession with the financial 'bottom line'.
They should develop reciprocal rather than 'power-based' relationships with
customers and suppliers. And they will have to be clearer about their
purpose and values.
Coming from a run-of-the-mill management consultancy such prescriptions
would hardly appear startling. As some of the conclusions of a group of
senior executives from 25 leading UK businesses, however, they are likely to
make many people sit up.
The Inquiry into Tomorrow's Company - whose interim report was published in
London yesterday - was established just over a year ago by the Royal Society
for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce. Besides the active
participation of companies spanning the industrial, service and financial
sectors - British Gas, Cable and Wireless, NM Rothschild and Manpower to
name but four - the project has attracted the interest and support of
luminaries like Sir Adrian Cadbury, Sir John Harvey-Jones and Charles Handy.
Yesterday's 35-page document* charts the relatively poor performance of the
UK in an increasingly competitive global market and sets out the team's
preliminary criteria for future survival and success.
On the authors' own admission little of the analysis is new. Its purpose,
however, is to highlight the gap between talk and action, underline the
competitive threat to those who fail to take note, and stimulate further
debate in the UK and elsewhere.
The main thesis is that the successful company of the future will have to
adopt an 'inclusive' approach. This means that relationships with all its
'stakeholders' - customers, suppliers, employees, investors and the
communities in which it operates - have to be nurtured and developed.
An important focus for the inquiry will be finding ways to measure the
effectiveness of these relationships, so that companies are well informed
about the associated costs and benefits when they are in conflict.
Other features of the 'inclusive' approach are consistency of message and a
recognition of interdependence.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: Nationality should still count
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this age of affaires sans frontieres, a company's nationality of
ownership no longer matters. For a manufacturer, what counts is where it
carries out its research, development and production. So long as it does not
concentrate these activities in its home base, but disperses them across
several countries, it can be at least as good an owner of enterprises in
those countries as a local parent. It will often prove a better one, since
it brings extra scale, skills and synergy.
That, in essence, has been the welcoming reaction of most enlightened
politicians, economists and journalists to BMW's bold snatching of Rover
from under the nose of the latter's Japanese parent-in-all-but-name, Honda.
Their reaction is more right than wrong, but nevertheless simplistic. So was
last week's declaration by Michael Heseltine, the UK's trade and industry
secretary, that 'ownership is unimportant'.
The reality is that, in many cases, nationality of ownership still matters
considerably - but not always in the way people think. It should not matter,
and eventually may cease to, but not for decades.
It is true that manufacturers of all nationalities have erected production
plants all over Europe, America and Asia. But, contrary to the fashionable
wisdom promulgated by influential academics such as Robert Reich - now US
labour secretary - it is still the exception rather than the rule for higher
value-adding activities, especially design, development and engineering, to
be equally dispersed across borders. For various reasons, most German
enterprises are especially loath to do this.
The truly 'transnational' company - what Reich calls a 'global web' - with
high added value activities situated almost regardless of its headquarters
nation - is the ideal corporate animal of the future from several points of
view, but it is still a rare breed.
At present, except in companies such as ABB, Unilever, Hewlett-Packard, and
a few chemicals giants, most units outside the home country direct their
activities only at local or at best regional markets - they do not serve the
world. This privilege is generally left to units at home, be that in Japan,
the US or Europe.
As for the establishment of research units around the world, this brings
multinationals much publicity, but is usually less significant than it
looks.
With a few exceptions, most Japanese 'R&amp;D' laboratories in the US and Europe
are off-line labs serving the home base - where the real added value is
done. Nissan's European technical centre is an exception, doing design and
development work which is integrated closely with the company's UK and
Spanish plants.
Nor is senior managerial decision-making usually as dispersed as the
location of a company's physical facilities might suggest.
This is true not just of most Japanese multinationals, but also of many
European ones, as Jim Hamill of Strathclyde University suggested in the FT
on Monday.
In relatively few multinationals has the headquarters of even a single
business division yet been transferred, or otherwise established, outside
the home country. Yet this is a test of true 'transnationality'. In a few
cases such moves have been reversed, and power clawed back home again.
The net result is that, in most companies - including the majority of German
ones - the home country still benefits from an overwhelming 'headquarters
effect': an unusually high concentration of technical skills and senior
decision-takers. This is true even of a long-standing 'good international
corporate citizen' such as IBM.
In these circumstances the question of nationality may still weigh heavily
for the managers - and, in an ideal world unlike Rover's, the shareholders -
of a company confronting a takeover from abroad.
When Rowntree, the UK chocolate maker, was faced with contested bids in
1988, both happened to be Swiss. It chose the right one: from Nestle, which
has treated it with respect, whereas it would almost certainly have been
swamped by its alternative Swiss suitor, Suchard, which now has an American
parent, Philip Morris.
In Rover's case, matters are complicated by the fact that BMW's home base is
closer at hand than Honda's; this will reduce Rover's degree of future
independence. As Ford has found, a company incurs a high cost, but not
necessarily a commensurate benefit in market or organisational terms, if it
operates closely-linked design and development activities in countries as
near as Germany and Britain.
There will be considerable pressures over time within BMW-Rover to
rationalise activity on to one site or other, as there have been at Ford.
So, despite the reassurances that BMW has given, and the lower cost of doing
design and engineering in Britain, a gradual seepage of highly skilled work
to Germany is likely.
The situation is made more sensitive by the fact that BMW's nationality is
more Bavarian than German - a far from fine distinction. Hardly anyone seems
to have made the - for Britain, ominous - connection with the current
controversy about where Audi, the Bavarian-based luxury offshoot of
Volkswagen, should locate a new plant.
Last weekend the Bavarian prime minister's office said it would do
everything in its power to have the car built in the state, rather than
elsewhere in Germany or in Belgium.
For Rover, the best defence against external pressures of that kind, as well
as internal ones within BMW, would be to persuade Honda to remain its
minority parent. As companies such as the UK's Crosfield Electronics have
found, it can do wonders for one's independence if one has two parents
rather than one - especially if they have different nationalities.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Roof bolts cleared in mine fall probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bilsthorpe Colliery accident last August in which three miners were
killed was not caused by any defect in its roof-bolting system, according to
a report into the accident published yesterday by the Health and Safety
Executive.
The roof fall at the Nottinghamshire site occurred in a roadway being driven
through coal close to an exhausted area - a practice known in the industry
as 'skin-to-skin' working.
The report said the roof fall was caused by rock movement 'probably'
triggered by 'the relatively high rate of advance of the working in the
roadway'. It recommends stopping 'skin-to-skin' working.
It exonerates the use of roof-bolts at Bilsthorpe, even suggesting their
presence may have helped men to escape from the rock fall.
Mr John Rimington, HSE director-general, said the accident had 'not been
reasonably foreseeable'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Pressure on Sinn Fein stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments will press ahead urgently with the talks
process intended to bring an overall political settlement in Ulster, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
The odds on peace were shortening and the terrorists were running out of
time as they confronted the 'irreversible will of the people' for peace, he
said.
Sir Patrick was addressing the Association of American Correspondents in
London, the day after meeting Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, in the first of a series of individual meetings with the
parties to discuss ideas for a political settlement. Today he will meet Dr
John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, although no date has yet been
set for a meeting with Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party.
Sir Patrick's speech formed part of the continuing effort to maintain the
pressure on Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street declaration.
He stressed that there was 'no daylight' between the two governments on the
joint declaration and warned those who had so far refused to join efforts to
find a settlement that they could join the process or stay out. 'But they
cannot halt it,' he added.
Both sides have said Sinn Fein should make its decision on the declaration
known by the time of its annual conference in two weeks' time. Sinn Fein
officials, however, are playing down suggestions that any decision will be
made by then or during the conference.
Attacking the recent visit to the US by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president,
Sir Patrick said that those who justified the killing of Irish people 'may
be lionised briefly, albeit damagingly, abroad', but the people of Ireland
wanted an end to violence.
Sir Patrick reiterated the determination of both governments not to
renegotiate the joint declaration, which he said had 'no recommended
shelf-life'. It ruled nothing out, he said, including 'a united Ireland, the
union maintained', or any other formula. Britain, he said, did not aim to
frustrate any particular outcome.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Cost of training turns Wayne's world on its head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wayne Law spent years as a builder but always wanted to be a hairdresser.
Last year he decided to stop waiting - so wound up his business and sold his
home.
That, he decided, was the quickest way to gain a qualification. Joining a
government-financed training course would have meant waiting six months. If
he had accepted unemployment benefit he would have have been barred from a
full-time course because the unemployed are expected to be available for
work.
By selling his home and moving to rented accommodation Mr Law was able to
finance the Pounds 4,700 cost of a nine-month course at a private training
centre in London. 'I wanted to take control of my own life,' said
34-year-old Mr Law. 'I am not the sort of person to take unemployment
benefit and just sit back.'
He is one of a growing number of people prepared to take drastic action to
secure qualifications. Keith Bulmer is still employed as a painter and
decorator, but spends most of his time off in college. Every Thursday he
joins a small huddle of students swapping notes at Newham Community College
in east London.
They are the people who might have missed the previous week's session or
were only able to reach the day-long course after completing shift work.
Several of the course's participants are working full-time like Mr Bulmer
and paying for their training in their own time - because their employers
have declined to pay, in spite of doing so in the past.
Mr Bulmer and his three friends on the course all work for Newham council.
Their employer paid for two years part-time study for the Ordinary National
Certificate (ONC) in building studies, but declined last September to fund
the higher qualification.
'The council did not give us a reason for not giving us time off,' said Mr
Bulmer, 28. 'I guess they cannot afford it or else they fear we will try and
get new jobs when we have better skills.'
Local authorities are among many employers who have cut back on part-time
further education courses. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said:
'There has been a significant cut-back in training and development budgets
in local authorities - particularly metropolitan authorities who have had to
make big cuts in their budgets. Priorities are having to be set.'
For those unable to finance themselves the government provides Career
Development Loans. Established in 1988, the scheme, backed by three banks,
provides interest-free loans of up to Pounds 5,000, which will increase to a
maximum of Pounds 8,000 next year. The loan is interest free for the period
of training and one subsequent month. This is to be raised shortly to six
months.
In 1992-93, 10,000 people took up the loans. 12,500 are forecast to do so in
1993-94 and 20,000 the following year.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Banking plan for low-income families
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office and high street retailers offer the best prospect of
providing basic banking facilities for low-income households, including the
provision of low-cost loans, according to a study carried out for the Social
Security Advisory Committee which was published yesterday.
The service could be made financially viable if social security payments
were made directly into accounts operated by them, the paper says. It should
include a facility to deal with cheques addressed to the payee's account,
and might also have to take in measures to ensure that buying the retailer's
goods was not a condition of providing the service.
The research by the Policy Studies Institute, an independent think-tank,
shows that although one in five households were without a current account,
this was not entirely because people were excluded from banking facilities.
Instead some chose to close their accounts and manage their budget in cash.
Of the households without current accounts, 40 per cent were pensioners, and
a further 40 per cent had incomes of less than Pounds 150 a week. They were
mostly lone parents or people who were unemployed.
Mr Michael Bett, chairman of the committee, which advises the government on
a range of social security matters, welcomed the paper's proposals.
The study noted consumer resistance to the payment of social security
benefits by automated cash transfer - an essential element of the scheme in
order to avoid the need for subsidy. Since it was not clear whether the
problem lay with automatic transfer itself or with the reluctance of people
on benefit to use a bank or building society account, there was a need for
further research, it added.

FT  11 FEB 94 / National Lottery consortium to make only partial bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of the Rainbow consortium, has decided to make
only a partial bid to run the National Lottery.
The consortium, which also includes Mr Richard Wheatly, chairman of Leo
Burnett, the advertising group, has decided that it wants to run only the
instant - or scratch card - part of the lottery. This could account for
anything from a quarter to a third of the lottery revenues - more than
Pounds 1bn.
Rainbow will apply for the main operator's licence - but its bid will
indicate that it intends to sub-contract the main part of the lottery - the
on-line network of computer terminals.
Rainbow said yesterday that Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National
Lottery, had confirmed that such an approach was possible under the rules.
The consortium did, however, have to make its intentions clear about the
on-line part of the business.
Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT industries, said yesterday that splitting the
on-line part from the instant games would generate competition and help
increase the overall sum raised for the five causes that would benefit -
arts, charities, heritage, the millennium fund and sport.
Mr Wheatly said yesterday: 'We don't believe it would necessarily be in the
public interest to see the lottery simply fall into the hands of a single,
all-embracing consortium.'
Monday is the deadline for the submission of bids for the main operator's
licence and at least eight consortia are expected to submit bids.
Rainbow conceded yesterday that it has no agreement with any other
consortium to run the main on-line business or any agreement that it should
run the instant part of anyone's else's operation.
'We wish to differentiate ourselves and play to our strengths,' said Sir
Patrick, who conceded that detailed talks with large corporations to back a
bid to run the entire lottery had come to nothing.
Leo Burnett has considerable experience in marketing charity lotteries and
lotteries in other countries and believes that different skills are needed
to run instant games.
As many as 40,000 outlets are being planned and retailers will be able to
pick up packs of cards from cash-and-carry outlets.
As many as 4m prizes a week would be available through the scratch cards
with a top prize of at least Pounds 75,000. In addition, main prize winners
could become eligible for a prize that could be as much as Pounds 1m a
month.
Meanwhile IBM UK, the technology partner in Mr Richard Branson's UK Lottery
Foundation bid, said yesterday that it would offer an early launch date and
could launch an on-line lottery as early as this November.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Fall in employer-funded education worries CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry and education organisations said
yesterday they were disappointed at figures which showed that employers have
cut sharply the number of workers they send on further education courses.
The figures came at the same time as others which showed that employees who
want extra training were resorting to paying for classes themselves, and
were often using holiday time to attend them.
The Department of Employment is to work with the Further Education Training
Council, which supplied the figures, to try to explain why employers are not
taking up part-time training places.
The number of part-time students funded by employers has fallen by 7 per
cent - in spite of new financial incentives to do so.
The Confederation of British Industry said it was unhappy with the figures -
but suggested that the decline in employer take-up would prove 'transient'.
Many recruits were staying longer in education and did not attend
day-release schemes when they started work, while the recession had hit
overall recruitment and so the numbers of employees being sent on training
courses.
The Association for Colleges described the take-up from employers as
'disappointing'.
The number of part-time day students funding themselves has risen 16 per
cent in the 1993-94 academic year - more than twice the government target.
Further education colleges were removed from local authority control and
became independent institutions in April last year. Funding council figures
show that the number of full-time students has since increased by 8 per
cent.
But the overall rise in numbers was restricted to 5.1 per cent compared with
a government target of 6.9 per cent. Numbers taking evening classes also
dropped.
Greater London saw the sharpest increase in further education take-up at 9.3
per cent while in East Anglia the increase was only 3.0 per cent.
Employer-led participation dropped 12.9 per cent in Yorkshire and
Humberside, but rose by 4.6 per cent in London.
Mr Tim Boswell, further-education minister, said the overall expansion had
'confounded the doom and gloom merchants', but added that colleges should
make clear to industry that further education could improve business.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Japanese play down wage role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low labour costs are far down the list of reasons for Japanese companies
investing in Britain, according to evidence presented to the Commons
employment committee and published yesterday.
The more important causes for inward investment cited by Japanese
corporations that have invested heavily in Britain in recent years were
availability of government grants and green-field sites, use of English as
the language of international business, political and economic stability,
communications infrastructure and the UK's proximity to the Continent.
A strong emphasis was also placed on flexibility in UK working practices,
the relatively high skills level of British workers and good industrial
relations.
The committee report on the import and export of jobs revealed that:
Toyota, the motor company, told the committee that the company did 'not
consider low wages to be a factor in our investment'. It added: 'What is far
more important is the availability of good people, with the desire to apply
a high level of management and engineering skill.'
Motor company Nissan said it was not concerned with labour costs, nor with
the consequences of the social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht
treaty. 'In our industry labour costs are less than 10 per cent of total
costs,' it said. Sony, the electronics company, cited labour costs as only
10th of 11 reasons why it chose to invest in south Wales.
Both Toshiba electronics and the Honda motor company did not even mention
low labour costs to the committee as a reason for investing.
But MPs do suggest in the report that 'a conflict of evidence' left them in
'some doubt about the relative importance of wage costs'.
Mr Greville Janner, committee chairman, said their division of opinion
reflected the party political affiliations of members - with Conservatives
believing low labour costs were important.

The signs will be installed over a three-year period on the M1, M6, M11,
M25, M40 and M42 motorways as well as on the A1 and A604/A14 between
Cambridge and the M1.
Feasibility studies have shown that benefits in time saved by drivers would

The Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts formally came
to an end yesterday when Mr Richard Slowe, a former barrister, became the
first solicitor to exercise advocacy rights in the High Court.
He appeared before Mr Justice Ferris in the Chancery Division of the High
Court as junior in a business expansion scheme case.
He was one of 32 solicitors whose applications for exemption from the
requirement to take an advocacy course before gaining higher court advocacy
rights was granted by the society yesterday.
The profession got the go-ahead for the change from Lord Mackay, the Lord
Chancellor, and the four senior judges last December.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Wider Customs powers attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour protested yesterday at government proposals to extend Customs
officials' powers of inspection and complained that a planned two-stage
review procedure would not allow companies a fair chance of appeal against
Customs &amp; Excise decisions, Graham Bowley writes.
New proposals in the finance bill would give Customs officials the power to
inspect the books of companies that 'finance or facilitate' businesses
involved in import and export activities.
Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour treasury spokesman, said: 'Banks, lawyers and
accountants would certainly come within this definition. Customs would now
have the right to demand these people breach client confidentiality.'
But Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, said that the move away from the
physical control of goods as they passed the borders towards an audit-based
system in the collection of Customs duties meant that such powers were
necessary to give auditors access to the information they required.
He said such measures already existed for the collection of excise duties
and VAT.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Parents from state schools go private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than half the parents of independent school pupils were educated by the
state, a survey showed yesterday.
The proportion of private school 'first-time buyers' - those educated in
state schools - rose from 41 per cent when a similar survey was carried out
in 1989, to 54 per cent by late last year.
But while private schools appeared to be less socially exclusive, the
report, produced for the Independent Schools Information Service by MORI,
the polling organisation, indicated that they are increasingly becoming the
preserve of the wealthy.
It also revealed that the proportion of parents who 'voted with their feet'
because of dissatisfaction with state schools rose from 21 per cent to 25
per cent since 1989. Implementation of the government's education reforms,
intended to revitalise the state system in England and Wales, began in 1988.
'League tables' of examination results, which have been introduced since
1989, appear to have had little impact on parental choice, with only 15 per
cent of parents citing a school's league ranking as an important factor.
The Department for Education said: 'Many state schools perform just as well
as independent schools. Performance tables provide parents with an
opportunity to compare schools in both sectors and make sensible choices.'
School fees have risen by more than retail price inflation each year since
the last survey. This appears to have affected schools' social composition.
Since 1989, the proportion of families in social class A has risen from 15
per cent to 22 per cent, while representation from the lower classes C, D,
and E has dropped from 37 per cent to 30 per cent.
The proportion of parents making advance financial plans to pay for school
fees increased from 25 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period,
although most - 82 per cent - pay for fees out of salary and other personal
income.
Most parents said they were attracted by independent schools' generally
conservative values - the most important factors were good discipline (named
by 84 per cent), reputation (77 per cent) and small classes (67 per cent).

FT  11 FEB 94 / City warned of big increase in staff turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City institutions have been warned of a big increase in staff turnover this
year. It is expected to rise to 75,000 - or one in four of all employees.
Staff shake-outs and a shift in culture from paternalistic to
performance-based has often been badly handled and left staff morale at 'an
all-time low', a group of City personnel directors adds in a report.
Their comments are coupled with a warning that failures in managing change
could endanger London's position as Europe's premier financial centre during
the next five years. It could decline to being merely the 'first among
equals'.
The report from the London Human Resource Group warns that the City has lost
50,000 jobs in the past three years - the same number that it put on during
the Big Bang period of the mid 1980s. But job numbers are expected to rise
again by 21,000 to 328,000 by 1998, it adds.
The report says that rationalisation is necessary but not sufficient and
that financial services could face the same decline as large parts of
manufacturing. 'This report's recommendations deserve to be studied at the
highest level in every institution,' says Lord Alexander, the chairman of
National Westminster Bank, in the report's foreword.
Staff costs account for between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of company
expenditure and three out of five employees are relatively high-cost
'knowledge workers', characterised by high levels of education,
identification with their craft, and strong individualism. The proportion of
knowledge workers will continue to rise as the number and 'customisation' of
financial products increases. The report, based on a survey involving 358
City institutions, says the number of financial products has increased to
more than 700 from 70 in 1970.
The new performance culture for such knowledge workers, which has produced a
large increase in productivity, includes the buying out of perks and the end
of 'job-for-life' assumptions. But Mr Geoff Tucker, personnel director of
Legal &amp; General, the insurance group, said many job interviews were still
based on the assumption of permanent employment and most pensions were still
based on final salary.
'In some companies we are just getting to the point of basing interviews on
the explicit assumption that people will only be with us for three to five
years,' he said. The report says City institutions will have to offer
training for future employability to such people in exchange for job
security. The report also recommends that companies spell out their core
values, something which only 2 per cent of those surveyed now do.
The main dilemma, says the report, is that City institutions will need to
continue to 're-engineer' themselves and make themselves more flexible while
requiring skills and values which are difficult to develop in a low-trust
climate.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Roof bolts cleared in mine fall probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bilsthorpe Colliery accident last August in which three miners were
killed was not caused by any defect in its roof-bolting system, according to
a report into the accident published yesterday by the Health and Safety
Executive.
The roof fall at the Nottinghamshire site occurred in a roadway being driven
through coal close to an exhausted area. This practice is known in the
industry as 'skin-to-skin' working.
The report said the roof fall was caused by rock movement 'probably'
triggered by 'the relatively high rate of advance of the working in the
roadway'. It recommends stopping 'skin-to-skin' working.
It exonerates the use of roof-bolts at Bilsthorpe, even suggesting their
presence may have helped men to escape from the rock fall.
Mr John Rimington, HSE director-general, said the accident had 'not been
reasonably foreseeable'.
The Health and Safety Commission welcomed the report but added that it was
appointing Sir Bernard Crossland of Queen's University, Belfast, to 'hear
publicly, any new or further views or evidence that may exist'. The
commission will wait for that report before considering further action.
British Coal welcomed the report's findings and said it was already
implementing its recommendations.
'For many years BC has driven similar roadways as that at Bilsthorpe,
particularly in the midlands, without major incident,' said a spokesman.
'All such developments have now been stopped'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity, the biggest of the regional power companies in England
and Wales, is to shed 250 white collar jobs through voluntary severance and
early retirement under a reorganisation plan aimed at cutting costs.
The company, which employs about 5,700 workers, said the reductions, on top
of 2,000 job losses since privatisation three years ago, were in response to
the electricity industry regulator's review of its supply business.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Solicitor breaks the Bar's monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts formally came
to an end yesterday when Mr Richard Slowe, a former barrister, became the
first solicitor to exercise advocacy rights in the High Court, Robert Rice
writes.
Mr Slowe, a partner of City solicitors S J Berwin, appeared before Mr
Justice Ferris in the Chancery Division of the High Court as junior to Mr
Alan Steinfeld QC in a business expansion scheme case.
He was one of 32 solicitors whose applications for exemption from the
requirement to take an advocacy training course before gaining higher court
advocacy rights was granted by the society yesterday.
All 32 have either experience of work in the higher courts as part-time
judges, or have formerly practised as barristers.
Three solicitors were granted audience rights for civil cases only, 16 for
criminal cases only and 13 for both civil and criminal cases.
Mr Walter Merricks, the society's assistant secretary general, said he was
delighted that 'at long last some solicitors will be able to represent their
clients in the higher courts'.
More than 1,000 solicitors had enquired about obtaining rights of audience
in the higher courts since the profession got the go-ahead from the Lord
Chancellor and the four senior judges last December.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Councils unite to save steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A coalition of 24 Tory and Labour-controlled councils will be launched in
the Northamptonshire steel town of Corby today to fight for the survival of
the country's steel industry.
The campaign, to be called SteelAction, will also demand more action from
the government to end subsidies paid to rival foreign industries by their
governments.
The councils, which all have steelworks in their areas, claim that more than
50,000 jobs are at risk - this is more than the number of jobs lost recently
in the coal industry.
Mr Roger Stone, a Rotherham councillor is to be the chair of SteelAction. He
said: 'We have seen one industry after another disappear from Britain, and
we're uniting now to stop the steel industry collapsing in the same way.'
SteelAction Organisers say that the country's steel industry faces pressure
on two fronts. Subsidies paid to competitors in Italy, Spain and Germany put
them at a grave disadvantage, while the continuing over-capacity on the
continental mainland badly affects what is left of the UK industry.
Mr Stone said that the government either had to force the countries still
paying subsidies to stop the payments and to make capacity cuts or it should
give UK producers temporary financial help so that they can survive.
The launch of the coalition comes on the eve of a meeting of Eurofer, which
groups the big European steelmakers, to discuss the industry's restructuring
plans.
Non-aided private companies are holding back from offering capacity until
the European Union takes a tougher line on subsidies.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Employees of BNF given vote go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of British Nuclear Fuels who are also members of Copeland borough
council have been given dispensation by the Department of the Environment to
vote in committees on matters relating to BNF's business.
Last month the council was advised by a QC specialising in local government
law that councillors should not vote on planning applications by their
employer or their spouses' employer.
Nine Copeland councillors who are BNF employees at its Sellafield nuclear
processing plant, and another three whose spouses work for BNF, sought
dispensation. The department has ruled that, provided they declare an
interest, the 12 can vote in committees on applications by BNF or UK Nirex,
the nuclear industry's waste disposal body.
But they are not allowed to vote on these applications at full council
meetings, although they may speak.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Engineering employers seek fresh link with CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Engineering Employers' Federation is making a fresh attempt to cement
ties with the Confederation of British Industry following the scrapping of
their plan to merge central activities.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, the federation's president and acting director-general,
said yesterday that it is looking at a 'close alliance' with the CBI on
areas where they overlap.
It is focusing on overlaps with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council on
issues such as manufacturing representation and policy, and European Union
matters.
Mr Mackenzie said he would be presenting a paper to the federation's council
next week, on entering into a memorandum of understanding with the CBI. This
would draw the EEF into a joint programme of alliance with the council.
The proposal is designed to avoid the same obstacles that tripped up the
original merger plan. The EEF's 14 regional associations opposed the deal
because of worries that the services they receive may no longer be suitable
for engineer-ing companies if the EEF's central functions were merged with
the CBI or the council.
But Mr Mackenzie stressed that the associations would retain their autonomy,
and that the federation would keep control of the services it offers.
The uncertainty over the future of the EEF has delayed the search for a new
director-general since the abrupt resignation of Mr Neil Johnson in the
autumn. However, Mr Mackenzie said the federation was 'here to stay' and
within the past two weeks it had begun searching for a replace-ment.
If Mr Mackenzie's proposal is approved next week, details will then be
worked out. Meanwhile the federation has set up an internal working party to
discuss other areas of potential co-operation with the CBI such as
employment policy.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Promises, promises at gifts' fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 90,000 trade buyers visited the International Spring Fair in
Birmingham to scrutinise the giftware offerings of 4,500 manufacturers,
importers and distributors. Generally, they made the exhibitors more
cheerful than at any time since the start of the recession.
The fair, spread over more than 1m square feet of floorspace at the National
Exhibition Centre, finished yesterday with attendance 14 per cent higher
than last year. There were about 10,000 buyers from overseas, 25 per cent
more than in 1993.
It was the biggest trade fair ever held in the UK, although smaller than a
comparable event held annually in Frankfurt. The goods on display were
mainly designed to attract disposable income, thus making the mood at the
fair dependent on retailers' perceptions of future shopping trends.
Products available ran from air fresheners to yard-of-ale glasses via icing
equipment, diamonds, rocking horses, scarf clips and woks.
Although exhibitors were not predicting a consumer-led economic recovery,
they displayed a confidence about their trading prospects which was a sharp
contrast to the handwringing woe at the 1992 fair.
Ms Francine Black, marketing Alice in Wonderland products for Macmillan, the
publisher, said there had been steady interest. 'It hasn't been a rush. The
last two or three years have been less busy than the 80s.'
But Mr Andrew Gregory, sales manager for Bodum, the Cheltenham-based tea and
coffee-ware maker, had found that 'year on year, this has been better. We've
open far more new accounts. The extra new business generated is up 70 per
cent.'
The fair has offered promise rather than actual trade. 'We've written less
business than ever but I think we have had a better trade fair than ever,'
said Mr Ivan Tonder, whose company makes Cally and Co designer linen.
Visitors have not had the time to devote to giving orders: 'We do the
serious business in the next two months,' he said.
It has been a good year for inquiries. Sutherland Health, importing
cosmetics from Germany under The Nature Shop and the Soap Shop labels and
giving aromatherapy demonstrations, counted 400. Translating those into
business is another question.
But standing sober-suited against the riotous colour of his imported
artificial flowers, Mr Leslie Barnett, chairman of CI Group, was
unambiguous: 'We're very happy. Business has recovered.'

Scottish salmon farmers yesterday urged Whitehall to seek stronger EU action
against Norwegian salmon exports.
They published an analysis by Ernst &amp; Young which says that for five years
the Norwegian salmon farming industry has been receiving a 20 per cent
government subsidy and is bankrolled by the state-owned banking system.
The Scottish farmers say the subsidies encourage Norway to dump salmon on
the EU market, driving down prices and causing severe problems for the
farmers.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Gould renews attack on Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould yesterday renewed his attack on Mr John Smith's leadership of
the Labour party within a day of announcing he was quitting politics to
return to his native New Zealand, David Owen writes.
The former shadow cabinet member, who was once a candidate for the party
leadership, argued that Labour bore a share of the blame for the recent
recession. Launching a pamphlet calling for a more radical approach to
economic policy, he urged Labour to 'stop giving the Tories a free run' and
to 'make the case for a new and real commitment to full employment'.
In a document that he agreed was his 'swansong', Mr Gould urged Labour to
adopt a 22-point policy checklist. This included identifying full
employment, not stable prices, as the central aim of monetary policy,
reducing interest rates by between 2 and 3 percentage points and increasing
taxes on the 'very rich'.
His attack was immediately pounced on by Mr Gerry Malone, the Conservative
deputy chairman, who said Mr Gould was leaving Labour 'disillusioned by John
Smith's timid leadership'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Continued recovery predicted for engineering output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering output will continue to recover after declining at the end of
last year, the Engineering Employers' Federation predicted yesterday, but it
warned against a deteriorating trade balance, Graham Bowley writes.
In an interim update to the federation's half-yearly Engineering Economics
Trends report, Mr Ian Thompson, federation economic adviser, said that the
recovery was being led by the electronics and vehicle sectors.
Engineering output declined in the second half of last year, but the
federation now expects positive growth for all major sectors except
aerospace. Output from the aerospace equipment sector will continue to
decline. But 'the trade deficit could be an inhibiting factor on the UK
economy,' he said.
The federation said the most interesting picture to emerge is a large shift
in the pattern of UK exports and imports from European to non-EU trading
partners.
Engineering employment will continue to fall during this year, said Mr
Thompson, but he emphasised that this is not necessarily a bad thing as
companies improve on efficiency.
Referring to the planned tax rises he said: 'The impact of the tax increase
has been exaggerated and will not stop the recovery.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / Insurance premium tax is likely to be levied gross
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is close to deciding to levy the proposed new 3 per cent
insurance premium tax gross instead of net of brokers' commission.
The change, proposed in November's Budget, would require an amendment to the
finance bill under scrutiny in the Commons. The move is one of several
changes being considered by ministers after meeting industry
representatives. Alterations would generally be motivated by ministers'
desire to introduce the new tax - due to take effect from October - in as
practical a manner as possible.
Levying the tax on a gross rather than a net premium basis, as originally
suggested, would slightly increase the Pounds 750m it is projected to raise
for the Treasury in a full year.
Ministers are also under pressure to extend the list of exemptions, now
confined to long-term insurance products such as endowments and some types
of commercial insurance.
Conservative MPs are among those arguing that extended warranties offered to
purchasers of items such as cars and white goods should be exempt.
Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to this argument but anxious not
to create a potentially troublesome legal loophole.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, argued this month for the 'relatively
low' tax to apply across a broad base, so that 'as fair as possible a
distribution of the tax burden' would be achieved.
The Association of British Insurers has written to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, arguing for exemptions on private medical insurance, payment
protection for creditors, credit insurance and surety bonds.
The industry body was disappointed with the decision to introduce the tax,
and has stressed the importance of ensuring the 3 per cent rate does not
rise. Labour strongly opposes any exemption for private medical insurance.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Mayhew increases pressure on Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments will press ahead urgently with the talks
process intended to bring an overall political settlement in Ulster, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
The odds on peace were shortening and the terrorists were running out of
time as they confronted the 'irreversible will of the people' for peace, he
said.
Sir Patrick was addressing the Association of American Correspondents in
London, the day after meeting Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, in the first of a series of individual meetings with the
parties to discuss ideas for a political settlement. Today he will meet Dr
John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, although no date has yet been
set for a meeting with Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party.
Sir Patrick's speech formed part of the continuing effort to maintain the
pressure on Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street declaration.
He stressed that there was 'no daylight' between the two governments on the
joint declaration and warned those who had so far refused to join efforts to
find a settlement that they could join the process or stay out. 'But they
cannot halt it', he added.
Attacking the recent visit to the US by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president,
Sir Patrick said that those who justified the killing of Irish people 'may
be lionised briefly, albeit damagingly, abroad', but the people of Ireland
wanted an end to violence.
Sir Patrick reiterated the determination of both governments not to
renegotiate the joint declaration, which he emphasised had 'no recommended
shelf-life'. It ruled nothing out, he said.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Pay frozen for biggest council's 104,000 staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strathclyde, Britain's largest council, said yesterday that its 104,000
staff will receive no pay increase this year and blamed the government's
capping of its budget.
Local government leaders fear that other councils may also find it difficult
to meet pay rises of 2 per cent to 3 per cent - while conforming to the
government's policy of a freeze on public-sector pay bills - because of
budget constraints.
Mr Robert Gould, Labour leader of the council which includes Glasgow, said:
'Strathclyde just cannot afford to include pay increases in the council
budget this year. It is deplorable that the government have placed us in
this difficult position.'
Strathclyde's final budget and the size of its regional council tax for the
1994-1995 financial year will be fixed at a special meeting of the council
scheduled for March 9. But council leaders said yesterday their budget had
been set tightly by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, at Pounds 1.9bn.
Every 1 percentage point pay rise would cost the regional council more than
Pounds 3m.
Councillors say the government's 1994-1995 grant settlement for Strathclyde
takes no account of any pay awards for the staff.
Mr Gould said: 'We are worried that (the pay freeze) will lower staff morale
at a very critical time for local government. Strathclyde remains committed
to honouring nationally negotiated pay settlements and we will do everything
we can to press the government to provide the necessary resources.'
The council's policy and resources committee is demanding that Mr Lang meet
local authorities to reconsider what it sees as his failure to include an
element for pay within the 1994-1995 grant settlement.
Unison, the main public services union, reacted angrily last night to
Strathclyde's announcement. Mr Mark Irvine, the union's local government
head in Scotland, said: 'The proposed pay freeze is completely unacceptable.
We will be seeking an urgent meeting with the secretary of state for
Scotland to discuss the financial crisis facing local government in
Scotland.'
The union said it understood the financial difficulties facing Strathclyde
and other councils in Scotland but warned that it could not accept that
low-paid local government workers should receive no pay rise at all in 1994.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Government defeated on Welsh council name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was defeated last night when peers voted to keep the ancient
name of Powys for a Welsh council.
The Lords divided by 88 to 60, a majority of 28, to retain the name instead
of replacing it with Mid Wales. The vote came during the report stage of the
Local Government (Wales) bill, which replaces the principality's eight
counties and 37 districts with 21 all-purpose authorities in 1996.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Scott hears of decision in Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs officials decided to prosecute Matrix Churchill executives accused
of illegally exporting arms to Iraq even though an important argument in
their defence had been accepted by senior Whitehall officials, it emerged
yesterday.
The prosecution went ahead after lawyers for the Customs and Excise
Department predicted mistakenly that a judge would rule against disclosure
of sensitive government documents.
Details of the latest twist to the controversial case at the heart of the
arms-for-Iraq affair emerged yesterday after Sir Robin Butler, head of the
home civil service and cabinet secretary, provided Lord Justice Scott with
new evidence.
The evidence, in the form of notes taken by Sir Robin's former private
secretary, show how senior officials conceded that Matrix Churchill
executives had a reasonable basis for believing that they were exporting
defence-related machine tools to Iraq with government approval.
The notes were of a meeting attended by Sir Robin, other cabinet officials,
and Sir Brian Unwin, the head of Customs, in December 1990 - three months
before Matrix Churchill executives were charged by Customs. The meeting was
to discuss advice given to machine tool manufacturers by Mr Alan Clark, the
former defence and trade minister, which officials described as 'ambiguous'
and 'occasionally idiosyncratic'.
Sir Robin told the inquiry yesterday: 'The trouble was Mr Clark had left
himself open to misunderstanding.'
The notes were brought to the attention of Lord Justice Scott only this
week, prompting a public complaint from the judge that the Cabinet Office
had not provided the document at an earlier stage in the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry.
Further evidence made available to the inquiry shows that Sir Brian Unwin
advised Sir Robin that Customs lawyers preparing the Matrix Churchill
prosecution were 'very robust' that the judge in the trial would not order
disclosure of documents relating to Mr Clark's meeting with machine tool
manufacturers.
The advice preceded the decision by customs lawyers to call Mr Clark as a
prosecution witness.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Disclosure on dam ruling by Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to go ahead with the
funding of Malaysia's Pergau dam project in 1991 was the only occasion on
which the advice of an accounting officer in his department has been
overruled since the Conservatives came to power.
Mr Hurd's decision to go ahead with the Pounds 234m project, which was
recently described by Whitehall's accounting watchdog as 'a very bad buy',
was taken against the advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent
secretary and accounting officer at the Overseas Development Administration,
which is a part of the Foreign Office.
In recent evidence to a select committee MPs, Sir Timothy said he regarded
the funding of the Malaysian project as an 'abuse' of the aid budget, and
that he therefore asked for a 'ministerial direction' from Mr Hurd to 'sign
the cheques' for the project.
In a written parliamentary answer released yesterday, Mr Alastair Goodlad, a
Foreign Office minister, confirmed that this was the only occasion on which
a foreign secretary had issued such a direction.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Anti-terror law referred to European court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's anti-terrorism legislation was yesterday referred by the Court of
Appeal to the European Court of Justice.
The court will be asked to rule whether the Prevention of Terrorism Act is
incompatible with a 1964 European directive providing procedural guarantees
for people expelled from EU states on grounds of public policy, public
health or public security.
The Home Office was last night playing down the significance of the move in
the case of Mr John Gallagher, an Irishman excluded in September 1991 under
the act by Mr Kenneth Baker, then home secretary.
It said the questions referred to the Luxembourg court were 'fairly minor'
and did not call into doubt the home secretary's power of exclusion.
But Mr Stephen Grosz, Mr Gallagher's solicitor, said the case would be an
important test of Britain's anti-terrorism laws. 'In a field where people
have so few rights it is important to hold on to those rights that they
have,' he said.
Mr Gallagher, who was jailed for three years in the Irish Republic in 1983
for being in possession of two rifles for unlawful purposes, obtained a job
in London in April 1990.
After his exclusion he challenged the legality of the home secretary's order
in the English courts on the basis that he had been denied details of the
grounds on which the order was made and that the Home Office had refused to
tell him the name of the person who advised the home secretary on his case.
The appeal judges dismissed his case under domestic law but two ruled that
the European Court should be asked to consider whether the Home Office
breached the 1964 European directive which requires national authorities to
take independent advice before expelling someone.
Mr Grosz said the European judges would be asked how someone who has been
excluded can be sure the home secretary has taken independent advice if the
Home Office appoints the adviser and the excluded person is not told the
adviser's name.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Rebuke from EU on water estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK has overestimated the costs of complying with water quality
directives, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the union's environment commissioner,
said in London yesterday.
UK water companies have predicted that they will need to invest more than
Pounds 10bn to bring water and sewage treatment standards in line with the
EU urban waste water directive. But Mr Paleokrassas, whose officials met UK
water regulators Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority this week, said the
eventual costs were likely to be 'several billion pounds' lower.
His comments came after months of rising tension between London and Brussels
over water standards. The UK has attacked some standards as unnecessarily
high, and asked for more time to comply. Yesterday Mr Paleokrassas said:
'There will be no lowering of standards or lengthening of dates.'
Thames Water said: 'A lot of investment follows from this directive, but the
costings are complex and the interpretation needs to be clarified further.'
Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Paleokrassas also said the
European Commission would say within two weeks whether the UK government's
decision to licence the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield
followed commission rules.
'There is some doubt as to whether the environmental impact assessment has
been infringed,' he said.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Major deepens Tory divisions on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday disowned all the central elements of the manifesto
on which the Conservatives' allies in the European Parliament will fight its
elections in June.
Confirming the increasingly Euro-sceptic stance of his government in the
approach to the polls, he said the Conservatives planned a 'distinctively
British' platform.
To the dismay of Conservative MPs on the pro-European wing of the party, Mr
Major agreed with one of his party's leading Euro-sceptics that the
manifesto of the European Peoples' party should be brushed aside.
The Conservatives have formal links with the EPP, the alliance in Strasbourg
which represents most of the Christian Democrat parties in the rest of the
European Union. The EPP finances the offices at Conservative Central Office
in London run by Tory members of the European Parliament.
But in the Commons yesterday Mr William Cash, one of the MPs at the
forefront of the anti-Maastricht campaign, urged the prime minister to
disassociate the party 'from the EPP's call for a single currency, a
European central bank, the social chapter and a common immigration policy'.
Mr Major replied that the government was not obliged to accept those
policies, adding: 'Nor will we.'
His comments, however, brought private warnings from senior figures on the
centre-left of the party that an anti-Brussels stance in the election
campaign would risk a new split.
One middle-ranking minister said he was 'appalled' by the tone of some of
the government's recent statements.
Mr Major attacked Labour for allegedly signing up to the 'centralising'
policy of its socialist partners.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Quick fix for child support agency is ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday underlined the government's determination not to be
stampeded into ordering further changes to the operations of the Child
Support Agency.
In heated exchanges at question time with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
the prime minister argued that more time was needed to evaluate the changes
that were announced in December. Stressing that the agency's operations
would be kept under review, Mr Major said any further changes should be made
in the light of 'a little more experience'. If changes proved necessary,
they would be made 'then, but not now'.
In a debate on the agency, Labour's call for further changes was defeated by
316 votes to 285, a government majority of 31. A government amendment
welcoming 'the important changes recently introduced in response to early
experience of the new scheme', was carried by 314 votes to 279, a majority
of 35.
Some Tory backbenchers joined Labour MPs in highlighting the problems faced
by 'absent fathers' who were pushed into financial difficulties by decisions
made by the agency.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security minister, said that in some
instances maintenance payments agreed in earlier settlements had been
greatly increased and no account was taken of the travel costs incurred by
men who lived long distances from their place of work.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said some of the changes already
announced were still being implemented.
While acknowledging the large number of complaints being received by MPs, he
emphasised that the agency was not just pursuing men who were already paying
maintenance for their children.
In the majority of cases the absent parent was 'not paying a penny of
regular maintenance and has not even agreed in principle to do so'.
He added that in 96 per cent of the cases dealt with by the agency, the
child and mother were living on social security benefit.
Mr Lilley denied that officers of the agency were paid a bonus geared to the
amount of money secured from absent parents - 'there is no element of bounty
hunting'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Penalties proposed for late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is proposing to introduce clauses in contracts covering more
than Pounds 5bn of public-sector building work to ensure that construction
companies and their subcontractors are paid on time.
A consultation paper detailing the proposals, published yesterday by the
Department of the Environment, received a mixed response from the building
industry.
At the heart of the proposals are procedures to ensure that payments made by
the customer to the main contractor are passed on to sub-contractors which
do the bulk of the work.
Sub-contractors have complained that main contractors are delaying payments
to improve their own financial position at the expense of specialist
builders.
The environment department is proposing that government building contracts
include clauses requiring subcontractors to be paid within 17 days of
architects issuing payment certificates.
Payment periods for government departments and agencies to pay main
contractors would also be fixed, the department said.
The Specialist Engineering Contractors Group, representing sub-contractors,
welcomed the proposals - but said it was concerned that there was no system
to adjudicate when there was disagreement over the amount to be paid. It
said main contractors often queried prices as a means of delaying payment.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Fresh bid revealed for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three big media organisations - MAI, Time Warner and Pearson - yesterday
announced that they had formed a consortium to bid for a national Channel 5
television licence if one is advertised.
The consortium would offer national programming and a series of local
services for leading UK cities. It would resemble the US television system
with a national network serving a host of regional affiliates.
MAI is the controlling shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company
for the south of England, and recently made an agreed bid for Anglia
Television. Time Warner is the largest media group in the world and Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, also owns Thames Television, the ITV company
that lost its franchise to Carlton.
The consortium is the most weighty so far to announce its interest in
Channel 5, which could reach around three-quarters of the UK population.
In December 1992, the Independent Television Commission rejected the only
bid for the Channel 5 licence - put together by Thames (not then owned by
Pearson), Time Warner and Pearson. The ITC did not think the business plan
sufficiently robust and decided that the shareholders were not sufficiently
committed.
For some time, the ITC has been looking to see whether the franchise should
be readvertised or the frequencies reserved to develop a host of digital
television channels in this country.
The ITC will take its decision 'shortly'. The likeliest outcome is that
Channel 5 will be re-advertised, but as part of a co-ordinated plan to
develop digital television gradually.
The ITC has been trying to find ways to reduce the number of video recorders
that would have to be re-tuned for Channel 5 to go ahead. Extensive
re-tuning because of the interference that would be caused by the Channel 5
signal was one of the problems with the original proposal.
Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, said yesterday: 'This is a golden
opportunity to bring in a new distinctive channel offering both national and
city-based programmes.'
It would offer extra choice at no cost to viewers and extra choice for
advertisers, particularly local advertisers, he added.
At the moment Pearson, as a company owning a national newspaper and an
independent television production company, could only take a 5 per cent
stake.
The government has, however, announced a review of cross-media ownership
rules.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US wants Japanese trade 'clean break'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese officials resumed trade negotiations yesterday, but US
officials insisted this weekend's trade summit between President Clinton and
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokowa still must produce 'a clear break
from the past'.
'It is not clear whether we'll have any agreement at all,' said a senior US
official. 'It's very clear that the US position will not change on these
critical issues. The status quo has got to be altered.'
The talks - on market access for cars, car parts, insurance,
telecommunications, and medical equipment - had broken off Wednesday.
They were restarted after a lengthy breakfast meeting between Foreign
Minister Tsutomu Hata and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr
C. Bowman Cutter of the National Economic Council, who ordered their
deputies to try again.
The ministers were to meet again to review the progress. If there was a
chance of success - and Mr Kantor is a great believer in last minute
deal-making - then the talks would resume.
US officials indicated a partial agreement might be possible as long as
Japan agrees to 'objective criteria' to measure gains achieved for
'competitive foreign goods'. They continued to be vague, however, about the
interpretation of the 'quantitative and qualitative' indicators they want,
except to reject the notion that it means they want market share targets.
Another US official said the administration was unified, resolved and
specific about its goal in a way it never has been in previous talks.
'Things have gotten worse,' he said of the nearly Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn)
US trade deficit to Japan last year. 'We've learned a lot.'
The Clinton administration has concluded that it has nothing to gain by
waiting for further reforms promised by Mr Hosokowa because of his
disappointing performance on deregulation. 'We've held our fire,' the
official said. 'Its all rhetoric and there's no deregulation that we can
find at all.'
If Tokyo really wanted reform, he said, it would have agreed to the zero
tariff initiative in the Uruguay Round, particularly on wood, since it could
have slashed housing costs.
Cars imports must still face an 'elaborate testing system' which raise
prices and car parts have to deal with a costly licensing regime.
'That's why we are dealing with these indicators.' the official said. 'We do
not know any other way of prying it open. The frustrating fact is that this
is all we have left.'

Personal share dealings by money managers in the booming US mutual funds
industry have come under regulatory scrutiny, prompted by congressional and
public concern that some managers may have been making personal profits at
the expense of their investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has written to 30 mutual fund groups
asking about managers' personal share dealings. It is trying to uncover the
extent to which fund managers invest personally in companies whose shares
are also held in the portfolios they manage.
This could create a conflict of interest, since managers could be tempted to
deal personally before they trade on behalf of their funds.
News of the SEC's action came in a letter from Mr Arthur Levitt, the
Commission's chairman, to Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House
sub-committee on telecommunications and finance.
Responding to concerns raised by the congressman, Mr Levitt said: 'I assure
you that we will take whatever measures are appropriate to correct any
abuses we discover as a result of our inquiry, including, if necessary,
recommending new laws and legislation.'
The SEC's investigation follows the sacking of a fund manager at funds group
Invesco last month, and the launch of an inquiry into dealings by managers
at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the US's biggest mutual funds group.
There has been concern in Washington that the regulation of the mutual fund
industry has failed to keep pace with its rapid growth. By the end of last
year mutual funds had amassed Dollars 2,000bn (Pounds 1,340bn) in assets in
the US, accounting for a substantial part of personal investments.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Latin America trading accords 'carry
dangers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proliferation of bilateral and sub-regional trade agreements in Latin
America carries dangers, the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean says in a new report*.
The report reflects the concern expressed by Mr Gert Rosenthal, the head of
the Santiago-based organisation, in a recent interview, over the lack of
common external tariffs in most of the region's trade agreements.
What may follow, he said, is the development of rules of origin 'as a proxy
for restricting trade.'
The report, prepared for a meeting of Latin American government experts on
trade next month, says rules of origin 'could become a hidden instrument of
protectionism that discriminates more against countries less able to take
advantage of the expanded market's potential or against those with a greater
proportion of extraregional investment.'
Four sub-regional agreements are in place - the Central American Common
Market, the Andean Pact, the Caribbean Community and Mercosur - and over 20
bilateral agreements have been signed.
Trade liberalisation commitments have also been signed between groups of
countries, for example between the Caribbean Community members and
Venezuela.
Bilateral agreements tend not to carry common external tariffs while none of
the sub-regional agreements currently has a common tariff applied by all its
members, the report notes.
It points out that 'bilateral agreements and other agreements with very
limited geographical coverage' entail costs if they do not lead to broader,
less discriminatory arrangements.
For example, 'if bilateral relations are increasingly concentrated, there is
a risk that a small country may adjust its production structures to the
conditions prevailing on the market of its main trading partner, instead of
adapting them to the more competitive conditions of the world economy.'
It adds: 'The emergence of certain 'hub' countries with which most bilateral
agreements are concluded can also create incentives for the concentration of
investment in those countries, since they will have access to more markets
and cheap inputs.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / US preparing guidelines to prevent environmental racism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is preparing guidelines that would insert
questions of environmental equity into decisions on all US government
programmes.
The guidelines would require federal agencies to make sure that their
programmes do not inflict an unfair degree of environmental damage on poor
communities or on racial minorities.
They respond to growing complaints from civil rights leaders that pollution
disproportionately affects minorities.
A 1987 report by the Commission on Racial Justice found a pattern of
'environmental racism' in the siting of toxic waste dumps and incinerators,
concluding that most of the largest and most dangerous landfills in the US
were in communities with majority black or Hispanic populations.
Mr Benjamin Chavis, who headed that commission, has since taken over as head
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the US's
oldest and largest civil rights organisation, and has taken the lead in
urging that more attention should be paid to environmental equity issues in,
for example, the reform of the Superfund law on toxic waste clean-ups.
A subsequent report by the Environmental Protection Agency, however,
concluded that although ethnic minorities were likely to be more exposed to
hazardous chemicals, the pattern was determined less by race than by
poverty.
But community groups have filed racial discrimination suits to complain
about the siting of incinerators and other treatment facilities in minority
neighbourhoods, and the state of Louisiana last month cited concerns about
environmental racism in refusing a permit for the construction of a toxic
waste plant in a mostly black area. 'It's unfair to allow black communities
to feel we are more lax in looking at permits in their areas than anywhere
else,' said Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards.
Earlier this month the Clinton administration proposed the creation of
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) fund paid for by the insurance industry as part of
its overhaul of the Superfund laws.
The draft legislation would also set up a new form of arbitration process
for allocating responsibility for cleaning up waste sites, under the
auspices of an independent expert.

<TEXT>
The presence of 150 US combat engineers on the Pacific coast of Colombia has
generated political embarrassment for President Cesar Gaviria just as he is
canvassing for support to become the next secretary general of the
Organisation of American States.
The engineers are building a small school, a health post and a few miles of
road in the village of Juanchaco, 190 miles southwest of Bogota, under a
military co-operation agreement.
However, the arrival of the US troops in December in great secrecy has
turned into a highly charged pre-electoral issue, leading to anti-American
protests and graffiti and a series of dynamite attacks on US-linked
organisations.
Colombia is holding congressional elections next month and presidential
elections in May.
The Council of State, a grouping of leading magistrates, released a
communique this week saying that the president's interpretation of foreign
treaties, on which the US agreement is based, ran counter to the
constitution and violated national sovereignty.
In an unusually heated press conference, Mr Gaviria defended military
co-operation and stressed the importance of technical assistance in fighting
drug trafficking. US military personnel are also helping to build a river
operations base and installing radar in other parts of the country.
The governing Liberal Party and its main election candidates have supported
the president but the Council of State's ruling could lead to an
investigation by Congress or by the attorney general's office.
Congressmen joined Mr Rafael Pardo, the defence minister, in a tour of the
construction site. Mr Pardo admitted there had been an information problem.

FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Iceland's trade policy 'to blame for
downturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iceland's trade and industrial policies have contributed to a squandering of
its valuable fish resources, some of the world's highest food prices and a
damaging bias against the manufacturing sector, says a report by Gatt
economists published yesterday.
Iceland, with a population of about 260,000, grew prosperous in the post-war
period on the back of the fishing industry, which accounts for about 17 per
cent of gross domestic product and 75-80 per cent of merchandise exports.
However, since 1988 the economy has floundered, due partly to recession in
Europe but also to cutbacks in the cod catch.
The Gatt report says free-of-charge access to marine resources and state
supports have led to over-investment and overfishing and the Icelandic
government has been forced to reduce cod catches to replenish stocks.
Membership of the European Economic Area, the giant free trade zone spanning
western Europe which came into force last month should help the fisheries
sector by eliminating most tariffs on fish exports to the EEA's 18 members,
the report notes.
However, Iceland's uncompetitive agricultural sector is likely to come under
increasing pressure from imports from the EEA. Without government support,
now being cut, the farm sector will inevitably shrink, Gatt says.
The transfer of resources to manufacturing would help stabilise the economy,
now vulnerable to changes in fish catches and prices. But the report
expresses some doubts about Iceland's plans to base future economic
development on energy intensive industries.
Gatt says these make a much smaller contribution to net export earnings and
national value added than fisheries because most of the raw materials and
equipment have to be imported.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Argentina to widen wealth tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina plans to broaden its wealth tax to include holdings in the
previously exempt financial system.
The government sent a bill to Congress this week that will tax financial
assets such as shares, bonds and bank deposits at 0.5 per cent a year. These
assets are currently untaxed to encourage saving. The government says it
will maintain tax exemptions for foreigners.
Previously, the wealth tax was payable only on assets such as cars, yachts
and property worth over Dollars 100,000. The threshold remains unchanged,
although the government will halve the tax from 1 per cent.
Mr Daniel Artana, chief economist at Fiel, a private economic research
foundation, said: 'This is nothing to get upset about. The financial system
still receives a favourable tax treatment.' However he said the government
should redouble efforts to raise revenues by further reducing tax evasion.
Economists believe the government decided to tax holdings in the financial
system to make up for declining tax revenues elsewhere.
The changes are expected to triple wealth tax revenues to about Dollars 350m
a year.

<TEXT>
Caribbean banana producers are falling victim to the European Union's
dispute over bananas with Latin American exporters, Dame Eugenia Charles,
prime minister of Dominica, said yesterday.
Latin American producers have complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade about the EU's preferential trading arrangements on bananas with
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. A report by a Gatt panel expected
to condemn the Lome convention as incompatible with Gatt rules is due to be
published today. 'I'm a believer in free trade, but not so free it ruins an
entire country,' said Dame Eugenia.
Banana exports provide 75 per cent of Dominica's revenue and Dame Eugenia
said the Windward Islands had lost Dollars 70m (Pounds 48m) since last July
when the EU's new banana regime came into force. However, it was not
accepted by Latin American producers.
Since then, the Commission has slightly increased the Latin Americans'
import ceiling, but has insisted a condition of acceptance would be for the
countries to withdraw their complaint to Gatt.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Clinton to speak at ILO anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is to speak at the 75th anniversary conference of the
International Labour Organisation in June in a sign of his growing concern
to introduce a social agenda into discussions on the global economy.
It follows his decision to call a jobs summit next month in Detroit for the
seven main industrialised nations to discuss global unemployment.
Mr Clinton's trip to Geneva underlines the increasing importance the
American administration is giving to labour questions, reflected in the
training and employment policies being drawn up by Mr Robert Reich, the
labour secretary.
It also indicates an important shift in American international labour
strategy. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush the US took a hostile view of the
work of the ILO and American employers believed it was hostile to the
principles of free enterprise.
Observers believe Mr Clinton's trip will provide a welcome support for the
ILO's new social agenda which will be presented to the conference by its
director-general Mr Michel Hansenne.
In a recent report Mr Hansenne argued that the ILO needed to adopt a more
positive line on social issues with the onset of freer international trade
after the successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay Round and the creation
of the North American Free Trade Area.
The ILO believes this must go beyond the setting of universal standards of
labour practice.
Mr Clinton will be the first US president to travel to Switzerland to
address the ILO. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke to the ILO when
it met in Philadelphia in 1944, when the organisation was relaunched in the
closing stages of the second world war.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Congress gets ready to prescribe drugs price curbs:
Pressures for change encompassed in President Clinton's plans for healthcare
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Congressional pressure for stricter curbs on prescription drug prices is
building as detailed debate gets under way on the Clinton healthcare reform
plan.
Members of Congress are marshalling reports and statistics to show that
pharmaceutical companies continue to charge more for their products in the
US than in other countries, and that drug prices continue to rise faster
than inflation.
Last week, Senator David Pryor, a persistent critic of the pharmaceutical
industry, produced a study by Democratic staff members of the Senate special
committee on ageing, which he chairs, showing that although wholesale drug
price rises slowed down last year, averaging only 3.1 per cent compared with
6.4 per cent in 1992, they still far outstripped the overall rate of
inflation for manufactured goods.
And Congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the House of Representatives
subcommittee on health and the environment, released a report by the General
Accounting Office showing that the most commonly prescribed drugs cost 60
per cent more in the US than in the UK.
The GAO report examined wholesale prices for 77 drugs sold by the same
manufacturer in both countries, and found that only 11 were cheaper in the
US, while 47 cost more than twice as much in the US as in the UK.
While the most commonly prescribed drug in the study, Beecham's Amoxil
antibiotic, cost 40 per cent less in the US, other top sellers such as
Wyeth-Ayerst's Premarin, Burroughs Wellcome's Lanoxin and Upjohn's Xanax all
cost well over twice as much in the US.
'Beyond any doubt, the US is substantially subsidising low drug prices in
the rest of the world,' Mr Waxman said, urging examination of the British
system for controlling drug prices.
Pharmaceutical companies sprang to defend themselves with their own barrage
of studies.
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association released a report by Mr Thomas
McLaughlin of Harvard University which found only 'slight price variations'
between the US, Canada, Germany and the UK, and warned of the difficulties
involved in such comparisons.
A separate study of prices for cardiovascular drugs conducted by Professor
Patricia Danzon, a health economist at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania, found prices were slightly lower in the US than in Canada
and Japan but higher than in most of Europe.
Prof Danzon warned that looking at the top-selling brand-name drugs tended
to bias international comparisons against the US, where such products are
often more expensive, and that most studies had failed to take proper
account of the availability of generic alternatives, as well as of rebates
and discounts to bulk buyers.
The Clinton health plan, which would require health insurance plans to cover
prescription drugs, would also oblige pharmaceutical companies to offer a 17
per cent rebate to Medicare, the government-run system that provides health
coverage to the elderly, with an additional rebate if their prices rise
faster than the consumer price index.
With healthcare reform legislation now starting to pick up speed in
Congress, members who want even tougher controls on drug prices are likely
to seek to add their own amendments to the bill.
'The train is about to leave the station and the train is healthcare reform.
I want to get on that train,' said Senator Pryor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 23 international banks have told the Thai government they want to
withdraw from a controversial Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) elevated motorway
project for Bangkok and have their loans and interest worth some Dollars
250m repaid in full.
The demand by the banks - which sent a stern letter to the Thai authorities
10 days ago and met Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, this
week - could hinder Thailand's efforts to secure foreign funding for other
big transport, communications and power projects.
Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi
of Japan and financed by Thai and foreign banks, is locked in a bitter
dispute with the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA)
over revenue-sharing and other aspects of the toll road contract.
The ETA forced open the 20-km stretch of new road in September by obtaining
an emergency court order and bypassing agreed dispute procedures, prompting
foreign bankers to accuse the Thais of 'nationalising' the scheme, one of
the first major build-operate-transfer projects in Thailand.
Kumagai Gumi has been negotiating for months to recoup its costs by selling
its 65 per cent share in BECL to a Thai consortium led by construction
company Charoen Karnchang, but the two sides have been unable to agree on a
price.
The foreign banks, including National Westminster, Credit Lyonnais and
several Japanese banks, said their loan facilities to BECL had been
non-performing since March 1993. They put the blame squarely on the
shoulders of the ETA.
'In the circumstances,' the banks wrote in their letter, 'the offshore
banks' desire is for their facilities/loans to BECL plus full accrued
interest plus all other fees and expenses to be repaid in full by the
onshore Thai bank lenders, the Thai government, Ch Karnchang, or another
third party as soon as possible.
'The offshore banks wish to be totally removed from their involvement in the
BEP (Bangkok Expressway Project).'
Eight Japanese banks - out of the original 31 foreign commercial bank
lenders - did not sign the letter, possibly for fear of damaging their other
interests in Thailand.
The ETA, now profiting from the substantial toll revenues provided by the
new motorway above Bangkok's congested streets, replied with a scathing,
eight-page letter attacking BECL.

goods

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's consumers believe the best quality goods are made by Japan,
Germany and the US, while goods from Britain and other exporting nations lag
well behind, according to a world-wide Gallup poll* of 20,000 people.
Japan scores the highest, with nearly 39 per cent of consumers rating its
products very good or excellent. Germany and the US do almost as well.
Britain leads the rest of the field with a score of 22 per cent.
The poll, commissioned by Bozell, the US advertising agency, is believed to
be the first large-scale attempt to quantify world-wide perceptions about
the quality of goods made by the 12 biggest exporting nations.
Japan's position at the top of the league table confirms impressions that
its manufacturers are now considered the world's best. Britain's
manufacturers may draw some comfort from finding themselves relatively high
up in the league table. But the poll makes grim reading for Russia's
manufacturers, rated the worst.
The Gallup Organisation, a US-based market survey company, carried out the
poll by asking more than 20,000 people in 20 countries how they rated the
quality of manufactured goods produced by each of the 12 countries named.
Ratings were given on a five-point scale ranging from poor to excellent.
Some 38.5 per cent of interviewees thought Japan's products were very good
or excellent. Germany was second with 36 per cent, and the US was third with
34.3 per cent. Next, after a big gap, came Britain, France, Canada, Italy,
Spain, China, Taiwan, Mexico and Russia.
The breakdown of replies given in individual countries suggests that
national prejudices influenced consumers' opinions. In France, for example,
consumers said French manufacturers' products were the best.
Consumer patriotism was highest in Japan, where 76 per cent of respondents
rated Japanese products as very good or excellent. Next highest scorers in
Japan were Germany with 49 per cent, then Britain with 39 per cent.

<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, yesterday
briefed King Hussein of Jordan on the latest PLO-Israeli agreement,
responding to Jordan's previous criticism that the PLO had failed to
co-ordinate with the kingdom over the peace talks.
Mr Arafat presented the king with a copy of the security arrangements agreed
with Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Cairo, and discussed
future aspects of co-operation between the East and West Banks.
Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, Jordan's prime minister, said the king was
'extremely happy' Mr Arafat had kept his promise of enhanced co-ordination
with Jordan.
Since it was disclosed that secret Israeli-PLO talks had taken place in
Norway last summer, leading to the historic peace accord signed last
September, King Hussein has repeatedly complained Jordan has not been kept
up to date with meetings on the future of the occupied territories.
Despite accords signed between the Jordanians and Palestinians on economic
ties and security this year, and assurances from the PLO that it supports
co-ordination, Jordan remained sensitive about being left out.
Recently, King Hussein said: 'Our basic position is supporting our
Palestinian brothers as regards regaining their rights on their national
soil, but I cannot say our co-ordination until now is what it should be,
while between us and Syria and Lebanon co-ordination is normal.'
Jordan is keen to play a central role in the West Bank after an Israeli
withdrawal. Fifty per cent of the kingdom's population is of Palestinian
origin and the West Bank was ruled by King Hussein until 1967. Agreements so
far will allow Jordanian banks to re-open branches in the West Bank where
the Jordanian dinar will be the main legal tender. This will give Jordan's
central bank a key role in monetary policy in the new Palestinian entity.
Jordan wants a bilateral pact on trade and joint ventures in business and
manufacturing. Next week a Jordanian-Palestinian committee will begin
discussing these details as part of the economic protocol signed in January.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Security pact speeds Mideast peace process: Compromise and
complicated formulae were key to hard-won Israeli-PLO accord

Israel and the PLO have overcome deep suspicions to forge the Cairo accords
on security. The signing in Cairo on Wednesday night broke months of
deadlock over implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank area of Jericho.
Employing painstaking compromise, complicated formulae and postponement of
some sensitive issues, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres,
Israeli foreign minister, reached a deal which will inject momentum into the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The Cairo accords pave the way for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to meet Mr
Arafat within four weeks to sign a comprehensive protocol leading to the
delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho. Completion of Israeli
military redeployment will not be possible by the April 13 deadline.
To reach agreement on security issues, Mr Arafat had to give up demands for
absolute PLO control over borders and roads, viewed as important symbols of
sovereignty for a Palestinian state. Israel had to concede the Palestinian
need for dignity without jeopardising security requirements.
Israel keeps exclusive control over external security. The most important
issues resolved under the accords are arrangements for the Gaza-Egypt and
Jericho-Jordan border crossing; security details for the Jewish settlements
in Gaza and for roads linking the settlements with Israel, and broad outline
of the size and composition of the Jericho area.
The most important details of a final protocol yet to be agreed are
relations between the two economies; the operational limits of a Palestinian
police force and transfer of administrative power from Israeli to
Palestinian hands. All these issues must be finalised before Mr Rabin and Mr
Arafat can sign the comprehensive protocol.
Separate agreements on the modalities of holding Palestinian elections and
redeployment of Israeli troops in the rest of the West Bank will be
negotiated in Washington. The Cairo accords cleared away the most difficult
issues of a protocol on Palestinian self-rule:
Border arrangements: Israel retains responsibility for external security. It
will rely heavily on modern surveillance devices rather than physical
searches. Each border crossing will have one terminal with two wings, the
Palestinian one to serve Palestinians and visitors to Gaza-Jericho, with a
Palestinian flag and Palestinian policemen at its entrance. The Israeli wing
will serve Israelis and foreigners. The Palestinians and the Israelis will
have a closed area for searching luggage;
Inspection: The Israelis may open luggage in the presence of the owner and a
Palestinian policeman. Persons entering the Palestinian wing will pass
through a magnetic gate in the presence of an Israeli and Palestinian
policeman. A Palestinian may be physically searched by a Palestinian
policeman in the presence of an Israeli policeman.
Israel will check the identity documents of all Palestinians crossing the
Palestinian wing but will do so 'in an invisible manner' for Gaza-Jericho
residents. In the event of suspicion, both sides may question a Palestinian.
A Palestinian may be apprehended crossing through the terminal by either
side, but must be dealt with by a Palestinian policeman. Both sides have the
right to veto entry to any person not a Gaza-Jericho resident; Israel will
control security in the Palestinian-controlled areas between the Gaza-Egypt
and Jericho-Jordan border posts, in close co-ordination with a Palestinian
deputy. Palestinian policemen present will be armed with handguns;
The area of Jericho: Israel and the PLO have initialled a mapped area of
Jericho of 55.5 sq kms but left the final decision to Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat
when they meet to sign the protocol.
Israel guarantees safe passage to Palestinians to three areas outside the
Jericho area: the religious site of Nebbi Moussa, the pilgrimage site of
al-Maghtas, and the northern shores of the Dead Sea, where Palestinians will
be allowed to set up private projects and joint tourism ventures.
Palestinians will have sole control over roads in the Jericho area, with
joint patrols, under Palestinian authority, on the main roads used by
Palestinians and Israelis.
Gaza security: Israel retains absolute authority over the Gush Katif and
Erez settlement areas and Israeli military installation along the Egyptian
border. In a second zone Israel will control security, in co-operation with
Palestinians in security matters, including joint patrols. Israel retains
absolute control over security for three roads linking the settlements with
Israel.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Bank's growth forecast revised upwards
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's central bank yesterday revised upwards its economic growth
forecast for 1994 and its estimate for last year, saying that gross domestic
product could increase by a real 8.2-8.3 per cent in 1994 after a rise of
about 8 per cent in 1993, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok.
Mr Vijit Supinit, Bank of Thailand governor, attributed the
better-than-expected performance to higher exports and investment; previous
official estimates suggested GDP would grow less than 8 per cent this year
and last. 'Exports performed much better than expected, which means the
current account deficit improved,' Mr Vijit said.
Thailand's current account deficit was about 5 per cent of GDP in 1993,
compared with the forecast 6.3 per cent. Exports last year rose by more than
the 11.5 per cent previously predicted.
The value of Thai exports was hit in the first part of 1993 by low prices
for agricultural commodities, although electronics exports continued to grow
strongly.
Prices for rice, one of Thailand's main export commodities, have risen
recently, following the Japanese decision to allow foreign rice imports. But
a water shortage in the central plains of Thailand is likely to restrict the
amount of Thai rice available for export.

Public prosecutors yesterday indicted Mr Tadao Otani, a Diet member, and
charged him with helping supporters obtain tax refunds by falsifying
receipts. Mr Otani recently resigned from the Japan Renewal party, second
biggest grouping in the government coalition.
Until now, investigators have focused on local politicians and the business
community. Mr Otani is the first Diet member to be indicted during the
present anti-corruption effort. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at
Morgan Stanley in Japan, said: 'This shows the continuing willingness of the
government to tackle corruption. It's unusual for a Diet member to be
indicted, but Mr Otani is a little fish, not a big one.'
Mr Otani, now an independent member of the House of Representatives, is
alleged to have conspired with his former political secretary, Mr Susumu
Ochiai. In January, Mr Ochiai admitted offering supporters receipts for
political donations in excess of amounts given.
Under present electoral rules individuals can receive tax breaks on
donations of more than Y10,000 to political groups; the 72 supporters were
said to have been able to claim the inflated amounts, worth Y55m (Pounds
341,614). The offences are alleged to have occurred between 1990 and 1992.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Japan urged to introduce tough budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese finance ministry yesterday asked the government to follow its
record Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) pump-priming package with an austere budget
for the coming year.
The ministry's draft budget for the fiscal year, starting on April 1, calls
for a 1 per cent rise in total outlays to Y73,081bn. Ostensibly an
improvement on the previous year's 0.2 per cent budget growth rate, it
represents a small decline after stripping out accounting changes, according
to finance ministry officials.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said he expected the US to support the
budget, which is likely to be part of trade and economic talks today between
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US President Bill Clinton.
Ministries will negotiate on the draft over the next few days, before the
government adopts a final budget on Tuesday, which will then be debated by
parliament next month. Separately, the cabinet yesterday adopted a Y2,185bn
third supplementary budget for the current year, needed to fund part of the
recent stimulus package.
The government will probably need at least one more supplementary budget
this year, because yesterday's draft is unlikely to cover the its needs,
said economists. 'It is clearly insufficient,' said Mr Jim Vestal, chief
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
The figures might change slightly in the bargaining to come, but the draft
is a general guide to the government's plans. General spending, the core of
the budget, is to rise 2.3 per cent, the smallest increase for six years,
within which defence is set to rise by 0.8 per cent, the lowest growth for
34 years.
Overseas aid is set to rise by 4 per cent, the smallest increase ever from
one of the world's largest donors - and only just over half the foreign
ministry's request for a 7.9 per cent increase. However, public works
spending is to rise by 29.6 per cent, in line with the government's
pump-priming policies, a point welcomed yesterday by the Keidanren business
federation.
On the revenue side, the government expects tax receipts to fall by 12.5 per
cent, because of the income tax rebate at the heart of the stimulus package.
Its tax revenue forecast is, however, based on the Economic Planning
Agency's target of 2.6 per cent growth in gross national product for the
coming fiscal year, widely seen as over-ambitious.
This high economic growth target, however, reduces pressure on the finance
ministry to commit itself to issuing deficit bonds, to which it has strong
objections, pointed out Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring
Securities in Tokyo.
The finance ministry has already had to swallow its pride by agreeing to
issue Y3,134bn of deficit bonds, the first for five years, to fund much of
Mr Hosokawa's tax rebate. The drop in tax revenue and the demands of an
increased public works programme means the government plans a 68 per cent
increase in bonds issued next year, to a record Y13,643bn, or 18.7 per cent
of government revenue. Of that, Y10,509bn will be so-called construction
bonds, destined for public works only - to which the ministry has no
objection - with the rest in deficit bonds.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Dry dams threaten Thai way of life: A monsoon country's most
serious water crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok and the central plains of Thailand, often flooded during the monsoon
rains, are now in the grip of a water shortage so severe that some of the
most basic aspects of Thai life - from rice farming to having soapy baths at
massage parlours - are likely to be affected before the monsoon returns in
June.
Seen from the pumping station north of Bangkok where the Metropolitan
Waterworks Authority draws off the capital's water supply down a 30km canal,
the Chao Phraya river appears to be flowing serenely towards the sea.
Thai officials, however, are far from serene; they are contemplating the
possibility that there will not be enough fresh water running downstream to
keep the sea water from pushing inland as far as the MWA's canal. The MWA
might be forced to suspend pumping, and that could mean water rationing in
Bangkok.
'This is a real crisis,' says Mr Sawad Wattanayagorn, director general of
the Royal Irrigation Department. 'It's the most serious crisis in the Chao
Phraya river basin in history.'
During the dry season from November until June, the Chao Phraya is supplied
from the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams (named after Thailand's King and Queen)
in the north of the country. When full, the two dams combined can hold more
than 16bn cubic metres of usable water. They held that quantity only once,
in 1975.
This time they started the dry season with a record low volume of 2.2bn cu m
of available water, a figure that has since dropped to less than 1.7bn cu m;
normal dry season demand is about 6bn cu m.
Rice farmers, Thailand's biggest water consumers, could be the first victims
of the drought. For the second year running, tempted by high rice prices,
many of them have ignored government pleas not to grow an extra crop during
the dry season.
Without good off-season rains, the crops could fail. Usually the government
is sympathetic to the demands of the country's many farmers (as voters they
form a powerful lobby) but this year there is no irrigation water to spare
to save the rice; the priority is to keep salt water out of the Bangkok
water network.
'There's not even enough for regular consumption, let alone irrigating the
second rice crop,' says Mr Sawad.
Tourist hotels and massage parlours could be severely affected if there was
water rationing, and some of them have begun to reduce water consumption
already.
In central Bangkok, the luxury Dusit Thani hotel has started a campaign to
educate employees and guests on how to save water; guests will soon be asked
whether they want their towels laundered every day. 'If it's true what the
government's saying in terms of present water levels, it's pretty scary,'
says Mr Mark van Og-trop, hotel manager. 'It hasn't affected us yet, but it
will.'
Manufacturing industry is likely to emerge relatively unscathed, at least
for this year. Most factories pump water from their own wells. Excessive use
of groundwater has caused land subsidence in industrial areas, and there are
fears further pumping will allow sea water and pollutants to seep into the
ground water, but wells have yet to run dry.
Higher demand for water and lower rainfall have both contributed to the
water crisis in central Thailand over the past few years.
The area of land under irrigated rice has increased rapidly since the 1970s.
The water is free to farmers and the old-fashioned irrigation system in the
central plains is prone to seepage and evaporation. Industrial and urban use
of water has also increased.
In the north, less water has been flowing into the dams because demand
upstream of the barrages has also risen. Farmers and loggers have hacked
down the forests which once acted as sponges, absorbing rain during the wet
season and releasing it into streams in the dry months.
Rainfall seems to have declined during the last decade, and particularly
during the last six years, although wide annual and regional variations make
it hard to reach firm conclusions. Last year the north had 623mm of rain,
half the normal level, says the RID.
Many people believe that deforestation has somehow caused the reduction in
rainfall, but the contention is hard to prove. 'My guess is that
deforestation has had a lot to do with it,' says Mr Scott Christensen, a
research fellow at the Thailand Development Research Institute, an
independent think-tank; he is studying the management of the country's water
resources.
Even if the 20m inhabitants of the central plains survive this year's water
crisis without too much hardship and it rains on schedule in June, Thailand
will still have to decide how to allocate its water resources in the decades
to come.
One suggestion is that farmers should pay for irrigation water and that
urban consumers should pay more for tap water. The RID wants to build more
dams, but environmentalists have mounted increasingly effective protests
against such projects.
'With the decline in rainfall over the past couple of years it's really come
to a crisis point,' says Mr Christensen. 'The short-term economic impact I
think is going to be quite modest, but this is a serious long-term problem.'

FT  11 FEB 94 / White right threatens to disrupt all-race poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Prospects for peaceful elections in South Africa receded further last night
when the white right wing, the Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF), said it would not
take part in April's all-race elections, and would actively disrupt the
poll.
Compounding the threat to elections, the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly, the
parliament in Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's homeland of KwaZulu, said it
would take steps to resist the poll, though the Chief's Inkatha Freedom
Party has not yet officially announced a boycott.
Both announcements could be partly tactical, aimed at pressing the African
National Congress and government to make last-minute concessions before
Saturday's deadline for registration of political parties contesting the
elections.
'If the ANC and NP come to their senses and decide there will be a volkstaat
(white homeland) and self-determination for Afrikaners, we will consider
(participation),' Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the ultra-right
Conservative Party, said after the AVF's own 'parliament', the 'Transitional
Representative Council', had met.
The AVF leader, Gen Constand Viljoen, was to meet the ANC last night for
what AVF officials described as a 'final' round of talks on the white
right's demand for an Afrikaner homeland. At the same time, the government
was making last-minute efforts to revive stalled trilateral talks between
the right wing umbrella group, the Freedom Alliance, and the ANC and the
government.
There were few indications that agreement could be reached on constitutional
amendments before the Saturday deadline. The Freedom Alliance has said such
amendments are essential if they are to reverse their decision to boycott
the poll. The government said last night it might extend the Saturday
deadline if progress seemed possible, but did not think this likely.
The Afrikaner Volksfront said it would use its 'total ability' to oppose the
poll, though Mr Hartzenberg was careful to avoid an overt call to violence.
But conservative white local councils would refuse to integrate with black
councils as required by law, and the AVF would set up the equivalent of
'mini-volkstaats' in conservative rural areas.
'But if they are going to crush us, we must use a little bit of violence to
protect ourselves,' he warned.

Two British members of parliament and an aid worker were released unharmed
by kidnappers in Somalia yesterday after being taken hostage late on
Wednesday night.
The two MPs - Mr Mark Robinson, Conservative member for Somerton and Frome
and Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie - were
kidnapped at Erigavo in north west Somalia while on a week-long fact-finding
mission in the country.
Mr Jeff Chinnock, an aid worker from the British charity, Actionaid, had
been held with them.
All three were freed by the Somali gang yesterday after-noon after Mr
Ibrahim Egal, leader of the breakaway region of northwestern Somalia,
ann-ounced he would order militiamen to attack the kidnappers if the men
were not released.
There were reports yesterday that the kidnappers were part of the Mous
Ismail sub-clan of the Habr Yunis, which is controlled by rebel militiamen
and wanted recognition from the local administration.
Mr Robinson, 44, is a junior Foreign Office aide and the parliamentary
private secretary to Lady Chalker, minister for overseas development. He has
worked for both the UN and the Commonwealth. Since November, Mr Worthington
has been the Labour party's foreign affairs spokesman on Africa, the Middle
East and the Indian sub-continent.

<TEXT>
TAP-Air Portugal, the loss-making state airline, said yesterday it had
reached an agreement with its flight crew on a 35 per cent rise in working
time, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Mr Jose Braz, president of the flight
attendants' union, said they had agreed to increase their maximum flying
time from 550 to 750 hours a year in return for enhanced benefits.
The government hailed the accord as a breakthrough for its plans to return
the debt-ridden company to profit by injecting Es180bn (Pounds 690m) in
fresh capital.
Pilots have already accepted the increase in flying time. However, a TAP
statement that the flight crew had also agreed to a pay freeze for this year
was disputed by the union. Mr Braz said it was still pressing for a 7 per
cent increase.
According to a TAP spokesman, the union signed an agreement accepting
whatever pay rises were decided for the whole company between 1994 and 1997.
'We have already made clear there will be no increases for anyone in 1994
and the union has clearly accepted that.'

whatever wage increases were determined for the whole company between 1994
and 1997. 'We have already made it clear there will be no increases for
anyone in 1994 and the union has clearly accepted that,' he said.
However, Mr Jose Braz, president of the union representing TAP's 1,300
flight attendants, said that the company was deliberately misinterpreting
the agreement and that the union was still pressing for a 7 per cent wage
increase.
He said they had agreed maximum flying time would rise from 550 to 750 hours
a year in return for a monthly expenses subsidy of Es25,000-Es75,000 (Pounds
96-Pounds 288), higher commission on in-flight sales and free flight
insurance.
TAP's 436 pilots have already accepted the increase in flying time although
the issue of any pay rise is still unresolved. Negotiations with ground
staff on pay and conditions have also yet to reach a conclusion.
None of TAP's 9,500 workers received a pay rise last year and Mr Fernando
Santos Martins, TAP president, has said the company cannot afford one this
year.
Like the company, the government has also interpreted the accord with the
cabin attendants as an agreement to a wage freeze. It hailed the agreement
as a breakthrough for its plans to return the debt-ridden company to profit
by injecting Es180bn (Pounds 690m) in fresh capital and establishing labour
peace.
Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, transport minister, said it supported the
government's recovery plan. However, Mr Braz said strikes were almost
inevitable this year if a wage freeze was imposed.
The airline's accumulated debt reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating
losses rose to Es35bn, the worst result in the company's history. Portugal
is seeking approval from the European Commission for a plan to bring the
company back to profit in 1996 by injecting new capital and reducing the
workforce by 2,400 people.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Car sales end year-long decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales rose by an estimated 6 per cent to 1.023m in
January, halting 12 months of unbroken decline in the European market.
New car sales in 1993 fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the
steepest decline since the war.
Carmakers' forecasts suggest only a marginal recovery this year of 1-2 per
cent.
According to industry estimates, sales in January were higher in 11 of 17
markets across west Europe, led by big increases in three of the large
volume markets, the UK, France and Spain.
New car sales fell by 10 per cent in Italy, however, and sales in Germany
were little changed, with an estimated fall of 1 per cent.
Motor industry leaders cautioned that the apparent strength of the overall
market in January was misleading, as sales a year ago had been depressed by
changes in taxation and exhaust emissions regulations.
New car sales in Spain last month were 28.6 per cent higher than a year ago
but were still 26 per cent below the average for January during the last
five years.
Sales in France rose last month by 15 per cent year-on-year, but according
to the French carmakers' federation the underlying trend in demand was still
downward after eliminating distorting factors.
Among the big six volume carmakers, Ford and General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall)
both gained market share helped by their large presence in the UK, where the
overall market grew by 20 per cent year-on-year.
The Volkswagen group of Germany and Fiat of Italy, both of which plunged
into heavy losses last year, continued to lose market share in January, as
they suffered in particular from the weakness of their home markets.
Among the specialist carmakers Mercedes-Benz has reversed a long period of
decline and has overtaken BMW, its arch domestic rival, which had outsold
Mercedes-Benz for the last two years.
Mercedes-Benz's fortunes have been boosted by the successful launch last
summer of its new C-Class executive range.
BMW will take on a new scale in Europe, however, through its planned
purchase of Rover from British Aerospace. Rover, the strongest performer
among leading carmakers in the west European market last year, clearly
outperformed BMW in January.
It increased its sales by an estimated 17 per cent year-on-year to capture a
market share of 3.5 per cent, while BMW's sales declined by 5 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Former Italian export credit chief extradited: Firrao faces
corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss authorities yesterday extradited to Italy Mr Ruggero Firrao, a
former head of Sace, the Italian export credit guarantee organisation, to
face corruption charges.
Mr Firrao is the sixth person in a year to have been arrested in connection
with alleged large-scale abuses of Sace credit guarantees.
He was arrested last September by Swiss police after the issue of an
international arrest warrant.
According to Rome magistrates, Mr Firrao is alleged to have received at
least L1.4bn (Pounds 567,260) from three Italian companies in exchange for
Sace paying indemnities to them for work carried out in Libya, Tunisia and
Turkey.
Some of these monies were allegedly shared with two other members of Sace.
Mr Firrao, aged 70, and a one-time member of the executive committee of the
Bank of Italy, left Sace in 1985 and became a consultant also working for
the organisation.
In a separate development, Rome magistrates have begun investigations into
the role played by Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, the former chairman of BNL, in
granting credits to Mandelli, a Piacenza-based robotics group recently
placed in liquidation.
Mr Cantoni stepped down as chairman on Monday after a special board meeting;
and on Tuesday the Bank of Italy passed papers on BNL's relationship with
Mandelli to the magistrates.
BNL is Mandelli's biggest creditor with outstanding loans of over L100bn.
The magistrates are understood to be investigating a loan of L75bn to
Mandelli in December 1991 via BNL's offices in London.
The explanations for the purpose of this loan apparently did not satisfy
Bank of Italy inspectors and the magistrates are now trying to ascertain
whether the funds were used to buy out a stake held in an engineering
company, which was ultimately owned by Mr Cantoni's family interests.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Russia 'must print money or face crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new Russian government is in a critical financial position and will need
to print vast quantities of money to avoid financial collapse, Mr Jakov
Urinson, first deputy economics minister, told the state duma (lower house)
yesterday.
Mr Urinson said 75 per cent of Russian enterprises were urgently calling for
priority support because of heavy debts, and that the budget deficit in the
first quarter of the year had already mounted to Rbs12,000bn.
In an account which lay much blame at the door of the former administration,
Mr Urinson said the government's failure to pay wages and other bills last
year had left a huge budget deficit in the first quarter of this year. At
the same time, short-term, three-month bonds issued by the last government
were now falling due, to the tune of Rbs850bn.
Mr Urinson said the demands from enterprises for more credits had aggravated
the crisis, and that a document was being prepared discriminating between
those enteprises needing funding and those which should be allowed to fail.
He said Rbs130,000bn would be set aside for investment in the forthcoming
budget - with the share of investment going to defence unchanged, but the
security budget being raised. Some 40 per cent of expenditure would be
devoted to social spending.
The target for monthly inflation by the end of the year was 10 per cent, he
said, and the government was aiming to reduce the budget deficit to 5-6 per
cent of gross national product.
The crisis appears to be compounded by a lack of any new ideas from the
government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin whose members had sworn to fight
inflation and budget deficits by means other than the monetary ones favoured
by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
former first deputy prime minister for the economy.
Mr Fyodorov, who was present at the hearings as a parliamentary deputy,
said: 'If we don't stop the collapse of the financial system we will have to
change the government every three months.'
In newspaper interviews, Mr Gaidar said attempts were being made in plans
put forward by academics and former ministers, to reinstate controls which
would prevent stabilisation of the economy. These would 'bring the country
back to chaos,' he said.
However, Mr Urinson said the much-criticised high taxes would stay, but
enterprises' bank accounts would be scrutinised more rigorously and further
controls would be put on payments to regions and republics within Russia.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Turkey plans big state sell-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Turkey yesterday unveiled an ambitious privatisation programme, aiming to
sell Dollars 20bn of state companies in the next two years.
The programme, announced by Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, new head of the Public
Participation Administration, the government's privatisation authority,
envisages proceeds of Dollars 2.6bn this year and Dollars 18bn in 1995 -
much of that from the disposal of the state PTT telephone monopoly. In
addition, the closure of loss-making industries is estimated to create
savings of a further Dollars 7.3bn.
Since 1985, hindered by legal wrangles and parliamentary and labour
opposition, the PPA has raised just Dollars 1.7bn. Hitherto most sales have
been of minority stakes, often in private companies, such as the current
issue of Tofas, which assembles Fiat cars, where the global offering next
month of the PPA's 21 per cent is expected to realise Dollars 500m.
The new urgency reflects the need to close the budget gap, and restore
policy credibility, amid worries that Turkey could lose out if a spate of
asset sales across Europe soaks up international investor demand.
Turkey is set to sign an Dollars 84m technical assistance credit with the
World Bank next week. In an unusual move the Bank, worried the programme
could falter, has set performance conditions, which require Turkey to meet
an agreed timetable on asset sales.
The loan will finance a feasibility study for the Zonguldak region, looking
at retraining schemes in the event of closure of the loss-making coal mines
corporation, as envisaged in the PPA's new programme. The loan will also
cover the cost of foreign advisers, public relations and legal expenses.
Chase Manhattan is leading an advisory consortium, including the UK bank
Kleinwort Benson, on the sales of Tupras, the refineries concern and Petrol
Ofisi, the petrol retailer. The PPA's ambition is to complete the sales this
year.
The programme for 1995 looks even more ambitious. The PTT disposal will
account for the bulk of the 1995 revenues. However, court action currently
blocks all government efforts to prepare the company for sale.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: West plays down warning from Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's opposition to air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia,
repeated yesterday by Mr Anatoly Adamishin, the first deputy foreign
minister, is not yet causing much concern to the west.
There are two reasons. First, western diplomats believe that, despite their
protests yesterday, the Russian leadership will not react dramatically if
air strikes go ahead. Second, they believe that Russia, with the US, is
being drawn into the negotiating process and understands that no-one in the
west wants strikes except as a last resort.
However, it is recognised that President Boris Yeltsin and his government
are under strong pressure from nationalists. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the ultra-right Liberal Democratic party, said on Wednesday in parliament
that he would destroy the countries of those pilots who bombed Serbian
positions.
Less vividly, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a former presidential adviser, warned
that the 'consensus' which had existed with the west on the conflict would
be destroyed by air strikes. 'The ability of the Russian government to play
the role of loyal partner is limited . . . by public opinion.'
One senior diplomat who had held a session with foreign ministry officials
on the issue yesterday said that the Russians had questioned whether the UN
mandate allowed air strikes. They argued that the effect would be to drive
the Serbs and Moslems out of the negotiating process, the former in protest
and the latter because they would assume the west was now on their side.
Mr Adamishin's comments yesterday - he said that 'making threats and
ultimatums is not Nato's business' - were aimed largely at ensuring that the
UN was in charge of the process.
The US state department said that Russia's objections 'did not differ in
some cases from the concerns of some European allies'. Mr James Collins, US
ambassador at large for the former Soviet states, has had discussions with
Russian officials and was said by one diplomat last night to be satisfied
that Moscow was not too alarmed by the prospect of strikes.
However, it is clear that the general agreements between the west and Russia
on foreign policy have recently been under strain over the expansion of
Russian power in the former Soviet states.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Clinton wins respite from the clamour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nato ultimatum buys President Bill Clinton some immediate relief from
public pressure, but this may grow again if Bosnian Serbs do not withdraw
their guns from around Sarajevo or if other Moslem enclaves under UN
protection come under renewed fire.
The drumbeat for action had been growing louder in Washington this week in
Congress, in opinion polls and in the media. But, as the Congressional
Democratic leadership reported after a meeting with Mr Clinton late on
Wednesday, the general caveat is that the US should not act alone and should
not insert its own troops to enforce a settlement.
Reflecting this, initial editorial comment yesterday about the new Nato
approach was by no means favourable. Both the New York Times and the
Washington Post said that air strikes, while 'emotionally satisfying' as
retaliation against the Serbs, would not in themselves induce a settlement.
The Times argued again that 'the surest way out in the long term' was to
lift the UN arms embargo to permit Bosnia 'to defend itself.' Its columnist,
William Safire, positing the choice of 'intervention now or disaster later,'
wrote that 'peace in the Balkans will come not when the Moslems agree to be
good victims, nor when Christians and Moslems 'get tired of killing each
other,' in Clinton's callous phrase, but when a good ol' European balance of
power is achieved'.
The Post, echoing an argument used often this week by Mr Laurence
Eagleburger, the former secretary of state and a Balkan expert, wrote that
'it is American credibility that concerns us most,' a problem that would
only be compounded if this latest Nato threat turned out to be 'empty'. It
concluded: 'More talk policy is an obscenity. If the government isn't
conducting a serious policy, it should shut up.'
Divisions inside the administration still persist on what to do if the Nato
ultimatum is ignored. Mr William Perry, like most secretaries of defence, is
cautious on the effectiveness of limited military force, while Mr Warren
Christopher, secretary of state, prefers diplomatic solutions.
An additional constraining force remains Russia, vehemently critical of the
air strike option. An indication of US concerns came from Mr Clinton on
Wednesday night, when he said he had tried to talk to President Yeltsin by
telephone but had been thwarted by technical problems.
The higher profile now given by the US to negotiations is both a nod in the
direction of Moscow and, according to the state department, a response to
direct appeals from Europe, led on this occasion by France.
Nevertheless, it does involve some shift in US tactics. Having repeatedly
said that it would be wrong to exert undue pressure on the Moslems, because
they have been the principal victims, the administration has now undertaken
precisely this mission, hedged about as it is with qualifications about
concessions that can reasonably be expected from the Bosnian government.
The current US diplomatic effort, according to Mr Clinton, is to determine
Bosnia's 'legitimate bedrock requirements' for a peace settlement.
Yesterday, Mr Mohammed Sacirbey, the UN ambassador, defined these as the
creation of 'a viable state,' the return of refugees 'to homes from which
they have been ethnically cleansed,' and access to the Adriatic Sea, now
under negotiation with Croatia.
Mr Clinton himself has been conspicuously cautious in his own prognoses.
'There is no such thing as a risk-free air operation,' he said and no
guarantee that the warring parties can be brought to a settlement. On both
scores, any respite he has obtained may be brief.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: West creates new uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor

<TEXT>
Whichever way one looks at it, the Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to
withdraw their artillery surrounding Sarajevo within 10 days or face air
strikes, has created a new ball game.
It marks a fresh departure in the policy of the Atlantic alliance, which has
never before planned to take offensive action and has always in the past
refused to intervene in conflicts which do not directly threaten its own
territory.
The calculation of members of the alliance, of course, is that the Bosnian
Serbs will comply with their demand to withdraw their heavy weapons and
tanks within a 20km zone from the centre of Sarajevo or place them under
United Nations control, thus making air strikes unnecessary. That
calculation is based on the belief that, in contrast with previous
declarations of the same kind, Nato's latest warning is likely to be taken
seriously by the Bosnian Serbs, because for the first time it is tied to a
specific deadline.
Similar threats, notably in August 1993 and last month, did not have a
deadline attached to them and could therefore be seen as insubstantial
bluster, which did not need to be taken too literally.
If the Bosnian Serbs fail to comply this time, Nato does not have any other
choice than to carry out its threat. If it does not do so, it will lose what
little credibility it still has and might as well pack its bags and admit
that it has no further role to play as an effective security organisation in
a post-cold war Europe.
A new ball game has also been created on the ground in Bosnia, with
unforeseeable consequences. The fact that Nato, some of whose members are
the biggest contributors to UN forces in Bosnia, has largely abandoned its
neutral role and has adopted a clear anti-Bosnian Serb stance, is likely to
make the UN's peace-keeping and aid operations much more hazardous.
The Bosnian Serbs have already made clear that they will not hesitate to
retaliate against UN forces if air strikes are launched. But even if these
air attacks do not take place, the Serbs could make life very difficult for
both the peacekeepers and the aid workers, particularly in enclaves such as
Srebrenica, where Canadian troops are encircled by Bosnian Serbs.
The main weakness of the Nato declaration is that it concentrates entirely
on the situation in Sarajevo. It does not seem to be based on a long-term
strategy for the solution of the 22-month-old conflict, other than
reaffirming its general support for a negotiated settlement.
The best outcome is that, as the result of the UN's and Nato's more muscular
stance, a separate agreement can now be negotiated for Sarajevo,
demilitarising the Bosnian capital and placing it under UN administration.
Such an agreement could form a building-block for an overall Bosnian peace
agreement, but no more than that.
There are many more complicated problems which will remain to be solved even
if a satisfactory status for Sarajevo can be agreed between the warring
parties. For the Bosnian Moslems, it is at least equally important that the
33 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina's territory which is due to be allocated
to them is properly consolidated and amounts to a viable nation, however
small. At the moment that is certainly not the case, since most of the
Moslem enclaves which have been designated as 'safe areas' by the UN are
surrounded by Serb territory.
Territorial disputes between Moslems and Croats continue to be the cause of
some of the most bitter fighting in central Bosnia.
To believe, therefore, that a comprehensive peace settlement in Bosnia is
just around the corner as the result of Nato's new muscular stance is
clearly an illusion. It will have achieved a worthwhile result if relief can
be brought to the martyred population of Sarajevo. But that will merely
switch attention to other disaster areas in Bosnia.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Calculating risks to the peacekeepers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
The first challenge for Nato tacticians in implementing a threat of air
strikes in Bosnia will be to find and destroy gun emplacements.
The emplacements, which are small and mobile, can be found through analysing
the trajectory of an incoming shell, or by 'forward control teams' - 40 of
which Nato has working covertly in Bosnia, according to Mr Edward Foster of
the Royal United Services Institute in London. These teams can pick out
targets for attacking aircraft.
Those aircraft are likely to be F-16 fighters based in Aviano and
Villafranca, northern Italy and possibly Jaguar aircraft based in Gioia Del
Colle, southern Italy. To deal with tanks, Nato may also bring in A-10
'Warthog' anti-tank aircraft, and possibly AC-130 Spectre aircraft, based at
Brindisi.
On the Serbian side, a number of defences might be employed. They could
mount an air defence, although Nato could deploy Tornado F-3 aircraft in
convoy with F-16s and A-10s to deter this - Tornados F-3s can spot incoming
aircraft early and fire long-range missiles at them. They could also fire
anti-aircraft guns. These have already been used in Bosnia as heavy machine
guns, says Mr Foster. Nato forces would deal with these in the same way as
artillery and mortars.
More difficult could be surface-to-air missiles. According to the Military
Balance, published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the
Serbian side could have as many as 60 radar-guided SA6 missiles. The radar
can be jammed, or radar-homing missiles, which follow the radar signal to
its source, can be used. The US aircraft carrier Saratoga in the Adriatic
sea is carrying this equipment.
Finally, Serbian forces could respond to air attacks by retaliating against
the 11,000 UN troops on the ground.
Some, like the British, have Warrior armoured vehicles, which are proof
against all but heavy weapons, but others, including the French and
Ukrainian forces in Sarajevo and Canadians in Srebrenica have only vehicles
that will protect them against small arms. The most vulnerable of all, will
be the troops' support units and the UNHCR relief workers.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Paris seeks broader peace mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday sought to cement its new diplomatic partnership with the US
over Bosnia by raising the possibility of an American mediator, and maybe
even a Russian one, joining the peace effort.
An Elysee spokesman said this idea of enlarging the Owen-Stoltenberg peace
mission had been raised at a meeting yesterday between President Francois
Mitterrand's chief of staff and Mr Peter Tarnoff, the US under-secretary of
state for political affairs, and Mr Charles Redman, President Clinton's
special envoy on Yugoslavia. The agreed aim, he said, was 'not to launch a
big new diplomatic initiative, but to reinvigorate the existing peace
process with American help'.
Having persuaded Nato to adopt its military ultimatum on Wednesday, France
and the US turned their attention yesterday to diplomacy. Mr Alain Juppe,
the French foreign minister, also met the two Americans and said after
wards: 'There is now a common Franco-American desire to relaunch a political
solution . . . involving maintaining pressure on the Serbs and Croats, and
an effort of persuasion on the Moslems.'
The US envoys were reported to have promised to discuss with the Moslems the
whole of their demands and to see which 'reasonable' demands could be worked
into a modified version of the European peace plan.
But the US continued to insist that the Serbs must still make most of the
concessions and that, if sanctions against Serbia were progressively
removed, as the Europeans have suggested, some leverage on Belgrade should
be retained until the very end - by, for example, maintaining the freeze on
Serb assets abroad. French officials said they largely agreed with these
points.
In the wake of the Sarajevo ultimatum, the Elysee spokesman said US and
French officials confirmed the earlier Nato decision to help peace-keeping
forces in Tuzla and Srebrenica, and to examine other areas for similar
action, like Mostar or Vitez.
Mr Mitterrand and his government were said to favour sending the aircraft
carrier Foch to the Adriatic 'because it could be useful if our troops get
into difficulty', the spokesman said. But the carrier's dispatch might be
delayed for a few more days 'so that it would not be interpreted as a
unilateral French act, outside what Nato is doing'.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Nato lays to rest its past ambiguity on
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nato's ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to pull back their artillery from the
vicinity of Sarajevo or face air-strikes marks a turning point.
For the first time in the 22-month-old civil war, the alliance has committed
itself to using force according to a clearly defined set of criteria. The
ambiguity of past communiques has gone.
The ultimatum may also come to be seen as the moment when Nato stopped the
rot in its own house and started to fashion a new, productive military
co-operation between the US and France, the two countries that made the
running throughout nearly 13 hours of talks last Wednesday.
The carnage wrought by a mortar attack on Sarajevo market last weekend
undoubtedly created a political tailwind in favour of action; but a second
calculation in Brussels was the damage to Nato's credibility if the alliance
failed to live up to its own promises to prevent the strangulation of
Sarajevo.
As one senior Nato diplomat said: 'There was a recognition that there was a
risk to the alliance . . . . That led people to say 'We have got to come to
terms with this now'.'
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, expressed a mixture of delight
and relief that Nato unity had come through virtually unscathed (with the
exception of Greece 'disassociating' itself from the decision without
blocking it). 'This is a historic moment. It is a decisive moment in the
life of the alliance.'
But Mr Worner made clear that he was not predicting that Nato, the alliance
founded in 1949 to defend western Europe against communism, would soon be
moving into a combat role in former Yugoslavia.
Like President Bill Clinton and other western leaders, Mr Worner hopes that
the mere threat of Nato warplanes will be enough to clear the hills of Serb
and Bosnian government artillery, establishing a firmer basis for a
permanent ceasefire and a more promising start for a political settlement
built around the demilitarisation of Sarajevo.
Diplomats at Nato headquarters have over the past week suggested there is
little appetite for protracted air strikes; still less is there a desire to
commit the extra ground forces needed to consolidate bombed terrain.
The extent of Franco-American co-operation in the drafting of the ultimatum
was at first sight remarkable, given recent public squabbling. The Clinton
administration's opposition to commit troops to the UN peace-keeping effort
while reserving its own position on the UN-European plan for a political
settlement is partly to blame; but so too is France's long-standing
ambiguous attitude to Nato itself, where it is a political member but
remains outside the military command.
Lately, however, Paris has shown signs of re-evaluating its position on
Nato, recognising that for the moment it remains the best security bet in
town. This week, France and the US worked hand-in-glove as great powers and
the smaller states followed.
Britain kept quiet. It would be easy, but wrong, to read this passivity as
one more sign of strained relations with the Clinton administration. For as
one UK diplomat observed, there is no greater interest for Washington and
London at the moment than binding France further into Nato, the one
organisation which guarantees US engagement in the affairs of the continent.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Nato communique rejects extension of
deadline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Council: (1) expresses its indignation at the indiscriminate attacks
which have once again struck the people of Sarajevo in recent days;
(2) notes that the siege of Sarajevo is continuing, and that consequently
the Bosnian Serbs bear the main responsibility for the tragic loss of
civilian life that results from it;
(3) reaffirms the Alliance's support for a negotiated settlement of the
conflict in Bosnia, agreeable to all parties;
(4) recalls that on 11th January 1994, the Heads of State and Government of
the members of the Alliance reaffirmed their readiness, in accordance with
the Alliance decisions of 2nd and 9th August 1993, to carry out air strikes
in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo;
(5) commends the European Union Action Plan of 22nd November 1993 to secure
a negotiated settlement, and considers, in this context and with regard to
UN Security Council Resolutions 824, 836, and 844 that the lifting of the
siege of Sarajevo could be a step toward the placing of Sarajevo under UN
administration, in conformity with that plan; also commends the current
efforts of the UN negotiators toward securing the demilitarization of
Sarajevo; (6) condemns the continuing siege of Sarajevo and, with a view to
ending it calls for the withdrawal, or regrouping and placing under Unprofor
control, within ten days, of heavy weapons (including tanks, artillery
pieces, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, missiles and anti-aircraft
weapons) of the Bosnian Serb forces located in an area within 20km of the
centre of Sarajevo, and excluding an area within two kilometres of the
centre of Pale;
(7) calls upon the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, within the same period,
to place the heavy weapons in its possession within the Sarajevo exclusion
zone described above under Unprofor control, and to refrain from attacks
launched from the current confrontation lines in the city;
(8) calls upon the parties to respect the ceasefire; all concerned should
make every effort, during this ten-day period, to achieve by agreement the
withdrawal or control of heavy weapons as called for in the preceding
paragraphs; failure to reach such agreement will not result in the extension
of this period;
(9) authorizes the Nato Military Authorities to support Unprofor in carrying
out its task of identifying heavy weapons that have not been withdrawn or
regrouped in conformity with these decisions;
(10) decides that, ten days from 2400 GMT 10th February 1994, heavy weapons
of any of the parties found within the Sarajevo exclusion zone, unless
controlled by Unprofor, will, along with their direct and essential military
support facilities, be subject to Nato air strikes which will be conducted
in close co-ordination with the UN Secretary General and will be consistent
with the North Atlantic Council's decisions of 2nd and 9th August 1993;
(11) accepts, effective today, the request of the UN Secretary General of
6th February and accordingly authorises the Commander-in-Chief, Allied
Forces Southern Europe to launch air strikes, at the request of the United
Nations, against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo
(including any outside the exclusion zone) which are determined by Unprofor
to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets in that city;
(12) demands strict respect for the safety of Unprofor and other UN and
relief agency personnel throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the right of
free access of all these personnel to Sarajevo;
(13) asks the Secretary General to inform the Secretary General of the
United Nations of these decisions.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Electricity generators to escape monopolies reference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry's regulator, is
today expected to announce that National Power and PowerGen, the UK's two
largest power generators, will not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The move will clear the way for the government to sell its 40 per cent stake
in the companies later this year, probably in July or October, and realise
at least Pounds 4bn of the Pounds 5.5bn target it is aiming to raise from
privatisation receipts in the next financial year.
The sum the government will raise may grow significantly in the next few
months as the two companies' share prices have been held back by fears of a
possible reference.
Shares in both companies, and in the entire electricity sector, were down
yesterday amid market uncertainty over Prof Littlechild's announcement
today. PowerGen fell 17p to 525p and National Power 12p to 461p.
However, in a statement of more than 20 pages, Prof Littlechild will say
that both National Power and PowerGen 'have agreed to give undertakings such
that a reference is not required'.
It is thought that the generators have agreed with the regulator that prices
in the electricity pool - through which suppliers like the regional
electricity companies buy their power supplies - should not rise above a
certain level.
The most likely cap is for two years at between 2.4p and 2.55p per kilowatt
hour, about 7 per cent below levels in the first half of the 1994-95 year.
Today's statement is also likely to include reference to the possibility of
generators selling some of their power stations to other companies.
Immediate disposals are unlikely, however.
Prof Littlechild promised last July to make an early decision on a reference
after a sharp rise in pool prices. He has missed two deadlines to make a
decision, promised at first for 1993 and then for mid-January this year.
The generators play a crucial role in the determination of pool prices. They
bid a series of prices for each of their power stations for every half hour
of the day. The main determinant of prices is the price of the most
expensive plant needed to supply electricity throughout the country in any
half hour period.
Critics of the pool system say it gives the generators too much power and
that the generators effectively operate a duopoly. However, few critics
supported a reference, which they believe would affect the whole electricity
supply industry.
Prof Littlechild has been keen to see the generators selling some of their
power stations since this would increase competition and, he believes,
reduce prices.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Russian call prompts urgent UN debate: Moscow wants security
council to demilitarise Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council decided last night to hold an open
debate on Bosnia today, after Russia pressed for an urgent session in the
hope of averting Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
The UN move came as the Serbs around Sarajevo were already taking some steps
to comply with western demands to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital. At
the same time, however, a Bosnian Serb officer indicated that UN aid workers
would be at risk if air strikes were launched against Serbs.
Russia's UN ambassador played down concern that it was set on confrontation
at the UN to try to block the air strikes threatened in the Nato ultimatum
to the Serbs on Wednesday.
Instead, he said, Moscow was intent on 'quieting down the situation' and
wanted the Security Council to examine 'practical ways of demilitarising
Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the UN'.
After consultations, the 15-member security council decided to hold a debate
open to all 184 UN members, but with no decision, resolution or vote. This
avoided any possibility of disagreement leading to a veto on UN action by
any of the world powers.
Moslem and non-aligned nations also called for a UN meeting, though they
support air strikes and favour lifting the arms embargo on the Moslem-led
Bosnian government.
In Bosnia yesterday, Serb forces around Sarajevo allowed UN peacekeeping
troops to move into six frontline zones as part of a plan to lift the siege
of the Bosnian capital.
But the ceasefire which started at midday was shattered late last night when
three artillery shells and a heavy burst of machinegun fire struck the city.
The firing came from the direction of one of the most fiercely contested and
volatile frontline positions not yet handed over to UN peacekeepers.
The deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army warned meanwhile that UN aid
workers would have to remain at their posts if Nato launched threatened air
strikes. But General Milan Gvero denied that the aid workers would be held
hostage.
In Geneva Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said during
negotiations with Moslems and Croats that his forces would implement an
agreement to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo and put the
weapons under UN control.
At the same meeting, the UN agreed to set up a special inquiry into last
weekend's Sarajevo market massacre which led to the Nato ultimatum. The UN
decision cleared the way for fresh peace talks between the warring Bosnian
factions. The Serbs had threatened to walk out of the talks unless an
inquiry was set up. The peace talks resume today.
Nato's ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery,
mortars and tanks from a 20km zone around the centre of Sarajevo or place
them under UN control within 10 days. It also calls on the Moslem-led
Bosnian government to put its heavy weapons in the same exclusion zone under
UN control.

FT  11 FEB 94 / General Motors returns to profit in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' core North American automotive business returned to profit
in the final months of last year, producing its first quarterly after-tax
profit for four years.
The Dollars 427m (Pounds 292m) net income in North America, with a solid
performance in Europe in the face of a weak car market, helped the US's
biggest car manufacturer to match the most optimistic stock market
expectations. It reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 1.2bn, or
Dollars 1.28 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 652m or Dollars 1.25 a
share in the comparable period a year before.
GM continued to predict a return to net profits for this year as a whole in
its North American operations, although it said the need to adapt
manufacturing facilities for new models would lead to the loss of some
production capacity during the year.
GM's net income for 1993 as a whole was Dollars 2.5bn, compared with a loss
of Dollars 2.7bn for 1992. Sales increased to Dollars 125bn from Dollars
119bn and gross profit margin to 15 per cent from 11.1 per cent.
The improvement stemmed from a mix of cost-cutting and higher vehicle sales.
Much of the benefit came from closing plants and lower materials costs, said
Mr Rick Wagoner, chief financial officer.
GM's results are comparable with those of its big US rivals, Chrysler and
Ford, both of which have also reported a marked improvement in 1993 as the
US market has expanded. The car companies have noted, though, that they need
to generate enough cash while the market is strong to strengthen their
balance sheets before the next cyclical downturn.
With an unfunded pension liability of Dollars 22.3bn at the end of 1993 (up
from Dollars 14bn a year before), GM has more ground to make up in that
regard than the others.
Productivity gains had reduced the time it took to manufacture each vehicle
by more than 10 per cent last year, the company said. It added that further
double-digit gains would need to be made if the company were to rebuild its
finances.
GM's share of total vehicle sales in the US fell slightly to 33.2 per cent
last year as it dropped less profitable sales to car rental companies.
However, its vehicle sales in North America were up 6.6 per cent from the
year before. The rise more than offset a 7.9 per cent decline in sales
overseas as the European car market weakened, and there was an increase of
1.3 per cent in the number of cars sold worldwide to 7.9m.
After-tax profits in Europe last year fell to Dollars 605m from Dollars
1.3bn the year before, holding down GM's overseas profits to Dollars 1.2bn,
compared with Dollars 1.5bn the year before.
GM's shares fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on profit-taking, much as
those of the other big US carmakers.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Russia condemns Nato threat of air strikes: Moscow calls for
urgent UN Security Council meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, ROBERT MAUTHNER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security
Council in an attempt to head off Nato air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs, threatened in a Nato declaration on Wednesday.
The council, which is expected to meet today, should examine 'practical ways
of demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the United
Nations', said Mr Grigory Karasin, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, had a duty to consult
the council before declaring any action, Mr Karasin added.
In Washington, however, a senior aide to President Bill Clinton said he saw
no need for a Security Council session. He said existing council resolutions
gave enough authority to launch air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs refused to
pull back their heavy weapons.
Another White House official said Mr Clinton had been trying without success
to telephone Russian President Boris Yeltsin who, according to a Kremlin
spokesman, had retired to his country residence with a cold.
The Russian demand underlines widening differences between Moscow and Nato
on the question of air strikes. And it threatens to end a broad agreement on
the international response to fighting in the former Yugoslavia.
Nato's ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy
artillery and tanks surrounding Sarajevo from a 20km zone around the centre
of the capital, or place them under UN control. It also calls on the mainly
Moslem government of Bosnia-Hercegovina to place its heavy weapons within
the same exclusion zone under UN control.
In Bosnia yesterday, there were signs the Serbs were already acting to avoid
air strikes. Serb forces around Sarajevo allowed UN peacekeeping troops to
move into six frontline zones as part of a plan to lift the siege of the
Bosnian capital. The troop movements came after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, said during peace talks in Geneva that his forces would
implement an agreement to withdraw their artillery and put it under UN
control.
In Moscow, Mr Anatoly Adamishin, Russia's first deputy foreign minister,
challenged Nato's right to make 'threats and ultimatums to use force'.
However, he also stressed that Russia shared the horror expressed at the
deaths caused by the mortar attack in Sarajevo last weekend, and he
saidRussia would agree to 'press for 'peace by force' if if all members of
the Security Council agree'.
Western diplomats acknowledge that the Russian government is under growing
pressure from nationalist forces. But they believe that air strikes would
not seriously damage the west's relationship with Russia.
Russia's request for an emergency council meeting was due to be discussed at
closed-door consultations at the UN in New York last night and be part of a
debate already called for by Bosnia and Islamic governments in support of
the Nato action.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Britain 'bowed to US pressure' over Bosnia ultimatum:
Decision to support Nato plan averted damaging rift with Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain acquiesced in this week's Nato ultimatum to the Serbian forces
besieging Sarajevo only after a blunt warning from the US that refusal would
permanently damage the western alliance.
The acknowledgement that Britain had bowed to US and French pressure came as
Conservative MPs voiced deep concern that the threat of Nato air strikes
might draw the west into greater military involvement in Bosnia.
After a meeting with senior ministers, the MPs said they would push for an
immediate withdrawal of the 2,500 British troops in Bosnia if the 10-day
ultimatum brought an escalation in the conflict.
But as the government temporarily suspended its aid convoys in Bosnia for
fear of retaliation by Serbian forces, ministers admitted that the choice
had been between supporting the Nato plan and a damaging rift with the US.
It is understood that President Bill Clinton made clear US determination to
take action to end the siege of Sarajevo during a telephone conversation
with Mr John Major on Wednesday.
Senior ministers said Mr Clinton believed that failure to act would
strengthen the hand of those in Washington arguing for a much faster and
bigger disengagement of US forces from Europe.
Downing Street last night denied that the conversation between Mr Major and
Mr Clinton had forced the government's hand, insisting the decision to back
the Nato plan had been taken before the two men spoke.
However, then ministers said a shift in the French stance in favour of the
air strikes also undercut Mr Major's position that air strikes posed too
serious a threat to the troops on the ground. France has committed more
troops than Britain to Bosnia.
One senior minister said that in such circumstances it would have been
'disastrous' for the future of the alliance to oppose the ultimatum.
Mr Major, whose government was seriously at odds with Mr Clinton over the
admission to the US this month of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader,
judged that Britain could not afford another damaging breach.
Significant tensions still remained within the cabinet before the decision
to go along with the US was taken.
The ministers said the cabinet had agreed to the ultimatum only after
military commanders on the ground said limited use of air power was feasible
and that the risk to British troops could be contained. It was also agreed
that if air strikes failed in their objective, there would be no further
escalation in British military involvement.
In a Commons statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, alluded
repeatedly to the tensions within the western alliance when he said there
was a need to preserve a united front within Nato. The government had backed
the ultimatum because 'there is a strong British interest in maintaining the
strength and solidarity of Nato'.
He also emphasised hopes that the demilitarisation of Sarajevo would speed
the process towards a political settlement in Bosnia. But he admitted: 'No
one would pretend that this was an easy decision.'
Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in an
attempt to calm Tory backbench fears at a hastily convened meeting last
night. The two ministers stressed that contingency plans had been made to
secure the safety of British troops and, if necessary, to withdraw them.
The ministers stressed also the advantages of the new US commitment to more
active involvement in the search for a peaceful settlement. Washington had
made it clear it is still opposed to the involvement of US troops, but
British ministers hope the Bosnian Moslems will be persuaded that the US can
no longer be relied on as a 'secret ally'.

BSN, the French food manufacturer, is increasing its equity stake in Delta
Dairies, Greece's largest food processor, from 10 to 20 per cent.
BSN will take up 70 per cent of a Dr18bn (Dollars 70.5m) rights issue to be
launched by Delta next month. A total of 3.01m new shares is to be offered
in the two-for-10 issue.
Mr Dimitri Daskalopoulos, Delta's managing director, said BSN's increased
participation would 'provide a boost in financing and know-how, allowing
Delta to expand more aggressively, both in western Europe and the Balkans'.
BSN acquired a 10 per cent stake in t Delta in July 1993, and agreed then to
co-operate in its efforts to penetrate Balkan markets.
Mr Daskalopoulos said up to 50 per cent of funds raised would be used to
finance new projects, mainly in Romania and Bulgaria.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Preussag profit tumbles to
DM193m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Preussag, the diversified German steel, plant construction, engineering,
energy and metals trading group, saw net profits tumble to DM193m (Dollars
109m) for the year to the end of September, after a loss of DM164m in its
steel division.
The result was less than half the DM440m earned in 1991-92, but still showed
the value of being such a broad-based industrial holding company, said Mr
Michael Frenzel, the newly-installed chief executive. The dividend will be
maintained at DM10.
He announced a big push to 'internationalise' further the group, which
already has 44 per cent of its DM23.29bn annual turnover in foreign sales,
although 77 per cent of that export trade is within Europe.
Mr Frenzel said the aim was now to promote Preussag sales and investments in
new markets, particularly in north America and in Asia. The group signed a
co-operation agreement with Sumitomo, the Japanese trading company, in
December to market its products and services in the Pacific region.
He said that results for the first quarter of the current year showed a 4
per cent increase in orders, to DM6.6bn, with a 12 per cent increase in
outstanding orders to DM13.4bn. Turnover in the quarter at DM6.1bn was
little changed on the same period of the previous financial year.
Positive results for the energy, trade and transportation, shipbuilding and
railway wagon building, plant construction and environmental technology
divisions, in spite of the difficult economic conditions, compensated for
losses from steel, non-ferrous metals and telecommunications.
Apart from the loss at Preussag Stahl, the steel subsidiary, the group had
already announced in January the need for a capital injection of up to
DM150m for MetalEurop, its ailing French subsidiary which contains all its
non-ferrous metals interests.

returns to black

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, yesterday reported a sharp
reversal in its fortunes, with a net profit of NKr1.52bn (Dollars 200m) in
1993 against a loss of NKr154m a year earlier.
The savings bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, said
although loan losses continue to be unusually high and growth in volume was
modest, the improvement was far above expectations.
The near-50 per cent decline in domestic interest rates, which contributed
to a sharp rise in bond prices, made a strong contribution to the turnround.
Sparebanken Nor will pay a dividend of NKr18 per primary capital certificate
 -a hybrid security listed on the Oslo bourse - and will allocate NKr599m to
a dividend adjustment reserve fund.
Group net interest income rose by NKr604m to NKr3.21bn, as net operating
income shot up to NKr5.35bn from NKr3.73bn. Operating expenses rose
slightly, to NKr2.46bn from NKr2.43bn. Losses on loans and guarantees dipped
to NKr1.31bn from NKr1.5bn, but the bank still achieved an operating profit
of NKr1.56bn against an operating loss of NKr271m.
The bank said the volume of defaulted loans developed 'in the right
direction'. Net non-interest-bearing loans fell to NKr1.7bn last year from
NKr2.7bn in 1992, with the loss of income on such loans representing an
estimated Nkr220m in 1993 against NKr300m the previous year.
Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage lending institution which converted to
a bank last year, reported a rise in 1993 pre-tax profit, to NKr272.5m from
NKr133m in 1992, helped by an increase in net interest income and a fall in
loan losses.
Nevertheless, the bank's shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr150.50 yesterday
on the Oslo bourse in active trading. Norgeskreditt will pay a dividend of
NKr8.50 per preference share, with the total payout reaching NKr96.4m.
Group net interest income rose to NKr313.7m, or 1.5 per cent of average
total assets, from NKr266.8m, or 1.3 per cent of average total assets.
Realised gains on bonds, certificates and foreign exchange reached NKr29.7m,
against a loss of NKr3.8m in 1992. Profits on shares amounted to NKr26m last
year, against a loss of NKr17.1m.
The bank said that a write-down of NKr6.9m of the share portfolio at the end
of 1992 was reversed in last year's first quarter, with the market value of
shareholdings at the end of last year NKr29.4m higher than the acquisition
cost.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Lisbon shares claim overruled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Portuguese court has made a landmark ruling against a group of former
shareholders seeking Es20bn (Dollars 114m) from the government in
compensation for the loss of holdings nationalised following the 1974
revolution.
The ruling in the first compensation case to reach a conclusion is a victory
for the centre-right government, which is facing at least three other
important claims in the courts.
After a bitter legal battle that began in 1987, a Lisbon civil court ruled
against the claim by five former shareholders in 10 companies, including
eight banks, that were nationalised by a Communist-led government in 1975.
The group sought Es20bn in compensation based on the market value of their
shares at the time of the nationalisation and an additional compensation to
make up for monetary depreciation. But the court ruled in favour of a
government proposal to pay them only Es1bn.
Mr Joao Rocha, one of the former shareholders, said they would take their
case to the court of appeal in Portugal. They are already pursuing a legal
action against the Portuguese state at the European Court in Strasbourg.
In what Mr Luso Soares, a lawyer for the group, described as an historic
case, they had succeeded in moving their claim out of Portugal's
administrative court system into the civil court. But judges there ruled
that nationalisation was a political act that did not require the state to
compensate former owners in full or pay interest on delayed compensation
payments.
Other cases before the courts include a claim by Mr Luis Champalimaud, an
entrepreneur, for Es1bn in compensation for the loss of holdings in 13
nationalised companies, and a claim by Mr Sergio Geraldes Barba for a
similar amount in compensation for the nationalisation of Socarmar, a
fishing company he owned.
A ruling in favour of any of these claims would be likely to trigger a rush
to the courts by other investors and former owners who lost their holdings
in the nationalisations of 1975.
Most of the state takeovers of Portugal's financial and industrial companies
have been, or will be, reversed by a reprivatisation programme that began in
1989.
However, although the government has already reached out-of-court
settlements with most foreign former shareholders, expropriated Portuguese
investors are still fighting for what they consider adequate compensation.

The popularity of Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, has dropped
sharply since the beginning of the year and he now has the support of just
over half of voters, according to an opinion poll published yesterday,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The Gallup survey for the weekly L'Express said 52 per cent of those
questioned approved of Mr Balladur's policies, down from 59 per cent a month
ago. The percentage of those who disapproved rose 8 points to 39 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Romanian senate last night approved a tough economic reform package
agreed with the International Monetary Fund that will clear the way for an
18-month standby arrangement and loans worth Dollars 700m, writes Virginia
Marsh from Bucharest.
Under the arrangement, the Romanian government has agreed to liberalise the
exchange rate by April, to take measures to cut inflation which jumped to
296 per cent in 1993, and to restructure and privatise the state sector. The
government reached agreement with the fund in December but, due to political
disputes with its left-wing and nationalist allies, did not present the
programme to parliament for ratification until this week. The loans will
provide Romania with badly-needed balance of payments support. The central
bank's hard currency reserves fell to just Dollars 40m in December.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Refugees find doors bolted: Financial constraints are
forcing Europe to tighten procedures against asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the European Commission mulls over its recent discussion paper on asylum
and immigration, a small drama has begun to unfold in Germany that threatens
to add a new edge of controversy to the debate.
Immigration offices across Germany have notified the tens of thousands of
Croat refugees who have fled from the former Yugoslavia that they will have
to start returning to Croatia from April 1.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that, if the
Croats - who number between 70,000 and 100,000 - are deported, many would
find themselves being returned to places currently controlled by the Serbs,
or else to places where their homes have been destroyed.
But with Germany facing an acute shortage of suitable accommodation for the
refugees, the authorities seem determined to lift the deportation ban which
previously guaranteed the Croats' right of refuge, even though they had not
applied for political asylum.
The German decision stems not so much from political pressure from the far
right, but rather from the intense financial constraints adding a new edge
of urgency to the EU's debate on the issue.
In the past 10 years asylum applications across Europe have risen tenfold -
from some 65,400 a year in 1982 to nearly 680,000 in 1992, with Germany
alone accounting for nearly 75 per cent of this.
One reason has been the growing availability of air travel, which has
brought political refugees from places as diverse as Sri Lanka and Somalia
into Europe's airports and sea ports.
However, another reason has been Europe's tough immigration policies, which
have left many would-be immigrants convinced that their best chance of entry
lies with an application for political asylum.
In an attempt to combat these so called 'economic migrants', the Commission
is now calling for greater co-ordination between the member states, both in
their policies to keep out the illegal migrants, and in their treatment of
legally resident immigrants.
Meanwhile, one by one the European countries have been tightening their own
asylum procedures.
Last summer Germany rescinded its constitutional right of stay for political
refugees and added new amendments to its liberal asylum laws which mean that
those entering Germany via a safe, third country can be sent back to that
country.
The British Home Office has taken on nearly 500 extra staff to deal with
asylum applications, toughened its methods of detecting fraudulent
applications and introduced vigorous new fines for airlines and ships which
carry illegal immigrants.
Partly as a result of these procedures, asylum applications fell last year
for the first time in ten years, to slightly over 550,000, compared to
679,900 in 1992.
The main factor in this was a 25 per cent fall in the German applications.
However, falls were also seen in the UK and France, which together received
a total of 55,007 last year, down from a combined total of 104,200
applications in 1991.
Meanwhile, as Mr Henrik Oleson, of the intergovernmental consultations on
refugees points out, these overall figures conceal an even greater fall in
the numbers of Third World refugees, since the total includes the huge
increase in refugees from the former Yugoslavia.
Governments insist that, even with this reduction, this figure is still far
more than European governments can bear - the immigration budget in Germany
last year reached DM5bn, while in the UK the comparable figure was Pounds
1.4bn.
However, the new procedures have provoked strong protests from some refugee
groups, who argue this is discriminating against genuine refugees.
The UNHCR has collected a dossier of stories which illustrate that in some
cases airline staff have unwittingly turned away valid claims of political
persecution, while refugees who reach Europe are often left for long periods
in limbo, with their legal rights varying significantly between countries.
The tightening of procedures has itself generated new problems for
neighbouring countries, as asylum seekers look for new points of entry.
After Germany tightened its regulations last year, both Belgium and the
Netherlands saw a rise in applications.
The European Commission believes the solution to this problem is better
co-ordination among member states, both in its treatment of legal immigrants
and in its policies to deter the false asylum seekers.
Refugee groups are already warning that if Europe adopts a more co-ordinated
policy, as the Commission's recent paper suggests, this could create a
spill-over in eastern Europe.
'We are already seeing rising numbers of refugees in countries like Poland
and the Czech republic, and these countries do not have the resources or
experience to deal with this,' says Mr Philip Rudge, director of the
European Council for Refugees and Exiles.
Unless the German government changes its latest policy, it seems that the
100,000 Croat refugees currently living Germany will soon become the latest
statistic in this trend.
Many in the refugee world argue that the best long-term solution would be a
more open immigration policy that gave would-be immigrants a chance of
entering Europe in more legal manner.

FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness crept into Glaxo shares on findings from a US health panel that
could be damaging to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug and biggest selling
treatment.
Zantac works by blocking acid formation and the health panel tentatively
concluded that some patients should be treated with antibiotics as well as
acid-blocking drugs. The news saw Glaxo shares decline 10 to 662p in spite
of the potentially beneficial effect of a stronger dollar and the launch of
a big call warrant by BZW on leading pharmaceuticals stocks. Dealers said a
US press conference, scheduled to take place after the London market closed,
could hit the stock again today.
SmithKline Beecham, which also has an ulcer treatment, Tagamet, but also
represents part of the BZW warrant, firmed a penny in the 'A's to 418p.
Tagamet comes off patent in May and analysts said the potential loss of
revenue was already in the share price.
Buying ahead of figures today saw BP improve 5 1/2 to 390 1/2 p on one of
the heaviest turnovers in the FT-SE 100 Index - 13m shares. The stock
ignored the effect of a weaker oil price and responded instead to a stronger
US currency and a smattering of pre-results recommendations.
The range of forecasts is enormous, with analysts looking for historic net
income of between Pounds 670m and Pounds 1bn and replacement cost profits of
between Pounds 757m and Pounds 1.1bn. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing was
confidently predicting that the share price would hit 500p by the end of the
year, while James Capel, Lehman Brothers and NatWest Securities were also
continuing to offer support.
Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce moved strongly against a weak market
trend as speculation that it is to merge with its US rival Pratt &amp; Whitney
returned.
The shares gained 8 at 183p in average trade of 4.7m. The talk about a
merger between the two groups first surfaced at the end of last year, but
then faded. However, one analyst dismissed yesterday's rumours, saying: 'I
cannot rule it out, but the rationalisation costs for the two rival engine
programmes would be very high indeed.'
Consideration of results from Lloyds Abbey Life saw its share price slip 15
to 447p. Analysts said the headline figure of Pounds 323.6m was in line with
expectations but the group, which is the insurance arm of Lloyds Bank, had
not included any provisions for the mis-selling of pensions. Mr Roger Harvey
of Kleinwort Benson reduced his 1994 forecast for Lloyds Abbey by Pounds 23m
to Pounds 359m. Lloyds Bank, which reports tomorrow, advanced 7 to 613p.
Analysts are looking for profits of up to Pounds 1.05bn, compared with
Pounds 801m previously.
Leading bank stocks fell sharply in early trading in response to weaker
gilts prices. However, most recovered by the close, with two-way business
prompting very heavy turnover. Barclays ended 2 lower at 587p on turnover of
13m and NatWest 3 off at 539p, also with 13m traded.
In a weak telecoms sector, Cable and Wireless attracted attention as BZW
issued a buy recommendation, arguing that the company's investment in
Australian telecoms group Optus was now worth an estimated Pounds 500m.
The broker reckons that Optus has snatched a 10 per cent share of the
Australian long distance market in only its second year of business.
Together with its other telecoms operations, BZW calaculates Optus's value
at Pounds 2bn. C&amp;W has a 24.5 per cent stake in the venture and could reap
further dividends should it be floated, a prospect deemed likely in the
medium term. Turnover in C&amp;W hit a busy 7m, but the shares fell after an
initial gain, losing 9 at 509p.
Holiday operator Owners Abroad was the star performer of an otherwise
lacklustre leisure sector as it delivered satisfactory results and an upbeat
trading statement. The shares shot forward, closing 20 ahead at 120p on
turnover of 6m.
Mr Bruce Jones of Smith New Court said the company's claim of a 15 per cent
market share demonstrated its renewed competitiveness and there was relief
that the results contained no nasty surprises. He added: 'Owners are now on
the same rating as Airtours, but if Owners get it right there is more upside
potential.' Airtours shares added 2 at 586p.
A domestic court case over the issue of tied pubs and a downbeat
presentation from Vaux were said to have combined to depress drinks stocks.
Vaux slipped 8 to 288p. Kleinwort Benson used the opportunity to reiterate
its negative stance on the stock.
Wilton Group saw very heavy two-way business after news that the group is to
team up with Shaw Media Corporation to launch a Chinese-language satellite
channel in Europe. The shares held at 3 3/4 p with 36m traded.
Profit forecast upgrades following well-received figures on Tuesday helped
Reuters Holdings climb 47 to 2018p.
Marks and Spencer, muted in recent sessions on rumours of flagging sales,
stabilised and closed 1 1/2 firmer at 427p.
Financial software concern Coda Group made a successful market debut, the
shares coming to the market at 235p and closing yesterday at 265p.
Property stocks were weak, although Hammerson moved forward 3 to 422p on
talk of an imminent deal.

FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Top job worries hit BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that British Aerospace may become rudderless following weekend reports
of the chairman's impending departure exacted a toll on the stock. At the
day's worst the shares were 23 cheaper at 542p, but came off the bottom in
the afternoon to finish 16 down on balance at 549p.
There was also talk that BAe would join forces with defence electronics
group GEC to mount a counter-bid for helicopter company Westland Group, now
under siege from GKN, which launched a Pounds 496m bid on Tuesday.
Market watchers were largely dismissive of the talk, and one said: 'The
problem is - which of the two bidders would own Westland?' Last weekend, BAe
revived the idea of a strategic link with GEC to create a single UK defence
contracting group. Yesterday's speculation left GEC trailing 6 at 344p.
Shares in Westland jumped 23 to 330p after the board formally rejected the
offer from GKN. Analysts predicted the predator would have to raise its 290p
a share offer to win control of the helicopter group. The prospect of having
to increase its bid saw shares in GKN relinquish 22 to 560p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector had a volatile session which saw a recovery on the
back of a firm Wall Street following initial weakness due to weakness in
gilts, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at a
discount to an already weak cash market at 3,420. The poor form of the gilts
sector prompted selling from the large institutions and the contract fell
through its recent support level of 3,400.
However traders reported buying at the lower levels, even as March declined
indicating there was no clear view on the direction of trading from market
participants during the morning.
The strength of US bonds boosted the New York market and helped March
bounce, which also offered dealers much sought after arbitrage
opportunities. March finished at 3,430, at a 6 point premium to cash. Volume
was 18,061 at the official close.
Index options continued to lead the way in traded options business. The
FT-SE 100 option finished with 20,842 lots while the Euro FT-SE 100 traded
3,541 contracts. BP was the busiest stock option at 3,561 lots, closely
followed by NatWest Bank with 2,341 lots and Hanson with 1,940 lots.
Activity in the OMLX futures remained poor with volume falling to 449 lots
as the March contract on the Mid 250 index closed at 4,101.

FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Weakness in bond markets unsettles
equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON

<TEXT>
Trends in international bond markets set the agenda for a London stock
market still undecided after a topsy-turvey beginning to the week.
An early sharp fall in sterling was seen as the main cause of a sell-off in
gilts, and was accompanied by fresh losses in German bunds. These produced
sharp declines across the board in London share prices, although downside
pressure in the market was much reduced later in the session when Wall
Street opened on a firm note. US investors adopted a more positive view on
the outcome of the two big auctions of US Treasury bonds, involving Dollars
12bn worth of 10-year bonds late yesterday and Dollars 11bn worth of 30-year
bonds today.
At their worst levels yesterday, long-dated gilts were down 1 1/4 before
stabilising and rallying to finish the session some 13 ticks off on balance.
Although closing 11.1 down at 3,429.1, the FT-SE 100 Index was well above
the day's lowest point, reached just before midday, while the Mid Cap 250
Index settled 30.5 off at 4,101.1, also above the day's low point.
The equities market was under pressure from the outset, with weak gilt
futures unsettling the equity market amid stories that the trend in US bonds
could have signalled a withdrawal from UK gilts of the big US hedge funds
and institutions.
The FT-SE 100 Index opened around 17 points lower, affected by gilts and
pressure in the Footsie future, and managed a modest recovery which saw the
index down only 5 points. However, the rally soon came to grief as renewed
selling across the board in gilts and equity futures drove the FT-SE 100
future below 3,400 and to a discount to the cash market around midday. At
the day's low-point the 100-share index was down 36.5 at 3,403.7.
A good rally developed thereafter, with London picking up the scent of a
steadier than expected opening by US bonds and Wall Street. German bunds
moved up, taking gilts with them, and equities responded accordingly. Wall
Street was around 25 points higher as London closed, although it moved
significantly lower afterwards.
Some UK strategists remained unconvinced by the rally in bond markets
yesterday afternoon and the impact on equities. Mr Edmond Warner at
Kleinwort Benson said the markets had 'woken up today to worries that
support for gilts has evaporated'. The gilts/equity ratio has fallen to 2.1,
and for the ratio to return to 2.0 would need a strong rally in gilts or a
big correction in equities. A ratio of two would entail a 170-point drop in
the FT-SE 100 to 3,250, or smaller moves in both gilts and equities.'
Turnover in equities was well down from Tuesday's 1.02bn shares, reaching
912m. Non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 64 per cent of the overall total.
The value of customer business transacted in the market on Tuesday was
Pounds 2.08bn, continuing the high levels of recent weeks.
Kleinwort European Privatisation Trust, one of the day's two new issues,
accounted for a heavy 61m shares, with the stock coming under pressure all
day and closing at 43 1/2 p, compared with an opening level of 49p. Coda,
the other market debut stock, ended at a good premium to its placing price.
Oil shares attracted keen interest, with the majors strongly supported after
a buy recommendation from one of the London market's top broking firms and
in spite of a steep decline in crude oil prices.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks driven up by
program buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A wave of futures-related program buying swept US share prices sharply
higher yesterday as investors welcomed a firming trend in the bond market,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 25.89 ahead at 3,931.92, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.72 better at 472.77. The American SE composite
improved 2.91 to 480.59 and the Nasdaq composite put on 3.83 at 786.53. New
York SE volume, at 332.7m shares, remained heavy. Advances led declines by
1,274 to 844.
After ignoring flagging bond prices in the previous session, equity
investors were cheered by the Treasury market's surprising resilience ahead
of a worrisome afternoon debt auction. Stocks, aided by computer buy
programs, pushed ahead and never looked back.
The Treasury sale later went off without a hitch. In late activity, the
benchmark 30-year government bond was trading  7/16 higher at 97 13/16 .
The firmer tone in the inflation-sensitive long bond was somewhat surprising
in view of the release of January producer price data tomorrow. Observers
predicted a sharp reaction in the financial markets if the index proved to
be higher than expected.
Cyclical issues - those most closely linked to broad economic trends - once
again led equities. General Electric advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 108
1/4 . Goodyear Tire gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 48 1/8 on news of a 30
per cent increase in net earnings in the final three months of 1993.
Strong fourth-quarter results lifted Allied Signal for the second day
running. The issue climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 .
Alcoa's plan to cut production continued to benefit the stock, which moved
ahead Dollars 1 to a 52-week high of Dollars 80 3/8 , after Tuesday's
Dollars 1 1/4 gain.
A range of Big Board stocks also participated in the advance. Procter &amp;
Gamble rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 , McDonald's Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 60 3/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49.
Ford Motor was hit by profit-taking after its quarterly report produced no
surprises. The stock sagged Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 1/2 . WMX Technologies
fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 25 after the waste collection concern reported
disappointing net earnings and Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft moved forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80 after its
chairman said the software supplier could double revenues by fiscal 1997.
Canada
Toronto saw bargain hunting and closed modestly higher after busy trading.
The TSE 300 index rose 11 points to 4,463.2 and advances outnumbered
declines by 424 to 358. Volume came to 81.3m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by real estate, up 1.3 per
cent. The golds group put on 1.1 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens 2% amid
heavy index-linked sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Short of support ahead of Friday's meeting between President Clinton and
Prime Minister Hosokawa, share prices dropped on heavy index-linked selling
and profit-taking by corporations, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 409.85, or 2 per cent, at 19,841.38, falling below
20,000 for the first time in eight trading days. The Topix index of all
first section stocks slid 18.68 to 1,598.02, through 1,600 for the first
time since January 28.
Selling pressure increased in the afternoon as investors were discouraged by
rumours that a leading monthly magazine will carry an article over a
trucking company's allegedly dubious loans to Mr Hosokawa. The Nikkei opened
at the day's high of 20,236.32 and fell to a low of 19,650.97 in the
afternoon session.
Many investors were also sidelined ahead of the launch of the Nikkei 300
stock futures contract next Monday. 'There are rumours that some US
investors will be selling the Nikkei 300 index to hedge their positions,'
said a Japanese broker.
Volume totalled 450m shares, down from Tuesday's 616m, and declines
outscored advances by 915 to 168, with 104 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.34 to 1,321.13.
Stocks recently popular on the multi-media theme were lower on heavy
profit-taking. Fujitsu fell Y30 to Y1,040 and Nitsuko Y60 to Y1,540. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y28,000 to Y947,000.
Some banks were lower on corporate selling, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank losing Y20
at Y1,940.
Trucking issues were weak due to the alleged scandal involving Mr Hosokawa.
Nippon Express declined Y40 to Y1,000 and Yamato Transport Y30 to Y1,180.
Short term investors bought speculative favourites. Japan Storage Battery
rose Y7 to Y820, Sanken Electric climbed Y36 to Y915 and Namco advanced Y60
to Y2,650.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 316.27 to 21,704.84 in volume of 84.2m
shares. Kyocera, the ceramic chip package maker, shed Y230 to Y6,740.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were mixed as the Lunar New Year holiday season took
hold. Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were already closed.
HONG KONG ended firmer but off highs as early demand dried up and gains were
eroded by late position-squaring. The Hang Seng index rose a net 49.87 to
11,504.03 in half-day trading ahead of the new year festival, which closes
the market for the rest of the week.
Expectations of strong results announcements by some blue chip companies
later this month had stimulated the buying. Properties led gains, with
Cheung Kong, the second most actively traded stock, adding HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 47.75 and Henderson Land ahead HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 53.50. SHK
Properties receded 50 cents to HKDollars 63.50.
BANGKOK was spurred 2.8 per cent higher as demand from local and foreign
funds overcame selling pressure by local investors. The SET index broke
above 1,400 to end 37.90 stronger at 1,403.63.
MANILA's composite index climbed 42.48 to 2,995.33 as local investors bought
selected stocks.
SINGAPORE edged forward in thin half-day trading and the Straits Times
Industrial index firmed 19.96 to 2,341.60.
AUSTRALIA was depressed by profit-taking and a drop in futures, the All
Ordinaries index falling 34.5 to 2,270.9.
NEW ZEALAND declined, the NZSE-40 capital index finishing 4.53 off at
2,369.16.
Telecom picked up 3 cents to NZDollars 4.91 after the 9-cent fall on Tuesday
which followed its third-quarter results.
BOMBAY surrendered 3.4 per cent as profit-taking whittled away at the sharp
gains seen earlier in the week. The BSE 30-share index dropped 143.16 to
4,018.92.
KARACHI was higher as blue chips posted sharp gains late in the day. The KSE
100-share index closed a net 9.87 ahead at 2,325.22, after dipping to
2,304.88 at midday.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil below best after setting new
high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo ended 1.9 per cent higher in heavy trade in response to Congress
approval late on Tuesday for the creation of a social welfare fund, the
backbone of the government's stabilisation programme. The market was nearly
5 per cent up at the close of the previous session.
Profit-taking left the market below the day's best with the Bovespa index
ahead 1,668 at 90,467 in turnover of Cr221.4bn.
Some traders said that buying was prompted by short-covering in the Bovespa
futures market.
Central bank officials have said that they intend to keep monetary policy
tight after the adoption of a single price index to try to prevent consumer
spending from rising. The government has vowed to bring the country's 40 per
cent monthly inflation down by pegging prices to the new index.
Mexican stocks rose to a new peak in early trading, helped by a fall in
domestic interest rates, but later declined on profit-taking. The IPC index
was finally 21.54 down at 2,859.63, after setting an intraday all-time high
of 2,895.89, near to the psychologically important 2.900 level.
The central bank said that the 28-day Treasury bill interest rate would be
cut to 9.72 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt mounts post-bourse
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a day for the tacticians, the strategists still had their say, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Overnight in New York, a UK house, SG Warburg, said it liked equity
prospects in Italy, and Sweden in particular. In London, Merrill Lynch, of
US fame, continued its support for European commodity-sensitive stocks, on
prospects for gains in both commodity prices and in the US dollar.
FRANKFURT rebounded in the post-bourse after the DAX index fell 21.92 to
2,085.29 on the session, closing the afternoon 31.14 to the good at
2,116.43, its best of the day.
Mr Nigel Longley, of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said that the bund future had
moved from 98.94 on Tuesday, via a 98.58 low yesterday, to a close of 99.20
 -'huge volatility', he said, in this area. In addition, equities were
lifted by the upswing in New York.
Turnover rose from DM9.8bn to DM10.6bn. Banks were weak on the session, but
carmakers were outstanding on the day. At the official close, Volkswagen was
up DM5 to DM447 on American buying.
In the afternoon, however, BMW was the real star, responding to a Standard &amp;
Poor's downgrade of its commercial paper by rising from DM777 at the close
to a final DM814. The prospect had been in investors' minds, said Mr
Longley, they had bought on the 'bad news' and BMW - not as liquid as some
car stocks - had rocketed on short covering.
MILAN put in a restrained performance on a day of technically driven
trading, which saw the expiry of options ahead of tomorrow's end of the
February account. The Comit index added 2.4 to 680.12.
IMI, making its debut, was quoted at L14,400 in pre-opening trade, compared
with the L10,900 privatisation price, prompting speculation that a broker
had been short in the stock. The shares later turned back to finish at
L13,430.
BCI, up for privatisation at the end of the month, added L37 to L5,523.
Montedison traded L38 or 3.2 per cent lower to L1,159 in continued response
to Tuesday's news that a little known Gibralta-based investment firm was
buying a 6 per cent stake.
PARIS was little changed on the day with the CAC-40 index rising just 2.2 to
2,302.06.
Peugeot, down FFr7 to FFr847, had attracted attention from a number of
brokers; Merrill Lynch, yesterday, moved its recommendation a notch lower,
from buy to hold.
Mr Keith Hayes commented for Merrill that this move was partly the result of
the stock's strong performance in recent months: it has outperformed the
CAC-40 index by some 25 per cent. He was concerned at a possible hole in the
group's model range, with strong competition coming from Renault and Fiat,
and added that Peugeot lacked exposure to the lucrative north American
market.
Among other automotive stocks Valeo, the components manufacturer, advanced
to a new year's high, up FFr46 to FFr1,520, taking its gains since the
beginning of the year to 18 per cent. Michelin gained FFr2.40 to FFr262.30.
ZURICH finished 1.4 per cent lower, although Wall Street's firmer opening
enabled shares to pick up from the day's lowest levels. The SMI index shed
43 to 3,054.2.
Banks, in demand until recent days on expectations of good results later in
the month, remained under pressure. CS Holding shed SFr20 to SFr710. UBS,
which said it had sold its 19 per cent stake in Grundig to Philips, dipped
SFr16 to SFr1,465.
Roche saw SFr90 of its recent gains erased as it finished at SFr7,090.
AMSTERDAM recovered from a midsession low to close modestly higher. The AEX
index added 0.98 to 437.52.
Fokker, which has seen volatile trading recently, was one of the day's best
performers, up Fl 1.90 or 8.6 per cent to Fl 23.80, following a report in
the domestic media that it was planning a major restructuring package to
include job cuts. The aircraft manufacturer had no commment to make on the
article.
ISTANBUL fell another 8.1 per cent as investors switched further holdings
into cash, taking advantage of high interest rates as the central bank
continued to defend the lira.
The composite index, bouncing from a daily low of 15,478.14, ended at a
provisional 15,695.71, its lowest since November 17 and down 1,385.44 points
from Tuesday.
The index has lost 45.7 per cent since its all-time high of 28,883.61 on
January 13.
TEL AVIV hit a new 1994 low, the Mishtanim blue chip index losing another
8.55, or 3.5 per cent at 235.87 after a similar fall on Monday and a small,
intervening rally on Tuesday.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: India rises despite the Asian wobble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the rest of Asia wobbled on Monday in reaction to the slight increase
in US interest rates at the end of last week, India went in the opposite
direction as some foreign investors decided to switch portfolios.
However, in spite of a fall back from high levels yesterday, the performance
cannot be seen as a 'one-day wonder'. In fact, many emerging markets
strategists favour the sub-continent as having the potential to show a
strong performance in 1994, with Foreign and Colonial, for instance,
forecasting 55 per cent growth.
Mr Michael Edmonds, of Olliff and Partners in London, says that the country
has good prospects, founded in the main on stability in the political arena.
Furthermore, a satisfactory improvement in exports - a better than expected
gain of some 20 per cent in the nine months to the end of December 1993 -
has underpinned expectations of broader economic growth.
He adds that new investment funds have been launched recently, following the
government's relaxation of restrictions on foreigners towards the end of
last year, and suggests that export-orientated sectors, and the textile
sector in particular, are in fund managers' sights.
The Asian wobble at the beginning of the week caught no-one off guard - a
rise in US rates having been discounted in the markets - but did provide an
excuse for some foreign and domestic investors to take profits. Thailand and
Hong Kong were the heaviest casualties, the former already having a
disappointing year as measured by the IFC.
Morgan Stanley chose this moment to review its exposure to emerging markets,
reducing their weighting in its global portfolio by 1 percentage point to 4
per cent. At the same time it lifted its asset allocations for Singapore and
Malaysia by 2 points, and 4 points respectively from zero.
This, it said, took into account the fact that both markets had good
potential, and had underperformed since the beinning of this year.
In Latin America, Venezuela came into its own last week as foreign
institutions decided that the time was now right to come in, encouraged by
the pose being adopted by Mr Rafael Caldera, the country's new president,
and his government.
Mr Victor Galliano of LatInvest remarks that although the macroeconomic
picture continues to look bleak, there is a feeling that things cannot get
any worse; and the economics team appointed by the president has a
pro-market attitude.
The equity market is likely to remain volatile in 1994, he says, with the
possibility of further fallout in the wake of the collapse of Banco Latino.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Sterling under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling continued its downward path yesterday as market sentiment soured
following Tuesday's 25 basis-point cut in interest rates, writes Philip
Gawith.
The pound finished in London yesterday at DM2.5708, four pfennigs lower than
its level before the rate reduction was announced and 2 1/2 pfennigs down on
the day. It closed nearly a cent lower against the dollar at Dollars 1.4605.
The trigger for further selling was the release of the Bank of England's
quarterly inflation report, which concluded that there was a risk of
underlying inflation rising. The market took the view that this could not be
reconciled with a decision to cut rates.
Coming against the backdrop of ongoing political difficulties for the
government, heightened by the death of Tory MP Mr Stephen Milligan, the
market sensed a whiff of political expediency in the air and this is always
very negative for sterling.
Analysts were harsh in their assessment of the Bank's rate cut, which was
widely branded a failure, both in presentational terms and in terms of the
worsening inflation outlook, reflected in the fall in bond prices.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, described sterling's
weakness as 'a classic chartist move'. Although the drop was triggered by
fundamental factors, the extent of the fall was likely to be determined by
technical considerations.
He said the pound was effectively retracing the sharp upward move of the
last four months which had seen it rise fairly sharply from DM2.43 in
October - before the Bundesbank started cutting rates - to a high in January
of DM2.63. Dealers said sterling should attract a fair degree of support at
the DM2.53-2.55 level.
Mr Hannah added that he did not expect sterling's weakness against the
D-Mark to continue for more than a few weeks. On the one hand, following the
poor reception of Tuesday's rate cut, there is probably not much more
downside for British rates.
In Germany, by contrast, figures released on Tuesday show unemployment is
still rising and analysts believe there is still room for a 100 basis-point
fall in interest rates. 'The interest rate argument will swing back in the
UK's favour,' said Mr Hannah.
Less rosy is the outlook for 'cable' - the sterling/dollar rate - which
technical analysts predict is heading for 'very big' trouble. They said if
it falls through Dollars 1.4550, then it could easily drop to Dollars
1.41-1.42.
The yen traded nervously again yesterday as the uneasy state of relations
between the US and Japan remained to the fore. Having fallen a yen in Asian
trade, sinking beneath Y108, the dollar traded below that level in London
and closed at Y107.8450. However, it improved in New York to end at Y108.35.
The dollar has weakened from a high of Y113.60 last month on fears that the
US may press for a higher yen as a means of cutting Japan's trade surplus
with the US should trade talks fail.
The hasty dispatch by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of his
foreign minister Mr Tsutomu Hata to Washington for urgent talks did nothing
to alleviate these fears.
Indeed, it was taken as confirmation that the two countries remain miles
apart in terms of tackling the surplus ahead of Friday's planned trade
summit between President Clinton and Mr Hosokawa. Mr Hata said: 'It is a
very difficult problem. The two sides are insisting on their own views. The
two views clash, but in order to have better relations with the US it was
hastily decided that I would visit the US for frank talks with my
counterparts.'
Japanese dealers were reported as saying that the Bank of Japan had
intervened during Asian trading hours in a bid to stem a further sharp
appreciation of the yen against the dollar. The BOJ was said to have bought
small amounts of dollars for yen when the US currency was falling towards
Y108 and below.
The D-Mark firmed slightly against other EMS currencies, but dealers said
the EMS was pretty much sidelined, with the dollar/yen and pound in the
headlines. The broad sideways movement within the EMS grid was expected to
continue ahead of next week's Bundesbank meeting.
Comments yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, that
bringing down unemployment was the government's highest priority indicated
the pressure the government is under for a more expansionary policy. Some
analysts said this might make D-Mark assets less attractive and put downward
pressure on the currency.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 270m of
late, unspecified assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds
601m. This compared with its latest forecast of a Pounds 900m liquidity
shortage.
The Bank also announced that it would provide a total of Pounds 3.667bn
through its repo and secured loan facility on February 10. The Bank said it
would allocate Pounds 2.484bn in its two-week repo expiring on February 24
and Pounds 1.183bn in the four-week repo maturing on March 10. The interest
rate of 5 5/32 per cent being offered on both facilities is in line with the
levels at which it provides repo assistance in its normal money market
operations.

FT  10 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc prices slide as production
cut hopes fade - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC prices fell sharply again yesterday under pressure from investment fund
selling and dwindling hopes of production cuts. The London Metal Exchange
three months price added Dollars 20.50 to Tuesday's Dollars 20.25 fall to
reach Dollars 983 a tonne.
The selling was influenced by a statement from Outokumpu of Finland saying
it had no plans to cut production. Also European Union zinc producers had
yet to deliver the promised smelter closures, dealers noted.
The ALUMINIUM market meanwhile showed signs of losing its recent upward
momentum, with the three months price closing Dollars 6.75 lower at Dollars
1,288.75 a tonne. The closure threat at Tajikistan's Tursunzade smelter that
had helped to steady the market on Tuesday receded slightly with news that a
small delivery of alumina had been received this week. But an official said
reserves remained minimal, while doubts remained about further deliveries
from Uzbekistan because of failure to pay for earlier shipments.

exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil Norge, the Norwegian unit of London-based Enterprise Oil,
yesterday announced that it would fund a NKr400m (Pounds 36m), three-year
Norwegian North Sea exploration programme in exchange for the right to farm
into three licences operated by Esso Norge.
The deal boosts Enterprise's net acreage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf
by 25 per cent, or 298 sq km, and gives the company a 50 per cent stake in
each of the three blocks within the Esso licenses.
Domestic analysts said they believed the deal to be the biggest of its kind
ever concluded in Norway. Enterprise said that portions of blocks 16/1, 25/8
and 25/20 in the Utsira High area with proven hydrocarbons were specifically
excluded from the farm-in.
The company explained that it had agreed the farm-in with Esso to make
greater and faster progress in building its Norwegian North Sea portfolio
than what otherwise could be accomplished under Norway's licensing regime.
Enterprise intends to drill three exploration wells - one this year in block
25/8 near Esso's producing Balder field - and to undertake three dimensional
seismic surveys over the bulk of the farm-in acreage.
Including the farm-in well, the company plans to drill up to 10 exploration
wells this year elsewhere on Norwegian shelf acreage, or one-third of all
wells to be drilled in the sector, representing its heaviest ever
exploration programme since entering Norway in 1989, when it acquired
acreage from Texas Eastern.
The two companies have already secured approval of the agreement by Norway's
industry and energy ministry and finance ministry.

Brazil's state-controlled mining giant, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, has cut
iron ore prices to match the discounts offered by Hamersley, a company
official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.
CVRD had closed several contracts with Japanese clients, including Nippon
Steel Corporation and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, that included 9.5 per cent
reductions for sinter feed and 5.9 per cent for lump ore, the official said.
Officials of the Brazilian company were due to sign contracts with various
German clients in Dusseldorf tomorrow and prices offered on those contracts
were likely to be similar to those agreed with the Japanese, he added.

deal
</HEADLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A shadow was cast over the Dollars 1bn El Abra copper project in Chile
yesterday when the two north American partners said that tests they had made
to confirm previous estimates showed reserves might be significantly lower
than previous data suggested.
El Abra had previously been expected to become one of Chile's largest copper
mines, producing an annual 225,000 tonnes.
Lac Minerals and Cyprus Amax, who last year agreed to pay Codelco, the
state-owned Chilean group, Dollars 404m for a 51 per cent stake in El Abra
and to spend Dollars 307m on the project, said they would do more assay test
work, which would take another six to eight weeks.
However, Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president of development, warned
that if the North American companies reduced their offer too drastically his
company might look for new partners. But it was unlikely this would be
necessary, he added. Codelco so far was 'very happy' with Lac and Cyprus.
The partners would look again at core samples taken from drilling between
1973 and 1975 at the El Abra site, in the Atacama desert, which provided the
basis for Codelco's estimates of copper oxide reserves of 500m tonnes
containing 1 per cent copper, Mr Bande said. 'This is absolutely normal for
such a big project,' he added.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: French blamed as UK pig
industry 'bleeds to death'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is being urged to investigate French payments of
alleged state aid to pig producers, which the National Farmers' Union says
is causing the British pig industry to bleed to death.
In a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, yesterday, Mr
David Naish president of the NFU, said farmers were angry at the 'apparent
lack of political will to investigate possible state aids paid by the French
government to its pig industry'.
Pork prices collapsed across the European Union last year following an
expansion of herds in France, Denmark, Spain and to a lesser extent, the UK.
EU pig meat production rose by 4 per cent last year to 14.9m tonnes.
The British Pig Association estimates that farmers are losing Pounds 12 per
animal - equal to 20 per cent of gross returns.
Mr Naish's letter said that producers accepted that the industry was
cyclical and that there would be phases when prices were depressed. 'But it
is absolutely intolerable if member states are allowed to distort the
operation of the common market organisation by paying illegal state aid.'
The French government has introduced several measures to assist pig farmers
since last September and British producers claim the government is paying
roughly FFr370m in financial aid. Estimates put the expansion of the French
pig herd at about 18 per cent, which British farmers claim is not justified
by current prices.
British pig output increased by about 3 per cent last year, but Mr Grenville
Welsh, chief executive of the pig producers group, expects a drop in
production of at least 8 per cent by the middle of this year. 'We're looking
at maybe 2,000 to 3,000 producers going out of business,' he said. The UK
currently has 11,500 pig farmers.
UK pig farmers have been caught in a squeeze caused by the aftermath of
devaluation of sterling, which raised the price of feed, and its subsequent
recovery, which was making pork exports to Europe uncompetitive. Ministry of
Agriculture figures show that pig farm incomes almost halved last year while
overall farm earnings were up 40 per cent.
The NFU has pressed the commission for action to alleviate market pressure
and provide producers with a breathing space while supply adjusts to balance
demand.
Producers are particularly irked that retail prices have not fully reflected
the drop in pork prices to farmers. The producers' association has urged the
Pork and Bacon Promotion Council to start an advertising campaign in an
effort to boost sales.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese win price cuts from
more Australian iron ore producers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Robe River Iron Ore Associates of Australia, a joint venture in which North
Broken Hill Peko has a 53 per cent interest, yesterday announced that it had
agreed to cut iron ore prices by 14.5 per cent, following negotiations with
the Japanese steel mills.
It said that, in return for the large price reduction, the Japanese buyers
had agreed to take at least 12.5m dry long tons of Robe River ore in
1994-95. The Robe River venture produces iron ore fines at operations based
in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
The price cut is more substantial than that announced on Tuesday by
Hamersley Iron, part of the CRA group, after 'unusually complex and lengthy'
negotiations. Hamersley said that it was cutting prices by an average 7.6
per cent - made up of a 9.5 per cent reduction for fines and one of 5.9 per
cent for lump ore. Hamersley agreed a minimum delivery of 19m tonnes,
unchanged from 1993-94.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian steel and natural resources
group, also announced yesterday that it had agreed to a 7.6 per cent price
for iron ore to be delivered from its Mount Newman project in the Pilbara,
with the same split as Hamersley between fines and lump.
BHP said, however, that contracts for its Yandi and Goldsworthy projects had
yet to be finalised.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International consortium to
seek oil in China's Tarim basin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Agip of Italy and Texaco of the US, at the head of an international oil
consortium, have initialled an agreement to explore in the vast Tarim basin
area of China's remote western region.
Mr William Doyle, Director of Texaco China, described the 9,814 sq km Tarim
bloc as a 'world class opportunity' for the five-member partnership, in
which Agip will be the operating company.
Other members of the consortium include Elf of France and two Japanese
companies - Japan Energy Company and the Japan Petroleum Exploration
Company. Each partner will have 20 per cent.
Mr Doyle said he was aware of suggestions that China was offering less
prospective areas in the Tarim basin to foreign participation, but Texaco
was 'very pleased' with the potential of its concession, which lies at the
western end of five being made available to foreign companies.
China announced about a year ago that it was inviting foreigners to explore
in promising onshore areas including the Tarim, which had long been eyed by
the international petroleum industry as potentially 'one of the world's last
great oil plays'.
Response from foreign companies has been lukewarm, however, compared to the
enthusiasm that greeted the opening of China's offshore areas in the early
1980s. Among factors dampening enthusiasm have been worries about lack of
infrastructure in the Tarim and uncertainty about the construction of a
pipeline to transport oil from the remote region.
Mr Doyle said he was confident that if oil was discovered in commercial
quantities that the Chinese would ensure that transport would be
facilitated. He estimated a 2,000km pipeline across some of the world's
roughest terrain would cost 'several billions'.
Texaco has been relatively successful in its Chinese ventures. With its
partners Agip and Chevron of the US, it is producing 60,000 barrels a day in
the South China Sea. The American company recently signed agreements to
explore in the East China Sea south of Shanghai. It is also involved in
exploration in the Bohai Gulf, south-east of Beijing.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger EU banana quota sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guatemala will today lead a delegation of four Latin American countries to
Brussels to propose a way of ending the current stalemate in a row over the
European Union's banana regime.
The European Commission's deadline for the Latin Americans to accept a
proposal for an increase to 2.1m tonnes in their ceiling for deliveries to
the Dollars 2.7bn EU banana market runs out tomorrow.
A report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade condemning EU
arrangements with African, Caribbean and Pacific producers over bananas
under the Lome convention will also be circulated on Friday.
A condition of the commission's offer is that the Latin Americans drop their
complaint to Gatt.
Guatemala's proposal calls for an increase in access for the Latin Americans
to about 2.5m tonnes - this would be included in an overall quota for all
non-EU bananas of 3.2m tonnes. Within that ceiling, the Guatemalans suggest
a single tariff to apply to ACP and the so-called dollar bananas from Latin
America.
Higher tariffs would be payable on imports above that level with the revenue
raised from the tariffs going as direct aid to ACP countries. The proposal
also calls for the abolition of the licensing system.
The proposal is backed by Panama, Honduras and Ecuador, which is the biggest
Latin American exporter of bananas to the EU, but is not a member of Gatt.
It lacks the key support of Colombia and Costa Rica, which are large
exporters and, as members of Gatt, carry more political clout with the EU.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: US Treasuries extend gains
after 10-year auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds extended their gains yesterday after the market cleared an
afternoon auction of new 10-year notes without stumbling.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better at
97 3/4 , with the yield slipping to 6.416 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/16 ahead at 99 1/4 , to yield 4.384 per cent.
In early trading, prices were firm across the yield curve ahead of the sale
of Dollars 12bn in 10-year securities, the second leg of the Treasury's
Dollars 40bn quarterly debt programme. The positive trend surprised many
traders because it was uncertain whether the issue would generate sufficient
demand.
In the event, the auction went reasonably well, as did the programme's first
stage - Tuesday's sale of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes. The 10-year
issue was awarded at an average yield of 5.92 per cent, a little weaker than
bidding before the sale had suggested.
The market was still facing an Dollars 11bn auction of new 30-year bonds
this afternoon. The prospects for a successful outcome improved yesterday
with the reception accorded the 10-year notes. However, traders remained
anxious about the final auction because it is to be followed by January
producer price data tomorrow.
A firm opening in US Treasuries and signs that the recent transatlantic
selling had come to an end helped UK government bonds and futures to come
off the day's worst levels. The March long gilt future bounced from the
day's low of 115 1/32 as traded as high as 116 3/32 . It stood at 115 29/32
in the late afternoon, down  11/32 on the day.
In spite of yesterday's recovery, analysts said the gilts market remained
shaky, since many market participants had taken the view that Tuesday's
unexpected rate cut had been politically motivated.
German government bonds broke their recent losing streak and made solid
gains as dealers covered their short positions.
The March bund future on Liffe bounced back from the day's low of 98.58 to
99.21 in the late afternoon, up 0.20 point on the day.
The market appeared to be divided about the market's short-term outlook.
Some dealers warned that the market remained vulnerable to any adverse
developments in US Treasuries which could push futures back as low as 98.00.
However, others believed bunds had come to the end of their downward
correction and that futures could go back above par in the next week.
Southern European government bond markets continued to show resilience to
the volatility in other markets, protected by their relatively high yields
and sound economic fundamentals.
The Italian government bond March future rose 0.14 point to 118.40, while in
Spain, the March government bond future added 0.07 point to 106.28.
Some analysts said the good performance of these markets since the start of
the year could be put at risk if bond markets worldwide had another bout of
weakness.
'There are funds with massive positions in the main markets so they might
get cold feet about their exposure to smaller markets,' an analyst said.
Japanese government bonds and futures continued to rebound yesterday as
investors took the view that the worst was over for the market now the
government's fiscal package designed to lift the economy had finally been
unveiled.
The yield on the benchmark JGB No 157 fell to 3.42 per cent in Tokyo from
the previous day's close of 3.51 per cent, and stood at 3.42 per cent in
London trading.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said
the market was contrasting its concerns about oversupply with Japan's
favourable inflation prospects.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Bonds: FRNs take centre stage amid interest
rate doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Floating-rate notes again featured prominently yesterday, meeting demand
from investors expecting interest rates in the US and the UK to creep
higher. However, the interest rate outlook on both sides of the Atlantic
remained uncertain.
Dealers said activity was subdued, with many investors preferring to remain
sidelined until this week's US Treasury's auctions of 10- and 30-year bonds
and Friday's January US producer prices index data were out of the way.
Goldman Sachs issued the day's largest FRN, a Dollars 500m offering of
four-year notes.
The deal will be priced today to give a margin of three-month Libor plus
3/8 point at the reoffer price. A syndicate official at Goldman Sachs
reported strong interest in the issue from investors seeking exposure to
rising interest rates.
'We are seeing strong demand for US dollar floaters - there's a lot of money
coming out of fixed-rate into floating rate assets, and spreads in the
floating-rate sector are tightening,' said another trader.
In the sterling sector, Salomon Brothers issued Pounds 150m of five-year
FRNs paying a coupon of three-month Libor plus 40 basis points.
According to one FRN dealer, the issue was generously priced and traded up
after the syndicate broke. While UK rates are expected to continue falling,
most participants say they are close to bottoming and will track US rates
higher eventually.
Elsewhere, Austria's Girocredit Bank issued Dollars 100m of 10-year notes
paying six-month Libor less  1/8 point and incorporating a 5 1/8 per cent
coupon floor. According to lead manager Merrill Lynch, the deal met strong
demand and sold out in one hour.
Yesterday's two straight dollar bonds received a cooler welcome and were
widely deemed to have been too aggressively priced.
Swedish Export Credit (SEK) issued Dollars 300m of three-year 5 per cent
bonds, priced to yield 10 basis points over the new three-year US Treasury,
via Kidder Peabody.
The Bank of Dutch Municipalities (BNG) issued Dollars 150m of 5 per cent
three-year bonds priced to yield 13 1/2 basis points over the three-year
Treasury via Goldman Sachs.
The spread on both deals widened after syndicate broke, with the SEK bond
yielding about 17 basis points over the Treasury and the BNG yielding some
19 basis points over in late trading.
However, the deals were largely targetted at retail investors and spreads
are expected to tighten as the bonds get placed, one of the lead managers
said. 'Once they're on the retail buy-list, they should start to perform.'
Another favourite retail borrower tapped the market in the afternoon.
General Electric Capital Corporation issued Pounds 150m of 6 1/4 per cent
bonds due December 1999 via Deutsche Bank.
They were priced to yield 19 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due
August 1999.
Given that the GECC bonds have a slightly longer maturity, 'on the
interpolated curve they look expensive', said one trader. However, an
official at the lead manager reported solid interest from UK and continental
European accounts.
The European Investment Bank issued the largest peseta bond in the Spanish
Matador market, Pta50bn of 7.5 per cent seven-year bonds, and today is
expected to launch its long-awaited Greek drachma bond via Midland Bank
Athens and the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Portugal bourses given
options plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's stock exchange commission (CMVM) yesterday proposed a
restructuring of the country's two bourses as part of plans to create a
futures and options market.
The CMVM aims to reconcile opposing bids by the rival Lisbon and Oporto
bourses to set up a national derivatives exchange.
Mr Fernando de Costa Lima, CMVM president, said the commission proposed
replacing the spot market in Oporto with a futures and options exchange and
developing a national spot market in Lisbon.
The Lisbon and Oporto bourses compete with separate spot markets although
more than 150 of the most liquid shares are quoted on a national continuous
market for which Lisbon and Oporto act as separate trading floors.
Last year, the two exchanges presented rival projects for a futures and
options market.
Mr Costa Lima said the two bourses should overcome their differences and
co-operate in building two national markets for spot and derivative
operations. He made the proposals with the backing of Mr Eduardo Catroga,
Portugal's finance minister.
Ms Graca Carvalho, an analyst with Totta Dealer, welcomed the proposals as a
means to end competition between Lisbon and Oporto for the same small
market.
She said the Oporto exchange was better equipped to handle a derivatives
market but Lisbon was unlikely to welcome the new market going to its rival.
There was no reaction from the two bourses.
Many analysts believe Portugal's capital market needs to develop greater
liquidity and transparency before a futures and options market would be
successful.
However, Ms Carvalho said the new market would help generate more liquidity.
The average daily volume of share trading in Lisbon is Es2bn (Dollars
11.4m), some 10 times higher than it was 18 months ago.

<TEXT>
Russia is to open its domestic Treasury bill market to foreign investors,
allowing non-residents to take up to 10 per cent of the next bond issue on
February 15, Reuter reports from Moscow. The finance ministry said it would
put up Rbs100bn of three-month Treasury bills at this month's auction.
Russia's tiny small Treasury bill market has been restricted to domestic
players. Turnover, about Rbs2.2bn a day over the past week, has fallen
sharply as investors moved their assets into hard currency because of doubts
about government economic policies. This year the rouble has fallen 25 per
cent against the dollar.
Russian Treasury bills yield more than 230 per cent, up from about 185 per
cent at the January auction.
Western emerging market portfolio managers have begun looking at investment
opportunities in Russia's new financial markets. Treasury bills offer one
possibility.
Foreign banks are interested in finance ministry bonds, issued last year to
compensate domestic companies whose funds were frozen by the foreign trade
bank of the former Soviet Union at the start of 1992.

<TEXT>
Standard and Poor's has lowered the credit ratings of Nissan and American
Honda. It has affirmed Toyota's triple A long-term rating and removed the
group from creditwatch.
S&amp;P said that Nissan's poor financial performance led it to reduce the
company's credit rating to BBB+ from A.
'Recovery of earnings will take a few years, as the company's efficiency
continues to be affected by excess production capacity domestically and weak
performance of overseas subsidiaries,' S&amp;P said.
S&amp;P noted that Nissan continued to have a strong market position in Japan,
global market presence and 'exceptional product development abilities as a
full line producer of passenger cars'.
American Honda had its credit rating lowered to A-2 from A-1. Honda's
liquidity levels were low while earnings continue to be under pressure, the
agency said.
Toyota had its triple A credit rating affirmed, as a result of its dominant
share of the Japanese market, strong presence in overseas markets and strong
financial profile.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ford Europe trims loss to
Dollars 960m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, posted a slightly
reduced net loss of Dollars 960m in 1993 - its third successive heavy annual
loss.
However, excluding Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, the European
operations 'could be profitable' in 1994, the US carmaker forecast
yesterday.
A return to profit would depend on the continuation of the economic recovery
in the UK and on an increase in west European new vehicle demand.
Ford has suffered one of the weakest financial performances of the big six
volume carmakers in Europe in the last three years with total net losses of
Dollars 3.3bn in the period including a loss of Dollars 1.29bn in 1992 and
Dollars 1.08bn in 1991.
Ford said its European operations had been hit heavily last year by the 16
per cent decline in new vehicle demand in west Europe and by currency
fluctuations.
Its results were burdened by a pre-tax operating exchange loss of Dollars
485m for the full year due chiefly to the weakness of the lira, the pound
and the French franc.
Excluding Jaguar, Ford's European automotive operations sufferred a loss of
Dollars 407m last year following a loss of Dollars 647m in 1992 (including a
one-time Dollars 334m restructuring charge) and Dollars 478m in 1991.
The US carmaker has been forced to undertake a drastic rationalisation of
its European operations and has cut its workforce, excluding Jaguar, by 15.4
per cent to 83,000 people by the end of 1993 from 98,100 in November 1992.
The company said yesterday that the restructuring programme had been
completed following a cut of 4,600 jobs or 23 per cent of the salaried
workforce and of 10,500 jobs or 14 per cent of the hourly workforce. Costs
had been reduced 'substantially'.
Ford, which is in fourth place in the west European car market behind the
Volkswagen group of Germany, General Motors of the US and the PSA Peugeot
Citroen group of France, increased its market share marginally last year to
11.4 per cent (excluding Jaguar) from 11.2 per cent a year earlier.
The higher share was due largely to the success of its Mondeo large family
car, while the Fiesta, Escort and Granada/Scorpio all lost ground.
Vehicle sales from its plants in Germany and Belgium fell by 10 per cent to
831,216, from its UK plants by 11 per cent to 421,939 and from its Spanish
plants by 32 per cent to 211,413.
Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker which Ford acquired in 1989 for Pounds 1.6bn
(Dollars 2.4bn), cut its operating loss last year to Dollars 371m (including
one-time restructuring costs of Dollars 174m) from a loss of Dollars 412m in
1992 and a loss of Dollars 354m in 1991.
Excluding the restructuring actions the results improved by Dollars 215m
reflecting a 22 per cent increase in retail sales to 27,000 - including a 47
per cent jump in sales in the US to 13,000 - and savings from cost reduction
programmes.
Jaguar is being more closely integrated with Ford's European operations.
Later this year production of the stamped body panels for Jaguar cars will
be transferred from Venture Pressings, a joint venture with GKN, the UK
automotive components group, to the Ford plant at Halewood, Merseyside,
which has free capacity.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: PPG paint deal with Akzo near
completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in the European market for painting cars during manufacture  -
worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 975m) a year - is likely to intensify
following the German and Dutch authorities' approval last week of the sale
of Akzo's share in the business to PPG, the US industrial coatings
specialist.
The takeover, now in the final stages of European Union approval, will
reduce numbers of principal competitors to three - PPG; Herberts, the
industrial coatings subsidiary of Hoechst, the German chemicals group; and
BASF, another big German chemicals company.
This rationalisation will allow each group to step up the fight for market
share.
Although Herberts and BASF dominate their national market, PPG is believed
to have at least 35 per cent of total European sales, while industry sources
estimate Herberts' European share at around 25 per cent and BASF's as
approaching 20 per cent.
Akzo claimed a 9 per cent share. ICI withdrew from the market last month
when it abandoned IDAC, a six-year joint venture with Du Pont based near
Cologne. Du Pont will continue alone, with what was claimed as an 11 per
cent share at the time of the break-up.
Mr Austin O'Malley, managing director of PPG's European business, said
yesterday he was expecting vigorous competition as PPG hurried to integrate
Akzo technology, products, research and development.
PPG's tactic will be to offer manufacturers the chance to completely
outsource the painting process at a lower cost than buying materials and
technical support at competitive prices and doing the job themselves, as
now.
PPG's acquisition of Akzo's business - coupled with an earlier alliance with
Bollig and Kempe, a German spray painting specialist - will give it a full
range of all the products and technologies involved.

<TEXT>
Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, is
to buy a 40 per cent interest in the Boddington gold mine from Reynolds
Metals Australia, part of the US minerals group.
Reynolds, battered by the slump in aluminium prices, has been looking for
buyers for its gold operations for some time. It is retaining the Mount
Gibson and Yilgarn mines in Australia that last year contributed 210,000
ounces to Reynolds' total and will continue its gold project in Australia's
Northern Territories.
PosGold, which is currently in the throes of a hostile bid battle for Aztec
Mining, will pay Dollars 116m for the stake and undertake to deliver 30,000
ounces of gold over seven years.
The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will make PosGold the
largest stakeholder in the mine, which is located about 120km south-east of
Perth. Other partners in the project include Newcrest Mining, with a 20 per
cent interest and Billiton Australia Gold, with 30 per cent.

Fears of a further big contraction in Australia's car industry surfaced
yesterday, when Ford Australia said it would halt all production at the
Homebush assembly plant in New South Wales, and cease producing the Capri
sports car at its Broadmeadows plant in Melbourne.
In Sydney, Mr John Ogden, president of Ford Australia, emphasised that the
restructuring did not herald an immediate pull-out by Ford from
manufacturing in Australia.
Declining tariff protection for the Australian car industry caused Nissan,
the Japanese carmaker, to halt local assembly in 1992, with the loss of
almost 2,000 jobs. Tariffs, which stood at 57.5 per cent in the mid-1980s,
are being reduced and should reach 15 per cent by the year 2000.
Ford said that the decision to shut down the Homebush plant, which has been
assembling the Laser model since 1981 and employs around 400 people, was due
to 'increasing costs of complete knock-down assembly, reducing tariff levels
and declining volumes'.
One-off costs associated with the restructuring plan marred an otherwise
improved profit performance from Ford Australia in 1993. The company said
that it made a net loss of ADollars 45.3m (USDollars 32m) on sales of
ADollars 2.77bn, compared with a loss of ADollars 38.3m in 1992, when sales
reached ADollars 2.46bn.
But the 1993 deficit was entirely due to a ADollars 89.3m abnormal item,
largely reflecting the restructuring costs. After-tax operating profit was
ADollars 44m, up from a loss of ADollars 25.7m last time. Ford also said its
market share edged up from 22.9 to 24.4 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bayernwerk taps energy
opportunities in the east - The west German power group plans a DM5bn
investment in Thuringia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency has sold the remainder of eastern
Germany's regional utilities to Bayernwerk, west Germany's third-largest
electricity company.
Bayernwerk, which has acquired majority stakes in three utilities in the
eastern state of Thuringia, will invest more than DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) over
the next five years and guarantee several thousand jobs.
The sale follows separate acquisitions by RWE Energie, the country's largest
utility company, and PreussenElektra, the electricity division of Veba, the
energy-based conglomerate which together will invest more than DM5.5bn and
secure another 8,000-plus jobs.
The significance of these acquisitions is that they finally open up east
Germany to large investments in the electricity sector.
These are expected to exceed DM40bn by the end of the decade. More
importantly, the sale ends a bitter three-year-old property rights dispute
in which eastern Germany's 164 municipalities had unsuccessfully tried to
claim the assets of the region's 15 utility companies with the aim of
opening up the sector to genuine competition.
At issue in the dispute was the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract
negotiated by the then east and west German governments in August 1990. It
stipulated that only 49 per cent of eastern Germany's 15 regional utilities
could be owned by the municipalities with the remaining 51 per cent divided
among RWE, Preussen-Elektra, Bayernwerk, and west Germany's five smaller
utilities which would modernise the utilities.
However, as a means of underwriting these investments, the Stromvertrag
stipulated that the regional municipalities must buy 70 per cent of their
energy from Veag over the next 20 years. Veag is a monopoly structure: the
Stromvertrag gave RWE, PreussenElektra, and Bayernwerk a 75 per cent stake
in Veag, with the remaining 25 per cent divided among the five smaller west
German utilities. Veag, which controls the region's high-voltage grid, is
being privatised by the Treuhand to these companies.
In spite of the large investment commitments, 'the principle weakness of the
Stromvertrag is the way it stifles competition in eastern Germany's energy
sector', an energy expert and adviser to the Treuhand said.
Veba defends the Stromvertrag on the grounds that the two German governments
negotiated the deal as a means of securing a future for brown coal, or
lignite which fuels eastern Germany's utilities. However, the municipalities
have argued that west German utilities have established a monopoly in the
east's energy sector, stifling competition as a result.
Eastern Germany's municipalities, which retain the right to generate or buy
from elsewhere 30 per cent of their energy needs, have tried to fight back.
Several cities, including Potsdam, have opted for gas to circumvent the
monopoly structure and enter the lucrative energy sector. At the same time,
outsiders can take a stake in the remaining 49 per cent stake of the
regional utilities. But even they are locked into the Stromvertrag: the
utilities must buy 70 of their energy from Veag.
Yet common to all the players in eastern Germany's energy sector is the need
for customers. Before German unification, natural gas accounted for less
than 10 per cent of primary consumption in eastern Germany, while
electricity, fuelled by brown coal, accounted for more than 87 per cent.
Energy consumption has fallen 60 per cent since 1990, with brown
coal/electricity bearing the brunt, following the collapse of the region's
manufacturing base.
The concerns facing western German utilities centre on whether there will be
a sufficient growth in electricity sales in eastern Germany to justify their
large investment programme, and whether gas is set to become a leading
player which would undermine the careful architecture of the Stromvertrag.
Veba is confident that PreussenElektra will reap the benefits of its recent
acquisition. 'I don't see any danger for our investment. The Stromvertrag
guarantees us energy sales,' the company said. It added that politicians
would put pressure on east German cities to buy electricity instead of gas
to protect miners' jobs.
Veba's confidence has been further lifted by the prospect that even if
energy consumption shows few signs of a pick-up in eastern Germany,
PreussenElektra and the other west German utilities can resort to Union pour
la Coordination de la Production du Transport d'Electricite, or UPCD.
This means that energy generated in eastern Germany, unlike pre-unification
days, can be sold to other European Union countries as part of the UPCD
arrangement.
The Veag management is connecting high voltage grid lines to the eastern and
western German networks to secure sales across Germany and to EU countries.
'You can see why our investments and acquisitions in eastern Germany are an
opportunity of a life-time,' added Veba. Indeed, as one energy expert said,
without competition, how could they be anything else.

<TEXT>
MacMillan Bloedel, Canada's biggest forest products group, was profitable in
the fourth quarter because of strong timber markets and the lower Canadian
dollar.
Net profit was CDollars 5.1m (USDollars 3.89) or 3 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 16.5m, or 17 cents a share a year earlier, on sales of
Dollars 939m, against Dollars 789m.
For all 1993, profit totalled CDollars 53.2m, or 42 cents a share, against a
loss of of CDollars 49m, or 52 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 3.8bn,
against CDollars 3bn.
Mr Robert Findlay, president, said MB expects better performance in 1994
with strength in wood products and packaging and some improvement in pulp
and newsprint.
For the full year, strength in wood products was partly offset by poor pulp
and container board prices. 'Downtime' taken in some mills due to market
weakness led to higher overall production costs.
A joint engineered products venture in North America did well but KNP BT, in
western Europe, was adversely affected by the recession but improvement is
expected in 1994 following reorganisation of this company.
Housing stocks in the US and Japan, two key markets for MB wood products,
should be strong again this year, said Mr Findlay.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japan turns old debt into a new
company - Finance ministry officials describe government proposals to allow
the securitisation of bad debt as 'epoch-making', but not everyone agrees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's bureaucrats, scrambling for an ultimate Japanese Way to solve the
bad loan problem of their country's banks, presented their answer this week
with a government economic package.
'It's epoch-making,' said a triumphant finance ministry official, after
explaining its proposals to deal with the mounting bad loans and increasing
number of corporate restructuring programmes for which the banks are having
to provide financial aid.
The traditional 'Japanese Way' of dealing with bad or risky loans has been
to sit on them until conditions improved - or until the borrower went
bankrupt. Such methods have been under scrutiny, with critics contending
that Japanese banks should learn from their US counterparts to write off bad
loans or make loss reserves for dubious ones.
Non-performing loans at 21 leading institutions rose 7.7 per cent to
Y13,800bn (Dollars 126bn) in the first half to September, but this figure
might well be doubled if the broader, western interpretation of
non-performing loans is used.
The finance ministry's new policy guidelines allow banks to shift
deteriorating assets off balance sheets by securitising the loans, Japanese
style. Banks will be allowed to set up a special company to buy loans made
to non-bank financial institutions, to which banks have waived all or most
of the interest.
Through the plan, the ministry wants to wipe away concerns over problem
loans to non-bank finance companies, including housing loan companies caught
up in the buying frenzy of the late 1980s, which have been weighing heavily
on the Tokyo stock market and business confidence.
The ministry says that unlike the US securitisation of loans - where a third
party buys the securities - the company, financed by the banks, will
purchase the loan at a discounted price, and monitor the financial
restructuring of the borrower.
The scheme will allow banks to define their losses on such loans and, by
keeping the loans within the existing group of creditors instead of selling
it out into a secondary market, the non-bank finance companies and banks can
maintain their ties.
But in spite of the enthusiasm by the authorities, some Japanese bankers
contend that the loan securitisation scheme does not fundamentally solve the
problem, since the ties between the creditor bank and the non-bank financial
company remain, and financing the special purchasing company will be an
additional cost. 'It's a bit masochistic,' says one bank official.
Mr David Marshall, analyst at IBCA, the UK bank rating agency, says: 'The
measures do give some encouragement to banks to write off problem loans and
may pave the way for a more fundamental solution for the non-bank problem.'
However, he adds that the plan may allow banks to remove chunks of problem
loans from their balance sheets and hide them in the special-purpose
companies. The scheme also highlights the close involvement of the ministry
of finance in matters that in the West would be left to banks' management
and auditors.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry will ease the restrictions on making taxed
loan loss reserves. The measure will allow banks to add loan loss reserves
to cover risky loans so long as they are willing to pay tax for it; so far,
banks which wanted to reserve against a loan had to undergo strict ministry
scrutiny that the borrower could not repay its debts. Ms Alicia Ogawa,
analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, regards this scheme as good news so
long as the banks have enough profits to pay the taxes.
But without tax incentives, bankers say making reserves against risky loans
is too much of a burden. 'It does allow us to look forward and leave the
problems behind, but it's not beneficial, profit-wise,' says one commercial
bank official. 'But most of us are so busy dealing with unrecoverable loans,
that looking at those with a risk of going bad doesn't have much priority at
the moment.'

Sun International Bophuthatswana, owner of 12 casino resorts in the South
African homeland, reported a 16 per cent gain in pre-tax profit in the
half-year to December 31 to R158.3m (Dollars 46m), from R136.6m the previous
year.
The group enjoyed the first full contribution from its newest resort, the
Lost City, which lifted sales by nearly one-third to R717.6m from R556.4m.
Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said a sharp increase in the number of overseas
tourists at its Sun City complex was 'a breakthrough in the international
market place', with occupancy rates at more than 70 per cent despite the
expansion of facilities and the completion of the Lost City.
Operating margins held steady on improved operating profit of R178.8m
against R141.7m, but interest costs rose sharply to R20.5m from R4.6m,
reflecting the debt incurred in funding new projects. Long-term borrowings
were trimmed to R276.5m from R351.5m.
Slightly lower tax ensured attributable earnings climbed to R134.5m from
R110.6m, equivalent to 113 cents and 93 cents a share. A 17 per cent
improved interim dividend of 75 cents, against 64 cents, is declared.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Impala registers first-half gain
at pre-tax level

Pre-tax profit at South Africa'a Impala Platinum, the world's second-largest
producer, improved 3 per cent to R153.7m (Dollars 44.7m) in the half-year to
December 31, underpinned by a solid operating performance at the group's
mines and almost flat rand revenue for its platinum group metal production.
The rand's weakness against the dollar compensated for 55 per cent and 29
per cent lower dollar prices for rhodium and nickel respectively, which
compared with 9 per cent and 45 per cent better platinum and palladium
prices. The average rand price for the parcel of metals Impala sold fell to
R1,960 an ounce from R2,009 an ounce.
Mr Michael McMahon, managing director, said: 'The sky is falling on our
heads as far as metal prices go.' Although platinum revenue increased to
R734m from R524m, rhodium revenue collapsed to R146m from R318m. Overall
turnover rose slightly to R1.1bn from R1.03bn.
Mr McMahon said that given the 'soggy fundamental' market conditions facing
platinum, with plummeting car sales in Europe and Japan, hopes rested on the
metal's link with gold.
On-mine operating costs were well contained as Impala started to reap the
full benefit of its recent productivity drives centred on increasingly
mechanised underground operations and retrenchments throughout the group's
operations. Impala has shed one-third of its workforce in the past two
years, but with 37,000 employees is still short of a target of 35,000.
Increased capital spending and the group's revised expansion programme, in
addition to lower interest receipts and share of income from Impala's stake
in Lonrho's neighbouring platinum mines, took their toll.
Distributable profit fell to R53m from R59.1m, equivalent to 134 cents and
136 cents a share, but a maintained 45 cents dividend is declared. Mr
McMahon said Impala would match the performance in the second six months.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dividend cut at Genbel
Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Genbel Investments, the investment and securities trading group unbundled
last year from mining house Gencor, has reported a 30 per cent jump in
pre-tax income to R179m (Dollars 52m) in the six months to December 31.
However, the company made a R80m provision for the possible loss in value of
its stake the Oryx gold mine and aluminium producer Alusaf. The provision
set attributable profit back to R77m from R138m. The fall in earnings to 18
cents from 22 cents a share was accompanied by a 33 per cent lower interim
dividend of 10 cents.
A spokesman said Genbel had made good progress in recent months in
establishing its enlarged 'investment trust business' with R1bn borrowings
used to buy R717m worth of equities and gilts, plus a R270m futures
exposure.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: SEC to propose new rules for
stock trading systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday to propose new rules
that would establish record-keeping and reporting requirements for brokerage
firms operating automated stock trading systems in the US.
The proposals represent the first action the SEC has taken to follow up on
its Market 2000 report. Published last month, Market 2000 was the agency's
first big study of US financial markets in more than 20 years.
The report recommended a series of regulatory and reporting changes that it
believed would improve market supervision and oversight.
Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, said that while he welcomed the lower
costs and improved efficiencies that the automated trading systems had
generated, the systems were having a growing impact upon securities markets,
and it was important that regulators gathered more information about their
activities.
Under the terms of the new rules, which will not be introduced until the end
of a 60-day period for receiving comments from the industry, firms operating
the trading systems would have to make quarterly reports to the SEC about
participants, volume and transactions on the systems.
The rule changes are aimed primarily at big securities firms which use their
own trading systems to execute orders for their institutional and retail
clients. Seeking to cut costs and improve efficiency, more firms have moved
this kind of business in-house, rather than use the more conventional
floor-based exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the computer-based
markets like the National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq systems.
Yesterday, Mr Bernard Madoff, of Bernard Madoff Securities, a firm that
operates one of the biggest off-exchange automated trading systems, said he
anticipated little difficulty in complying with the SEC's new rules.

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: CBS ends record year on a strong
note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS yesterday announced a 39 per cent increase in fourth quarter earnings to
Dollars 46.4m as the top-rated US broadcast network completed a
record-breaking financial year on a strong note.
Full-year profits ended at Dollars 326.2m, up from Dollars 81m in 1992 and
the best result in the company's history. While the latest three-month
earnings failed to match CBS's accomplishments in the third quarter, when
the company earned Dollars 118.3m, profits in that period were boosted by
several one-off factors.
Once again the best performance within the group came from the CBS
Television Network, which has consistently led the other three networks  -
ABC, NBC and Fox - in recent viewing figures. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman,
said CBS was now close to being the most watched network in prime-time,
daytime and late night television, a feat achieved only once before by a US
network. Higher ratings usually lead to bigger profits because they allow
networks to charge higher rates for television advertisements.
CBS has been particularly successful in late night programming since
September's debut on the network of an 11.30pm weekly talk show featuring Mr
David Letterman, currently the most popular of the many talk show hosts on
US television.
The one cloud on CBS's horizon is its sports programming. Although the
company should draw big audiences for its broadcast of this month's Winter
Olympics from Lillehammer, Norway, last year CBS lost the rights to televise
both professional baseball and American football.
The loss of the contract to televise one of the two American football
leagues, which was awarded to Fox Television for Dollars 1.5bn, was a
particularly grievous blow. The 1994-95 season, which starts in September,
will be the first time CBS has not shown American football since the 1950s
when the network pioneered television coverage of the sport.
