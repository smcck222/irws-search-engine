FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades Aetna unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The life insurance subsidiary of Aetna, the US composite insurer, was
downgraded yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's in a move which could hit its
ability to attract new business.
The downgrading came as Aetna revealed an after-tax loss of Dollars 366m
last year (Dollars 593m before accounting changes), resulting from
substantial one-off charges announced two weeks ago.
The charges, amounting to Dollars 1.28bn after tax, stemmed from the
company's move to stop offering unprofitable guaranteed investment and
annuity products, and to cut 4,000 jobs in an attempt to lift its lacklustre
performance.
S&amp;P said it had lowered its rating of Aetna Life's claims-paying ability to
A plus, removing its double-A rating. Given the long-term nature of many
life insurance products, a strong rating is an important factor in many
customers' minds when selecting an insurance company.
S&amp;P said the downgrade was based in part on an assessment of the charge made
against discontinued annuity products. Though the assumptions that lay
behind this charge seemed reasonable, Aetna Life might eventually need to
set aside more to cover the costs of these products, which would not run off
for 30 to 40 years, S&amp;P said.
The agency added that the life company had become more reliant on its health
insurance operations, and the future for this business was unclear given the
debate in the US over healthcare reform.
Aetna disputed S&amp;P's decision, saying that its life company was stronger
than it had been before the charges. It also said other rating agencies
continue to give a double A rating to its claims paying ability.

Spectrum Information Technologies has filed a counter-suit against Mr John
Sculley, who has resigned as chairman and chief executive only four months
after joining the company. The company is seeking over Dollars 300m in
damages.
In the lawsuit, filed in Connecticut late yesterday, the company counters Mr
Sculley's claims that he was deliberately misled concerning the company's
accounting and legal problems. Mr Sculley, former chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, said he would not have joined Spectrum had he
known it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On Monday, Mr Sculley filed a suit against Mr Peter Caserta, Spectrum
president.
Spectrum claims, however, that Mr Sculley was fully aware of the SEC
investigation and of its accounting practices before joining the company.
'The explanation Sculley provided for his resignation is false,' the suit
states, 'as his own 'due diligence' file, which he left at Spectrum's
offices after resigning makes clear, Sculley was fully aware of the
accounting issues that he cited as one of the reasons for his departure.'
Spectrum is charging Mr Sculley with breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, mismanagement and theft of trade secrets.

in quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong operating margins enabled Goodyear, the last of the big US-owned tyre
groups, to lift net income by nearly 30 per cent in the fourth quarter,
despite a slight decline in sales.
The company posted earnings of Dollars 113.2m, or 76 cents a share, in the
final three months of 1993, against Dollars 87.5m, or 61 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1992.
Revenues slipped from Dollars 2.92bn to Dollars 2.91bn, largely because of 6
per cent slide in Europe, where the car industry is severely depressed.
Latin America, with sales 5 per cent higher and operating income up 74 per
cent, continued to outperform other regions. Sales were flat in the US,
despite a strong performance by the domestic car industry.
The announcement was greeted warmly on Wall Street, even though the company
had given investors an accurate estimate of its results two weeks ago. The
stock added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 in early trading, amid expectations
that the company's performance would improve as the US economy expands in
1994.
For the full year, net earnings, excluding extraordinary items and the
effect of accounting changes, improved 33 per cent to Dollars 488.7m, or
Dollars 2.57. Worldwide sales dipped to Dollars 11.64bn, compared with
Dollars 11.78bn, but the year-earlier figure included Dollars 43m in
revenues from businesses which were later discontinued.

Northwest Airlines, the US carrier planning a flotation on the US stock
market by the end of next month, scraped into profitability in the fourth
quarter with net income of Dollars 10.5m compared with net losses of Dollars
695.2m last time.
The company said that the figure would have been higher without the impact
of an Dollars 85m accounting charge relating to new labour contracts.
Operating profits were Dollars 74.8m compared with operating losses of
Dollars 185.4m last time, it said.
For the full year, the airline reported a turnround from operating losses of
Dollars 376.2m to operating profits of Dollars 292.4m. But it was still in
the red after tax, showing net losses of Dollars 115.3m compared with losses
of Dollars 1.08bn last time. The previous year's figures included
non-recurring pre-tax charges of Dollars 792.7m.
Northwest Airlines left the stock market in 1989.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aetna, the US multiline insurer, racked up an after-tax loss of Dollars 366m
last year (Dollars 593m before accounting changes) as a result of
substantial one-off charges announced recently.
The charges, amounting to Dollars 1.28bn after tax, followed a decision by
the company to stop offering unprofitable guaranteed investment and annuity
products, and to cut 4,000 jobs in an attempt to lift its lacklustre
performance.
Without the one-off items, Aetna showed an improvement in operating profits
last year, to Dollars 610m from Dollars 192m in 1992.
The improvement came against a fall in premium income, from Dollars 10.8bn
to Dollars 10.6bn, and was helped by a 7 per cent decline in operating
expenses during the year, though Aetna's overheads still remain higher than
most of its competitors.
For the final quarter of the year, before charges, the company reported
earnings of Dollars 143m, compared with less than Dollars 1m the year
before.
Earnings improvements were seen in all operating areas during the year. Net
income in health and life insurance (before charges) rose to Dollars 344m
from Dollars 315m, though fourth quarter results stayed flat at Dollars 91m.
Commercial property/casualty insurance operations reported a profit of
Dollars 139m for the year (a loss of Dollars 125m in 1992) while the
personal property/casualty business had earnings of Dollars 8m (a loss of
Dollars 18m).
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said Aetna's actions to cut the drag on its
earnings from the unprofitable investment products, to reduce costs and to
cut the size of its property portfolio would enable it to improve returns in
future.

Quebecor, the printing, publishing and forest products group, reported a 93
per cent gain in operating income in 1993, with better results from most of
its businesses.
Net income from operations was CDollars 75m (USDollars 57.2m), or CDollars
1.11 a share, against CDollars 56.2m, or 85 cents, a year earlier, up 31 per

items final net profit was CDollars 74.6m, or CDollars 1.10, against
CDollars 87.3m, or CDollars 1.34.
The company's biggest single unit is Quebecor Printing, north America's
second-biggest commercial printer. It has just acquired 49 per cent of
Groupe Jean Didier, France's leading commercial printer. Later, Quebecor
will take full control of Didier which has annual sales of about USDollars
350m.
Quebecor Printing said it was also looking at acquisitions in Italy and the
UK.

Spectrum Information Technologies, the company that Mr John Sculley abruptly
left earlier this week, said yesterday that its accounting firm, KPMG Peat
Marwick, had terminated its relationship with the company.
KPMG was brought in at Spectrum in November by Mr Sculley, the former
chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer. On Monday Spectrum restated
its earnings, based on KPMG's recommendations, to defer Dollars 6.4m in
revenues previously recorded in the past two quarters.
Spectrum said that the accounting firm gave no reason for ending the
relationship, but indicated that the resignation was 'not based on any
accounting disagreements with the company'.
'We view their action as arbitrary and unprofessional,' said Mr Salvatore
Marino, chief financial officer. 'The accounting firm had not yet reviewed
the financial records of the company. We think it is more than coincidental
that their resignation follows that of John Sculley.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Viacom tops the Paramount bill -
A look at the final offers for the entertainment group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 10bn, five-month takeover battle for entertainment group
Paramount Communications may be within days of a final showdown, with cable
company Viacom holding an apparent lead but television shopping channel QVC
Network still fighting hard to win investor support.
Shareholders have until midnight, New York time, on Monday to decide between
the bidders' final offers, and victory will go to whichever company wins
over 50 per cent of Paramount's stock. However, if neither side gets over
half the shares, the battle will continue and the bidders will be free to
alter their terms again.
During the final few days of the campaign, both Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman
of Viacom, and Mr Barry Diller, the film industry executive who heads QVC,
have been wooing the big institutional investors and Wall Street traders who
control much of Paramount's stock in a succession of face to face meetings.
Two issues dominate these sessions: the relative value of the offers, and
which bidder will be better able to exploit the assets of Paramount, which
include Hollywood film studios, book publishing, theme parks and New York's
Madison Square Garden sports arena.
A significant number of investors have already made clear that they intend
to tender their shares to Viacom unless QVC can improve its terms, which the
rules of the Paramount auction forbid it from doing before Monday's close.
Viacom is offering Dollars 107 a share in cash for 50.1 per cent of
Paramount's stock, compared to QVC's Dollars 104 a share. The package of
common stock and other securities QVC is offering for the remaining 49.9 per
cent has a higher theoretic market value than that in Viacom's bid, giving
the overall QVC bid a value of around Dollars 86 a share to Viacom's Dollars
81.50.
QVC's apparent lead is due partly to the fact that Viacom's shares have
fallen sharply as it has looked more like the winner, while QVC's shares
have risen. Investors are concerned about the amount of Viacom paper that
will flood the market in the event of victory, as well as the debt the
winner will be taking on.
However, many investors say they prefer the Viacom offer because it
guarantees to pay up to Dollars 12 a share if its stock trades below a
certain level in the year after a Paramount takeover. The QVC bid lacks any
such mechanism and Mr Diller argues that 'there are no safe harbours. There
might appear to be but there really aren't. They are illusions'.
However, QVC has been hinting that its largest backer, the telephone company
BellSouth, might give a degree of share price support by offering to buy a
certain amount of QVC stock at a particular price over a period of years.
But if it did so before Monday night it might be accused of breaking the
auction rules.
As for strategic fit between the two companies, shareholders are essentially
being presented with a choice between Viacom's depth of management and broad
range of businesses, and Mr Diller's individual proven flair for turning
around troubled Hollywood studios.
Paramount Pictures, the crown jewel among Paramount's assets and the reason
the takeover battle has been fought so long and hard, has a distinctly
lacklustre track record - a fact underlined last week when the group warned
it would suffer a loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m in its third quarter.
Mr Diller, who headed Paramount during one of the studio's successful
phases, and then went on to launch Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox business as a
fourth television network, says the group's film and television operations
need most work. 'And I've the most experience in those areas . . . that's
not the experience the other side has. It will take them longer.'
Viacom - which bought many of its creative businesses, rather than building
them from scratch - argues that it is the better bet because a merger with
Paramount, together with its simultaneous Dollars 8bn bid for Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video rental retailer, will create a 'global
entertainment powerhouse'.
Viacom says it will bring to the partnership much more depth of management,
its own successful track record in television programming and Blockbuster's
strong cash flow and film and record retailing chain. The combination will
offer new distribution channels for Paramount's studios.
Wall Street was initially unenthusiastic about a
Viacom-Blockbuster-Paramount deal, largely on the grounds that Blockbuster's
video rental business is going to be made obsolete by inter-active,
video-on-demand in the home.
But some analysts have since warmed to the combination. Says Mr Christopher
Dixon of Paine Webber: 'The ability to create efficiencies, cross promote
and develop new businesses holds enormous promise.'
The idea of Mr Diller reviving Paramount still excites Wall Street, which
for the most part believes both bidders would be worthy winners. But with
the strategic arguments finely balanced, perceptions of short-term
shareholder value will win the day, and right now that looks like handing
victory to Viacom.

Scandinavian Airlines System is to cut costs by nearly SKr3bn (Dollars 372m)
over the next 18 months through a shake-up in staffing and operations.
The airline, which made a loss in each of the last four years, plans to cut
2,900 full-time jobs, one in seven of its 20,000 staff, and streamline group
organisation.
It is also closing down some routes and reducing the number of aircraft
types operated. Two models, the Boeing 737 and Saab 340, will disappear from
its fleet.
SAS said the moves would assist future expansion and allow it to enter
alliances or co-operation agreements with other airlines. In November, plans
to merge with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines as
part of the Alcazar project, collapsed.

<TEXT>
Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, yesterday reported a sharp
reversal in its fortunes, with a net profit of NKr1.52bn (Dollars 200m) in
1993 against a loss of NKr154m a year earlier.
The savings bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, said
although loan losses continue to be unusually high and growth in volume was
modest, the improvement was far above expectations.
The near-50 per cent decline in domestic interest rates, which contributed
to a sharp rise in bond prices, made a strong contribution to the turnround.
Sparebanken Nor will pay a dividend of NKr18 per primary capital certificate
 -a hybrid security listed on the Oslo bourse - and will allocate NKr599m to
a dividend adjustment reserve fund.
Group net interest income rose by NKr604m to NKr3.21bn, as net operating
income shot up to NKr5.35bn from NKr3.73bn. Operating expenses rose
slightly, to NKr2.46bn from NKr2.43bn. Losses on loans and guarantees dipped
to NKr1.31bn from NKr1.5bn, but the bank still achieved an operating profit
of NKr1.56bn against an operating loss of NKr271m.
The bank said the volume of defaulted loans developed 'in the right
direction'. Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage lending institution which
converted to a bank last year, reported a rise in 1993 pre-tax profit, to
NKr272.5m from NKr133m in 1992, helped by an increase in net interest income
and a fall in loan losses.
Nevertheless, the bank's shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr150.50 yesterday
on the Oslo bourse in active trading. Norgeskreditt will pay a dividend of
NKr8.50 per preference share, with the total payout reaching NKr96.4m.

Group net interest income rose to NKr313.7m, or 1.5 per cent of average
total assets, from NKr266.8m, or 1.3 per cent of average total assets.
Realised gains on bonds, certificates and foreign exchange reached NKr29.7m,
against a loss of NKr3.8m in 1992. Profits on shares amounted to NKr26m last
year, against a loss of NKr17.1m.
The bank said a write-down of NKr6.9m of the share portfolio at the end of
1992 was reversed in last year's first quarter.

Shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian financial services group
privatised last week, opened at a 32 per cent premium on their first day of
trading yesterday.
IMI's stock, which also made its debut in London and New York, settled at
L13,430 by the close, marking a 23 per cent premium over the L10,900 offer
price.
The heady performance will come as a boost to the Italian treasury, which is
embarking on an ambitious privatisation programme. IMI is the second big
public sell-off, after Credito Italiano last December. It will be followed
by Banca Commerciale Italiana later this month.
Mr Luigi Arcuti, IMI's chairman, acknowledged the strong demand for the
company's shares had exceeded even his most optimistic expectations.
By the end of the last week's offer period, closed early because of
oversubscription, IMI received applications from almost 375,000 domestic
retail investors for nearly 378m shares - more than five times the 75m on
offer. Separately, more than 1,800 institutions applied for almost 1.6bn
shares - almost 13 times the 125m available to them.
The demand means it will be easily Italy's biggest company, in terms of the
number of shareholders, eclipsing the likes of Fiat and Generali.
To fulfil the unexpectedly strong retail demand, the treasury will redirect
to the domestic offering 18.75m shares previously earmarked for
institutional investors. The latter's original allocation will be
maintained, however, by allocating a similar number of shares originally
held back for market stabilisation purposes. As a result, the combined
public-sector stake in the bank will fall to about 25 per cent from more
than 60 per cent previously.
Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general of the treasury, confirmed the state's
remaining shares would also be sold. He gave no indication of when the
second tranche would go.

The first sale of secondary debt in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group,
is believed have run into problems because Midland, the UK bank which is
selling the FFr130m loan (Dollars 21m), has delayed completing the deal.
Speculation in the New York secondary debt market suggested that the Bank of
England was putting pressure on Midland to abandon the proposed sale.
Both Midland and the Bank of England declined to comment on the issue.
Midland, one of the 64 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
net debt, is understood to have agreed in principle early last month to sell
its FFr130m portion of debt to a US investor for 60 per cent of its original
value.
The deal was agreed subject to documentation. This process usually takes
three weeks for the first transaction in a sizeable company such as Euro
Disney, and Midland was expected to complete the transaction a few days ago.
However, US sources said that the deal had been delayed over the past few
days. This has led to speculation over the role of the Bank of England,
which has expressed concern about the effects of uncontrolled secondary debt
trading.
The Bank has formed a working party of banks in an effort to develop a code
of practice that would require buyers of distressed debt to comply with the
Bank's set of principles for the restructuring of troubled companies.
The Midland deal had been regarded by secondary debt specialists as a
watershed transaction which could have opened up a lucrative market in Euro
Disney and helped to establish the distressed investment market in Europe.
The secondary loans market has expanded rapidly in the US. But there is now
an imbalance between the amount of capital available and the dwindling
number of distressed investment opportunities, prompting US investors to
look to Europe.

Sales revenue grew 80 per cent to Ft15.5bn.
Fotex plans to place about 30 per cent of the company with selected

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bank's rescue leaves bitter
taste - The Credit Lyonnais bale-out is unpopular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A favourite topic of conversation among French financiers has for years been
the precarious state of Credit Lyonnais, one of the biggest and by far the
most controversial of France's banks. However, recently their comments have
adopted a rather bitter tone.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was parachuted into Credit Lyonnais last autumn to
succeed Mr Jean Yves Haberer as chairman, is approaching the final stages of
negotiations with the French government over a recapitalisation package to
repair the state-controlled bank's battered balance sheet.
The timing of the rescue will be critical. Credit Lyonnais, burdened by the
heavy losses and provisions left by Mr Haberer's frenetic expansion
strategy, made a net interim loss of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 175.6m) in the first
six months of last year. This sent its capital ratio to just above the legal
minimum of 8 per cent. It is expected in late March to announce an even
larger loss, of up to FFr4bn, for 1993, which would push the capital ratio
below the minimum.
This means Mr Peyrelevade and the government must agree terms for the
recapitalisation before the results come out. The critical question is
whether they will manage to meet that deadline against the rising chorus of
complaints from Credit Lyonnais's competitors.
Recapitalisations are a familiar feature in the French public sector. The
Bull computer company, Aerospatiale and Air France have all recently
received - or are now negotiating - cash injections from the government.
However, these groups, like most recent recipients of rescue packages, are
involved with industry, not finance.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, and Mr Michel Pebereau, his
opposite number at Banque Nationale de Paris, have argued publicly that it
is unfair for the government to bale out Credit Lyonnais when their banks
are left to fend for themselves.
The counter-argument from the government is that it has no choice but to
help Credit Lyonnais. The bank is paying a painful price for the
over-ambitious policies pursued by Mr Haberer.
The crux of its problems is his aggressive lending strategy, which left the
bank heavily exposed to the rise in business failures and the fall in
property values during the French recession. It has also faced huge
write-offs on loans to a string of corporate catastrophes such as Olympia &amp;
York, the Canadian property group, and Switzerland's Sasea.
Credit Lyonnais yesterday lodged an official complaint against the judge in
charge of the Sasea receivership.
The government hopes the other French banks will come round to its way of
thinking. Many of them, privately, already have. 'No one ever likes to see a
competitor being given preferential treatment,' said one senior Paris
banker. 'But we all know that Credit Lyonnais is in a desperate state and
that last thing we want is a French version of Banesto. We'd all suffer
then.'
Yet the complaints of Credit Lyonnais's competitors - coupled with the
threat of opposition from the European Commission, which last month
challenged the latest FFr2.5bn injection for Bull - may well affect the
final shape of the recapitalisation package.
The government is keen to allay criticism by minimising its direct capital
injection, probably to between FFr3.5bn and FFr4bn, and to be seen to
encourage Credit Lyonnais to raise capital on its own through asset sales.
The group has already begun with last month's FFr1bn disposal of its 30 per
cent stake in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group.
Mr Peyrelevade is expected to indicate other areas for divestment when the
1993 results are published next month.
In the meantime, he hopes to float off between FFr25bn and FFr28bn of Credit
Lyonnais's property assets into a new state-owned company. Credit Commercial
de France, another bank, implemented a similar scheme before its 1987
privatisation, as did Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the property group, in its
recent rescue.
Analysts suspect that such a package should be sufficient to stabilise
Credit Lyonnais. 'It ought to be enough, but everything depends on how bad
the 1993 figures turn out to be and that's anyone's guess,' said Mr Stephan
Arrouays, banking analyst at BZW. However, he, like other analysts, believes
that Mr Peyrelevade still has a tough task ahead before it can achieve the
government's final goal: privatisation.
'It's far too soon to say what effect the recapitalisation will have on the
trading position,' said Ms Susan Sternglass, banking analyst at Goldman
Sachs. 'It's possible that Credit Lyonnais might break even by the end of
1994, but Peyrelevade will have to provide firm proof of a return to profit
before it is a sellable company.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Total steady in spite of oil
price write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Total, the French oil group, yesterday announced estimated net profits of
FFr2.9bn (Dollars 492m) for last year, a slight increase over the FFr2.8bn
in 1992. The result was largely in line with expectations.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, group chairman, said the results demonstrated Total's
resilience to recession in Europe, and the sharp fall in the oil price in
1993. The latest results included an exceptional inventory write-down of
FFr800m relating to the decline in crude oil prices.
Excluding the inventory loss, operating income rose from FFr7.3bn to
FFr7.6bn, while cashflow surged to FFr11.3bn from FFr10bn. Sales remained
stable at about FFr136bn. The effects of a capital increase in April last
year, however, prompted a fall in earnings per share, from FFr13.8 to
FFr13.2.
In spite of the depressed market conditions, Total said it had managed to
pursue its strategy of increasing reserves and production, developing gas
activities, restructuring specialty chemicals activities and extending the
geographical base.
Mr Tchuruk mentioned several areas where the group was expanding its
development and production of oil and gas. Total's projects in Indonesia and
Colombia, for example, should help achieve the company's target - outside
the Middle East - of a 40 per cent increase in production during this year
and next.
In 1993, the group's exploration and production division, which excludes the
Middle East, saw operating profits fall from FFr2.9bn to FFr2.2bn. The
decline was largely blamed on the downturn in the oil price, which averaged
Dollars 17 per barrel of Brent crude, compared with Dollars 19.30 in 1992.
The trading and Middle East division increased its profits in 1993, from
FFr600m to FFr700m, reflecting the low exposure of upstream margins to
declining crude prices, and an improvement in trading and shipping
activities. Including the Middle East, the group's total oil and gas
reserves rose from 3.95m barrels of oil equivalent to 4.07m barrels by the
end of last year.
Operating profits in the refining and marketing division rose sharply from
FFr2.1bn to FFr3.3bn, the result of a slight recovery in refining margins
and a strong improvement in Total's US operations.
In chemicals, however, profits declined by 18 per cent to FFr1.4bn. Total
said the fall reflected the impact of recession in Europe and, in
particular, the weak demand from the automotive industry for its coatings
and paint products.
During the year, gross capital expenditures rose from FFr14.8bn in 1992 to
FFr17.6bn, while the debt-to-equity ratio declined.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at FMT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FMT Holdings, the former Vickers subsidiary which is viewed as one of the
last global competitors in the British-owned machine tool industry, has
called in the receivers.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, was this week appointed receiver at the
Brighton-based company, whose chairman, Mr Mike Bright, is one of the the
best-known figures in the industry.
News of the receivership was immediately described by observers as a
'disaster' for the industry. However, the company is continuing trading, and
it is understood that the receivers will try to sell it as an ongoing
business.
FMT is one of the few British producers to compete head-on with the much
larger Japanese and German machine tool builders in high-technology
machining centres, linked together by computer control to create flexible
manufacturing systems.
The timing of the receivership was a shock to the industry - many UK
producers have recently been expressing cautious optimism after three years
of recession.
FMT even held an open day last week to display new products, and according
to one observer, appeared to be relatively busy.
However, it is believed that the company has been short of new orders and
has also been hit by price-cutting in the UK market by German and Japanese
companies.
It is understood that the receivers have already made about 30 redundancies
from a workforce of 160.
The receivership is a further twist in the chequered history of a company
that, as Kearney, Trecker and Marwin, once employed 2,000 people with
several factories in Sussex.
In the 1970s, as KTM, it became a subsidiary of Vickers, but in 1988 Mr
Bright and five senior managers bought it from the luxury cars and
engineering group in a Pounds 10.6m buy-out.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A marriage proposed for tax reasons? - A
look at the rationale behind GKN's hostile Pounds 496m offer for Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN lets the television news justify its proposed marriage of helicopter and
armoured vehicle production.
From Bosnia to Somalia, the recurring image of light tanks escorting the
sick and wounded to waiting aircraft, or helicopter gunships assisting
ground forces, pays testament to the natural alliance of the two sectors.
That, at least, is the stated rationale of the engineering and industrial
services group which is courting Westland, Britain's only helicopter
manufacturer.
Westland's institutional shareholders and a growing number of City analysts,
however, have not been appeased by claims that the changing post-cold war
environment has created a ready market for manufacturers of rapid response
military vehicles.
'We cannot see any synergy between GKN and Westland,' one leading
institutional shareholder said yesterday.
GKN's real motive, they suggest, is not the determination to exploit sales
potential in the world's 40 areas of conflict. Instead, the Pounds 496m bid
for Westland camouflages a deal engineered by the group's tax advisers, not
its military strategists.
Combining Westland's lucrative spares and overhaul business with GKN's
existing defence and engineering operations would enable GKN to increase the
proportion of UK sales to 40 per cent of turnover.
In turn, the Yeovil-based group's pre-tax profits - up 22 per cent to Pounds
30.5m in the 12 months to October 1 last year - would enable GKN to recover
a mountain of pent-up advance corporation tax.
The prospect of recoverable ACT was arguably the most significant factor in
persuading the engineering group to increase its stake in Westland and make
a full bid rather than sell out to other potential suitors such as British
Aero-space.
In 1992, GKN wrote off Pounds 132.6m in recoverable ACT and made another
sizeable provision last year. And, as Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman,
admitted this week, releasing those funds 'should impact favourably on the
group's overall corporation tax rate.'
Although Westland is expected to contribute only about Pounds 300m to GKN's
total sales of Pounds 2.5bn, the promise of a 5 percentage reduction in the
overall tax ratio proved an arresting proposition.
'The reason for doing this deal is purely financial,' according to one
engineering analyst. 'The idea of a defence synergy between armoured
vehicles and helicopters is a bit far fetched.'
That view was echoed by a leading defence industry analyst, who added: 'It's
all about the tax angle. It changes GKN's risk profile, but I'm not sure
they realise the diffi-culties of the aerospace ind-ustry.'
GKN, meanwhile, has difficulties of its own. Its recent performance has been
hampered by increasingly tough trading conditions, particularly in
automotive components which account for 58 per cent of sales.
Weak demand from the European car industry pinned pre-tax profits at Pounds
60m (Pounds 60.9m) in the first half of 1993, and prospects for the full
year have been hit by heavy redundancy and restructuring costs.
Those charges are expected to result in 1993 pre-tax profits falling by more
than 20 per cent to Pounds 97m.
Against that background, and GKN's commitment to dispose of peripheral
activities, the potential contribution of an enlarged defence division is by
no means assured.
Westland brings with it a Pounds 1.45bn order backlog, but it has only one
firm order for its flagship, the EH101 helicopter, developed jointly with
Agusta of Italy.
The civilian market for such aircraft is small and shrinking, and defence
analysts question whether the EH101, costing at least Pounds 30m each, will
prove an economic option as military spending comes under increasing
pressure.
GKN was only persuaded last summer that there was still life in its defence
business when Kuwait ordered 200 Warrior armed vehicles.
Up to then, it had been considering disposing of the defence arm. Had it
done so, it would have presaged the strategy later followed by BAe, which
came to the conclusion that defence, aerospace and automotive engineering do
not sit happily together.
Yet Sir David Lees has changed his mind and now believes that Westland and
an export-driven armoured vehicle division can push group turnover beyond
Pounds 3bn.
However, overseas sales, the main driving force behind the potential success
of a reinvigorated defence business, could be undermined by a rumbling
dispute with Arab governments which GKN would inherit with Westland.
Last year the helicopter manufacturer was awarded Pounds 385m damages
against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation over the 1980 decision
by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to abandon a helicopter
order. Trying to tease that money out of potential Middle East customers is
a risky prospect for GKN if it is relying on the Kuwaiti order for Warriors
to lead to greater things.
Nevertheless, the group is committed to winning outright control of Westland
and is in a strong position to do so having secured United Technologies'
18.7 per cent stake.
With 47 per cent of the company already in its pocket, GKN thinks it can
convince the institutions that the company's best interests lie in a
diversified group with a track record of forging joint ventures and overseas
collaborations.
Such ventures could offset potential difficulties with Arab customers. But
with speculation that Sir David Lees wants Westland mainly to improve his
own group's tax profile, the institutions will seek an improved offer before
sell-ing.
As one institution said yesterday: 'He will have to do better if he wants to
see GKN helicopters and armoured vehicles working in concert.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad hit by Pounds 12m exceptional
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners Abroad yesterday announced profits before tax and exceptional items
of Pounds 17.8m for the 12 months to October 31, compared with Pounds 30.4m
the previous year.
Mr Francis Baron, chief executive, said Pounds 12m of exceptional items had
pulled the pre-tax profits figure down to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 25.5m).
Mr Baron said Pounds 4.9m of the exceptional costs were attributable to the
successful defence last year to a takeover bid by Airtours, its rival, the
establishment of its strategic alliance with travel agents Thomas Cook and
other professional fees.
A further Pounds 1.5m of exceptional costs arose from compensation paid to
former directors of the group. Mr Howard Klein, chairman, Mr Roger Allard,
managing director, and Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director, resigned last
year.
Mr Baron would not say how the compensation was divided between the three.
The remaining costs related to property provisions in the UK and Spain.
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 710m as a result of holiday price
discounting and reduced airline revenues.
Cash balances at the year-end were Pounds 100.3m, compared with Pounds
98.4m.
COMMENT
The City was cheered yesterday by the absence of any previously undisclosed
bad news. Mr Baron is also widely seen to be taking appropriate action to
restructure the group. A cause for concern, however, is how Thomson and
Airtours, the group's larger competitors, plan to respond to Owners Abroad's
new management. Mr Baron said Lunn Poly and Going Places, the larger groups'
travel agents chains, had damaged Owners Abroad last year by pushing Thomson
and Airtours holidays. Owners Abroad's link with Thomas Cook gives it some
advantages but does not allow it to respond fully in kind. Expected 1994
profits of Pounds 21m and earnings of 7.4p put the group on a prospective
multiple of 16, which is probably generous. Most analysts, however, do not
expect restructuring benefits to show through until 1995, when expected
Pounds 27.5m profits and earnings of 9.7p provide a more realistic multiple
of 12.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wilton plans Chinese-speaking channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wilton Group, a UK-quoted company, is planning to launch a satellite
channel for the Chinese-speaking communities of western Europe, writes
Raymond Snoddy.
The channel will be broadcast on the Astra satellite and will be a
subscription service.
Wilton will take about 80 per cent of the Chinese Channel. The remainder
will be owned by the Shaw Media Corporation of Hong Kong.
A majority of the Chinese language programming will be supplied by
Television Broadcasts, the Hong Kong broadcaster.
The aim is to begin a limited service next month and build up to 12 hours a
day by the autumn.
The company, to be based in London, will broadcast predominantly in
Cantonese, although there will also be programmes in Mandarin and
Vietnamese.
The service will be aimed at the estimated 850,000 Chinese living in Europe,
where the main population centres are the UK, France and the Netherlands.
Wilton is planning to change its name to Cinecom and concentrate on the
media, following a substantial investment by Mr Clive Ng, a businessman of
Malaysian background.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Westland shares up 7.5% on bid rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Westland climbed 7.5 per cent yesterday after the Yeovil-based
helicopter manufacturer formally rejected the hostile Pounds 496m takeover
bid launched by GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, writes
Tim Burt.
Speculation that GKN would have to improve its offer pushed Westland shares
up from 307p to 330p.
Shareholders have been offered 290p per ordinary and preferred share, 354.8p
for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all
payable in cash with a partial share alternative.
Westland said the bid - which GKN plans to fund partly from its own
resources and partly from a 1-for-5 rights issue raising Pounds 248m - would
be vigorously contested.
Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said: 'The GKN bid brings nothing extra to
Westland that it does not already possess. Its offers clearly undervalue the
business and appear principally designed to address GKN's tax problems.'
Following his statement, the share price climbed to 333p before falling back
slightly. It closed at a 14 per cent premium to the 290p offer - already
accepted by United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters,
which is selling its 18.7 per cent stake to GKN for Pounds 75m.
Analysts said demand for Westland shares had been fuelled by expressions of
support from leading institutional shareholders.
Mr Richard Hughes, director of investment management at M&amp;G - which holds 12
per cent of the company - said although the 290p offer was acceptable to
UTC, 'it remains to be seen whether it's good enough for the other
shareholders'.
The helicopter manufacturer is also understood to have received the backing
of Schroders, which holds 13.5 per cent and acts as its financial adviser,
and Royal Insurance, which holds 4 per cent.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader whose Yeovil constituency
includes the Westland plant, also came out against the GKN bid.
'It fails to give assurances about the future of the workforce and does not
promise to maintain the integrity of the Westland product range,' he said.
Shares in the engineering group - whose core business involves automotive
components, armoured vehicle production and pallet hire - fell 16p to 566p.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort European at small premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust, which was
Pounds 380m oversubscribed in its public offer last week, in effect went to
a small premium in the first day's trading yesterday.
The shares were issued part paid at 50p, with one warrant attached to every
five shares. The shares closed yesterday at 43 1/2 p, and the warrants
traded separately at 43p, giving a package price for a share and a fifth of
a warrant of about 52p, a premium of 4 per cent. Kleinwort said this was
'encouraging', but in line with expectations.
Smith New Court said trading in the shares had been heavy, with volume of
58m, plus 8.7m in the warrants. A total of 500m shares have been issued in
the trust, which was the largest UK investment trust launch on record.
Kleinworts would not comment how much of the initial amount raised had been
invested so far, but said that purchases were on target. The trust will
invest in companies privatised within the last five years, in the UK as well
as the rest of Europe, in addition to taking advantage of new privatisations
as they crop up.
The partly-paid structure was intended to allow gradual investment of the
fund.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Grahams Rintoul to be restructured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grahams Rintoul Investment Trust, management of which was taken over by
Lazards last year, is to be restructured and its name changed to the Lazard
Smaller Equities Investment Trust.
American Express Bank is to sell off its majority stake in the trust, after
converting 2m of its stepped preference shares into 1.6m ordinary shares.
Its entire holding of ordinary and stepped preference shares has been placed
with institutions, subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary
meeting on March 7.
The increasing dividend entitlement of the stepped preference shares has not
been covered over the last three years and has forced the fund's managers to
concentrate on picking high-yielding stocks. Reducing the number of such
shares will give greater flexibility to invest for capital growth as well as
income.
The restructuring will increase the capital and income cover of remaining
stepped preference shares, but will decrease the net asset value per
ordinary share. However, the company says that the dividend savings will
amount to Pounds 5.3m over the remaining 19 year life of the shares, and the
benefit of this will fall to the ordinary shareholders.
In the year to December 31 1993, the net asset value per ordinary share
increased by 50 per cent to 170.9p, and during January 1994 rose by a
further 14.6 per cent. A single dividend for the year of 0.25p is proposed.
The trust is not recommending that any further shareholders take up the
option to convert, as this would involve loss of both income and capital.

The company said both properties reflected its philosophy of investing a
proportion of its resources in purchases that had substantial future
potential for capital enhancement, but currently yielded no income.
With its joint venture partner, Pamlion Properties, Frogmore is acquiring
Inverforth House and the ad-joining Inverforth Close, at Hampstead Heath,
London.
Frogmore has also acquired the recently completed 46,500 sq ft Imperial

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Overseas lifts assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fleming Overseas Investment Trust had a net asset value of 360.6p per
share as at December 31, up some 18 per cent on the figure of 306.6p
reported six months earlier.
The year-on-year improvement, against a value of 271p, was 33 per cent.
The trust, which seeks capital appreciation, easily outpaced its benchmark -
the FT-A World Index excluding UK in sterling terms - which rose just 4.7
per cent over the latest six month period.
Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, chairman, said the outperformance reflected an
underweight position in Japan and exposure to south-east Asia and emerging
markets. 'These gains have resulted almost entirely from underlying strength
in equity markets, rather than from currency changes'.
Available revenue amounted to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.87m) pushing earnings
per share down from 2.16p to 1.91p. The interim dividend is maintained at
1.5p.
The Fleming Enterprise Investment Trust, which concentrates on achieving
capital growth from medium-sized UK companies, reported a net asset value of
231.7p at end-December, up from 199.9p six months earlier and 170.7p at the
end of 1992.
Net revenue for the half-year amounted to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 734,000),
equivalent to earnings of 3.05p (1.83p) per share. The interim dividend is
raised to 1.4p (1.3p).

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Trifast for market with Pounds 32m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trifast, the Sussex-based manufacturer and distributor of industrial
fastenings, will be capitalised at Pounds 31.7m when it comes to the market
later this month.
James Capel, brokers for the flotation, said yesterday that the placing of
7.87m ordinary shares would be priced at 200p per share.
Dealings begin on February 16.
The placing, which has been received enthusiastically by institutions, will
reduce the stake of the two founders, Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts,
from a total of 90 per cent to 40 per cent of the enlarged capital, split
equally between them.
Existing shareholders will have 8 to 8.5 per cent of the company, leaving
new shareholders with 51.5 to 52 per cent.
Trifast has said it expected pre-tax profits on ordinary activities would
not be less than Pounds 2.55m in the year ending March 31, compared to
Pounds 1.98m in 1992-93.
On the basis of forecast earnings per share of 12.1p for the current year,
the placing price represents a p/e ratio of 16.5.
The placing will raise Pounds 15.7m, of which Pounds 12.2m will go to Mr
Timms and Mr Roberts. The rest will be used by the company to reduce debt
and purchase new freehold premises next to its head office in Uckfield.
Mr Malcolm Diamond, Trifast's managing director, cited a number of reasons
for the company's optimism on future prospects:
Investment in new business teams in the UK and Singapore are expected to
provide an increasing return from 1994.
Overseas and export activities are increasing following the establishment of
a coherent strategy combined with making resources available.
Considerable scope exists for increased market penetration for both fastener
management agreements and for niche products.
The fragmented UK fastener market gives opportunities to develop greater
market influence through organic growth and acquisitions.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Grosvenor Inns seeks Pounds 5.2m for
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grosvenor Inns, the public house operator, is raising a net Pounds 5.2m
through a rights issue and is buying six pubs.
The USM-traded group also announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 319,000
to Pounds 358,000 in the six months to November 27.
Four pubs in Essex and Hertfordshire are being purchased from CH Webster for
Pounds 3.3m cash. In the year to September 30 they made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 71,000 (loss of Pounds 24,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds
1.2m).
Two Hedgehog pubs in Hove and Southampton are being bought from Mr David
Bruce, a director of Grosvenor, for Pounds 400,000 in shares. In the 15
months to June 30 they incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21,000, against
Pounds 11,000 for the previous 12 months, on turnover of Pounds 898,000
(Pounds 749,000).
Grosvenor is issuing 4.87m shares at 120p on a 3-for-5 basis. Part of the
cash will be used to finance the purchase with the balance going towards
further acquisitions.
The shares gained 7p to 170p yesterday.
Following the purchases, Grosvenor will operate 37 pubs, of which nine are
freehold and 16 free of tie.
The result was achieved on turnover of Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 3.52m). During
the period it bought six pubs. The pre-tax figure was achieved after
exceptional costs of Pounds 45,000 relating to compensation for loss of
office of a former director.
Earnings per share were 2.9p (2.8p). The interim dividend is raised to 2.25p
(2p) and a final payment of 2.5p (2.25p) is forecast.
During the period Mr Bruce, founder of Bruce's Brewery and the Firkin pub
chain, joined the board to develop a new subsidiary called Belcher's Pubs.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merger for Essex and Suffolk Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two water companies controlled by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez of France are to
be merged, in a culmination of the rationalisation process set in train by
the industry regulator three years ago.
Essex Water and Suffolk Water, which distribute clean water to those
regions, yesterday said the merger would 'improve the existing standards of
service to customers' and provide greater efficiency.
The enlarged company will have turnover of about Pounds 45m. Profits after
tax in 1993 were approximately Pounds 18.6m at Essex and Pounds 4.3m at
Suffolk.
It is proposed that Essex offer 55 new shares for every 100 Suffolk with a
cash alternative of Pounds 10.
Suffolk's 11.5 per cent redeemable debenture stock holders will be offered
Pounds 101 of new debenture stock for every Pounds 100 held.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dedicated to taming a less than 'soft'
option - A look at Sema's role in packaged software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Bonelli, managing director of Sema Group, listed four reasons why
the Anglo-French computing services company is in the packaged software
business and added with a laugh: 'I know this speech very well because I
have given it to the board so many times. Come back next year and I will
have ten reasons.'
Mr Bonelli describes Sema's performance in packaged software as only
'moderately successful' despite millions of pounds spent in research and
development. By comparison, the group, Europe's third largest
indigenously-owned computer services company, has demonstrated both strength
and depth in systems integration and facilities management over the past few
years.
Next month it is expected to publish results for 1993 showing growth in both
revenues and profits. In 1992 pre-tax profits increased by 39 per cent to
Pounds 19.4m, on revenues of Pounds 416.7m.
Analysts predict strong growth in 1994. Sema seems, therefore, to be
successfully navigating the choppy waters of the recession and the slowdown
in the computer industry, while many of its competitors are bailing
furiously.
Mr Bonelli attributes the company's sustained profitability to strategic
decisions made in 1989, the year following the merger of CAP Group of the UK
and Sema Metra of France. The group decided to concentrate on three sectors
 -systems integration, facilities management and software packages.
It was an unusual move: 'In the 1980s, few computer services companies
thought about strategy; times were good and business was plentiful. There
was no reason to pick and choose,' Mr Bonelli says.
The plan was to earn 60 per cent of revenues from systems integration, 25
per cent from facilities management and 15 per cent from packages. Today,
the ratio is 70:20:10, indicating that the company has failed fully to
achieve its ambitions in packages.
Mr Bonelli claims the company is the European leader in systems integration,
which he defines as building complex systems for large customers.
'This is our most profitable activity, our basic livelihood. We are a key
player in combat management systems, where our customers include the Royal
Navy, in control systems for nuclear plant, in stock exchange back office
systems and in banking systems.
'Now we are seeking new niches in which we can achieve some kind of
dominance.'
The wish list includes air traffic control, airline reservation systems,
global distribution and telecommunications.
Sema is jealous of its reputation as prime contractor for large projects of
this kind. It is seething over suggestions that it is responsible for delays
to the Schengen free-travel computer system in Strasbourg. It is prime
contractor for the central system only. Mr Francois Dufaux of Sema said the
problem was that no single contractor had responsibility for managing the
overall project.
Sema has also enjoyed success with the second leg of its strategy -
facilities management. FM involves taking responsibility for part or all of
a customer's computer systems, providing an agreed level of service for a
fee.
A weak spot, however, is France. Sema and International Business Machines
had merged their FM operations in a joint venture called Axone. IBM bought
out the computing services company last year: 'We got a good price, but it
left us with nothing in France,' Mr Bonelli complains.
The UK is a second problem area. Sema has won some good contracts, but it is
having difficulty persuading the government that it is capable of managing
the largest of the market-testing contracts - the Inland Revenue computer
systems contract which went to Electronic Data Systems, for example. 'If we
can handle BP world-wide, we can handle the Inland Revenue,' Mr Bonelli
sniffs.
He thinks the company's credibility with governments should be enhanced by
its Pounds 20m purchase last year of the information technology operations
of the Swedish state-owned SKDforetagen.
Packaged software remains the chief problem. Sema moved into packages
because it was a fast growing market sector. It was also anxious to expand
business with multinational manufacturing companies which are big package
users.
But packages companies and systems integrators are culturally very
different. Sema bought a German packages company, ADV Orga, to bridge the
gap, but with only partial success.
It is continuing to spend several million pounds a year, in co-operation
with IBM, to refine I-Linie, a large scale industrial management package.
Mr Bonelli agrees that the strategy has been expensive. 'There has always
been a temptation to get out, but I believe the effort is worthwhile. As
long as our board and shareholders go along with us and we continue to do
well in systems integration and facilities management we ought to apportion
that amount of our resources to get a strong position in the package
market.'
Abandoning packaged software would have an immediate effect on the level of
earnings per share, but Sema has never favoured short-term solutions.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Another victim of the fall-out in chemicals: Why pressure
has mounted for a reorganisation of Europe's fibres sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reorganisations are beautiful. Or so the giants of Germany's chemicals
industry seem to think.
If Hoechst goes ahead and puts its huge synthetic fibres operation into a
separate legal entity, it would be only the latest in a series of moves that
are splintering the chemical empires of continental Europe.
These empires span fibres, bulk and speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals
and agriculture. Once the backbone of a huge manufacturing sector, the 1990s
have seen profits slide under the weight of over-capacity, recession,
imports and high wage costs - aggravated by social policies and strong
currencies.
Germany has proved especially vulnerable. The German Chemical Employers
Federation, the BAVC, says that chemical industry wage costs rose by 42 per
cent between 1984 and 1992 in western Germany. In the UK they gained 18 per
cent, while in the US they fell by 31 per cent.
As a result of these factors, a tide of reorganisation has washed over many
parts of the European chemicals industry.
In agrichemicals, the Common Agricultural Policy is leading to a cut in the
acreage under cultivation by up to 20 per cent. Last July, Shell sold its
agrichemicals business to American Cyanamid, and Hoechst and German rival
Schering merged their plant protection divisions.
Petrochemicals has seen chronic overcapacity undermine prices and profits.
This January alone saw the closure of BP Chemicals' ethylene production
plant at Baglan Bay in South Wales and the completion of the sale of ICI's
polypropylene division to German company BASF.
Now fibres seem to be in the firing line. Hoechst last May merged its
viscose and acrylics operation into a joint venture with UK company
Courtaulds, under the latter's management.
Bayer, Hoechst's arch rival in Germany, will next week hive off its textiles
division into a new subsidiary. The move means lower wage costs as Bayer
trims perks and other special payments to employees, without formally
leaving the fixed pay scales of the German chemicals industry.
Du Pont, of the US, is in the midst of a programme to cut 20 per cent from
the operating costs of its European fibres businesses. Meanwhile, Akzo of
the Netherlands said that 2,600 fibre jobs are at risk if workers at its
German fibres plants do not accept a 10 per cent wage cut.
Fibres have come under pressure for several reasons:
An explosion in European and Japanese investment in synthetic fibre
manufacture in Asia. Imports now account for some 40 per cent of the
polyester filament consumed in Europe. Asian countries supply the
overwhelming majority of that. Shrinkage of the European textiles industry -
the fibre manufacturers' main customer base. Import penetration exceeds 50
per cent in parts of the clothing and textiles industry. Again the
competition is based in Asia, so European textiles companies are lobbying
for cuts in prices of European made fibres.
High wage costs. Although Hoechst denied that this would be a reason for
hiving off the fibres operation, doing so would enable it to follow Bayer
and reduce wage costs towards the levels paid to workers in the textiles
industry, traditionally well below those in chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
Hoechst says that it has not yet made the decision to hive off the fibres
operation in Europe. But the pressure is rising.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Revival of US demand helps Ford lift earnings to Dollars
719m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Motor yesterday under-scored the revival of US vehicle demand and its
own market share gains by reporting fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 719m
(Pounds 479m) compared with a loss of Dollars 840m in the same period of
1992.
Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, the UK luxury car
subsidiary, posted a slightly reduced net loss of Dollars 960m in 1993 - its
third successive heavy annual loss. However, excluding Jaguar, the European
operations 'could be profitable' in 1994, the carmaker forecast.
Ford made Dollars 669m from its vehicle operations in the US, a Dollars 797m
improvement on 1992, but that was partially offset by a Dollars 372m loss in
its international operations.
Its financial services group earned a record Dollars 422m, up from Dollars
197m a year ago.
The results were towards the top end of analysts' forecasts, but the shares
fell Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 68 1/2 .
Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler
 -are all benefiting from a steady growth in North American demand and less
intense competition from Japanese rivals, whose cars now cost significantly
more in the American market than US ones.
Mr Alex Trottman, Ford's chairman, said the company was 'in good shape for
1994. We have strong new products and we expect better economic conditions'.
But there remained a lot to do to increase efficiency.
Ford's fourth-quarter earnings at Dollars 1.30 a share compared with a
Dollars 1.85 loss a year ago when the European operations took Dollars 419m
of restructuring charges. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 25.4bn to
Dollars 27.84bn.
The company had a one-time Dollars 73m gain in North America from the sale
of its vehicle seating business, while overseas results were hit by a
Dollars 109m restructuring charge at Jaguar and another of Dollars 57m in
Australia. These were partially offset by a Dollars 59m reduction in German
tax rates.
For the full year, Ford reported earnings of Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 4.55
a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 7.4bn, or Dollars 15.61 a share in
1992 which was due mainly to changes in accounting methods.
Its automotive operations made Dollars 940m in 1993, compared with a Dollars
1.53bn loss the previous year, while financial services earned Dollars
1.59bn, up from Dollars 1.03bn.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Life group allows for pensions hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group, yesterday said it was setting
aside money for possible compensation payments to people who bought their
personal pensions when transferring out of occupational schemes.
Announcing the 1993 results, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said it had made
'sensible and prudent' provisions. The life and pensions industry is
awaiting a report from the Securities and Investments Board, the City
watchdog, on how to compensate pension transfer customers who have suffered
as a result of poor advice.
Provisions rose, but the group would not give a figure for the amount set
aside for pension transfers, saying merely that the net effect on the profit
and loss account of reviewing its provisions was 'insignificant'.
Black Horse Financial Services, a 'bancassurance' company which sells
products only to customers of Lloyds Bank, had 22,600 pension transfers,
while Abbey Life, the group's other UK life assurance division which sells
mostly through a direct sales force, had 30,300 pension transfers. Together,
this gives the group Pounds 433m, or about 10 per cent of the estimated
500,000 pension transfers sold since 1988.
The group's pre-tax profits rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 323.6m. The
greatest growth came from the non-insurance businesses. A final dividend of
11.7p gives a total of 18p, up from 17.3p - the first increase for four
years. Earnings per share rose from 28p to 31.1p.
Within pre-tax profits, Abbey Life fell to Pounds 135.3m (from Pounds
146.4m), while Black Horse Financial Services rose to Pounds 115.6m (from
110.5m). Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, highlighted the impact of
regulation and low interest rates.
Meeting requirements on training and competence had contributed to a further
fall in the Abbey Life sales force to 2,500 as well as reducing selling
time.
Low interest rates meant that greater amounts had to be reserved out of
profits to meet future commitments to policyholders, he said.
Both regular and single premium sales rose in Black Horse Financial
Services, while Abbey Life suffered a small dip in regular premium business.
For the second year running, Trans Leben, the group's German life
subsidiary, had a bad result, recording a loss of Pounds 15.9m, after a loss
of Pounds 14.1m in 1992. Sir Simon said the group's aim was to 'keep it
small, steady and not a management headache'.
Pre-tax profits at Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company, rose to Pounds
38.2m from Pounds 16.2m, helped by a sharp fall in charges for bad debts to
Pounds 35.3m.
Black Horse Agencies, the estate agency, increased its sales last year and
again saw its losses fall, from Pounds 10.6m in 1992 to Pounds 700,000 in
1993.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Owners Abroad profits cut to Pounds 5.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners Abroad, the holiday group, yesterday announced 1993 pre-tax profits
of Pounds 5.8m, after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs - including its
successful defence against a hostile bid from its rival Airtours.
This profit compares with Pounds 25.5m the previous year. Mr Francis Baron,
appointed chief executive last November, said the company was pressing ahead
with plans to reduce head office numbers and change branding strategy. Mr
Baron said the restructuring plan, announced last December, would result in
a one third reduction in head office staff by May, but the benefits of the
branding changes would not show through until 1995.
The City welcomed Mr Baron's plans for the group, with the shares rising 20p
to close at 120p.
The board is cutting the final dividend to 2.1p from 2.52p the previous
year, resulting in an unchanged total payment of 3.5p.
During its battle last year against Airtours, Owners Abroad said it would
increase the full-year dividend by 43 per cent to 5p. Mr Baron said,
however, that the group had recommended the dividend 'in the absence of
unforeseen circumstances' which had subsequently occurred.
After the Airtours bid had been rebuffed, the group warned that 1993 profits
would be half market expectations. Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger
Allard, managing director, subsequently resigned. Mr Baron said it would now
be inappropriate to pay an increased dividend.
He said Owners Abroad had sufficient confidence in the future to pay a
maintained dividend, despite a fall in earnings per share before exceptional
items from 11.6p to 5.7p. After exceptional items, the loss per share was
0.6p, compared with a profit of 9.2p the previous year.
Mr Baron also said the group planned to increase its 25 per cent holding in
International Travel Holdings of Canada to 100 per cent for a consideration
which is not expected to be material. ITH made a post-tax loss of Pounds
1.4m last year on turnover of Pounds 229.8m but is now profitable.
ITH is the largest travel group in Canada, with a market share of 25 per
cent. It specialises in holidays to the southern United States, the
Caribbean and Central America. Because of ITH's strong winter market, Mr
Baron said it would provide Owners Abroad with profits during its quieter
season in the UK.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Hoechst considers spinning off fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, may hive off its European fibres
operations in an effort to cut costs.
Hoechst is Europe's biggest polyester manufacturer and its fibres division
had sales of DM5.1bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in the first nine months of 1993.
Although profitable globally, the division is heavily loss-making in Europe.
Any move to separate fibres from the rest of the company should be seen
against the background of the 'extremely unsatisfactory' earnings position,
the company said yesterday. Hoechst has already rationalised its fibres
activities: last month it said it would cut 2,000 jobs, mostly in Germany.
'Almost all our competitors pursue their business in this sector via legally
independent subsidiaries,' Hoechst said. News that Hoechst is considering
the separation of its fibres business follows Bayer's lead. A new subsidiary
company, Bayer Faser, will come into being on February 15.
Hoechst denied that it intended to cut wages, but said a hiving off would
cut costs.
Mr Rolf Brand, chairman of the workers' council at Hoechst, said yesterday:
'We are currently working on a major reduction of personnel in this area and
we will investigate whether it is sensible to establish fibres as a separate
company.'
Last year, Hoechst merged production of acrylic and viscose fibres into a
new joint venture, Faserwerk Kelheim. Courtaulds is taking a 74.9 per cent
stake in this, subject to regulatory approval.

FT  10 FEB 94 / O'Reilly buys into S African publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, has announced it is to take a 31 per cent controlling stake in
Argus newspapers, the largest newspaper group in South Africa, in its second
overseas acquisition within a week.
The deal will be financed through a share-swap, and the price - estimated at
about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19m) - will be calculated on the average share
price of the first 28 days of trading of Argus Newspapers when the group is
floated in April this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Independent is purchasing its stake from the Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment Company and the Anglo-American Corporation. The deal will give
the two companies around 4m new shares in the Independent group, equivalent
to a 5 per cent stake. Independent will have effective control of Argus with
its 31 per cent stake.
Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive officer of Heinz, added that the
smoothness of the transaction confirmed the commercial sense of doing
business in South Africa. A team from Heinz was evaluating partnerships with
local companies.
Last week Independent Newspapers acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in
Newspaper Publishing in the UK which publishes The Independent and
Independent on Sunday.
It also owns 20 per cent of APN, the Australian regional newspaper group. In
1992 it failed to acquire the Fairfax publishing group in Australia, and
later failed to buy Mirror Group Newspapers in the UK.
Argus Newspapers turned in pre-tax profit of R53m (Pounds 10m) on sales of
R685m in 1993. The group's interests include the Star and the Sowetan, the
country's most popular daily newspapers, as well as publications in Cape
Town and Durban.
Mr O'Reilly's ties with South Africa go back to his first visit in 1955 as a
member of the British Lions rugby team. He shunned investment in South
Africa during the apartheid era, but cultivated close links with Mr Robert
Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, and then Mr Nelson Mandela. His commercial
activities in southern Africa have been restricted so far to Olivine
Industries, a joint venture with the Zimbabwe government.

FT  10 FEB 94 / London launches new Ulster talks: Mayhew seeks to keep
initiative ahead of Sinn Fein conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government last night launched a fresh round of meetings with
Ulster politicians as it sought to maintain the initiative in efforts to
bring peace to the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was expected to use a
meeting with Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, to set
out ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional
parties, as he promised earlier this month.
It was also thought he might ask the UUP to postpone publication of its own
proposals - understood to involve little more than the establishment of
devolved government in Northern Ireland - until after the party conference
later this month of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
London and Dublin are anxious to deprive Republican leaders of any excuse
before this conference for rejecting December's Downing Street Declaration
by the British and Irish governments.
President Bill Clinton yesterday reiterated his support for the joint
declaration and the efforts 'in that context' of the British and Irish prime
ministers, during a 30-minute telephone conversation with Mr John Major.
The conversation coincided with news that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, is to be invited to make a second visit to the US to head a St
Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco. A recent 48-hour trip by Mr
Adams to New York caused friction in UK-US relations.
While Sir Patrick and Mr Molyneaux were meeting last night it emerged that a
planned Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster is caught in party
squabbling about its composition.
Labour - currently waging a procedural war against the government - is
pressing for four of its MPs to join a 13-member committee and for one of
them to serve as chairman. The government wants the number of Labour MPs
restricted to two.
The bilateral talks with the province's constitutional parties continue
later this week with a meeting between Sir Patrick and Dr John Alderdice,
leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party.
No date has been set for a meeting with the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party. The hardline Democratic Unionists are
boycotting the talks process.
Both leading unionist parties were irritated by Sir Patrick's decision to
provide Dublin with details of the ideas he would like to be pursued before
they were informed of them.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Impasse on trade issues may threaten US and Japan summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's foreign minister Mr Tsutomu Hata flew to Washington yesterday in a
last-minute attempt to resolve stalled trade talks, but US business urged
the Clinton administration to maintain a tough stance.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said before Mr Hata's arrival that
bilateral talks among trade officials had produced no breakthrough on
improved access to the Japanese market for US automotive groups and other
issues 'which have the most profound economic consequences'.
But he added, without elaborating, that agreement had been reached on
medical equipment, where US makers had complained about complex Japanese
regulations and non-transparent bidding procedures.
However, the absence of a wider accord threatens to bedevil a summit between
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, and President Bill
Clinton at the White House tomorrow. Mr Hosokawa said in Tokyo yesterday:
'Everything has come to an impasse.'
To buoy the administration's stand, the Economic Strategy Institute, a
Washington think tank with close ties to the US car industry, released a
letter to Mr Clinton signed by 81 business leaders, economists and
academics, supporting 'a pragmatic results-oriented strategy' which includes
numerically measured increases in Japan's imports.
Signatories included companies that have long sought better market access in
Japan - including Intel, Cray Research and National Semiconductor in the
high technology sector, as well as other companies that have sought
protection from Japanese imports, such as Chrysler.
Memories of past highly-touted but ultimately ineffectual bilateral trade
pacts with Japan will overlay the proceedings. The US has now endured 28
straight years of merchandise trade deficits with Japan. In Congress, the
administration has support for a tough stand from both parties.
However, a group of moderate House Republicans has issued a paper attacking
results-oriented trade as 'trade by the numbers'. They want Tokyo to 'lay
out a clear schedule for sweeping deregulation and economic structural
harmonisation'.
Mr Hosokawa will be able to brief Mr Clinton on a Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn)
economic stimulus package, and a draft budget for 1994 is due to be unveiled
today.

FT  10 FEB 94 / UK may increase Eurofighter order to win bigger work quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is considering increasing its order for Eurofighter
2000 combat aircraft from the current figure of 250 to help win the UK a
greater share of the production stage of the Pounds 32bn project, a select
committee heard yesterday.
MoD officials also outlined proposals to replace the 'whole range' of
frontline Royal Air Force aircraft - including the Harrier jump jet and the
Tornado bomber - with the multipurpose fighter.
Giving evidence to the parliamentary defence select committee, MoD officials
also revealed that the cost to the UK of developing the Eurofighter, a joint
project between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, had risen by another
Pounds 450m to Pounds 3.4bn - double the Pounds 1.7bn cost estimate for full
development given in 1988.
Mr Jack Gordon, the MoD's director general of aircraft, said that the
Eurofighter - which is running two years behind schedule - was expected to
make its maiden flight in April.
Tests and simulated combat modelling had shown that the fighter could
outperform all Western or Soviet aircraft except the American F-22
manufactured by Lockheed. 'It is capable of replacing the whole suite of
frontline RAF aircraft,' he said.
An expansion of the UK order above 250 is likely to lead to intense
negotiations between countries about the sharing of the production stage of
the project.
The 'workshare' quotas of the production stage of the fighter, which starts
next year, will be allocated according to the number of aircraft each
country orders. As 600 aircraft are planned for production, a UK order in
excess of 250 will give the UK strong grounds for arguing that it should
receive more than 40 per cent of the work.
'Clearly the more airplanes there are, the more good news for all the
partners. The more planes for the RAF, the more work for British industry,'
said British Aerospace, which owns 33 per cent of the Eurofighter
consortium.
Germany, whose Daimler-Benz also owns 33 per cent, has said it will order
140 - but is likely to contest any division which hands the majority of the
project work to the UK. In 1992 Germany insisted on cost reductions and
specification changes as a condition for continuing with the project.

FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Ford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a proxy for economic statistics, Ford's figures would serve tolerably
well. Strength in the growing US domestic market is offset by weakness in
depressed Europe. Market share gains in the US result in part from pressure
on Japanese imports as the yen has risen. The strong performance of the
finance subsidiary shows how alternative forms of financing - particularly
leasing - are displacing traditional methods. With many of its models
selling well, the company would seem merely to have to wait for recovery in
Europe to fire on all cylinders.
There are, however, problems. The company restructured for leaner production
in the 1980s, but new model development is still more expensive than that of
its rivals. Its product mix is also biased towards low margin general cars
and away from higher margin trucks and specialist sectors such as four-wheel
drive sport vehicles. In the face of the Japanese challenge, the
rejuvenation of Detroit has begun. But Mr Alex Trotman, Ford's new chairman,
still has much to do.

FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Nuclear electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would-be nuclear entrepreneurs must be chewing their fingernails as they
wait for the government's much-delayed review of the industry. At one
extreme, the review could result in nuclear power being allowed to wither
away. Still, Nuclear Electric seems happy enough and is arguing strongly for
privatisation. After the debacle of 1989, its renewed ambition to be
privatised seems more than a little fanciful.
Solid progress has, however, been made since the plug was pulled on nuclear
privatisation. Productivity has improved, due in large part to the more
reliable operation of the stations. Generating costs are now much closer to
those of gas or cleaned-up coal plant. At least as importantly, progress has
been made in identifying the scale of the decommissioning costs which so
scared the City last time. There are still substantial uncertainties which
need to be cleared up. A second bungled attempt to get into the private
sector might well be fatal. Issues such as the allocation of liabilities,
fixed price fuel and reprocessing contracts, the option to store spent fuel
and caps on disaster risk would need to be sorted out.
If these could be satisfactorily resolved, it is at least conceivable that
part of the existing industry could be sold. It is less certain that such a
privatised industry could carry the risks of building a Pounds 3bn new
station over 10 years. For that, shareholders would require equity returns
which Nuclear Electric would be hard-pressed to offer. Bankers might also
demand some guarantee about the end market for the electricity. But that is
not likely to be, given any government being sufficiently market-oriented to
privatise the industry in the first place.

FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If it does decide to spin its fibres business off into a separate
subsidiary, Hoechst will be following a road already taken by a number of
its competitors, most recently Bayer. The idea is far less radical than the
split in ICI which gave birth to Zeneca, or the creation of Courtaulds
Textiles as a separate company from Courtaulds. It is an indication of the
depth of concern about German manufacturing costs just the same. Fast
growing competition from Asia makes that concern particularly acute in the
fibres sector.
By making its fibres division a separate legal entity, Hoechst might be able
to pay its employees at rates prevailing in textiles rather than the
chemical industry. The chances are that its workforce would accept this
rather than face redundancy. The creation of separate entities may also make
it easier to establish joint ventures with other companies which have
established a similar structure. The consequent reorganisation might
mitigate the effect of Asian competition. It is unlikely to be a panacea.
Hoechst has set up joint ventures in other sectors such as that in
agrochemicals with Schering last year. But it has been slower than Bayer or
BASF to cut jobs in the recession. Healthcare reform in Germany and Italy
has blighted the outlook for pharmaceuticals. Earnings are now only around a
fifth of their peak in 1989 and the company has warned that the dividend is
likely to be cut for a second time this year. Perhaps Mr Jurgen Dormann will
shake up Hoechst's cumbersome structure when he takes over as management
board chairman in May. Some more restructuring would help while Hoechst
waits to be rescued by the cycle.

FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey's frugal life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some Abbey Life shareholders thought they got a poor deal when Lloyds Bank
injected five financial services businesses into it in 1988 in return for a
58 per cent stake. They may think again after studying the company's 1993
results. The sharp rebound in Lloyds Abbey's non-insurance businesses
generated enough distributable profits to justify a 4 per cent dividend
increase after four years of flat pay-outs. Lloyds Abbey now promises a
progressive dividend policy. It may even be able to lift its dividend faster
than the market average over the next few years.
Lloyds Bowmaker has achieved a sharp fall in bad debt provisions as the rate
of house repossessions has slowed, enabling profits to climb from Pounds 16m
to Pounds 38m. Even Black Horse estate agencies have substantially reduced
losses. The marginal growth these businesses provide is vital given the
uninspiring outlook for the life business. The dividend yield of more than 5
per cent will provide the company's mainstay considering the group's
earnings prospects are so dull.
Low inflation and the regulatory clamp imposed on life companies have
seriously undermined the sector's appeal - although Lloyds Abbey's powerful
distribution arm gives it greater opportunities than most. The company has
also felt obliged to swallow an unspecified provision against inappropriate
pension transfers. Unfortunately, Lloyds Abbey was not prepared to share its
assumptions with its shareholders. Until the Securities and Investments
Board has concluded its investigations, the market will therefore fear the
worst - even though the financial damage seems likely to prove slight.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Anti-dumping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having congratulated itself on the outcome of the Uruguay Round trade
negotiations, the European Union now seems bent on thwarting by the back
door the liberalisation it is intended to promote. That door has been opened
by the decision of the Council of Ministers this week to make anti-dumping
duties subject to approval by a simple majority of member states, instead of
by a qualified majority vote.
The change threatens to make it even easier for the EU to wield a
protectionist weapon which it has deployed with frequency in the past
decade. All the more so since Brussels plans to double its anti-dumping
staff and speed up the handling of cases.
Recent history does not inspire confidence that the new powers will be
exercised wisely. Brussels' anti-dumping procedures are so obscure,
arbitrary and elastic that they can be used to find that almost any third
country exporter is guilty of 'unfair' price competition and punished
accordingly. The result is huge costs to EU consumers - Pounds 1.3bn
annually for consumer electronics products alone, according to Britain's
National Consumer Council.
The change in voting rules is unlikely to be revoked, since it was an
explicit condition of France's acceptance of the Uruguay Round package. In
the short term, the best hope that it will not be abused is that Sir Leon
Brittan, the liberal-minded trade commissioner, will exercise restraint in
proposing anti-dumping actions. However, he may not remain in his job after
this year. Much stronger institutional safeguards and greater transparency
are needed.
Brussels has gone some way by separating investigations of alleged dumping
and injury, providing more information to consumers and allowing for
speedier judicial review. It needs to go further. Management of the
anti-dumping division needs to be tightened. In addition, all proposed
actions should be analysed by the Commission's economic and competition
directorates. These analyses should be published, along with the division's
own arguments and calculations.
Such measures would not guarantee fairness and impartiality. But they should
enable consumers, both businesses and individuals, to gauge the price they
were being asked to pay - and require governments to justify it publicly.

<TEXT>
No sniggering, please. Yannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment
commissioner, tonight lectures the London School of Economics on
'Environmental crime and punishment'. Big subject, pity about the speaker.
Paleokrassas, a former Greek finance minister and economist, tends to get
the jobs no one else wants. He carried the can for not taking the tough
decisions which might have prevented the Greek economy getting into a mess.
Now he is in charge of a European environment policy which is not only far
too ambitious but is not fully enforced on poorer countries - such as
Greece.
Given that he doesn't share the same politics as the current Greek
government, it's most unlikely that he will be reappointed as Europe's
environment supremo when his term expires at the end of the year. Maybe that
explains the persistent rumour that he's thinking of quitting and standing
as a Euro MP for Greece's New Democracy party.
It all adds to the general impression, among environmentalists at least,
that for the next year or so Europe's environmental criminals are likely to
go largely unpunished.

Prozac the wonder drug - it's said by some users to induce a sense of

Bond has been admitted to a Perth hospital, apparently suffering from
depression; part of his treatment is Prozac. His lawyers successfully
applied for an adjournment of a court hearing to decide whether he is fit to
give evidence at a bankruptcy examination on March 21. The fitness hearing
has been adjourned to March 14, when further psychiatric evidence is likely
to be presented.
A psychiatrist employed by Bond's lawyers said that he 'cries more often
than previously' and 'repeatedly feels that he is unable to go on'. Bond's
appearance is said to be 'consistent with patients with severe depression'.
It adds that 'he appears . . . to have difficulty in recalling even people

FT  10 FEB 94 / Hard core or soft centre: A look at the role of extensive
cross-shareholdings in French industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a spider spinning an intricate web, France's privatisation programme is
forging a series of links between some of the country's most powerful
financial and industrial companies. The group of long-term shareholders in
Elf Aquitaine, the oil company in the final stages of privatisation, is a
case in point. Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurer,
Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the biggest banks, and Renault, the car
group, are among those that will hold a combined 10 per cent of the oil
group's shares and form a core of stable investors, dubbed a noyau dur.
Elf should return the favour in several state sell-offs. It has already
stumped up almost FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) to become part of the noyau dur of
BNP. Renault and UAP are also likely to find the oil group near the top of
their share registers when they step up to the auction block later this
year.
Cross-shareholdings and noyaux durs are already common between French
financial and industrial groups. But the government's plan to privatise 21
of the country's largest companies, with a market value of more than
FFr300bn, creates the potential for a substantial expansion of the system.
In so doing, it raises several important questions, from the motives behind
the expanding web of cross-shareholdings, to its strength and efficiency.
The answers will help determine how French capitalism evolves from its
current position between the German and Japanese models - of substantial
equity and management links between industry, banks and insurance companies
 -and the liberal, market-based model of Anglo-Saxon economies.
There is a broad agreement on the reasons behind the rise of the noyaux durs
and their role in the current round of privatisations. 'The system is
designed to provide a minimum of stability and protection for companies
moving into the private sector,' says Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of
Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised
at the end of last year.
In the absence of powerful institutional investors, the duty falls to banks,
insurance companies and industrial groups. 'We have no heavy investors, such
as pension funds,' says Mr Elie Cohen, head of research at CNRS, the
economic and social research centre in Paris. 'So we had to invent
something, and we invented cross-shareholdings. It is the problem of
developing capitalism without capital.' The weakness of pension funds is a
result of France's concentration on pay-as-you-earn contributions that
provide benefits for retired employees.
There is less agreement, however, on the merits of the noyau dur system.
'This kind of set-up grates with some international investors,' says one US
fund manager. 'By reducing the discipline of the market, and maybe the
threat of takeover, it raises the risk of inefficiencies creeping into a
company.' Such concerns, however, have not prevented US investors
participating strongly in the three privatisations undertaken so far.
Mr Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economic and industrial research
centre, criticises the blurred responsibility of company directors. 'Is
their responsibility to their partners in their cross-shareholdings or to
all shareholders?' he asks. For Mr Cohen, there is the additional problem of
the efficiency of the allocation of financial resources. 'It is clearly not
the best system for an industrial company like Rhone Poulenc or St Gobain to
spend scarce capital on buying a stake in a bank,' he says. 'They should be
investing in their core businesses.'
Not surprisingly, the government's political opponents go further. Mr
Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister, last week attacked what
he described as 'armchair capitalism' in which appointees of the
centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, such as Mr Jacques
Friedmann, chairman of UAP, were forming a club of financial and industrial
companies.
'The heads of the companies being privatised are each on the boards of the
other, they exchange capital and are all close to the prime minister,' said
Mr Fabius. 'This poses a problem to the development of French industry.'
Industrialists accept that there are drawbacks to the system, including the
diversion of capital from their core activities. But they argue that the
powers of the noyaux durs are relatively limited, and reject the notion that
cross-shareholdings create inefficiencies by providing protection. 'What
would be the reaction of my so-called friends if they were offered four
times the market price for Rhone Poulenc shares?' asks Mr Fourtou,
rhetorically. 'A group of core shareholders is no guarantee of security,'
says Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, one of France's largest
banks.
For Mr Vienot and many others within the world of French finance and
industry, the power and the permanence of the noyau dur and the pattern of
cross-shareholdings is overstated. 'Our core shareholders do not play a
significant role in the strategy of the group. They regard it as more of a
financial investment and I would expect some of them to leave or reduce
their shareholdings over the next few years,' says one chief executive.
In the case of privatisation issues, core investors are usually subject to a
commitment to hold the majority of their shares for a set period, often
about 18 months. Within that period they can sell shares to other core
investors who also retain a pre-emption right on noyau dur share sales for
the next few years. 'It is not a very serious or permanent constraint in the
grand order of things,' says one French merchant banker, who adds that the
large number of core investors, and the relatively small level of their
stakes, limits their influence.
There are advocates of a shift towards a German-style system of more
powerful ties between banks and industrial companies cemented by substantial
shareholdings. Mr Michel Albert, for example, former chairman of the AGF
insurance group and now a member of the Bank of France monetary policy
committee, argues such a system allows companies to develop long-term
strategies, secure from the short-term pressures of the market.
There are also practical examples. Credit Lyonnais took stakes of between 10
per cent and 20 per cent in a number of groups including Pinault-Printemps,
the retail company, and Usinor-Sacilor, the steel group. 'Credit Lyonnais
under Jean Yves Haberer (its chairman until last December) was trying to be
a sort of French Deutsche Bank,' says Mr Cohen.
Few other banks have sought to copy its strategy. Instead, many
industrialists see an evolution, albeit gradual, towards a more Anglo-Saxon
model. 'It is true that the lack of big institutional investors has pushed
the system towards one of cross-participations between the main industrial
and financial actors as in Japan or Germany,' says Mr Fourtou of Rhone
Poulenc. 'But I don't see it as a permanent arrangement because French
industrial solidarity is not so strong.'
'My desire is that the system of noyau dur is a system of transition and
that we move towards the Anglo-Saxon model,' says Mr Vienot of Societe
Generale. The German system has its weaknesses, he says, pointing to last
month's near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the metals group, despite the
presence of several of Germany's biggest banks and financial companies on
its board.
Whether Mr Vienot's desire is satisfied will depend in particular on the
development of French pension funds and the expansion of long-term savings.
Both processes are under way. Faced with a state pension system with a
deficit of almost FFr20bn and approaching breaking point, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, is preparing a draft bill on pension
reform to be presented to parliament this spring. Tax incentives for money
market savings funds have already been reduced in favour of longer-term
deposits.
Creating pension funds will, however, take time. 'It will happen, but not
overnight,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of J. P. Morgan, the
US bank, in Paris. Most industry observers estimate it could take 15 to 20
years to build pension funds capable of playing a substantial role in
industrial investment and able to alleviate the need for
cross-shareholdings.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Personal View: Why Russia is not a special case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAROLD JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most curious assumptions about developments in Russia is that we
from the outside can somehow steer them in the right direction by an
appropriate choice of actions. It expresses itself in the belief that the
west has more power and influence than do Russians in moulding the Russian
destiny. The search for those outside Russia who might be accountable for
the debacle has been intense, particularly in the wake of the setbacks to
reform caused by the resignations of Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov.
Some observers blame the undoubtedly careless comment by the US ambassador
at large to the former Soviet Union, Mr Strobe Talbott, last year that there
has been too much shock and too little therapy. This was obviously untrue. A
striking feature about the past two years of Russian policy is how little
shock there has been.
The response of one of the foreign advisers responsible for advising the
Russian Federation to follow the shock course was even more curious. Harvard
economics professor Jeffrey Sachs has repeatedly denounced the international
community - the G7, the World Bank, and, in particular, the International
Monetary Fund - for failing to cushion the shock of the transition to the
market with sufficient support measures. He says international institutions
should have taken a bold gamble and supported with very large transfers of
resources those few people (Mr Sachs's friends) who promised that they could
see how Russia might be changed. According to him, almost every successful
stabilisation effort in the past has relied on generous foreign support.
Mr Sachs's favourite example of a successful foreign-supported stabilisation
is the aftermath of the German hyper-inflation of the early 1920s. It was at
the time often called the 'miracle of the Mark'. A reforming new central
bank president, Mr Hjalmar Schacht, broke with the old conservatives, and
introduced a new and stable currency. A few months after his currency
stabilisation, Germany was supported through a major international loan, the
Dawes Loan ( of 1924); and foreign central banks gave considerable help with
short-term measures to ensure the stability of the new Mark on the foreign
exchanges.
Meanwhile, the government followed an austerity course that was bitterly
unpopular. The only way that it could be sold politically to a sceptical and
disenchanted German electorate was as the inevitable price to be paid for
foreign assistance, and for the prospect of the inflow of foreign credits.
As long as these credits flowed, Germany managed a precarious stability.
Once something went wrong, though, ever larger numbers of people believed
the foreign contribution to the stabilisation to be the source of their
misfortunes. They began to vote in large numbers for the National Socialist
party, and the democratic order collapsed.
Too much effort had been expended on devising complicated schemes to help
Germany and imposing them from the outside, and not enough with building
domestic consensus about reform. One of the perpetual dilemmas of an
operation mounted as an obvious aid mission is that it leads to suspicions
of political manipulation. The realistic way to avoid such suspicions is to
de-politicise assistance as far as possible.
One of the most important conceptual contributions of the Bretton Woods
conference (which created the World Bank and IMF) was the idea of equal and
uniform treatment of all members of a new financial order. It was intended
to avoid the excessive politicisation of 1920s international rescue
operations - all of which failed in the long run. There would be no
'favourites' or 'darlings', but a community of states supporting each other
in times of difficulty through a regulated institutional mechanism.
Such an approach created a series of incentives for compliance, and for
opening to the world economy and for the creation of prosperity, growth and
stability, that were not merely political bribes or hand-outs. It also
emphasised the need for adequate domestic support, and for avoiding the
impression of a course imposed from the outside.
If we put our trust too blindly in a few specific individuals, rather than
in an institutionally anchored and broadly supported reform exercise, we are
almost bound to be disappointed. Perhaps we should remember that Mr Sachs's
favourite architect of the German economic stabilisation of the 1920s, Mr
Schacht, soon became Hitler's minister of economics and the 'wizard' of
National Socialist rearmament.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mr Hosokawa must say no
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The summit in Washington on Friday between Japan's prime minister, Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, and US president Bill Clinton is unlikely to be a
success. But this need not be a bad thing. As US negotiators were fond of
saying in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, better no agreement than
a bad agreement. If the US were to obtain all it wants, this summit would be
a disaster.
The background to the meeting is long-standing US resentment over the
Japanese trade and current account surpluses and the low penetration of the
Japanese market by imports. To these complaints have been added more
immediate worries about the Japanese economy, stagnant since the fourth
quarter of 1991.
In pressing US concerns on the Japanese authorities, the Clinton
administration has made two innovations: first, it has made the relationship
with Japan among the highest priorities for its foreign policy and, second,
it has demanded Japanese agreement to qualitative and quantitative criteria
for assessing success. So far the Clinton administration's attempt has
failed. Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US commerce undersecretary, has even claimed
that the two sides 'do not seem to have even a common understanding of the
problem, let alone a consensus on the solutions'.
This is not that surprising, since US trade demands represent almost perfect
examples of the mercantilist fallacy. Where the US makes more sense is on
macroeconomic policy. The difficulty here is that, however desirable a
strong recovery in the Japanese economy would be, such things cannot be
secured to order. The Japanese government's announcement this week of
agreement on a Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) stimulatory package of tax cuts,
increased spending and loans should help. But the US is entitled to be
cynical about the effectiveness of such packages, since this is already the
fourth one since August 1992. It is questionable, for example, whether
Japanese consumers will start spending in response to a tax reduction in
effect for just one year
If Mr Clinton needs to recognise the limits on what he can hope to obtain
over macroeconomic stimulation, how much more is this true of trade policy?
In the former area at least, he is trying to push the Japanese in the right
direction. In the latter he is doing the opposite.
Why would the quantitative indicators sought by the US be such a dire error?
One reason is that an indicator is bound to become a binding target, as has
been demonstrated only this week by the hostile reaction of US
industrialists to a decline in the foreign share of the Japanese
semiconductor market to 18.1 per cent, less than two percentage points below
the agreed level. How could the reaction be otherwise, when it is suspicion
of Japan that justifies these indicators in the first place? Given the
suspicions, failure to achieve any indicator will be taken as proof not of
the difficulties, but of bad faith.
The very act of acceptance by the Japanese government implies agreement that
it does control industry. But it also represents a commitment to increase
that control. Every failure to achieve a target would then be condemned as
malfeasance and every success as proof that the government does have the
means to deliver on such targets. Either way, the result would be both more
quantitative targets and more rigid administration of existing ones. Since
the European Union and other partners would join in, pretty soon Japan would
be as cartelised as its critics already say it is. What is more, these
demands will inevitably spread to other bilateral trade relationships.
Mr Hosokawa must say no, because the alternative would be dreadful. Saying
no could well have horrible consequences too, particularly if Mr Clinton
cannot be persuaded to take on the Japan-bashers in Congress. The outcome
could even include a spate of Congressionally-mandated actions against
Japan. Japan's only possible response would be to make this debate
multilateral, which is what it should have been all along. However difficult
it may be for Mr Hosokawa, what the world now needs from Japan is
imagination and determination.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Banks on notice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's high street banks claim that they compete with each other fiercely
to provide a high standard of service on their personal accounts. Yet the
customers of banks which deduct money from accounts without warning, which
pass on customers' details to insurance subsidiaries without written
permission, or which cannot transfer cash across borders quickly and cheaply
may question whether competition exists at all.
They are not alone. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading,
has warned banks and building societies that he intends to press for higher
standards of consumer protection. He says he is very disappointed by the
minimum standards that banks have agreed in their revised code of practice.
This voluntary code was agreed by banks and societies after an earlier study
concluded that the government should bring in a statutory code if banks
failed to raise standards. The code has now been reviewed in the light of
widespread complaints about banks in the first two years of its existence.
Banks are going to have to do a lot better by the time the code is revised
again three years hence if they are to banish calls for legislation. Far
from treating the code as a set of minimum standards, some have quibbled
with the clear intent of parts of the code in an effort to dilute their
effect.
Despite their rhetoric about competition, banks know that personal customers
tend to stick with their accounts even if they grumble. It is troublesome to
switch accounts, and few customers believe that other banks will provide
significantly better service even if they do so.
The code should not be a substitute for competition among banks, nor take on
the overtone of legislation. This would be the effect of Sir Bryan's call
for the code to be rewritten to include the requirement of the Financial
Services Act that those selling life insurance give 'best advice'.
Yet banks would be wise to recognise how unpopular they are. Some have
raised standards in the past two years, but they are starting from a low
base compared with sectors such as retailing and, if anything, are being
outstripped by a rise in consumer expectations. Improvements in technology
and strengthened capital present banks with an excellent chance to achieve a
step change in standards. They must now deliver.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: 33 and still laughing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs J WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just finished reading Christopher Dunkley's article 'Funny icons
of youth' (February 9), and to be honest, I don't get it.
I cannot understand why, if the comedians such as Sayle, Saunders, Elton etc
disappoint him so much, he doesn't just utilise his other options - namely,
turn over to another channel, switch the television off altogether, listen
to the radio, read or even, God forbid, hold intelligent conversation with
his partner.
I also do not understand how someone who obviously was a teenager in the
1960s can be commenting on what the youth of today consider rebellious, and
their 'own personal thing man'.
I happen to be a 33-year-old financial director's secretary, married, no
kids, and come from a family of four girls, the youngest of which is 16. I
do not consider myself over the hill, in fact I think I must be a very young
33-year-old, as my 16-year-old sister actually likes having me around and
going out with me and my 40-year-old husband. But maybe it could be because
we do not condemn her and her friends for what they like or consider to the
'their rebellious domain'. I was a rebel at 17, just as my parents were and
probably their parents etc, etc. It is immaterial whether it is comedy or
the Rolling Stones that is the 'in thing'. The time to start worrying about
the youth of today is when they start to hold fascists, dictators, cult
religions, etc, in the same high echelons as the Rolling Stones were to Mr
Dunkley.
I do agree that the present Alexei Sayle series, Absolutely Fabulous 2, Ben
Elton - Man From Auntie, are not as good as previous series, but they still
make me smile and laugh, and really that's what it's all about, isn't it?

FT  10 FEB 94 / Economic Viewpoint: A rather curious base rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a good question for a teenager aspiring to become an economic
scribbler. After the monthly meeting between the UK chancellor, Kenneth
Clarke, and the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on January 12
they decided against an interest rate cut. At their next meeting on February
2, they decided to make one after all.
What could have happened in three short weeks to make them change their
minds? (An answer in terms of personalities will be disallowed, at least
until the coffee break after the formal interview.)
The uneasy feature of the latest interest rate cut is the preponderance of
short-term influences. The current move has been triggered by a few months
of better-than-expected inflation figures, which in turn have been projected
into the period ahead. 'Interest rates should be as low as possible and as
high as necessary' is not a quotation from Kenneth Clarke, but is a good
guide to what he is likely to do. Is it an adequate principle?
The more tangible influences on the base rate decision are conveniently
listed in the Bank's new February inflation report. The Bank quite rightly
publishes a variety of inflation indicators. The message from all of them is
that inflation is now in the neighbourhood of 2 to 2 1/2 per cent per annum
 -only slightly above the headline RPI rate. It expects its new index of the
core rate - which excludes indirect and local authority taxes as well as
mortgage interest - to level out in this range for the rest of 1994 and
1995. This is between  1/2 and 1 per cent below what the Bank projected in
November. (The underlying rate including these taxes is expected to rise
slightly in the wake of the Budget and then level off at slightly more than
3 per cent.)
The Bank also takes comfort from its chart of financial market expectations
in the more distant future, which it derives by subtracting the yield on
indexed gilts from that on conventional gilts of comparable maturity. The
expectation on February 2 was that inflation would peak at about 4 per cent
around the year 2000, and then drift back towards 3 per cent.
The Bank's chart does not, however, show the deterioration resulting from
the fall in gilt-edged prices, which began in late January and has
accelerated since the base rate cut.
The key to all forecasts is that they follow unexpected changes in current
data. In this case, the main reason for the change in the Bank's 1994-95
forecast was the surprisingly low RPI figures for three months in
succession, re-flecting in its view 'not only greater competition among
retailers, but also stronger than expected disinflationary forces in the
economy as a whole'.
These are all reasons to present to someone who is against cutting interest
rates. What are the positive reasons in support of a cut? The main threat to
the pace of recovery mentioned by the Bank is 'the deflationary impact of
the November Budget's tax and spending announcements in the short run'. The
Bank estimates that personal disposable income will be squeezed by a
cumulative 3 per cent over 1994-95. The squeeze will not begin in earnest
until the income and national insurance increases take effect in the year
starting in April.
I was concerned about the size and timing of some of these increases before
there was firm enough evidence of adequate economic recovery. But having
decided that the man in the City or Commons bar was right about the evils of
budget deficits, Mr Clarke should not have tried to offset his own measures
by monetary relaxation merely on the basis of forecasts. There have been
several past fiscal packages of comparable severity which have not brought
any undesirable slowing down of economic activity; and I would have
preferred to wait and see.
Treasury and Bank officials are obviously worried that workers will try to
recoup the tax squeeze on their take-home pay by pressing for and obtaining
higher wage awards. That could lead to a reacceleration of nominal pre-tax
earnings growth from its present annual 3 per cent - the lowest for more
than 25 years. But that surely is an argument for making pay increases more
difficult to obtain rather than relaxing credit.
Interestingly enough, nearly all the other factors listed by the Bank, both
real and monetary, weaken the case for an interest rate cut. These are:
confirmation of the recovery in both output and employment, as well as an
acceleration of monetary growth. The Bank's writers could hardly be more
explicit when they say that these forces are 'likely to reduce the downward
pressure on inflation', which they do not expect to fall much further from
its present low but still decidedly positive level.
Indeed, since the chancellor and the governor met, we have had more very
bullish indicators, including a spectacular rise in housing starts and a
survey showing a fall in bankruptcies to the lowest level since December
1989. Looking ahead, the Bank sees improving personal debt positions, an
upturn in stock building and a modest turnround in the continental
economies. New CBI regional surveys show the recovery spreading for the
first time to all regions except Northern Ireland.
My own worries relate to the gap between output and productive capacity.
Underlying inflation depends both on the size of the output gap and the rate
at which it is changing. When the gap is already shrinking - which is a good
definition of genuine recovery - why take risks? Whatever the size of the
output gap, the Bank has little doubt that it is beginning to narrow - as
is, indeed, obvious from the pickup in labour demand and the answers to
questions on capacity in the CBI Trends survey. It is the small chances
taken early in a recovery that sow the seeds of much larger inflationary
pressures later.
The Bank itself says that the risks to its central inflation projections are
asymmetrical - 'a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a
further fall'. It reaches this conclusion on the somewhat different grounds
that inflationary expectations have - despite the evidence cited earlier -
not yet fully adjusted to the sharp falls in inflation experienced over the
last two years or so. Surveys suggest that ordinary citizens are more
pessimistic than financial markets about inflation and expect something
worse than the recently experienced rate. This may be the sheer cussedness
of human nature or the triumph of experience over hope.
The clue as to why the Bank went along with the base rate cut may well lie
in the recent increase in the US federal funds rate from 3 to 3 1/4 per cent
 -of which the Bank would have had some advance hint. It is still not
difficult for Britain - or other European countries - to move in the
opposite direction to the US, given the large interest rate differential in
their favour. But the supplementary thought could well have occurred: 'We
had better act now before US rates rise too far or political events in the
UK undermine confidence and reductions here become too difficult.' If the
Bank had any doubts about its intention to put its toe into the water with a
 1/4 per cent move before going any further, then the Fed's action will have
removed them.
Changing base rates in small jumps of  1/4 per cent, instead of the minimum
of  1/2 per cent we have seen in the past nine years, may help depoliticise
monetary policy. If so, fine. But the debate about whether to take many
small interest rate steps or a few large ones is the kind of issue, cloaked
in market mystique, on which too many of the best brains of the Bank of
England spend too much time. We all know that, in a real emergency, rates
will still be changed by leaps of one or two percentage points - either way.
The main advantage of the latest cut in UK base rates is that it brings
nearer the time when people will realise that the next interest rate move
may as readily be upwards as downwards. It is impossible to have stability
in everything; and some movement of interest rates in both directions is the
price for achieving low, stable rates of inflation and avoiding unnecessary
fluctuations in output and employment.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: The badly advised should be
reinstated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P TRICKETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Publication of the results of the inquiry commissioned by the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB) about pension scheme transfers has
rightly caused enormous public concern. That a staggering number of people
have been wrongly advised to transfer the value of their company pensions to
personal pension plans is indisputable.
Attention must now turn to how these wrongs should be put right. For most
members, the most satisfactory solution would be to reinstate benefits as if
membership had never ceased. The Mineworkers' Pension Scheme (MPS) has
stated its willingness to do this where personal pension providers accept
poor advice was given and are prepared to meet the full cost of
reinstatement. A number of former members have already been reinstated.
However, it seems this willingness is not shared by other occupational
schemes. A recent survey by an independent pensions consultant revealed that
no other schemes were prepared to accept reinstatements. This approach will
do nothing to help those disadvantaged and nothing to help improve the
tarnished image of the pensions industry.
A commonly held view is that because members taking a transfer legally sever
all links with their former scheme this means that schemes can justifiably
wash their hands of bad advice cases. Members who took transfers should not
be regarded as exceptionally rash or gullible. They had the assurance that
they could rely on the Financial Services Act to ensure that best advice was
being given. If they were advised to transfer there was supposed to be no
doubt that it would be in their best interests to do so. Until recently,
regulatory bodies refused to accept there was a problem. Under these
circumstances I think that occupational schemes have a part to play in
ensuring rights are restored.
Company schemes are set up with the expectation that a pension will have to
be provided for all former employees. Restoring a member to the position he
would have been in had he not taken a transfer should present no additional
risks as long as the full costs of reinstatement are met by the personal
pension provider.
I accept there may be some technical difficulties with reinstatement but
doing nothing in the expectation that the outcome of the SIB review will
take away the problem seems an inadequate response. Until then those who
have taken transfers will be worried about future retirement provisions and
an increasing number of former occupational scheme members and their
families will suffer real financial loss as pensions come into payment and
deaths occur. Where the opportunity to reinstate benefits exists, pension
schemes should grasp the nettle and welcome members back now.

   THE CITY OF LONDON: VOl 1
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WORLD OF ITS OWN 1815-1890
By David Kynaston
Chatto, Pounds 25, 497 pages
London's pre-eminence as an international financial centre appears to defy
the logic of economic history. Venice, Antwerp, Genoa and Amsterdam, which
in turn dominated European finance between the late 15th and early 19th
centuries, largely owed their financial strength to their competitiveness in
international commerce.
The City of London took the lead in the 19th century on the back of
unparalleled growth in Britain's domestic economy, a dominant position in
world trade and the widespread acceptability of sterling. Much the same
could be said of New York when it posed a serious challenge to London's
international role after 1918, as the dollar eclipsed the pound.
Competitiveness in international finance appeared, until then, to march hand
in hand with national economic and commercial strength.
The postwar period has been different. While New York and Tokyo are
unquestionably bigger financial centres than London, their share of purely
international business is probably smaller. In spite of Britain's relative
economic decline and the structural weakness of sterling, the bankers and
merchants of the City of London have managed to re-establish themselves on
the global stage in a way that has eluded British politicians. This
performance is counter-intuitive, and the explanation owes much to history.
So much the better, then, that David Kynaston, whose earlier books include
histories of the Financial Times and of stockbrokers Cazenove, has embarked
on an ambitious new three-volume account of the Square Mile.
His starting point is 1815, which broadly marks London's emergence as the
financial hub of Europe following the flight of capital from Amsterdam to
the City during the Napoleonic wars. This late entree has its disadvantages,
in that we miss the excitement of the South Sea Bubble. More important, it
involves the loss of a crucial part of the City's story - the role played by
the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in establishing Britain's comparative
advantage in international finance. It was the revolution that turned
Britain into the only important European power apart from the Netherlands to
sustain a government debt market and public finances that were safe from the
predatory behaviour of the monarch. There followed the foundation of the
Bank of England and the rise of the merchant banking community, without
which the City could not have become the centre for foreign lending and
trade finance in the 19th century.
That said, Kynaston's is an exceptionally readable account, which gives due
weight to the cultural and social factors that helped transform the City
into such a powerful financial engine. The gamey character of the Square
Mile in the 19th century, with its crashes, frauds and insider dealing, is
beautifully conveyed. So, too, is the robustness of 19th-century finance
capital. When the City came under attack after the skulduggery of the
foreign loans boom of the early 1870s, Charles Branch of brokers Foster &amp;
Braithwaite defended outright speculation by declaring that 'a stock
exchange restricted to investment business would be as useful and as popular
as a public house licensed only for ginger beer'.
Such straight talking turned, at times, into powerful anti-semitism. When a
corrupt City editor of The Times resolutely puffed one Rothschild bond issue
after another, the paper came to be known as the 'Jews' harp'. Yet
anti-semitism did not prevent the Rothschilds finding their way into the
peerage - first, because money talked; second, because ministers feared that
if the Rothschilds were not in the aristocratic camp, they might join the
democratic one.
The dependence of prime ministers and chancellors on the house of Rothschild
meant that the scions of the family were able, in the old City phrase, to
get on financially and get honour. Then, as now, the rewards in merchant
banking dwarfed those available even to the most innovative industrialists.
Small wonder that Bertram Currie, the driving force at private bankers Glyn,
Mills, Currie, declined to take a seat in the House of Commons because, he
said, it would have 'diverted my mind from money-getting'.
Social acceptability took time, not least because Queen Victoria was won
over with difficulty. According to a minion, she felt that the trade of
these City gamblers was 'far removed from the legitimate trading which she
delights to honour, in which men have raised themselves by patient industry
and unswerving probity to positions of wealth and influence'. There is, it
seems, a regal antecedent for the Labour party's view of the Square Mile.
The 19th-century City differed from the late 20th in that power was more
heavily concentrated. In merchant banking the chief focus was, in Byron's
phrase, on 'Jew Rothschild and his fellow Christian, Baring'. The ebb and
flow of the fortunes of these two houses provide a counterpoint that runs
through the book. The other central thread is the story of the Bank of
England stumbling by way of successive financial crises into its role as a
modern central bank. The two strands converge when William Lidderdale, the
Bank's governor, duly emerges as the hero of the Baring crisis of 1890,
demonstrating nerve and sound judgment in his role as lender of last resort.
Kynaston is not uniformly clear in his treatment of the economic and
financial detail. And given the bankruptcies and collapses that punctuate
the tale, it would have been interesting to hear more of the murky business
of insolvency practice, out of which the modern accountancy profession was
born. But these are paltry reservations on a colourful narrative full of
well-judged extracts from contemporary material. Roll on volume two.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for ERM re-entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW IVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The paper published by the No Turning Back Group ('Radical Tories urge
benefits overhaul', February 3) contains many interesting ideas for the
future of the European Union. The attitude taken towards the possibility of
re-entry into the exchange rate mechanism in the future, however, does seem
to take more account of the problems of the past than those which might
arise in the future. With the bands set as widely as they are today, the
scope for damaging realignment speculation is minimised, while a degree of
linkage is maintained. Even narrowing the bands would be possible in the
future, although the perils of over-rigidity should be borne in mind.
The key weakness of the system in recent years has been the reunification of
Germany, which has injected a shock which must be seen as one unlikely to be
repeated. In some years, when Europe has genuinely begun to act as a unit,
when this shock drops out of the system and the economies of the member
states are much more closely aligned, it is possible that a much tighter
system of co-operation could be appropriate. To rule this out would be
foolish, for the argument against such a scheme is strongest when based on
economic fundamentals.
This scenario is certainly unlikely to occur in the near future, but there
is always the possibility that at some point a cross-border monetary policy
will become beneficial.

Sometimes 'real-life' stories in the cinema are the hardest to believe of
all. In The Name Of The Father comes towards us loud with topicality (Irish
Troubles), ardent with indignation about the fate of the Guildford Four, and
all but pasted over from head to toe with yesterday's newspaper cuttings.
Yet I scarcely believed a single moment of it. Yes, of course it 'happened':
give or take some dollops of cinematic licence. Yes, Gerry Conlon and his
three co-victims of miscarried justice spent 15 years in jail for a pub
bombing they never perpetrated. And yes, they were released after long
lobbying by friends and family: or those of them still free or alive after
British justice had done its work.
The movie has already been cheered in Ireland and praised in America. We,
the whipping boys, get it last. But a nation on the receiving end of
punitive propaganda often gets the truest view. As the whip comes down, it
can peer up at the exaggerated body-language and the intelligent features
changed by empurpled melodrama.
As in My Left Foot and The Field, director Jim Sheridan takes a Big Subject
and piles on the big emotions and big scenes. Sundered families; father-son
showdowns in jail; battling barristers (Emma Thompson shining through an
armful of briefs); and a supporting cast pitting brutal Irish ideologues
against brute British pragmatists. To our left: Don Baker as the jail's
fictional Provo-cateur who sparks riots and turns prison guards into human
torches. To our right: Corin Redgrave as the dour, assembly-kit top cop
named 'Dixon', a sort of Jack Warner from Hell.
Where Foot had a miracle-working central performance from Daniel Day-Lewis
and Field had its DIY aura of mythic pastoralism, Sheridan's new film is
horribly trapped between reportage and re-imagining. Day-Lewis is back, but
his Gerry Conlon is not a person, more an actor's exercise. Though drawn
from life - the long black curls, the blend of fecklessness and
street-smarts, the famed harangue to the media circus when freed - the
character never seems more than a skin-deep bid by an actor radiating
stoical magnitude to play weakness, skittishness and bewilderment.
The failures of imagination and identification mount up. Who are these
rent-a-crowd Brits and Irish who keep steaming up the screen? Are all
anti-terrorist cops merely multi-decibel thugs like the night raiders who
arrest Gerry? ('Get up out of bed, you dirty murdering bastard]' cries one,
just in case we think they woke him with a cup of tea and a newspaper). And
are all Irish terrorists pale-eyed, guard-torching psychos like the
composite played by Baker?
Where the supporting dramatis personae are conveyor-belt cliches, the main
characters are flawed factory one-offs. At the film's supposed heart is the
relationship between the Conlons, father and son. Dad (Pete Postlethwaite)
was also wrongfully arrested for terrorism, so Sheridan has the sentimental
inspiration of letting the two men share the same cell for the duration of
their sentences.
It never happened, but what the hell. Schiller had Queen Elizabeth meet Mary
Queen Of Scots: no good art without licence. But rather than strengthening
the movie, this reduces the father-son liaison to a glib mutual therapy
session designer-scripted to make Gerry see the light about authority
figures. Ah] (he realises over the slow, unageing years): better peaceable
old Pop with his luminous inner strength than the braying prescriptions of
Irish fanaticism or British despotism/duplicity.
And so the long bromide-opera wears on. Almost every idea in this movie has
been pureed for simpletons. We are spoonfed the early 1970s as flared
trousers, soft drugs and offcuts from Blow Up. We are spoonfed the Irish
Troubles as a tale of Them (Brits) versus Us (Irish), sweetened with a few
concessions about bilateral bad apples. And we are spoonfed the redressing
of injustice as Emma Thompson holding passionately forth in a never-happened
courtroom finale.
To wash it all down is the cold coffee of Captionland. Yes, up there in
white letters on black background: what happened to the characters after the
end of the film. But of course the film never really began. What we want to
know is what happened to the characters during the film: and what happened
to Britain and Ireland during all those years consigned by Sheridan to the
de-flavourising machine of pop-agitprop movie history.
The week does not improve, but at least it lightens up. If France called
Euro Disney a 'cultural Chernobyl', what ever will they call the latest
Hollywood version of The Three Musketeers? Enter screen left four
colloquial, ill-shaven, Burbankspeaking bratpackers: Charlie Sheen (Athos),
Kiefer Sutherland (Aramis), Oliver Platt (Porthos) and Chris McDonnell
(D'Artagnon). Exit screen right Alexandre Dumas.
We are all for a good slap-happy version of adventure fiction's great cheval
de guerre: a film full of witty anachronisms, camp villains and tone-hopping
dialogue. But unfortunately we had that already 20 years ago, in Dick
Lester's brace of musketeer movies. The new film substitutes imbecility for
wit and historical crassness for judicious anachronism. Our four heroes dash
about rural Austria (playing rural France) in search of wrongs to right,
castles to question the architectural provenance of, and warring accents to
sort out.
The good chaps are largely American. The bad chaps are largely English, led
by Tim Curry's preening Richelieu. The high point of the first 10 minutes is
Curry's multi-syllable response to the news that three rebel musketeers are
trying to defy him. 'Thre-ee-eegh?' he quavers, consigning Edith Evans's
handbag to acting history's oubliette. But after that it is all downhill:
with Rebecca De Mornay's Milady, Hugh O'Connor's King Louis and all four
musketeers fighting over the Oscar for Worst Performance In A Costume Film.
So we turn to Free Willy. Now there is an assignment for a modern musketeer.
A green Dumas might have penned this ecologically correct yarn in which an
orphaned killer whale who wants to escape his Oregon seaquarium (played by a
Mexico City seaquarium) is helped by an orphaned boy who wants to escape -
yes] - his stifling goldfish-bowl existence in an adoptive home with a swank
view of the Pacific. The boy (Jason James Richter) has only two
consolations: his mouth organ and his summer job at the Sea World.
Willy, the said whale, soon warms to the boy and his organ. And the boy
warms to his Willy. The film is directed by Simon Wincer, who established
his animal-schmaltz credentials with Phar Lap. Just to ensure that our tear
ducts are fountaining as freely by the close as Willy's spouter, Wincer has
the boy say to the whale 'I love you' at least four times, accompanied by
keening music from Basil (Blue Lagoon) Poledouris. Anti-whaling audiences,
roll up. Anti-wailing audiences, stay away.

Given the millions spent on health clubs, vegeburgers and keep-fit videos it
is surprising that nobody has previously made a series on the general
subject of good health. Now BBC1 is trying. Good Health comes from the same
stable as 'The Clothes Show' and today's pilot features underarm deodorants
(good health ?), poisons and anti-smoking campaigns (8.00).
Since the very beginning Minder has specialised in cinema parodies for its
episode titles. Today's, called 'All Quiet On The West End Front',
introduces Arfur to the world of corporate hospitality; you know, a tent
full of tired men slurping Bollie (8.30 ITV). Actually, for once, it seems
to be nephew Ray who might have more success than his uncle.
Since Lisa St Aubin de Teran's novels 'Keepers Of The House', about farming
in South America, and 'The Slow Train To Milan' about, well, largely about
just that, were two of the best novels of the last 12 years, her programme
in BBC2's Great Railway Journeys series is particularly tempting. She
travels from Santos in Brazil to Santa Cruz in Bolivia (9.30).

FT  10 FEB 94 / Arts: A very British 'Pinafore' - Operetta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one puzzling thing about Sunday's concert performance of this 'Entirely
Original Nautical Comic Opera' was why it should be in the London
Philharmonic's 'International Series'. The cast was British as could be, and
the conductor too, and most of the (sensibly reduced) orchestra.
To other questions there were obvious answers. Why do a concert Pinafore at
all? Because it will fill the Royal Festival Hall, if it has enough singers
with Names. Why should singers who have earned their Names in grander music
bother with Gilbert &amp; Sullivan? Because they think it will be fun, and it is
nice to sing to a happy audience. How can they be so sure that the audience
will be happy? Because nearly all the latter have it heard it many times
before - they have probably sung in it; and if few modern singers with Names
can mimic the vintage D'Oyly Carte style, their modern Personalities should
make piquant compensation for any falling-away from orthodoxy.
And so they did, and it was fun. Roger Norrington conducted the piece at a
brisk clip. Though three of the announced soloists had dropped out of play,
their replacements - slightly lesser Names - gave full measure: Neil Jenkins
as a fervent, upstanding Ralph, David Thomas adapting Handelian bass manners
to ripe Edwardian melodrama for Dick Deadeye, Marilyn Hill Smith a model of
D'OC diction and innocence as Josephine.
Her sire Captain Corcoran was David Wilson-Johnson, her nearest competitor
in the diction-stakes, artful about underlining any political innuendo with
a newly up-to-date echo (as Gilbert's lines seem regularly to have). The
Butterfly and the First Lord of the Admiralty were Sarah Walker and Benjamin
Luxon, both of them emitting Personality on an expansive, shamelessly
appealing scale. The London Philharmonic Choir, reduced but energetic, sang
the crew of the Pinafore and the sisters, cousins and aunts with a will.
By sheer talent and cunning, Gwion Thomas almost turned the Boatswain into a
major character; and in the still smaller roles of Hebe and the Carpenter,
the young mezzo Ruby Philogene and bass Jonathan Best were
disproportionately good. All in all, the performance was engaging enough to
silence quibbles. I append one plea nevertheless, about diction.
Not unlike Walton's Facade, the G&amp;S operettas make great play with setting
Gilbert's consciously clever, scansion-heavy texts to deceptively simple
music with an easy flow. The apparent clash between those things, and the
witty accommodation that Sullivan engineered between them, is the heart of
the matter. No doubt the old D'OC company preserved its 'authentic' stagings
too long - but its practised, ultra-lucid, front-of-the-mouth delivery still
seems the best way of bringing G&amp;S to full comic life. That is vanishing
now. We shall come to miss it.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Arts: Royal Ballet nurtures its creative talent - Clement
Crisp catches 'Dance Bites' at Leicester and finds that excellent intentions
have produced admirable results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Ballet has come up with a welcome new development in both touring
and creativity. Offered under yet another odd title - what does Dance Bites
mean? - the enterprise takes a small group of dancers (27 in all) for short
visits to regional theatres, in Leicester, Cambridge, Blackpool, with a
repertory containing three new works by company choreographers. Staging, as
I saw in Leicester, is simple; forces are limited; and I would hazard that
costs have been kept low. Excellent intentions, admirable results.
The audience at Tuesday's matinee was enthusiastic, and there was a sense of
youthful verve about the performance, of creative talent being sensibly
nurtured - not chucked in the deep-end at Covent Garden, but trying ideas on
a smaller and less redoubtable scale. The intimacy of means, the frankness
of contact with a public in a medium-sized theatre (Leicester offered fine
sight-lines), also helped to 'humanise' the idea of the Royal Ballet, away
from the inevitable pomposities of an Opera House. The public's only
complaint might be about the barmy titles in the programme - Desirable
Hostilities, Caught Dance, Herman Schmerman are more like cryptic crossword
clues than aids to understanding.
William Tuckett and Matthew Hart, the company's aspirant creators, have
produced short works. Tuckett's Desirable Hostilities uses five of Bach's
preludes from the 48 as a ground on which two men (Matthew Trent, Alastair
Marriott) and two women (Rachael Whitbread, Violeta Gaston) spar,
contemplate their own navels, and behave with that provocative and uneasy
manner which has been patented for the dance-stage by William Forsythe.
There is a suspicion that they have been rather badly brought up, but the
writing is fluent, and the solos for the men, who have more searching
choreography than the women, are intriguing, hinting at youthful angst and
uncertainty. The cast are in black and the girls might sue over their dreary
mini-leotards.
Matthew Hart's Caught Dance is a duet for Leanne Benjamin and Jose Manuel
Carreno. The score is Lutoslawski's Dance Preludes, whose Polish folksiness
Hart rejects. Instead, we seem to be watching a courtship between exotic
creatures: Yoland Sonnabend's black and red leotards make the dancers look
like Amazonian beetles or birds. I suspected the lurking presence of cameras
and David Attenborough for yet another nature programme about copulation in
the jungle, but the choreography is well made, Leanne Benjamin is a
triumphant predator, and Hart's originality shows fascinatingly through the
conventions of the partnering, and in the ingenuities of Carreno's solos.
The most elaborate work in the programme is Ashley Page's new Renard. This
has always been an awkward cuss of a score, almost too firmly shaped by
Stravinsky in theatrical manner for choreography. The succinct narrative,
like the music and the sung text, is locked into Russian folk traditions,
and there have been few danced realisations. Page has seen its potential as
a stage picture, as he did with his Soldier's Tale for Rambert, and he has
turned to the same designer, Bruce McLean. So we have a vivid, bright
setting: a green structure - cock and hens on a platform raised above the
stage, with a descending ramp - a magenta sky, and bold costumes. The red
fox has a jokey hair-brush as a hat. The Cock, in black, has a red penis
appliqued on his costume. The hens have chic little red hats to suggest
their crests. It is very jolly, and the action, in simple dance terms, is
clear - it is not a piece that will permit much other than faux-naif capers.
It is well danced - Jonathan Cope as the Fox; Peter Abegglen as the Cock;
Adam Cooper as the Goat; Stuart Cassidy as the Cat, with six hens - and well
sung and played under Lionel Friend.
The rest of the programme brought Monotones 2 - somewhat less serene than
heretofore, and demonstrating that its cast of three really need the expanse
of an opera house stage if Ashton's patterns are to breathe  - and William
Forsythe's Herman Schmerman, without which I have decided I can very happily
do, and did on this occasion.
This Dance Bites tour is sponsored by the Audrey Sacher Charitable Trust and
the Friends of Covent Garden. It can be seen at the Corn Exchange,
Cambridge, on February 10, 11, 12; at the Grand Theatre Blackpool on
February 14, 15

FT  10 FEB 94 / Arts: Polish composer of wide acclaim - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday morning, just two weeks after his 81st birthday, the composer
Withold Lutoslawski died in his native Warsaw. That was something like a
lucky accident, for from the late 1950s - when his Funeral Music for strings
earned him wide international acclaim and interest - Lutoslawski had spent
long periods abroad, teaching in America, Scandinavia and England as well as
conducting his own works. He was soon laden with commissions, honorary
doctorates and prizes. Recently the South Bank devoted a retrospective
series of concerts to his music, and it enjoyed a quasi-popular success that
few living composers could expect.
Lutoslawski was already 45 when the Funeral Music (an In Memoriam for Bela
Bartok, whose musical character it reflected in its own rigorously
constructed way) made him internationally known. His discovery proceeded in
opposite directions. On the one hand his already substantial oeuvre,
scarcely known outside Poland, offered a wealth of happy finds: in
particular his witty, cross-grained expansion of Liszt's 'Paganini'
variations (from 1941, when he eked out a living by playing cafe-piano), now
a duo-pianists' staple, and the grandly exuberant, playful, slightly
menacing Concerto for Orchestra (1954).
In the other direction, there were his newer, radically exploratory pieces,
from before the Funeral Music and after it - and on and on. The later
Lutoslawski never repeated himself. He pursued various ideals of form,
always original, often oblique and yet transparent. For a time he flirted
(like the Hungarian Gyorgy Ligeti) with 'aleatoric' writing, in which
individual players are left to realise free notation in their own ways, but
strictly contained within the whole composition.
The common factors were always 'definiteness of intention', razor-sharp and
unmistakeable; a superb ear for well-placed, unexpected instrumental colour;
and a dangerous sense of humour (peculiarly Polish, perhaps). To those, the
music of his last two decades - from the Cello Concerto for Rostropovich -
added a stern eloquence, which flowered broadly in his third and fourth
symphonies, but turned laconic and even savage in his series of contrapuntal
Chains for smaller ensembles.
The London Sinfonietta was among the beneficiaries of that series. It is sad
to think that the Chains are broken off now: they amounted to a public
exhibition of a first-class composer's developing thoughts, and one awaited
each new instalment with excited anticipation. It is consoling to remember
that there is plenty of late Lutoslawski that cries out for further,
rewarding acquaintance. still; and to reflect that his long career
culminated - unlike most composers', contemporary or long-past - in a
quarter-century of deserved admiration.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sold on the back of
a bus - London's public transport system is a lucrative medium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To The Gap, there is nothing more attractive than the back of a bus. When
the US clothing retailer moved into the British market, it was looking for
an advertising medium that would reach upmarket young adults. Buying poster
space on London's buses, says the company, 'gave us the appearance of owning
the town'.
Younger, wealthier adults were also the target of Ballygowan, the Irish
spring water company, when it expanded into the UK. Beginning with a London
launch, it paired a colour magazine campaign with poster advertising on
London Underground. Ballygowan took 'across track' sites on the Tube -
research suggests that travellers spend an average of 3.5 minutes a journey
staring at tunnel walls while they wait for trains.
The biggest names are also attracted to London's public transport system as
an advertising medium: Coca-Cola, American Express, Nike, Nestle, Virgin
Records, Marks and Spencer and IBM have all advertised on the buses, the
Tube or both.
A one-month campaign on the Underground is said to reach 3m adults who are
heavily weighted towards the upper end of the market; the potential daily
audience for London bus advertising is about 8m. Those advertisers wishing
to attract the attention of tourists can concentrate resources in certain
parts of town.
For London Transport Advertising, the London Transport subsidiary, all this
means Pounds 23m worth of business a year, making LTA, with 30 per cent of
the London market, the capital's biggest poster contractor. Overall, LTA is
among the UK's top four poster companies.
Now LTA is up for sale: around 40 interested parties, including media
companies and poster contractors in the UK and France, are thought to be
studying the confidential sales information memorandum which went out last
month; offers from prospective purchasers are due by mid-April and selection
of the purchaser is expected by late May.
Among the interested parties are the 250 staff who currently work for LTA -
they have announced that they are attempting a management and employee
buy-out. Brian Robinson, managing director, who is leading the buy-out,
together with John Swainson, finance director, and Bob Haynes, operations
director, describes the sale as a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to
acquire what is one of the largest advertising franchises in the world.
The buy-out team can hardly be alone in wanting to expand outside London and
to start competing to sell poster advertising in other cities. Such a move,
which has been difficult until now because of restrictions on London
Transport's areas of operation, would enable the company to make fuller use
of its sales force - one of the largest in the poster business - and
advanced computer system.
The most innovative of its computer facilities is the 'visualisation' system
which allows potential advertisers to gauge what their posters would look
like in a variety of situations, without having to tramp around stations and
down tunnels. LTA has transferred video camera stills of the inside of
Underground stations - complete with authentic piles of litter - on to a
database. Advertisers can sit at the screen, select a station, look at the
sites available within it, and even try out different sizes of poster.
Above ground, there may, after all, be something more beautiful than the
back of a bus. LTA is now selling the 'super rear' which is the whole back
of a bus, rather than just a panel. For this 'largest, most eye-catching'
site LTA says an advertiser can expect to pay a modest Pounds 200 per
double-deck bus for a month.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Softly, softly
approach - The French enlisted history-makers to market the Channel Tunnel,
but UK advertising has had to be coaxing and humorous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British newspaper advertisements for the Channel tunnel show cartoon-like
figures snoozing their way through the tunnel or driving down tree-lined
French roads. The French press advertising campaign, by contrast, features
Napoleon, Churchill and Queen Victoria giving their blessing to the venture.
These different approaches reflect national attitudes to the largest
European engineering project of the past decade.
For the sceptical British, used to a stream of stories about problems in the
Pounds 10bn project, including this week's announcement of another delay in
the launch of train services, the approach has had be gentle, humorous and
coaxing. For the French, who regard the tunnel with Gallic pride as a
natural extension of their record-breaking, high-speed rail network, the
tunnel must be presented with all due ceremony.
This two-pronged advertising strategy - which initially caused some
controversy on the Eurotunnel board - is part of a wider marketing strategy
which has had to address important pricing, distribution and public
relations issues.
According to Christopher Garnett, commercial director of Eurotunnel, some
people wanted the UK campaign to be triumphal about the achievement
represented by the tunnel. But research by Eurotunnel and its advertising
agency, DDB Needham, showed that with the problems completing the venture
such an approach left people cold.
'We realised our ads could not be pompous. They had to be light-hearted
while at the same time explaining why people should use the tunnel. The
board did not like that idea at first. They said that they had worked so
hard on the project. But in the end the market research swung the argument.'
The friendly image of the cartoons - intended to make the journey less of a
frightening prospect for those who fear claustrophobia, terrorism or rabies
 -appears to have worked. Awareness of the Eurotunnel name rose 15 points
after the campaign was launched in November last year, while its marketing
targets were exceeded by 3 to 4 per cent, says Garnett. Later this month the
press campaign will be followed up by television advertisements maintaining
the light tone.
Given that the success of the tunnel hinges on the operators tapping a new
market for cross-channel travel, countering fear is inevitably one of the
big challenges.
Garnett, who joined Eurotunnel from the ferry company Sealink, now Stena
Sealink, in March 1991, claims not to be concerned about surveys which
highlight this.
He points out that only 40 per cent of Britons have ever taken their car
abroad and only 16 per cent go on a foreign motoring holiday in any one
year. At the same time, he adds, relatively few continental Europeans take
their cars to the UK, partly because of fears about driving on the left.
Eurotunnel hopes to capture half the existing car passenger market of 6m
journeys by 1996. But the company believes it will also be able to create a
new class of traveller attracted by the convenience of the shuttle to spend
weekends in Le Touquet rather than Devon.
Besides press, TV and poster advertising - the lion's share of Eurotunnel's
Pounds 25m launch marketing budget - public relations has also played a
prominent, if not always constructive, role. The uniqueness of the project -
which has guaranteed extensive press coverage - has obviously helped, though
this can cut both ways.
An unfortunate choice of words by Charles Barker, the company's PR firm,
last month prompted The Sun, the biggest-selling UK tabloid newspaper, to
splash a headline on its front page: 'We don't want Sun readers in our
Chunnel. No entry to you lot.' The Sun claimed its readers were seen as too
downmarket by the 'train snobs' at Eurotunnel.
The announcement of the shuttle fares had provoked a more positive response
and a burst of coverage in the news columns, though a premature story in one
Sunday paper created a false impression that Eurotunnel would pitch its
prices at the lower end of the ferry tariffs.
In fact, the shuttle prices are towards the top of the ferries' range,
reflecting both a shortage of shuttle rolling stock which will limit
capacity in the early months and the novelty value of travel through the
tunnel. The ferry operators were relieved that Eurotunnel had not launched
an immediate price war but few people expect these prices to hold for long.
Eurotunnel had initially intended to sell its tickets directly to the
public. But because 70 per cent of Britons buy their holiday tickets through
a travel agent, Garnett decided to stick to traditional sales methods.
Apart from the lapse with The Sun, Eurotunnel's overall marketing campaign
appears to have been well received, even winning a back-handed compliment
from one of its rivals. Brian Langford, marketing director of P &amp; O European
Ferries, says Eurotunnel is right to present a friendly image in advertising
what he calls 'a fairly spartan product'.
It was clear from the outset that the tunnel would have to be sold on speed
and convenience, so there would be little opportunity to introduce on the
trains the restaurants, discotheques and shops which are available on the
ferries.
It is just these features - conjuring up the idea of cross-Channel sailing
as a leisurely experience - which P &amp; O is now using to compete with the
tunnel. It is drawing on its traditions as a cruise line, which in the early
days served to distinguish the company from its ferry rivals.
Langford acknowledges that P &amp; O cannot match the tunnel in the amounts it
spends on promotion, though it is attempting to keep its name in the public
eye with a more modest campaign. Even so, many transport specialists expect
the ferries to be forced to make sharp reductions in the frequency of their
Dover-Calais sailings.
Garnett believes the tunnel will become the natural way to travel to the
Continent and that talk of the ferries as a leisure experience will become
irrelevant. The millions spent on marketing will undoubtedly help.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Time to put more theory into practice -
Sunjay Kakar argues that accountancy graduates are better equipped to act as
decision-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUNJAY KAKAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The credibility of chartered accountants to act as decision-makers and make
professional judgments is being called into question because many have not
been trained in the subject and lack a detailed knowledge of accountancy
theory.
Those who have studied accountancy as an academic subject argue that
qualified accountants from other disciplines do not seem to understand the
thought processes behind the current debates in the profession and are
impeding progress.
An accountant with a 'relevant' (accounting) degree cites the Current Cost
Accounting debate during the 1980s. 'In my experience the contribution of
accountancy graduates to this debate was potentially much greater than that
of non-relevant graduates because they had studied accountancy as an
academic discipline in its own right,' he says.
'Accountancy graduates could understand the theoretical process behind the
debate because, for example, they had studied capital maintenance as a
concept instead of how it was treated in the accounts.'
Academics are in a position to inform the debates taking place in the
profession on a wide range of ideas including finance, corporate governance,
auditing, accounting standards and management accounting.
Professor David Hatherly of the department of accounting at the University
of Edinburgh, says: 'There remains a problem for improving standards if the
professional membership, at least in England and Wales, has been
under-exposed to academic ideas, research results and debate on issues and
choices.
'The current cost debate is one possible example of how the debate did not
move forward, in part at least due to a lack of understanding of income
theory on the part of practitioners.'
Do chartered accountants in England and Wales develop their understanding of
the conceptual framework while studying for the professional exams? Jon
Boyle, a consultant at Robert Walters Associates, the financial recruitment
firm, who trained with Arthur Andersen after studying a non-relevant degree,
thinks not.
'You do not need to study accountancy theory to pass the chartered
accountancy professional exams,' he says. 'Whilst studying I was never once
asked for an academic approach. There was a genuine thrust towards making
the accountancy studies more practical and, in order to pass the exams under
time constraints, students do not have any time to talk about accountancy
theory.'
The size of the potential problem can be seen from the student entry
statistics from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The proportion of accountancy - or 'relevant' - graduates in the annual
in-take has remained stable at only 19 or 20 per cent for the last seven
years.
That contrasts with the position elsewhere. At the Scottish Institute,
Professor Ian Marrian, deputy secretary and director of education, says that
80 per cent of its students are accountancy graduates.
Professor Niall Lothian, junior vice-president of the institute, says there
is a greater feeling within the business community in Scotland that
chartered accountants should be accountancy graduates because it gives them
a far greater conceptual understanding when thinking through difficult
issues.
'The fact that we are faced with a heavily regulated profession has been
largely brought about by accountants' failure to understand the conceptual
framework of their own discipline,' he says. 'Students need to have a basic
minimum understanding of the conceptual framework, but I question where this
understanding is coming from if it is not taught as part of a university
degree course in accountancy.'
Daniella Acker, a lecturer in accounting at the University of Bristol,
suggests that chartered accountants who are non-relevant graduates tend to
have a narrow understanding of accountancy theory. 'Accountants who are
non-relevant graduates have a basic understanding of accounting concepts,
but perhaps not the wider and deeper conceptual issues involved,' she says.
The lack of understanding of accountancy theory in England and Wales raises
a question mark over the professional judgment of many chartered
accountants. Professor Lothian says that accountants who do not have a
degree in accountancy are 'driven to look up the cookbook of instructions
rather than think through the issues.'
Professor Hatherly says that the need for accountants and auditors to stand
back and judge whether financial statements give a true and fair view is
becoming ever more important and ever more difficult.
'This is a judgment which requires a theoretical perspective because it
requires knowledge and experience of business and accounting rules, but
above all as an understanding of how financial statements get over the
important aspects of financial position and performance,' he says. He
stresses the need for a profession 'sure of its own thought process and not
seeking refuge in rules.'
Mr Boyle says that whenever a complex situation arises, accountants and
auditors attempt to apply the rules as they currently stand. 'But this does
not mean that they research the theory behind the rules,' he says.
Many chartered accountants point out that they do not need to understand
accountancy theory. They argue that they usually refer to a firm's technical
department which is best placed to understand the theory because it deals
with complex technical issues.
But Professor Lothian says that this is 'a betrayal of the concept of the
profession'. He asks: 'Would a patient consult a doctor who had to ask a
technical partner to make a diagnosis?'.
Not everyone is convinced. Emile Woolf, technical partner at Kingston Smith,
says that accountants in practice do not need to be excessively concerned
with theory. 'Practitioners are not aware of any commercial disadvantage in
an ignorance of the theoretical framework underlying routine accounting and
auditing work,' he says. 'Most can get on perfectly well and
cost-effectively, without continuously referring back to accountancy
theory.'
Ken Wild, technical partner at Touche Ross, says: 'There are many chartered
accountants with a relevant degree who often spend too much time concerned
with technicalities. They should stand back and ask themselves whether they
are actually communicating.'
Allan Cook, technical director of the Accounting Standards Board, takes a
different view. He points out that in the past a lack of knowledge of
accountancy theory did not harm anyone. But now, with the increasing
complexities of the financial and commercial environment, it is important
that there should be general agreement on the basic ideas underlying
accounting standards.
'Developing markets have brought about financial engineering techniques
which were not available before,' he says. 'To challenge these we need a
clear understanding of the principles on which our accounting rules are
founded.'
Accountancy theory might be likened to driving a car. The purpose of the
theory is to build a better engine to drive the car more effectively.
Sometimes accountants spend too much time looking under the bonnet without
actually driving anywhere.

FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Hughes takes a shot at pots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Susan Mary-Lorraine Hughes, a 42-year-old business school graduate, has been
appointed chief executive (designate) of Portmeirion Potteries, which grew
out of a small gift shop in a small North Wales tourist resort of the same
name.
Hughes, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles' Meridian clothing business,
is being brought in to replace George Hesp, 60. She joins the company on
March 7 and will take over in stages from Hesp, who has been group managing
director since 1965.
Brett Phillips, Portmeirion's finance director, says there were more than
300 applicants for the job and Hughes had been chosen because she came from
a 'design-oriented company'.
Portmeirion traces its roots back to the 1950s when Euan Cooper Willis and
his wife, Susan Williams-Ellis - a designer who had studied under Henry
Moore and Graham Sutherland - began selling pottery from a gift shop in
Portmeirion, an architectural fantasy designed by Susan's father, Sir
William Clough Williams-Ellis. When the couple couldn't find a pottery
prepared to make their designs they bought their own pottery in
Stoke-on-Trent.
Susan still designs some of the production and her husband remains chairman.
Although the family retains majority control, the company came to the the
stock market in 1988 and has grown rapidly despite the recession. The
company's turnover, more than half of which is exported, has more than
doubled to Pounds 22.5m over the past five years and pre-tax profits have
risen from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 3.7m.

FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Another train ride for Prideaux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Prideaux, the manager credited with turning British Rail's InterCity
division into the only profitable long-distance railway in the world, is to
join the Docklands Light Railway, a much smaller and currently loss-making
operation.
Prideaux, 49, is joining DLR, which operates a nine-mile network serving
east London and the Canary Wharf office development, as a non-executive
director. But he says he expects to devote more time to DLR than is formally
laid down in his contract.
One project to which he will be devoting his time is the planned Pounds 100m
extension of the railway south of the Thames into Lewisham. The DLR is to
look for a private consortium to build the 4.5 mile line which on completion
would double the DLR's revenues. At present it collects just Pounds 4m in
fares against running costs of Pounds 20m.
Prideaux says his experience of helping BR negotiate the creation of a
joint-venture partnership with BAA to build the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express
line between Heathrow and Paddington in west London should be valuable in
negotiations with potential bidders for this project.
After stepping down as managing director of InterCity, Prideaux became
executive chairman at Union Railways, the BR subsidiary set up to manage the
development of the fast rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel. But
he fell out with BR chairman, Sir Bob Reid, over the proposed privatisation
of the company and over the choice of a London terminus for the link.
Prideaux favoured St Pancras while Sir Bob wanted Kings Cross.
The boardroom row came to a head last August but Prideaux only reached a
severance agreement with BR in December. The DLR directorship is the first
job he has taken on since leaving Union Railways, since when, he says, he
has been brushing up his language skills.
Also joining DLR as a non-executive director is Nicolas Lethbridge, managing
director in London of Babcock &amp; Brown, an international leasing company.
Lethbridge, formerly project finance director with Schroders merchant bank,
has a background in the private financing of public services, particularly
in the transport field.

FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Kate Barker follows up a hint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kate Barker, the new chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British
Industry, says the first time she thought of applying for the job was when
she was tipped for the spot in the Observer column of the FT.
Barker, who is the first woman to be appointed to the post, is currently
head of economics at Ford of Europe, the company which produced a former CBI
director-general in Sir Terence Beckett. She says that, although she will
miss the motor industry, she is looking forward to 'getting involved in the
policy area'.
Although Barker is replacing Andrew Sentance, who was director of economic
affairs, she will take the title of chief economic adviser; this has been in
abeyance since the departure of Douglas McWilliams. A further change in
nomenclature sees Sudhir Junankar, previously deputy director of economic
affairs, promoted to the post of associate director, economic analysis.
Barker should not expect to replace Sentance in the Treasury's panel of
seven 'wise men', however, which seems set to continue with six, now that
Sentance has joined the London Business School. Nevertheless, Barker has
some experience of advising the Treasury; she has been sitting on its panel
of industrial economists, which meets three times a year.
Barker, who obtained a first in PPE at Oxford and describes herself as 'very
broadly a neo-Keynesian', takes up her appointment in March.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Technology: Healed to the bone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Methods of performing complex bone surgery are being revolutionised by
stereolithography, a laser technique developed for industry. By combining
this with medical tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging, precise
three-dimensional models of a patient's bone structure can be created,
enabling surgeons to tackle operations that might otherwise be too
dangerous.
The technology is used in Europe to assist about 40 surgical operations a
year, says Norbert Mucheyer, president of Mucheyer Engineering in Germany.
It has been applied particularly to skull-related surgery.
In one case, says Mucheyer, surgeons were reluctant to operate, fearing
damage to an eye nerve and loss of vision, until the stereolithography model
enabled them to locate the path of the nerve and perform risk-free surgery.
Stereolithography involves selective hardening of a liquid polymer resin by
the action of a computer-controlled laser beam. Linked to a computer-aided
design station, the technique converts 3-D designs into a solid model.
Before reconstructing damaged bone structure, a surgeon needs to visualise
the location and condition of all the bone segments. He must also plan how
to rebuild the structure, which may involve transferring segments of bone
and developing prostheses, plates and implants.
The usual method of visualising such a surgical problem is to view and
analyse a scan of the patient on screen. With a solid model, the surgeon can
practise cutting up the bone, check the amounts to be moved and prepare
appropriate prostheses.
Scans generated by tomography can be used as the data for the laser
stereolithography but this is time-consuming and costly. Companies like
Siemens in Germany, Zeneca in the UK and Belgian-based Materialise are
working with the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, on a project to
create a system for producing medical models.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Technology: Make your own diagnosis - As more
over-the-counter medical tests appear on the market, Victoria Griffith looks
at their accuracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over-the-counter medical tests - including everything from a home
cholesterol test to a self-diagnosis kit for kidney disease - are
increasingly making their way into American homes.
With pressure growing to slice US health costs and push for early disease
detection, most officials believe home testing will expand over the next few
years. Yet controversy is growing over how far the trend should be taken.
Concern remains over the accuracy of some of the tests. And the possibility
of home tests for life-threatening diseases like colon cancer, prostate
cancer and Aids is worrisome to many.
'From a technological point of view, a home Aids test could be put out
today,' says Truman Sussman, president of Biotel, a US company which makes a
range of home tests, including ones for diabetes and kidney disorders.
'So could many cancer tests. The problem is, you have to ask what the person
will do with that information. The news of illness can be devastating. For
serious diseases, a medical person may also be able to act as a counsellor
when they give the bad news.'
Even in the case of non-life-threatening diseases, there is a danger of
wrong diagnosis. 'There are limits to how far we can realistically take
this,' says Carolyn Jones, director of in vitro diagnosis for the Health
Industry Manufacturers' Association in Washington, DC.
Home testing does offer a number of benefits, though. One reason for their
increasing popularity is that they can help consumers save money. A routine
visit to a physician in the US can cost Dollars 200 (Pounds 133), including
simple laboratory tests.
A home diagnosis kit is considerably cheaper, even in cases which
necessitate a medical prescription. The urinary tract infection kit by
Biotel, for instance, costs just Dollars 11 for a package of 12 tests.
Chronic sufferers often have running prescriptions from their doctors, so
even if the test is positive they can avoid a visit to the physician.
Home testing can also ease costs for the entire medical system, by boosting
early diagnosis. Cholesterol, kidney disease and internal bleeding tests,
for instance, can encourage patients to seek treatment early on.
Enthusiasm for home testing centres on success stories like diabetes
monitoring. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine two
months ago revealed significant benefits to sufferers who constantly
monitored their blood sugar levels at home. Patients used the information on
blood levels to adjust their insulin doses.
Later this year, the Indianapolis-based diagnostics division of Germany's
Boehringer Mannheim will launch a new home kit for heart disease patients.
The monitor will test the blood of patients on anti-clotting medication.
Like diabetics, heart disease sufferers could then adjust their medication
levels accordingly.
One of the biggest challenges in home testing is to make sure that lay
people can easily obtain accurate results. 'We put a lot of emphasis on
creating labelling that will be easy for everyone to understand,' says
Rosanne Savol, manager of regulatory affairs for Miles, a US company which
puts out a number of home tests, mostly for diabetics.
'We use very large print, so that people with eye troubles will still be
able to read instructions. We also aim at a fifth-grade (10-year-old)
reading level to make sure people with lower educational levels will still
be able to use the product.'
Technological improvements have given impetus to the trend. 'Things are
easier now because we know exactly what substance we're looking for, and
we've come up with a specific chemical which will react with that
substance,' says Jack Bush, director of new business development at
Boehringer Mannheim.
'We will be launching an improved blood sugar test which screens out
interference factors better,' says Ann Setzer, director of products
marketing for Boehringer. 'To do that, we performed the tests under a number
of different conditions, high altitudes, below sea level, in frigid and
humid conditions. Now, the product will give an accurate reading almost
regardless of where you use it.'
Most industry executives believe home testing will gain momentum over the
next decade. 'There are some megatrends that will push this forward,' says
Sussman. 'For one thing, the population is ageing all over the world and the
elderly need better control over their health. The second trend is a push
towards cost containment in the medical sector.'
However, growth may not be consistent, or across the board. The Food &amp; Drug
Administration recently refused to approve a home test for strep throat, for
instance, because of doubts about accuracy. The use of home tests for
chronic, but controllable, diseases will probably see the most rapid growth.
'Allergies, asthma, epilepsy and heart attacks are prime candidates for home
tests,' says Rolf Classon, senior vice president at Miles. 'Wellness
monitoring, like cholesterol tests, will also be a big area.'
However, even as technology improves, home tests for diseases such as cancer
and Aids will continue to be controversial, and concern over the accuracy
and ease of home tests will probably linger for some time to come.
'New technology makes the options in this field more promising,' says Steven
Gutman, head of clinical laboratory devices for the Food &amp; Drug
Administration. 'However, we have robust concerns. I think what we'll see is
cautious growth.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Technology: Hotline to a happy ending - How a tapeless
answering machine saved a company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom began selling its first solid state telephone answering
machine last December. Messages are recorded on microchip rather than on
tape, making it quicker to retrieve them and play them back, with clearer,
digital sound.
The Response 120, as BT calls it, is not the world's first tapeless
answering machine. But it is the first answering machine designed and built
in Britain, and it comes from a tiny company which employs only 10 people.
Furthermore, the machine has a remarkably elegant interior. Whereas the
first tapeless machines contained up to four printed circuit boards studded
with components, the Response 120 has just one board, measuring 12 cm by 14
cm. It is combined with a telephone in a casing similar to one of BT's
standard domestic telephones, the Relate.
BT, which controls about half the UK answering machine market through its
sales and rentals, believes the Response 120 will be a success and expects
to sell 120,000 of them a year at Pounds 69 each.
The story of the Response 120 is a positive one. It was designed by
Cairntech, based at Inverkeithing, Fife, and manufactured under contract in
nearby Glenrothes by Hughes Microelectronics of the US. In March 1992,
Timothy Laing, a former army officer who owns 95 per cent of Cairntech,
warned his staff that the business would have to close by June if it did not
win another good contract. Over the years it had lost Pounds 2m making
specialised telecommunications equipment.
But he also asked his four-strong technical team why no one had solid state
answering machines. Within two weeks the company drew up a specification.
Because it had already dealt with BT it was able, unlike some small
manufacturers, to take it direct to the telecommunications company.
'For a minute the man at BT didn't speak,' says Laing. 'Then he said our
specification was almost exactly the same as one they were about to put out
to tender. We were told to keep in touch.' In mid-June 1992, BT issued the
tender and Cairntech had two weeks to meet BT's design specification and
cost the manufacture of 100,000 machines a year. Laing obtained a
competitive quote for making the product from GEC Marconi in nearby Dalgety
Bay.
BT evidently liked what Cairntech was offering: its machine would have a
pre-recorded outgoing message ('a lot of answering machine owners forget to
record one and then can't understand why no one leaves any messages,' says
Laing) and a default setting on the volume control that guaranteed messages
would be audible ('many people set the volume too low'). BT was struck by
the quality of Cairntech's digital sound, Laing says.
By October, BT had visited Cairntech and was close to signing a contract.
Then GEC pulled out of manufacturing the machine. A furious Laing got
through to Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, who told him it was not
possible to manufacture telephones competitively in the UK.
As a small company with a poor financial record, Cairntech had difficulty in
being listened to by several of the big electronics manufacturers based in
Scotland. Eventually Laing chose Hughes.
BT signed a contract with Cairntech in November 1992 and the product went on
sale 13 months afterwards, one month late. Hughes assembles the printed
circuit boards, installing components imported from east Asia and loading
Cairntech's software, putting the finished boards into plastic mouldings
made in Kent.
Laing believes BT preferred Cairntech to rival east Asian suppliers because
it offered more features and superior voice quality.
However, the extra features, plus the fact that the product was originally
costed when sterling was at Dollars 1.90, will mean that The Phone Box, the
subsidiary Cairntech set up to handle the new product, will make only a very
small profit on the Response 120.
The initial order for the machine is worth Pounds 10m. Demand is forecast at
120,000 units a year over the 2 1/2 -year life of the product. For the
company, monthly turnover should rise sharply from around Pounds 20,000 to
Pounds 700,000.
Might other UK companies have had the same success? Cairntech had the
advantage of employing a specialist in telecommunications electronics, a
relatively rare breed in the industry, according to Laing. It benefited from
the flexibility and commitment of a small company, and was fortunate in
having contacts with BT. It also had good luck.

Gilbert Chalk, the founder and managing director of Hambro European

Hambros.
His resignation is the latest in a line of departures from UK venture
capital companies. Jon Moulton left his position as managing partner of
Schroder Ventures last week and Robert Drummond resigned as chairman of
Grosvenor Venture Managers before Christmas.
Hambro European ventures, which already manages Pounds 30m, has been trying
to raise a new fund in what is a particularly difficult market.
It is understood that Chalk and Hambros fell out over the degree of control
that the merchant bank was exercising over investments the venture capital
company was making.
Edmund Truell, already on the board, has taken over as managing director of
Hambro European Ventures, and Michael Sorkin, a vice-chairman of Hambros
Bank, has been appointed chairman.

Mr Justice Potts had expressed concern that Mr Alvin Shuttleworth, BNF

was acting unreasonably or irrationally in bringing judicial review
proceedings.
The courts had ruled that the group had an arguable case.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of measures to reduce accidents and casualties involving newly
qualified drivers was announced yesterday by the government, Charles
Batchelor writes.
A new driver convicted of a serious driving offence will have to re-sit the
driving test. A separate theory test for all candidates will be introduced
by 1996.
Newly qualified drivers will be offered voluntary training to improve their
skills, and education programmes for use in schools and colleges will be
developed for new and prospective drivers.
Drivers aged between 17 and 21 represent only 10 per cent of licence holders
but are involved in 20 per cent of accidents, the Department of Transport
said. They account for 25 per cent of road deaths.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Former minister hits at red tape bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Tory defence minister yesterday added his voice to criticism of the
government's plans to give itself greater powers to repeal legislation.
The de-regulation bill - which was passed with a government majority of 37
at second reading on Tuesday - would allow ministers to repeal primary
legislation by statutory order.
Speaking in the Commons, Sir Michael Neubert, MP for Romford, delivered a
strong warning about the possible consequences of allowing ministers to take
too much power in their drive to cut red tape.
Sir Michael asked MPs: 'Isn't it less than satisfactory that the only
safeguard against ministerial misjudgment in the exercise of delegated
powers of de-regulation is the consideration of 90 minutes for statutory
instruments which are unamendable by this House?'
Replying for the government, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister,
said that the public would benefit from the removal of 'antique, medieval
restrictions which have no place in the modern age'.
A number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the government when
the bill reached committee stage.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Girobank staff call first of one-day strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girobank clerical staff plan to strike next Wednesday in the first of a
series of one-day stoppages in protest at the bank's basic offer of a 1.5
per cent consolidated pay increase.
An overtime ban by the NCU communications union's 3,250 clerical staff at
Girobank offices across the country started last week. The NCU said
yesterday that the bank had been notified that further one-day strikes would
be held on March 7 and 22.
Girobank, which has been a subsidiary of Alliance and Leicester Building
Society since it left the public sector in 1990, said it regretted the
strike decision but intended to minimise disruption to customers.
The bank said it hoped staff would ignore the strike call and go to work as
usual next Wednesday. It pointed out that the full pay offer to its staff
was worth an average of 9 per cent because it included a Pounds 300
unconsolidated bonus as a reward for co-operating in work changes. Staff
have also been offered an extension of a job-security guarantee for a
further 12 months.
The NCU leadership recommended their members to accept the bank's package,
but it was rejected in a secret ballot last autumn by 1,408 to 1,249.
In a postal ballot last month the staff backed the use of strike action by
1,317 votes to 933. There was more overwhelming support for industrial
action short of a strike, with 1,691 for and 599 against.
Ms Jeannie Drake, NCU deputy general secretary, said: 'Given the Pounds
64.4m worth of profits generated by our members last year and the 20 per
cent improvement in operational efficiency achieved, the bank's offer is a
miserable reward.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, denied yesterday in the
Commons that his department was involved in collusion with the Post Office
to close sub post offices.
Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP who is sponsored by the UCW communications
union, said a letter from the Post Office's general manager in north Thames
and East Anglia to staff revealing the Post Office's closure and sell-off
programme targets had been 'agreed with the Department of Trade and
Industry' was evidence of 'grubby collusion'.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Sunday wage proposal defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt by Labour MPs to introduce a statutory requirement that shop
workers should be paid double time for working on Sundays was defeated by a
majority of 30 (299-269) in the Commons last night.
Before the vote was taken Mr Peter Lloyd, junior home office minister,
warned that such a requirement would be likely to undermine the partial
liberalisation of Sunday trading hours for shops in England and Wales.
While accepting that some large retailers would be able to afford to pay
double time for staff employed on Sundays, he said smaller shops unable to
do so would eventually be driven out of business.
Mr Lloyd said that as a result the number of shops open on Sundays would be
cut, thus denying shoppers the freedom of choice that was intended to be the
main object of the Sunday trading bill.
Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's shadow home affairs minister, maintained that it
was only 'fair and just' that workers deprived of the opportunity of
spending Sundays with their families should receive a premium payment.
She said the imposition of a statutory requirement on employers to pay
double time would also recognise the 'special nature of Sunday'.
Ms Ruddock warned that, unless required to pay double time by law, some
employers were likely to try to engage new staff on the basis that Sunday
was a normal working day.
She suggested that unless employers were legally bound to pay double time,
the attitude of some MPs who voted for the bill when it was given a second
reading by a majority of 75 in December, was likely to change.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Work ailments cost up to Pounds 9bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accidents and illness at work are costing employers between Pounds 4bn and
Pounds 9bn a year, the equivalent of as much as 10 per cent of all UK
industrial companies' trading profits, the Health and Safety Executive said
yesterday.
In a report based on the most comprehensive research the executive has
undertaken in the field, it calculates that accidents and illness at work
are costing the economy overall between Pounds 11bn and Pounds 16bn a year,
between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product or a year's
economic growth.
The cost to employers, it says, is 30m lost working days, the equivalent of
Pounds 360 for every working man and woman.
In spite of the findings Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said
yesterday that Britain's health and safety standards were the best in the
world.
'Lots of red tape does not necessarily lead to a healthier and safer
workplace,' he said.
Yet union leaders believe that any de-regulation of health and safety could
prove a false economy.
Mr Frank Davies, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, which
oversees the executive, said the report proved that accidents hurt
companies' balance sheets. 'I doubt if many managements understand what
accidents actually cost,' he said. Most of the costs tended to be uninsured
and hidden away on profit and loss accounts under production, insurance or
labour costs or as write-offs.
The report said the cost to employers included compensation to injured
workers, replacing staff involved in an accident and repairing equipment.
The findings were based upon figures in the Department of Employment's 1990
Labour Force Survey and case studies carried out by the executives' accident
prevention advisory unit.
The studies, which looked at non-injury as well as injury accidents and
illnesses, centred upon a construction site, a creamery, a transport haulage
company, a North Sea oil production platform and an National Health Service
hospital.
It found that the construction company lost Pounds 700,000 a year through
accidents and ill health, the creamery almost Pounds 1m, the transport
company Pounds 196,000, the hospital Pounds 400,000 and the oil production
platform Pounds 3.7m.
The report, based on figures from the 1989-1990 financial year, estimated
that illness and injury led to the loss of 30m working days in a single
year. About 1.6m injury accidents in the year had led to absence from work
equivalent to 18m lost working days. Some 5,000 of those injured had to give
up work permanently.
The commission believes that as much as 70 per cent of the cost of accidents
and ill health could be prevented by management.
A group of Nottinghamshire Labour MPs are meeting with Mr Forsyth today in
an attempt to have a public inquiry into the Bilsthorpe colliery accident
that resulted in the deaths of three miners in August. The report of the
Health and Safety Executive investigation into the accident is to be
published today.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Mates at work but strangers in the street: How west Belfast
factory staff cope with the Troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paddy Auld and Ronnie Lewis work together on the shopfloor at Mackie
International, a textile machinery company a stone's throw from west
Belfast's 'peace line', the brutal barrier of iron and brick that dissects
their city. But when they go home, they go in different directions to
different worlds; Paddy is a Roman Catholic and Ronnie is a Protestant.
Paddy heads south, across the Springfield Road - dubbed the 38th parallel by
battle-weary locals - ignoring the derelict houses abandoned by people too
terrified to live on the front line.
He returns to Andersonstown and to life in one of the Catholic ghettoes
marked on the city's extraordinary religious map. Some of the smarter, new
homes he passes on the way to 'Andytown' have metal window grilles to thwart
brick-ends and bombs.
Ronnie goes north, on to the Highfield estate, where 3,000 families live in
the shadow of Black Mountain. There is not one pub for drowning sorrows and
the run-down, Protestant streets suggest that hardship in Belfast shows no
particular sectarian inclination.
Nearly 60 per cent of Highfield's men are unemployed and all but a few of
the children at primary schools such as Glencairn qualify for a free lunch.
Community self-help is basic and too many youngsters have drifted
unthinkingly into the grip of the loyalist paramilitaries.
Paddy, a Mackie convenor, recently went shopping with his wife in an
exclusively 'prod' neighbourhood. He was spotted by a workmate who greeted
him as 'Billy' and passed on by. Paddy recalls: 'It wouldn't have been very
clever for either of us if he had been seen there talking to someone called
Paddy. It's not just the other side you have to worry about, some on your
own side are just as bad.'
One of Ronnie's best friends, a Protestant, lives just across the way from
him on the Highfield, separated only by the 20ft-high wall which perpetuates
the religious divide. When Ronnie's daughter got married, his friend would
not cross the line to attend the church. 'He went into town and came back
out in a taxi,' recalls Ronnie. Such are the instinctive, unspoken
procedures for staying out of trouble in this corner of the UK.
Neither man likes talking about 'sides', though it is unavoidable. They say
nearly everyone is sick and tired of the madness and united in their wish to
see an end to it.
They say they are optimists because the alternative is too awful to
contemplate but they do not sound entirely convinced that the end is at
hand.
'Things are better now. Not long ago when you went to work you didn't know
if you would be going home in the evening,' says Paddy.
He and Ronnie, a lathe operator who is also a union official, try to recall
whether it was two or three Mackie employees who were killed when the
Troubles were at their height in the mid-1970s.
Some of those working in the company's newly built plant still have their
moments. Pat Dougan, the outspoken, North Antrim-born Catholic who is chief
executive of Mackie and who daily arrives in his Jaguar XJS from a smarter
part of town, recently ran into a fusillade of stones. 'They have regular
battles across the Springfield between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock,' he says,
with a shrug of his shoulders.
But Mr Dougan, who says 'ethnic cleansing began in Belfast not Bosnia', is
not a man to be easily scared off. He arrived at Mackie in early 1992 to try
to save a long-established business which once offered a day's wage and a
sense of purpose for 7,000 people but which ended up dependent on government
hand-outs.
He has turned round the business, which is set to make a modest profit this
year and, after initially shedding workers, is recruiting again. Mr Dougan,
who says 'every additional employee is an extra nail in the coffin of the
terrorists', wants the 450-strong workforce up to 1,000 and intends to float
Mackie soon.
He also wants his workforce, once exclusively Protestant, to reflect the
religious make-up of the community; fair-employment regulations in any case
make it a pressing priority.
But his own Catholic upbringing does not cloud his view of how best to go
about it: 'The Fair Employment Commission is insisting that our job ads say
we welcome applications from the Catholic community. I refuse to do it.
Applications from both communities should be equally welcome if we are
talking about equal opportunities. In any case, I could get shot by the
'prods' for following that line,' Dougan adds.
So far, however, Catholics account for only 13 per cent of the workforce, a
figure which is rising but which gives no grounds for complacency.
Mr Dougan says one of the big problems in raising the Catholic intake is
finding skilled recruits. The company has agreed to take a quota of new
employees from two training centres in Catholic areas.
But he says a much broader effort is desperately needed. 'Giving people jobs
and meeting the challenge of making Belfast a better place to live in is the
way to end the misery and violence. The business community here, including
industrialists and bankers, have been cowards. They have chickened out of
facing up to the problems, refused to stand up and be counted; lying low is
not the answer.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Ken and Eddie bewilder the markets: Investors are
questioning the rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets do not like surprises. Tuesday's  1/4 percentage-point cut in UK
base rates was decidedly unexpected and the foreign exchange markets have
reacted badly.
Sterling fell 2 1/2 pfennigs and one cent yesterday, closing in London at
DM2.5708 and Dollars 1.4605 respectively. On a trade-weighted basis, the
Bank of England's sterling index dropped from 81.5 to 80.8.
The pound is now four pfennigs lower than its level before the announcement
of the cut. More important than the size of the fall, however, is that
sentiment towards the pound seems to have changed distinctly for the worse.
The mood among international investors, particularly those in the US is said
to have turned against the UK following the rate cut, with heavy selling of
both gilts and the pound.
The markets are unconvinced by the explanations for the cuts presented by
the Treasury and the Bank of England. Although the latter's quarterly
inflation report contained positive news, its conclusion was that the risks
of a rise in underlying inflation were greater than those of a fall.
'If you read the inflation report, there is no justification for rates to
come down,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International
(Europe). 'The target measure of inflation is forecast to be rising at 3 per
cent two years out, in the upper half of the target range and the report
says the risks are on the upside.'
The size of the cut, says Mr Shepperd, is seen as 'something of a
compromise' between the government and the Bank of England. As Mr Robin
Aspinall of Panmure Gordon puts it, the perception is that 'Ken (Clarke)
wanted  1/2 point and Eddie (George) wanted none'.
Given the perceived lack of economic justification for the cut, the market
has been tempted to look for a political explanation. The size and timing of
the rate cut was decided last week.
However, foreign exchange markets are highly cynical and some traders have
undoubtedly linked the timing of the cut, albeit erroneously, to the
government's political difficulties, in particular the recent death of Tory
MP Stephen Milligan.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, commented: 'The
authorities have made a very big hash. The politics have conspired to turn
the balance of market sentiment in the other direction. The surprise factor
has rebounded on them. Market sentiment about their own credibility has been
very much damaged.'
Some fall in sterling after the announcement of the cut was probably
inevitable, especially as the change came so soon after the Federal
Reserve's decision to increase US interest rates by  1/4 of a point.
What matters now is the extent, and the duration, of the pound's decline.
Although the government does not have an exchange rate target, the value of
the pound is one of the inflationary indicators monitored by the Treasury
and the Bank of England.
The authorities can take comfort from the fact that sterling's weakness is
only retracing the ground it has recently gained. Against the D-Mark, the
pound is still well above the DM2.32 it traded at a year ago and the DM2.43
it touched as recently as October. In trade-weighted terms, the Bank of
England index also remains well above the 76.0 level of 12 months ago.
A weaker pound brings some benefits, of course, most notably to the
competitiveness of UK exporters. Indeed some see a weaker pound as the main
motive for the rate cut, given that the small size of the change means it
will not be passed on by building societies in the form of lower mortgage
rates.
Industry could certainly live with a substantially lower pound. 'On a
trade-weighted basis, sterling still remains above the level recorded in the
first half of November. For many companies, this is still close to the top
end of the range at which they are competitive in main overseas markets,'
said Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the
Confederation of British Industry.
Analysts note that the outlook for sterling is much better against the
D-Mark than the dollar. Figures released on Monday showing German
unemployment still rising underline the economy's weakness. Economists
predict that German interest rates probably still have 100 basis points to
fall.
Increasingly the interest rate differential should favour sterling. Against
the dollar, however, there is talk of sterling falling as low as Dollars
1.35-Dollars 1.40.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the fact
that sterling had not bounced back much, despite its large fall, suggested
there was unlikely to be much recovery for the currency in the short term.
The government will be unhappy if this particular cut has placed its
anti-inflationary credibility in question, partly as that would limit its
subsequent room for manoeuvre.
The fall of sterling itself is unlikely to be a serious concern to the
government, at least this far. It may even be welcome. A sustained slide in
sterling would be another matter, but it is much too early to conclude that
anything like that is in prospect.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Light van sales lag behind recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New commercial vehicle registrations increased year-on-year by 1.3 per cent
in January, as demand for vans continued to lag behind the new car market's
strong recovery.
Commercial vehicle registrations in January rose to 17,642 from 17,418 in
the same month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Demand for light vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) fell again in January by 12 per
cent year-on-year to 6,111 and continued to mask recovery in other sectors
of the commercial vehicle market.
Sales of medium and heavy vans (1.8-3.5 tonnes) rose by 12 per cent last
month to 7,301, while registrations of trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross
vehicle weight) rose by 10 per cent year-on-year to 2,568.
In recent months demand has begun to pick up from the small business and
local distribution sector with rising registrations of medium and heavy
vans.
The heavy truck segment of the market (above 15 tonnes) continues to lead
the recovery with registrations up by 24 per cent year-on-year in January.
Sales in the whole of 1993 rose by 27 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Council ban on deer hunting quashed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A ban on deer hunting on Somerset County Council land was yesterday declared
unlawful and quashed by a High Court judge.
Mr Justice Laws ruled that councillors exceeded their powers when they voted
by 26 to 22 last August to ban hunting at Over Stowey Customs Common because
they found the sport 'morally repugnant'.
The judge said the law 'confers no entitlement on a local authority to
impose its opinions about the morals of hunting on the neighbourhood'.
He gave the council leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal after being told
that 35 councils had imposed similar bans.
The Liberal Democrat-controlled county council was ordered to pay the legal
costs of the case - unofficially estimated at Pounds 50,000.
The judge said the primary question was whether the councillors' moral
objections were capable of justifying the hunting prohibition as a measure
conducive to 'the benefit, improvement or development' of the area, in line
with the council's obligations under the 1972 Local Government Act.
The judge said the language of the act was not wide enough 'to permit the
council to take a decision about activities carried out on its land which is
based upon free-standing moral perceptions as opposed to an objective
judgment about what will conduce to the better management of the estate'. He
added: 'A prohibition on hunting . . . could only be justified if the
council reasonably concluded that the prohibition was objectively necessary
as the best means of managing the deer herd, or for the preservation or
enhancement of the amenity of their area.
'The view that hunting is morally repulsive, however pressing its merits,
has nothing whatever to do with such questions.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Trading standards move opposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh district councils are resisting attempts to set up large trading
standards authorities once local government in Wales is reorganised.
Trading standards officers believe businesses would face fragmented and
inconsistent regulation if the service were devolved to the 21 councils that
will replace the current eight Welsh councils. An amendment to create three
new trading standards authorities for Wales has been tabled in the Lords by
the Lord Elton (Conservative).
But the Council of Welsh Districts said yesterday: 'Such a move would mean
another blow to local democracy. The trading standards service is no more
complex and demanding than environmental health, a function which district
councils have carried out without complaint for many years.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Hello John, got a new motor?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major (left), of the 'more muscular response', not only to Bosnia
but to his backbenchers, yesterday looked for a soulmate at Triumph
Motorcycles, home of what the company calls 'the muscled streetfighter', the
Speed Triple, Paul Cheeseright writes.
At the factory in Hinckley, Leicestershire, gazing at a row of machines, he
brushed aside the suggestion he might buy one: 'That would be an interesting
sight, wouldn't it?'
His was a visit of symbols. He watched a Daytona model, in metallic
Barracuda blue, run through its paces. The Daytona claims to be what he,
politically, might like to be, 'a battleship built to outperform,
outmanoeuvre and outlast'.
Triumph has emerged over the past eight years from the ashes of the domestic
motorcycle industry and now exports to Japan.
'Triumph has emerged as a result of a dramatic level of capital investment,'
declared Mr Major. Industry now has 'a tremendous opportunity' with
inflation down, productivity and employment up.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Major dismisses talk of crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday dismissed as 'empty chatterings' the speculation at
Westminster that defeat in this summer's local and European elections would
threaten a new leadership crisis in the Conservative party.
With Tory MPs still stunned by the bizarre death this week of their
colleague Stephen Milligan, the prime minister acknowledged his frustration
at the constant talk of a leadership crisis.
During a visit to Leicester marking the start of an intense programme of
regional tours ahead of the elections, he insisted that the government's
attention was focused on a 'startling' improvement in economic prospects.
Mr Major, increasingly disillusioned with his treatment by the media at
Westminster, intends to use the tours to take his message directly to the
electorate. In Leicester, he held the first of a planned series of meetings
with regional newspaper editors.
He has ignored the advice of some colleagues that by taking such a high
personal profile in the campaigns he risks being blamed directly for a poor
Tory performance in the elections for local councils and the European
Parliament.
The prime minister has told friends in recent weeks that he is the only
leader capable of holding together the Tory party after its schisms over
Europe and economic policy.
Questioned about his own political authority, he replied: 'We had all this
last year - there was going to be a great leadership crisis in November but
it turned out to be empty chatterings - you will find the same thing this
year.'
He described the death of Mr Milligan, which is being investigated by the
police, as a deep personal tragedy. He added: 'He must have been pretty
unhappy, pretty miserable.'
His comments followed a warning from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that
a challenge to Mr Major would confront the Tories with almost certain defeat
at the next election.
The chancellor said the damage inflicted by a new leadership crisis would
become an argument over 'who leads the government to defeat'.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Patten orders inquiry into length of school day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday ordered an inquiry into
the length of the school day, despite a report from the education watchdog
which said this had little or no effect on standards.
League tables showing how many hours each school in England and Wales
teaches its pupils a week, are being considered.
The report, by the Office of Standards in Education, found 'little direct
correlation between the amount of teaching time allocated to pupils and
their overall standards of achievement'.
It found wide disparities, with taught time in primary schools varying
between 20 and 24.2 hours. The government's recommended minimum school week
for children in the last three years of primary education is 23.5 hours.
Ofsted also found that schools teaching less than the recommended minimum
'can, and often do, give their pupils short change in terms of the quality
and extent of the education provided'. In secondary schools using the short
week, the inspectors found that some subjects were not receiving the full
treatment required by the national curriculum.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'It is the quality, not the quantity of teaching which
counts and the government must avoid being seduced by an argument that comes
perilously close to 'never mind the quality, feel the width'.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Venables sued for Pounds 66,000 by bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank yesterday issued a High Court writ against Mr
Terry Venables, the England football coach.
The bank is claiming Pounds 66,493 it says is due under a guarantee given by
Mr Venables for the repayment of a Pounds 185,000 loan taken out by a
company called Recall City, a customer at the bank's branch in Romford, east
London.
The sum claimed is said to be the balance owing when the bank called in the
loan on October 28 last year, plus interest, which is mounting at the rate
of Pounds 18.78 per day.
Mr Venables took the Pounds 160,000-a-year job as England coach two weeks
ago.
The writ states that by a written guarantee, dated December 5 1991, Mr
Venables guaranteed the payment of all sums due at any time under the loan,
plus interest at 5 per cent annum above base rate from the date of the
bank's demand for payment.
Mr Venables's involvement with Recall is thought to relate to the ownership
of two public houses. He is expected to contest the bank's claim.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Surplus expected from Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester expects to show a small surplus on the Pounds 5m-plus spent on
its failed bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, with insignificant costs to the
city council. The money was raised from the private sector and government
agencies.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of the Labour-controlled city council, said
yesterday that benefits of the bid included Pounds 100m of public investment
and a similar sum from the private sector. Mr Stringer said about 5,000
'person-years' of employment had been created so far, with a similar amount
still to come. The city also planned to build the new Millennium Stadium,
creating another 3,000 jobs.
The stadium forms the centrepiece of Manchester's bid for the 2002
Commonwealth Games.
'Last year the city council gave Pounds 750,000 in grants to small
businesses to help create or safeguard 622 jobs,' Mr Stringer said. 'Compare
that with the infinitely greater benefits of our Olympic bid.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Germans fail to bid for Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of German shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan, which had expressed interest
in the troubled Swan Hunter shipyard, has decided not to bid. The decision
came after the company failed to find a partner for the venture.
GEC, which is also believed to be a potential bidder for Swans, declined
yesterday to reveal its intentions. The prospects of Swan Hunter, which has
been in receivership since May, being sold as a shipbuilder now depend
increasingly on whether the UK government is willing to assist a sale.
The only company to confirm that it wishes to place a bid, French
shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, has suggested that the
government-funded Tyne and Wear Development Corporation buy Swan Hunter's
main Tyneside sites and then lease the facilities to CMN.
Such a deal would anger rival UK warship yards, which have already attacked
the recent European Union decision, supported by the UK government, to grant
Swan Hunter limited eligibility to intervention funding subsidy.
Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of UK subsidiary CMN Support Services, said the
idea of CMN leasing Swan Hunter facilities from the development corporation
was not a form of government aid because CMN would pay the market rent for
the land.
It was not out of the question that CMN might buy Swans' site, he said, but
the more capital investment that was required, the more CMN needed to be
confident of workload in the near future.
'We most certainly require a number of assurances and guarantees from the
government on a whole host of matters,' said Mr Henderson. These included
whether a CMN-owned Swans would be competing on an even playing field for
export work.
Mr Alastair Balls, development corporation chief executive, said yesterday
it was awaiting firm figures from CMN following its leasing-deal suggestion.
Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said: 'If the government stands to
one side they are basically signing the death certificate.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / MPs rap Pounds 48m computer 'waste'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the Pounds 48m spent on a government computer network was a waste of
money, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday.
Its report on the Department of Employment's attempts to introduce a new
computer network called the Field System comes after similar criticism from
the National Audit Office, the watchdog on government spending.
The department said yesterday that it did not accept that the project was a
failure or represented poor value for money. It decided in 1988 to introduce
the system for its regional and area offices responsible for delivering
training and enterprise programmes.
Later that year the government announced plans to set up employer-led
training and enterprise councils in England and Wales to replace the area
offices from 1990. But the department decided to continue implementing the
Field System in order to assist Tecs.
'They experienced problems in developing and implementing it,' the public
accounts committee said.
'By spring 1993, when they ceased supporting the system and Tecs became
responsible for determining their own information technology requirements,
the department had spent Pounds 48m on it.'
The MPs said that although in August 1992 most Tecs were using the system
only partially or not at all, the department hoped the Tecs would 'tend to
decide to develop the system rather than move away from it'.
The department told the MPs that Tecs, had they been fully operational,
would not have asked for such a system. The committee reports that by
pressing ahead the department 'ignored a major lesson' from previous
computer projects about the need to involve potential users fully.
The committee said: 'We are disturbed that although the department spent
Pounds 48m on the Field System, most Tecs considered that the system had not
enhanced their performance.
'In such circumstances, we do not share the department's view that the
system can be regarded as any sort of success, even a partial one. In our
view, with so few clear benefits, this expenditure does not represent value
for money for the taxpayer. This was money that could have been spent on
providing training for unemployed people.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Right approach for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Maybe he is right after all. If we just sit and do nothing it will drop
into our hands.' You will gather from that comment from a senior Labour
politician that Mr John Smith's leadership does not inspire all his
colleagues at Westminster.
The frustration is felt not only by those on the left such as Mr Bryan Gould
who has been pressing the party to stop shadowing the Conservatives and
offer instead an ambitious strategy for economic revival and full
employment.
Mr Gould's departure will not be mourned by those who believe that winning
the next general election depends on stifling internal dissent. He is a
rebel. His antipathy to Europe is difficult to grasp. But Mr Gould is a
thinker in a party with many more placemen and women than intellectuals on
its front bench.
The modernisers, too, are frustrated. Though scornful of Mr Gould's economic
expansionism, they share the analysis that now the party has dumped much of
its ideological baggage, it must turn its mind to filling the vacuum. They,
like Mr Gould, are not making much headway. The safety-first approach is
going down well with the voters. Bank managers are back in fashion.
The lesson of the last parliament was that we should pay little heed to the
headline voting-intention figures of the opinion polls. Too many of those
ready to say they intended to vote Labour changed their mind when they
checked their wallets in the privacy of the polling booth.
The important - and overlooked - indicators were to be found in the fine
print of the polls. The voters did not trust Labour on the economy. In
England's south and south-east, they worried that tax increases would hit
the aspiring working classes.
They felt uncomfortable with the idea of Mr Neil Kinnock in 10 Downing
Street. The unions would wield too much clout. As one Tory strategist puts
it: 'We were able to persuade them that things were never so bad that they
couldn't be worse.'
But as Mr John Major's government lurches from crisis to crisis those
concerns have begun to disappear. Labour is rebuilding the respectable image
it has craved since Mr Kinnock pulled it back from the abyss in 1983.
Gallup's latest poll in the Daily Telegraph told the story. The interesting
point was not that Labour had retained its 20-point lead. It was that the
voters no longer feared a Labour government.
Four-fifths thought the opposition had become more moderate. Nearly half
thought it would do a better job of running the economy. Two-thirds thought
Mr Smith looked like a prime minister. Three-quarters said they would
welcome - or would have nothing to fear from - a Labour government.
With or without Mr Major, the Tories are bent on self-destruction. Tax
increases have deprived them of their strongest electoral card. Their
reputation for financial and moral probity is tarnished. The party is locked
in mortal combat over its ideological direction. After 15 years in office,
the argument runs, the corrosion is too deep to expect the political
recovery which traditionally follows an economic upturn.
Amid the present disarray it sounds plausible. Even some of the modernisers
believe it might be true. But the operative word is might. For Labour to
look forward with any certainty to government it has to stand for something
 -as it did in 1964 and in 1945.
It is often said in defence of inaction that the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher
offered only the thinnest outline of her programme when she published The
Right Approach before the 1979 general election. The parallel is misleading.
For all the absence of detail Mrs Thatcher left no one in any doubt about
where she was heading.
Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown have grasped the point. Mr Blair wants to
reposition Labour as the friend of individual opportunity as well as of
community. It should seek to enable not direct. Government should be cast in
the role of partner not master.
Mr Brown is expected to take up the theme in a series of speeches. His aim
will be to emphasise that the debate over tax and spending cannot be
divorced from the nation's overall economic performance. The market economy
is taken for granted. Labour will promise to get more out of it.
But the shadow cabinet's beautiful people - as they are dubbed by scornful
colleagues - are in a small minority. The mood of the moment favours sitting
and waiting. Maybe that will be enough.
It will, though, beg the obvious question: what would Labour do in
government beyond providing a breathing space for the Tories to prepare for
their return?

The trend towards decentralised bargaining in the public sector is expected

An IDS report says the government's policy of applying a pay bill freeze

People in the UK are Pounds 12bn worse off than they need be if they were
tax-efficient, claimed their rights and made their savings work harder,
according to research carried out for IFA Promotions, which represents
independent financial advisers.
Mintel, the financial analysts, says more than Pounds 5bn was lost through
poor use of tax allowances, a lack of planning ahead in areas such as
inheritance tax, and a failure to use tax-efficient products.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV companies plan to seek an injunction against the Football League
over the timing of the broadcast of Coca Cola Cup semi-finals this month,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
The row has arisen because of rules adopted by Uefa, the Union of European
Football Associations, which try to ban live televised games between noon
and 4pm at weekends in order to protect attendances.
Because of opposition by the Scottish Football Association, the Football
League has been insisting that either the semi-finals are not shown in
Scotland or the kick-off is delayed until 4pm. Broadcasters have decided not
to challenge the Football League on this Sunday's semi-final between
Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday when the kick-off will be delayed
to 4pm.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Minister reveals dam aid evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further circumstantial evidence that the government may have breached its
own guidelines on aid provision was disclosed last night when a minister
said that Malaysia had been promised aid shortly after an earlier
arms-for-aid offer had been rescinded.
Two weeks ago the Foreign Office revealed that Lord Younger, the then
defence secretary, had written to the Malaysian government in June 1988,
pointing out that the sale of Pounds 1bn of British arms could not be
formally linked to the Pounds 234m of UK aid to help build a dam on the
Pergau river, as such a link would have been a breach of guidelines.
The Foreign Office said that Lord Younger had sent the letter because he had
signed a protocol in March of that year which wrongly linked the arms sales
to the provision of aid.
However, in a parliamentary written answer yesterday to Mr Alan Williams,
Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, a Foreign Office minister,
confirmed that there was 'further correspondence reiterating promises of
civil aid' between the two governments following Lord Younger's letter.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Lib Dems may suspend council race row group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat group in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, the
only big urban council controlled by the party, has been threatened with
suspension unless it accepts the findings of an inquiry into alleged racism.
The threat follows a confidential intervention in the party's disciplinary
proceedings by Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president.
Mr Kennedy wrote to the party's London region in January protesting at a
decision to reprieve two Tower Hamlets members recommended for expulsion by
an inquiry into the publication of racist leaflets in the borough.
The inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat QC, concluded that
three Tower Hamlets activists produced racist leaflets during a council
by-election won by the British National Party.
One of the three members resigned voluntarily.
The London region's decision to accept apologies from the remaining two
members angered many of the party's MPs. It was described as a whitewash by
the Conservatives and Labour.
Mr Kennedy said yesterday that he told the London region executive that the
reprieve was 'damaging' the national party, and urged it to uphold Lord
Lester's recommendations.
After discussing Mr Kennedy's letter, the regional executive asked Ms
Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of Tower Hamlets local party, to sign a statement
accepting the Lester inquiry's conclusions, and withdrawing activists'
criticisms.
Ms Deakins was told that the Tower Hamlets group would be suspended unless
the signed statement was received by Sunday. She was not available for
comment last night.
The suspension of the Tower Hamlets group would be a victory for Liberal
Democrat anti-racism campaigners such as Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark
and Bermondsey.
The suspension would mean that Liberal Democrat councillors would remain
members of the party, but activities such as candidate selection would be
carried out by the London region.

who has been pressing the party to stop shadowing the Conservatives and
offer instead an ambitious strategy for economic revival and full
employment.
Mr Gould's departure in September will not be mourned by those who believe
that winning the next general election depends on stifling internal dissent.
He is a rebel. His antipathy to Europe is difficult to grasp. But Mr Gould
is a thinker in a party with many more placemen and women than intellectuals
on its front bench.
The modernisers, too, are frustrated. Though scornful of Mr Gould's economic
expansionism, they share the anaylsis that now the party has dumped much of
its ideological baggage, Labour must turn its mind to filling the vacuum.
They, like Mr Gould, are not making much headway. The safety-first approach
is going down well with the voters. Bank managers are back in fashion.
The lesson of the last parliament was that we should pay little heed to the
headline voting-intention figures provided by the opinion pollsters.
Too many of those ready to say they intended to vote Labour changed their
mind when they checked their wallets in the privacy of the polling booth.
The important - and overlooked - indicators were to be found in the fine
print of the polls. The voters did not trust Labour on the economy. In
England's south and south-east, they worried that tax increases would hit
the aspiring working classes.
They felt uncomfortable with the idea of Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour
leader, in 10 Downing Street. The unions would wield too much clout. As one
Conservative strategist puts it: 'We were able to persuade them that things
were never so bad that they couldn't be worse.'
But as Mr John Major's government lurches from crisis to crisis those
concerns have begun to disappear. Labour is rebuilding the image of
respectability that it has craved since Mr Kinnock pulled it back from the
abyss in 1983.
Gallup's latest poll in the Daily Telegraph newspaper told the story. The
interesting point was not that Labour had retained its 20-point lead. It was
that the voters no longer feared the prospect of a Labour government.
Four-fifths thought the opposition had become more moderate. Nearly half
thought it would do a better job of running the economy. Two-thirds thought
Mr Smith looked like a prime minister. Three-quarters said they would
welcome - or would have nothing to fear from - a Labour government.
The conclusions drawn by most in the shadow cabinet are obvious enough.
With or without Mr Major, the Conservatives are bent on self-destruction.
Tax increases have deprived them of their strongest electoral card. Their
reputation for financial and moral probity is tarnished. The party is locked
in mortal combat over its ideological direction. After 15 years in office,
the argument runs, the corrosion is too deep to expect the political
recovery which traditionally follows an economic upturn.
Amid the present disarray it all sounds plausible enough. Even some of the
modernisers believe it might be true. But the operative word is might. For
Labour to look forward with any certainty to government it has to stand for
something - as it did in 1964 and in 1945.
It is often said in defence of inaction that the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher
offered only the thinnest outline of her programme when she published The
Right Approach before the 1979 general election. The parallel is misleading.
For all the absence of detail Mrs Thatcher left no one in any doubt about
where she was heading.
Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown have grasped the point. Mr Blair wants to
reposition Labour as the friend of individual opportunity as well as of
community. It should seek to enable not direct. Government should be cast in
the role of partner not master, Labour should be on the side of the
achievers as well as of the disadvantaged.
Mr Brown is expected to take up the same theme in a series of speeches. His
aim will be to emphasise that the debate over tax and spending cannot be
divorced from the nation's overall economic performance. The market economy
is taken for granted. Labour will promise to get more out of it.
But the shadow cabinet's beautiful people - as they are dubbed by scornful
colleagues - are in a small minority. The mood of the moment in the Labour
party favours sitting and waiting. Maybe that will be enough.
It will, though, beg the obvious question: what on earth would Labour
actually do in government beyond providing a breathing space for the
Conservatives to prepare for their return?

FT  10 FEB 94 / Adverts fall closes engineer magazine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering, a magazine for 'innovators in technology, manufacturing and
management', which was founded in 1866, is closing.
The Design Council, which owns and publishes the magazine, announced
yesterday that the February issue would be the last because of continuing
losses.
The controlled circulation publication, which had an ABC circulation of
23,000 in 1992, was sent mainly to those involved in engineering design and
senior management in relatively smaller companies. It is a sector hit hard
by the recession and the magazine has found it difficult to win enough
advertising to survive.
Mr Anthony Land, publishing director of the Design Council said yesterday:
'I think we have done pretty well in all the circumstances but nevertheless
not well enough.'
In its December editorial the magazine bewailed the position of engineering
in UK society compared with European rivals. It said: 'Until engineering is
seen as both crucial to our economy and indeed spiritually enlightening we
will stay a second rate industrial nation.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Smith to accept some Tory NHS reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to retain decentralised management in the National Health Service
while abandoning some of the more explicitly market-based aspects of the
existing structure will be published by the Labour Party today.
A health policy document to be launched by Mr John Smith, the party leader,
will show that Labour does not intend to return to the system of centralised
decision-making that characterised the NHS before the government's 1991
reforms.
Labour will consult widely on its document over the coming year before
completing its health policy for the next election.
The party is taking a firm stand on some issues from the outset - notably a
determination to abolish GP fundholding, under which some family doctors
purchase hospital care for individual patients. The document will emphasise
that Labour is satisfied that fundholding has contributed to the development
of a two-tier health service and should be abolished. It will propose that
all GPs should instead be involved in joint commissioning arrangements with
health authorities.
Labour's document accepts the principle of the purchaser-provider split on
which the government's reforms are founded.
A Labour government would seek to operate it in a planned and co-ordinated
way, rather than with what the party sees as the commercialised and
competitive flavour of the government's internal market.
One of the most topical issues in the document concerns public
accountability in the running of hospitals and health authorities.
There is growing debate in the NHS over whether the current system of
appointing members to health authorities gives their decisions sufficient
legitimacy.
Labour intends to test public opinion on three options - retaining
nomination, direct election or integration of health purchasing with local
government. The document will stress that Labour's current view is that
nomination should be abandoned in favour of a more democratic structure.
Some of the most controversial aspects of the document are likely to concern
a future Labour government's relationships with private healthcare.
It proposes the eventual phasing out of private treatment in NHS hospital
pay beds, and restrictions on the amount of private work that NHS doctors
could carry out.
The document will not commit a future Labour government to any particular
levels of spending on the NHS.
But statements that Britain spends less on health than many other European
countries - for every Pounds 3 spent in Britain on health care, it says,
France, Germany and the Netherlands spend Pounds 5 - are likely to raise
public expectations.

Up to 500 jobs are to be axed at the Schlumberger Industries gas meter

The company blamed the job losses on a fall in orders from British Gas, the

FT  10 FEB 94 / Gould to quit politics for academia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould, a leading Labour party figure of the past decade, yesterday
announced that he was quitting politics to return to his native New Zealand
to take up an academic post.
Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs claimed that Mr Gould's decision to
become vice-chancellor at the University of Waikato was a blow to Labour's
fortunes and a sign that the party did not have credible policies.
There were mixed reactions in the Labour party. Mr John Prescott, shadow
employment secretary, said Mr Gould's decision reflected 'bad political
judgment and a certain tinge of bitterness' at having been defeated by Mr
John Smith in the party's leadership battle two years ago.
Mr Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, said that Mr Gould's decision was
a 'disaster' for the Labour party. He added: 'His talents have been ignored
and sidelined. We need every bit of talent like Bryan's we can get.'
Mr Gould will resign his seat in Dagenham from September 1. He had a
majority of 6,773 at the last general election.
Mr Gould, Labour's campaign co-ordinator at the 1987 general election, did
not lose the opportunity to attack Mr John Smith's leadership - especially
its 'espousal of monetarist policies' and its emphasis on 'prudence rather
than radical reform'.
He said: 'While I very much welcome the prospect of a Labour government it
is, I fear, unlikely to be a government which I could serve in or support
with a great deal of enthusiasm.
'The two major parties have now moved so much back into the centre that
there is very little ideological difference between them.'
After his defeat in the 1992 leadership election Mr Gould quit the shadow
cabinet, attacking the party's pro-European policy and urging it to adopt
policies geared to job creation.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said Mr Gould's decision to
quit was 'an admission that Labour cannot win and does not deserve to win'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'It is a sad day when Bryan
Gould believes the modern Labour party cannot provide such an original mind
with neither home nor future.'
Mr Smith praised Mr Gould's 'distinguished contribution' to Labour politics,
and wished him every success.

FT  10 FEB 94 / 'Grossly distorted allegations': Text of a speech by civil
service boss Sir Robin Butler, attacking media reports of the Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I would like to make a brief statement to the inquiry as head of the home
civil service.
I have consulted Sir David Gillmore, head of the diplomatic service, who
wants to associate himself with my remarks.
In accordance with the inquiry's wishes, I have given the inquiry an advance
copy of this statement.
In the course of the inquiry, officials from the home civil service and
diplomatic service have provided you with a vast amount of evidence and
testimony, both written and oral, on the matters under investigation.
Of those who have provided either written or oral testimony, or both, many
if not most have moved on to new posts and responsibilities since their
involvement in the matters now under investigation, and their co-operation
with the inquiry has been a major additional burden for them to carry
alongside their other duties.
I should like to record here my gratitude and admiration for the way in
which the civil service has met this task.
I also draw attention to the meticulous way in which records have been kept
and preserved: without a clear audit trail, this inquiry would have had no
prospect of reaching the truth.
The task of assisting the inquiry has been made more fraught and onerous by
grossly distorted and prejudicial allegations in the media about the role of
government and individuals, including civil servants, in these matters.
While I make no criticism or complaint about the inquiry's procedures, the
absence of the restraints on comment about the course of proceedings which
would apply if this was a court of law has permitted wild allegations and
pre-judging of issues in media reports.
I take just two examples about the subject matter of the inquiry that has
become known as the arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
One is the constant references, which have become common currency, to 'arms
sales to Iraq'. There were in fact no licences for the export of arms, that
is lethal goods, issued by the British government in this period.
The second is the references to public interest immunity certificates as
'gagging orders'.
As the inquiry is well aware, the effect of such certificates is no more
than to put in the hands of the court the decision whether the information
covered by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence.
As regards comments on individuals I can use my own case as an example
(though others have fared much worse).
Even before I have given evidence to the inquiry, there have been comments
and scrap-book items like 'The Butler did it', 'Cabinet chief linked to
Iraqi gun cover-up' and 'The trail of blood running through Whitehall in the
wake of the arms-to-Iraq affair leads to the door of the Cabinet secretary'.
These are only examples of the general tone of coverage. While I hope and
believe that people do not give this sort of report more weight than it
deserves, such prejudicial press comment has been distressing for
individuals concerned, and for their families, colleagues and close friends.
The victims are often middle-ranking officials who could not have expected
to be thrust into the limelight in the way in which they have.
The civil servants concerned have been asked not to respond to the press and
to leave the issues to be judged by the inquiry.
I would like here to thank them and their families publicly and most
sincerely for their co-operation and forbearance in this respect.
I repeat that I neither make or imply any criticisms of the procedures of
this inquiry but I register my concern and my confidence, on behalf of the
civil servants involved, that the inquiry will in due course put the record
straight and undo, so far as in its power, the damage which has been
unfairly done to our system of government, to the reputation of the civil
service and to individuals.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Germans rule out Swan Hunter bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of German shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan, which had expressed interest
in the troubled Swan Hunter shipyard, has decided not to bid, it emerged
yesterday. The decision came after the company failed to find a partner for
the venture.
GEC, which is also believed to be a potential bidder for the shipyard,
declined yesterday to reveal its intentions. The prospect of Swan Hunter,
which has been in receivership since May, being sold as a shipbuilder now
depend increasingly on whether the UK government is willing to assist a
sale.
The only company to confirm that it wishes to place a bid, French
shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, has suggested that the
government-funded Tyne and Wear Development Corporation buy Swan Hunter's
main Tyneside sites and then lease the facilities to CMN.
Such a deal would anger rival UK warship yards, which have already attacked
the recent European Union decision, to grant Swan Hunter limited eligibility
for intervention funding subsidy.
Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of UK subsidiary CMN Support Services, said the
idea of CMN leasing the shipbuilder's facilities from the development
corporation was not a form of government aid because CMN would pay the
market rent for the land.
It was not out of the question that CMN might buy Swan Hunter's site, he
said, but the more capital investment that was required, the more CMN needed
to be confident of workload in the near future.
'We most certainly require a number of assurances and guarantees from the
government on a whole host of matters,' said Mr Henderson. These included
whether a CMN-owned Swan Hunter would be competing on an even basis for
export work.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Tolls will be steep on the high road to Skye: Islanders are
angry at the prospect of paying Pounds 5 a car to use the new bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bridge which some people say will take the magic out of going over the
sea to Skye is becoming a reality. Against a backdrop of snow-topped
mountains, the two stubby concrete towers which will support the main part
of the Skye bridge are almost complete.
All day a landing craft shuttles back and forth through the icy winds across
the Kyle of Lochalsh, ferrying concrete mixers to pour their load into the
structures taking shape on the mainland side. Though the bridge is several
months behind its contractors' original schedule, it is still expected to
open as planned in August next year.
It is a project which arouses mixed emotions. Most of the 9,000 people on
Skye welcome the greater convenience the bridge will offer in travelling to
the mainland compared with the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service, which
will cease.
But they are angry that they will have to pay tolls on the bridge for about
15 years, beginning at the same rate as those of the ferry and rising with
inflation. With present tariffs that would work out at Pounds 5 per car in
summer and Pounds 4 in winter, probably the highest tolls in Britain.
Regular users would have discounts.
There is also lingering resentment at the way the Scottish Office ignored
local objections to paying tolls in deciding that Skye should have the first
privately financed bridge in Scotland. It will be only the second in
Britain, after the Dartford bridge on the Thames which opened in 1991. The
privately financed second Severn Bridge is due to open in 1996.
The contractors see the project as a potentially profitable scheme that will
produce an elegant bridge. In the words of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a
Scottish Office minister, it will 'skip lightly over the islands'. As well
as the 500-metre main bridge between Skye and the island of Eilean Ban - the
last home of the writer Gavin Maxwell - there will be a 196m secondary
bridge between Eilean Ban and the mainland.
The contractors are a joint venture between Miller Construction, a privately
owned Edinburgh company, and Dykerhoff &amp; Widman, usually known as Dywidag.
The designer is Dywidag, which specialises in this type of construction -
the Skye bridge is a pre-stressed, post-tensioned concrete box girder
bridge.
The two companies are also involved in Skye Bridge, a consortium formed with
Bank of America which is raising Pounds 17m to pay for the bridge. It will
recoup the construction cost from tolls and then hand the bridge over to the
Scottish Office. The government is paying Pounds 6m for connecting roads.
'The main problem we face is one of logistics,' says Mr John Henderson,
senior project manager. 'The weather here can change drastically in minutes.
Then there are strong tides and currents.'
Miller Dywidag hit serious delays last year in bedding the two concrete
caissons which form the base of the towers into the rocky seabed. But that
problem was overcome and over the next few months the main bridge will
extend outwards step by step from the two towers as successive concrete
segments are cast.
The project finds little favour with Mrs Kathleen MacRae who lives a few
miles into Skye at Breakish and is secretary of the Skye Bridge Appeal
Group, a grouping of the bridge's critics. 'All the time we agitated for a
bridge it was assumed that it would be a part of the road system. We were
horrified when we were told we would have to pay tolls if we wanted the
bridge in less than 20 years.'
She fears that the demise of the five-minute ferry trip will make Skye less
attractive to tourists, so that bridge traffic will grow slowly and the
tolls will operate for more than the expected 15 years. Nevertheless at peak
times queues for the ferry can be an hour or two long.
Mr Bob Wilson, a director of Miller Civil Engineering, says: 'I can't see
how the bridge won't improve the island's economy. What people forget is
that if there were no bridge there would always be tolls on the ferries.
With a bridge the tolls will come to an end.'
Mrs MacRae says: 'There will always be tolls, even when the Scottish Office
takes over. Can you name a single bridge in Britain where tolls have come to
an end?'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Lossmakers accuse Lloyd's council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lossmaking Names who oppose the insurance market's Pounds 900m out-of-court
settlement offer have alleged that members' of the Lloyd's council - or
governing body - stand to benefit from the deal.
The Names - individuals whose assets support the market - said that a number
of members of the council have a higher than average involvement as Names on
syndicates underwriting errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance. Their
liabilities will in effect be capped if the deal is accepted next week.
Errors and omissions insurers, who cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards
for negligence, are understood to be contributing about Pounds 400m to the
Pounds 900m offer. The offer document issued to Names indicated that their
actual exposure to claims was between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. Mr
Michael Freeman, a solicitor representing loss-making Names, said council
members should 'disclose their interest in E&amp;O syndicates when recommending
Names to accept the Lloyd's settlement offer which has such substantial
benefits for E&amp;O insurers'.
Mr Freeman added: 'This is especially the case where the external members of
the council have written to all Names urging them to accept the offer
without mentioning this plain conflict of interest.'
Lloyd's said yesterday that errors and omissions cover was written widely
across the market and that there were hundreds of reinsurers both in Lloyd's
and outside it. 'It is therefore impossible to assess the final impact on
any one Name from a claim being made,' Lloyd's said.
'Lloyd's finds it very disturbing that, at a time when many members are
faced with a serious financial decision affecting their membership, they
should also be confronted with a flood of disinformation and scare stories.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Evidence of aid disclosed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further circumstantial evidence that the government may have breached its
own guidelines on aid provision was disclosed last night when a minister
said that Malaysia had been promised aid shortly after an earlier
arms-for-aid offer had been rescinded.
Two weeks ago, the Foreign Office revealed that Lord Younger, the then
defence secretary, had written to the Malaysian government in June 1988,
pointing out that the sale of Pounds 1bn of British arms could not be
formally linked to the Pounds 234m of UK aid to help build a dam on the
Pergau river, as such a link would have been a breach of guidelines.
The Foreign Office said that Lord Younger had sent the letter because he had
signed a protocol in March of that year which wrongly linked the arms sales
to the provision of aid.
However, in a parliamentary written answer yesterday to Mr Alan Williams,
Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, a Foreign Office minister,
confirmed that there was 'further correspondence reiterating promises of
civil aid' between the two governments following Lord Younger's letter.
Mr Lennox-Boyd did not elaborate on the nature of the correspondence.
Mr Williams, said he suspected that this correspondence contained further
evidence that the aid was linked to the Pounds 1bn arms deal.

A former Conservative defence minister yesterday added his voice to
criticism of the government's plans to give itself greater powers to repeal
legislation.
Speaking in the Commons a day after the de-regulation bill gained its second
reading, Sir Michael Neubert, MP for Romford, delivered a strong warning
about the possible consequences of allowing ministers to take too much power
in their drive to cut red tape.
Sir Michael asked MPs: 'Isn't it less than satisfactory that the only
safeguard against ministerial misjudgment in the exercise of delegated
powers of de-regulation is the consideration of 90 minutes for statutory
instruments which are unamendable by this House?'
He also expressed concern that representations made during the period of
consultation promised before changes were made might be ignored.
Replying for the government, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister,
said that the public would benefit from the removal of 'antique, medieval
restrictions which have no place in the modern age'.
The bill - which was passed with a government majority of 37 - would allow
ministers to repeal primary legislation by statutory order.
A number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the government when
the bill reached committee stage.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Insurers fear stress claims will increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers met yesterday to discuss potential claims from employees suffering
from occupational stress, amid increasing concern about industrial diseases
and their impact on employers' liability business.
'Everybody is conscious that they have been taken unaware in the past by
conditions such as repetitive strain injury (RSI),' said Mr Tony Baker, head
of public relations at the Association of British Insurers, whose annual
seminar on employers' liability issues yesterday focused on stress.
'Insurers are not bracing themselves for extensive claims,' Mr Baker added,
but 'the industry has to be ahead of the game. It needs to look to the
future rather than waiting for things to happen.'
Recent interest has been triggered by a Pounds 10,000 out-of-court
settlement late last year to a manager of a leisure company who suffered a
nervous breakdown. Mr Fraser Whitehead, of Russell Jones &amp; Walker, the
solicitors which specialise in personal-injury work, said his firm was
investigating six other potential claims.
'There is no doubt at all that there will be more claims,' said Mr
Whitehead, who said middle managers, especially in businesses becoming
subject to pressures after privatisation, were particularly susceptible.
Mr David Rogers, of Davies Arnold Cooper, which represents insurers, told
the ABI seminar that employers were entitled to impose some stress on
employees. But if employers learn that by exposing an employee to increases
in stress they are increasing the risk of stress-induced injury, then
employers must adjust their conduct.
Employers' liability insurers outside the Lloyd's market paid Pounds 583m in
claims in 1991, about half of which stemmed from disease claims rather than
accidents.
Most claims have been lodged by blue-collar workers suffering from various
work-related lung diseases or deafness. But more recently insurers have paid
claims following court awards or out-of-court settlements to white-collar
workers such as typists suffering RSI.
An Inland Revenue typist was awarded more than Pounds 70,000 in an RSI
out-of-court settlement last month. Employers' liability premiums for
companies mainly employing office or other white-collar workers have risen
sharply as a result.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Threat to sales of Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to a quarter of the sales of the world's best-selling drug, Zantac, made
by Glaxo of the UK, could be at risk in the wake of a statement made by the
US National Institutes of Health yesterday.
The NIH said in a statement following a three-day medical conference that
all peptic ulcer sufferers should take antibiotics with their patent ulcer
treatments. The latter include Zantac, sales of which are worth Dollars
3.5bn a year worldwide, Losec (Dollars 1.6bn) from Astra of Sweden, and
Tagamet (Dollars 1bn) from the Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham.
An antibiotic should help combat the bacterium Helicobacter pylori which now
appears linked to ulcers, offering, 'an opportunity to cure a disease that
before we could only treat and suppress'.
According to pharmaceuticals analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers up to a
quarter of Zantac sales are 'maintenance therapy', designed to prevent
relapse.
Reuter adds: A study, partially paid for by Glaxo and to be published in the
New England Journal of Medicine today, found Zantac very effective in
reducing the risk of recurrence of bleeding ulcers.

<TEXT>
Last month's Los Angeles earthquake caused between Dollars 13bn and Dollars
20bn (Pounds 8.7bn-Pounds 13.4bn) in damage, California officials said,
making it the second most expensive natural disaster in US history, Reuter
reports from Sacramento.
State officials also announced on Tuesday that the cost of the earthquake to
federal, state and local taxpayers will be about Dollars 11.6bn.
The damage estimate is the most detailed since the 6.8 magnitude quake
rocked Los Angeles, killing 60 people, injuring 8,500 and destroying many
homes and freeways.
In the days after the quake, state officials had released a rough estimate
of Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn in damage. They said preliminary estimate
was based on earthquake models and actual damage was not quite as bad as had
originally expected.
However, Mr Dick Andrews, director of the California Office of Emergency
Services, said the latest estimate could be revised upwards again if there
was damage to sewer and water systems which had not been detected.
The federal government's share of the costs was put at Dollars 9.5bn, the
state's at Dollars 1.9bn and local government at Dollars 135m. President
Bill Clinton has already asked Congress for Dollars 9.5bn in federal
disaster relief funds.
The total cost to taxpayers includes Dollars 1.45bn to rebuild highways,
Dollars 4.2bn in clean-up costs and Dollars 1bn in disaster relief payments.
Mr Andrews estimated that private insurance would cover about Dollars 2.5bn
of the overall loss.
The most costly US natural disaster was Hurricane Andrew, which caused
Dollars 30bn in losses in southern Florida and Louisiana in 1992.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Peasant farmers take over four Chiapas towns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TEOPISCA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican peasant farmers have taken over at least four towns in the southern
state of Chiapas, protesting against official corruption and the poverty in
which they live.
The farmers, mainly from collective farms, are not connected with the
Zapatista rebels that violently seized several towns in the state on New
Year's Day. But they have clearly been inspired by the Zapatistas, and sense
the government's sudden vulnerability to peasant protests.
The peasants took over the towns of Huehuetan, Tuzantan, Teopisca, and
Mapastepec in the past few days. In several other parts of the state unrest
was building, with peasants occupying land and threatening to seize town
halls.
In the town of Teopisca, about 30km from the city of San Cristobal de las
Casas, about 1,500 peasants from a collective farm peacefully took over the
town hall on Monday, blocked incoming roads, and demanded the resignation of
the mayor and free elections to elect a board of leaders.
The farmers complained about lack of schools, drainage, and running water.
They alleged the town mayor, Mr Hector Alvarez Gordillo, had taken money
from the town budget, that he failed as promised to give out food and
medicine, and repair a dirt road.
Yesterday morning the peasants remained in control of the town hall, but
opened the road, which is the main route to Guatemala. Farmers in Teopisca
chanted 'The peasants have awoken - the Zapatistas have opened our eyes' as
they walked around the town's central square. While they said they opposed
the Zapatistas' call to arms, they approved of their goals, and used almost
identical language to the guerrillas when complaining about Mexico's
political system.
Until this week Teopisca had been a model of tranquility. It had always
supported the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, giving it 100 per
cent of the vote in the mayoral elections two years ago. The last
significant protest against the governing party was in 1985, and that was
over the selection of the PRI candidate for mayor.
'We were fed up with the burden of injustice,' said Mr Braulio Gutierrez
Lopez, one of the farmers' leaders. 'Things are now going to change because
we have woken up to our suffering.'
Mr Alvarez Gordillo, who took refuge in his large house in the main square,
dismissed the farmers as supporters of the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution. But while some of the peasants, including Mr Gutierrez, are from
the PRD, most said they had always voted for the PRI.
As farmers explained their decision to take over the town hall, it seemed as
if the Zapatista movement had removed the fear that prevented such protests
before. Police beat up demonstrators in 1985, but this time the hands of the
government are tied. Such a crackdown would seriously put back the prospects
for a peaceful settlement in Chiapas.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Clinton in new drugs push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday promised a new approach to crime and drugs
'that is both tough and smart,' with an increased budget and more attention
to treatment for drug addicts.
In a speech to inmates at a Maryland prison, Mr Clinton said his
administration's anti-drug budget would rise by Dollars 1bn next year to
Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 8.8bn), with most of the increase for prevention and
treatment, where spending would be boosted by 18 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn.
'No nation can fight crime and drugs without dealing honestly and
forthrightly with the problem of drug addiction,' Mr Clinton said, promising
to put 140,000 more hard core drug users into treatment next year.
'Drug treatment reduces criminality, it's just that simple,' added
Vice-president Al Gore.
The administration plans to increase spending on international drug
programmes such as promoting alternative crops, but will cut the money spent
on anti-drug patrols.
'The best long term approach to reducing the flow of drugs across our
borders is to reduce the demand for drugs within our borders,' the
administration's budget says.
The new strategy outlined by Mr Clinton yesterday conforms to his
administration's earlier promise to strike a more even balance between law
enforcement and treatment.
Last year, however, that promise was criticised as hollow because it was not
backed up by budget resources.
Mr Lee Brown, the White House drug policy director, said that the new
strategy was 'backed by the funds required to put it into action.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Senate foreign relations committee yesterday approved by 17 votes to one
the nomination of Mr Strobe Talbott to be the new US deputy secretary of
state.
The sole dissenter was Senator Jesse Helms, the right wing Republican from
North Carolina, who then lost another committee vote which would have
delayed consideration by the full Senate for another two weeks.
The chamber is now expected to confirm Mr Talbott within the next 48 hours.
A handful of Republicans will vote against but he avoided one potential
minefield in his Tuesday testimony by recanting old writings that some
construed anti-Israeli.
Mr Helms challenged Mr Talbott, a former Time magazine writer, at a
confirmation hearing on Tuesday for writing in 1981 Israel had become a
liability to US security interests. Mr Talbott said his views had changed
but the essay was critical of Likud not Israel. Several national Jewish
groups and at least two Republican senators, Connie Mack of Florida and
Alfonse D'Amato of New York, have come out against the nomination.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Rich given a heavier tax burden: Reaganomics' winners are
paying for a more egalitarian system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has wiped away Reaganomics. Estimates in this week's
budget confirm that fiscal changes enacted last year will more than offset
the impact of tax cuts for the wealthy during the 1980s. The federal tax
system is now more egalitarian than in the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter
occupied the White House.
The two most important changes were the sharp increase in the marginal tax
rate on high earners - to nearly 43 per cent against 28 per cent as recently
as 1990 - and the big expansion of the earned-income tax credit (EITC), a
kind of negative income tax that provides cash rebates for about 15m
low-income working families.
In a foreword to this year's budget, Mr Clinton drew attention to 'dramatic
changes that had restored fairness to the tax code'. He emphasised once
again that 80 per cent of the burden of last year's tax increases would be
borne by the richest 1.2 per cent of families - those with annual incomes of
Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 134,000) or more. Starting this April such families
will be liable for tax increases averaging Dollars 23,500 a year,
generating, it is hoped, an extra Dollars 33bn in federal revenue.
Middle income families will face tax increases averaging a few hundred
dollars a year. Families earning Dollars 30,000 or less will enjoy tax cuts.
The independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates federal taxes
(income, payroll and excise) this year will absorb 27.7 per cent of the
incomes of the richest 20 per cent of families, compared with 27.3 per cent
in 1977 and less than 25 per cent at the height of Reaganomics in 1985.
The bottom 20 per cent will pay 5.1 per cent of their incomes in tax
compared with nearly 10 per cent in 1977. Thanks to the expansion of the
EITC, the effective subsidy received by such families will be 10 times as
large as in 1977, according to the CBO.
The tax gyrations of the past 16 years have had relatively little impact on
the bulk of middle income households. Such families did not benefit
significantly from the Reagan tax cuts, nor have they suffered much from the
Clinton tax increases.
The new top tax rate of nearly 43 per cent on high earners reflects the
combined impact of a new top income tax rate of 39.6 per cent, the phasing
out of itemised deductions and the lifting of the previous ceiling on
Medicare payroll taxes. (High earners also face state income taxes which in
some cases will push the overall marginal tax rate above 50 per cent.)
As the spike in the chart illustrates, the phasing out of the EITC subsidies
as incomes rise will impose high effective marginal rates on many low-income
families, creating potentially serious work disincentives. CBO calculations
suggest a couple with two children earning Dollars 20,000-Dollars 25,000 a
year could face a marginal tax rate of more than 49 per cent. This reflects
the combined impact of income tax, payroll taxes and the loss of 21 cents of
EITC payments for every dollar of additional earnings.
Mr Clinton accelerated, but did not initiate, the shift toward a more
progressive tax system - one that places a proportionately larger burden on
the wealthy. In the 1990 budget accord President George Bush took an
important step in raising the top tax rate from 28 per cent to 31 per cent
and placing tougher curbs on itemised deductions and personal exemptions for
wealthy families.
The shift in the tax burden from poor to rich would have been even more
pronounced but for the steadily increased reliance placed on social
insurance taxes, which are less progressive than income taxes. They will
account for about 37 per cent of federal revenue this year against 30 per
cent in 1977.
Senior officials are confident they can extract substantially more tax from
America's wealthy families. However, some independent experts, such as
Professor Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, argue the rich - who can
afford the best tax lawyers - will report less taxable income, take more
leisure and find other legal ways of avoiding the higher taxes.
If this happens, the progressivity of the tax system could fall short of the
theoretical calculations - and the federal deficit will not fall as rapidly
as expected.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Brazil's Cardoso wins the fight but not the spoils: Finance
minister gets budget reform through congress but may miss run at presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's economic restructuring programme is back on its rather shaky course
after congressional approval on Tuesday night of an emergency fund to help
balance the budget. This marked a significant victory for the programme's
helmsman, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, who threatened
to resign if the fund was blocked.
But Mr Cardoso's victory may mean he has to remain in government rather than
resign to run for president later this year.
'As finance minister he won. But maybe from his personal perspective he
lost. Implementing the rest of the plan will not be easy,' said Mr Jouji
Kawasaki, vice president of Banco BMC.
The emergency fund is meant to give the government control of about Dollars
15bn (Pounds 10bn) of tax increases and spending programmes which would
otherwise be immediately due to the states or government agencies. With this
control, and other tax increases, the government will be able to claim it
has balanced a budget otherwise projected to show a deficit of Dollars
22.2bn.
Balancing the budget was the first and most important step in Mr Cardoso's
package. In the past, the government financed its mounting deficit by
issuing short-term securities at very high interest rates, thereby further
fuelling inflation.
Mr Cardoso needed to claim a balanced budget to push ahead with the rest of
his package, which includes launching a new currency untainted by past
inflation. He also needed to show he was tackling the roots of inflation,
now running at more than 40 per cent a month, for Brazil to gain an accord
from the International Monetary Fund as part of the country's private bank
debt renegotiation.
'This was a significant and sweeping victory,' Mr Pedro Simon, the
government leader in the Senate, told reporters.
Technically speaking, the emergency fund needs two more votes before it
becomes law. Predictions are dangerous when dealing with Brazil's congress,
but finance ministry officials hope the remaining votes will be largely
symbolic.
Further, the budget is still only balanced in theory. Negotiating the fund
has already forced a number of government compromises, including a
last-minute climb down on military pay. Some analysts question whether the
already weak coalition government of President Itamar Franco can hold off
other spending demands, especially in an election year.
Nevertheless, Mr Cardoso plans to move quickly to the next stage of his
programme and launch a new index, known as the URV, which will measure
present rather than past inflation. In Brazil's highly indexed economy, the
government hopes the private sector will use this index to calculate its
price increases. Existing indices measure past inflation and therefore can
themselves be inflationary.
After the congressional vote Mr Cardoso said he may be ready to introduce
the URV at the beginning of March. He is under mounting pressure to act from
businesses who say uncertainty about the economy is leading suppliers to
increase prices above inflation.
'The pressures are enormous. Our costs increased by above 40 per cent in
January, and February is not any better,' said a director of one of the
country's main carmakers.
Even if the URV goes ahead quickly, Mr Cardoso is running out of time in
relation to the presidential election. Under Brazilian law he would have to
resign by April 2 to run for election in October. But his victory with the
fund deprived him of an excuse to quit. Further, according to his opponents,
he cannot resign before inflation starts to fall. Since he became finance
minister last year inflation has increased from 23 per cent to more than 40
per cent a month, hardly a campaigning theme tune.
A constitutional revision which is under way may review the law on ministers
resigning to contest elections. It is possible, but by no means certain,
that the April 2 deadline will be extended and allow a late challenge. But
this would also rely on an understanding, which has so far looked remote,
between the main left-of-centre parties. They would need to unite behind Mr
Cardoso and confront the present election front runner, Mr Luz Inacio Lula
da Silva of the left-wing Workers party.
But according to one finance ministry official, Mr Cardoso already appears
to have decided to wait: 'The minister is only 62 this year. He can stay and
guide in a successor and would then be ready for the next presidential
elections.'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Bentsen fends off healthcare attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration counter-attacked yesterday as it sought to
rebound from a setback to the credibility of its healthcare reform plan.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, dismissed worries that the Clinton
plan had been dealt a fatal blow by Tuesday's report from the independent
Congressional Budget Office. That suggested that, far from reducing the
federal budget deficit by Dollars 59bn over the next six years, it would
increase it by Dollars 74bn.
Mr Bentsen pointed to the study's calculation that the Clinton proposals
would lower the US's overall health spending by Dollars 30bn in the year
2000 and by Dollars 150bn in 2004, and its conclusion that the reform would
reduce the budget deficit in the long term, though not until 2004.
'The report. . . . proves we can guarantee all Americans private health
insurance coverage by the year 2000, and at the same time reduce what we
spend on health care overall,' Mr Bentsen told the Senate budget committee
yesterday.
If Congress accepts the CBO's calculations of the effect on the deficit,
however, it might compel the administration to introduce more controversial
taxes as part of its reform package. At the moment, the only significant tax
increase in the plan is a quadrupling of the cigarette tax to 99 cents a
pack.
Underlying the CBO's analysis is the conviction that the health care system
urgently needs some kind of reform.
'The inherent uncertainties of change must be weighed against the
detrimental consequences of the current system - increasing numbers of
people who lack the security of insurance coverage for healthcare and the
rapidly rising costs of that care,' the report says.
The CBO also rebuts fears that the Clinton reform would severely disrupt the
US economy, although it notes that the effects on individual businesses and
people could be large.
Although the CBO suggests the plan could reduce overall employment by
between  1/4 and 1 per cent, this would not, however, result so much from
small businesses shedding workers because they could not afford their
mandatory health insurance, as from workers retiring early because they no
longer needed a job in order to keep their health insurance.
Overall, businesses would end up paying about Dollars 90bn (Pounds 60bn)
less for health insurance in 2004 than they would if the current system
continued, the CBO said, and the Clinton reform plan would have little
appreciable effect on the US trade balance.

Venezuela's new government has decided to re-start the country's stalled
privatisation programme by offering to sell a state-owned airline,
Aeropostal, 'at the end of March,' according to the new head of
privatisation.
Mr Abdon Vivas Teran, a long-time congressman, was appointed to manage the
privatisation programme by President Rafael Caldera, who began a five-year
term in February. The previous government planned to sell the airline
several times, but lacked political support. It also wished to sell three
electric power companies and other state-owned assets.
Aeropostal, which has domestic and international routes, has serious
financial problems and needs a large capital infusion to survive.
Mr Vivas Teran said the Caldera government wanted to ensure that workers in
nationalised companies obtained a greater number of shares than in the past.
As a first step, he said potential buyers of Aeropostal would have to agree
to allow workers to purchase 20 per cent of its stock and to continue
granting existing benefits.
Venezuela initiated an ambitious privatisation plan in 1990, but sales of
important assets did not materialise after a failed coup d'etat in early
1992 plunged the nation into turmoil. The programme gained over Dollars 2bn
from the privatisation of a telecommunications company, another airline and
a variety of other companies.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Hosokawa gloomy on trade accord: Talks on reducing Tokyo's
enormous surplus are in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, leaves for Washington today
with a smaller bundle of gifts to offer the US president than he would have
liked.
The main 'offering' is an economic stimulus package, already belittled by US
officials as a 'moderate step,' which he hopes will help convince the US
that his government is doing what it can to boost domestic demand and reduce
the country's enormous trade surplus.
But barring a surprise, Mr Hosokawa will have little to persuade President
Bill Clinton and his team of trade negotiators that their calls for tangible
results in improving access to Japanese markets have at last been heeded.
Mr Hosokawa was pessimistic that the talks - which were continuing in
Washington - could be brought to a successful conclusion before his meeting
with President Clinton.
'Everything has come to an impasse,' Mr Hosokawa told reporters.
Meanwhile, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, yesterday left for
Washington in an effort to save the talks.
The difficulty the US and Japan have in reaching a satisfactory trade
agreement lies more in the method than in the goal. Both are broadly agreed
that Japan needs to stimulate domestic demand, improve access to its markets
and bring down its trade surplus and that the US needs to reduce its fiscal
deficit, promote saving and strengthen international competitiveness.
The problem is, while US negotiators insist on setting clear quantitative
indicators of progress to ensure that Japan keeps its part of the deal,
Japanese bureaucrats, politicians and businessmen alike insist that such
targets are unacceptable because they lead to managed trade.
'The US should understand that putting up a certain quantitative goal and
trying to achieve it . . . isn't something that can happen in the real
business world,' Mr Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to the US said
recently.
But there is more to the Japanese resistance to numerical targets than a
dislike of managed trade. Indeed Japan has never had much difficulty with
the idea of managing trade and has long been something of a model of a
managed economy. However, they feel there are too many problems with
managing trade right now.
For one thing, it goes against the popular call to deregulate the economy.
The Hosokawa government's expressed intention to reduce bureaucratic red
tape and allow free market forces to play a bigger part in Japanese economic
life has gone over well with the public. A government which has hung on to
power largely on the strength of its public popularity would hardly be
helping itself by bowing to US pressure for goals which would require
bureaucratic meddling with market forces.
In areas such as government procurement where the government can take steps
without interfering in private business, some progress has reportedly been
made, while there has been no progress in cars and car parts, which are
completely in the private sector.
There is also concern about what would happen if such targets were agreed
and could not be met. Past experience has proved a bitter lesson for the
Japanese: neither the semiconductor agreement and the announcement by
Japanese car makers of their procurement plans for foreign car parts were
intended as government commitments but have been treated as such by the US.
But just as important as these concerns is a changing public perception of
Japan's status in the world order. The country has frequently been
criticised for lacking leadership on the world stage comparable to its
economic might.
There is a growing urge, not just among bureaucrats, but among younger
politicians and the general public as well, to be seen to play a more
responsible role. And to do so, Japan cannot constantly bow to foreign
pressure but must take its fate into its own hands.
'Japan is ready to carry out its reforms out of its own initiative, and not
because of foreign pressure and particularly not because of US pressure,'
said an official. It was important to resist US pressure for targets now to
ensure that this point was understood.
'The next summit will be the opening of a new relationship between the two
countries on an equal footing,' he said.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Little progress in market access discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hosokawa and President Clinton meet will tomorrow announce the results of
talks on four priority market sectors where the US would like to see
improved foreign access. These are:
Cars and car parts. The US claims that Japan's markets for cars and car
parts are 'relatively closed' to foreign products. Japan imports only 3 per
cent of its cars and 2 per cent of its car parts. Other OECD countries
import between 22 and 78 per cent of their cars and 16 to 60 per cent of
parts. In addition to improving access to these markets, the US wants
qualitative and quantitative indicators to monitor progress.
Japanese officials say to measure such progress they would accept the
monitoring of past data, such as the number of Japanese dealers selling
foreign cars or the number of US car makers selling right-hand drive cars in
Japan. However, they are adamantly opposed to setting market share targets
or parts procurement plans.
The main reason US car makers have not been successful in Japan is that they
do not make cars suited to the Japanese market. While 80 per cent of cars
sold in Japan are under 2,000cc, no US car maker sells cars in Japan in that
range. Moreover, the industry is in private hands, leaving little room for
government action.
Insurance. Japan has the world's second largest insurance market but
foreigners have been able to take only 2 per cent of the market. This
compares with foreign market share of 10 per cent to 34 per cent in other G7
countries. The US blames this on barriers such as a non-transparent
regulatory regime and procurement practices based on cross-shareholding
equity arrangements. The Japanese side says insurance should not be a trade
matter in the first place.
Telecommunications equipment procurement. The US claims that while Japan is
the second-largest telecommunications market in the world, 5 per cent
comprised imports in 1991 compared with an average 25 per cent in other G7
countries. The US, for example, imported 28 per cent of its
telecommunications needs.
Foreign companies are disadvantaged by the lack of access to procurement
information, sole sourcing practices and overly-detailed tender
specifications. The US would also like to see NTT, the privatised
telecommunications company, included among organisations that would be
subject to the government's public procurement guidelines. Japanese
officials say that NTT is a private company and cannot be told what to buy.
But there are signs of progress in this sector which is an area where the
government can act to improve matters without unduly meddling in private
business affairs. For example, the government recently announced an action
programme to simplify procedures in government procurement, to use open
tendering to the greatest extent possible and lower the threshold of
government contracts requiring public notice from SDR1m (Pounds 920,000) to
SDR800,000.
Medical equipment procurement. Agreement in this area was announced
yesterday by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown, though no details were
available.  Concerns centred on poor US penetration of the Japanese market.
In 1992, US companies sold equipment worth Y394bn (Pounds 2.4bn) to Japan,
28 per cent of a market worth Y1,428bn. US companies account for 47 per cent
of the European market.
Although there are no tariffs against American medical equipment, US
manufacturers claimed they were disadvantaged by complex Japanese
regulations and non-transparent bidding procedures. If Japan imported
medical equipment at the same rate as other developed countries, the US
could sell another Dollars 3bn a year.

Former Finance Minister Ruth Richardson criticised the move, saying the
party had capitulated for 'political expediency'.
The government had argued that minimum rates for under-20s undermined their
chances of a getting work. But critics claimed the young were being
exploited. Young workers will now be given 60 per cent of the adult minimum
wage, or NZDollars 147 (Pounds 56) a week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Papua New Guinea yesterday indicated it would allow an
Australian parliamentary delegation to assess the security situation on the
island of Bougainville and investigate claims of human rights abuses.
The island has been the centre of guerrilla warfare for the past five years,
after a revolt by local landowners over the Panguna copper mine previously
operated by CRA of Australia, a subsidiary of the RTZ mining group. The
Panguna mine is one of the world's main copper mines, and CRA began mining
copper at Bougainville in 1966.
The landowners' complaints became meshed with secessionist demands, and
clashes between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Papua New Guinea
defence forces have continued. The mine was mothballed in 1989.
Last year, an Amnesty International report said PNG troops and the BRA had
been guilty of human rights abuses, including murder, torture and rape. The
report criticised Australian government policies, and urged international
action. Access to the island has been virtually impossible.
Yesterday, during a visit to Australia, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime
minister, said he had no objection to an Australian delegation visiting the
island. 'If anyone wants to have a look it's up to them, provided the
timing's right,' he said
Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, suggested a visit could take
place within a few months, although it was unclear whether a delegation
would visit BRA-controlled areas. Relations between Australia and PNG have
been stormy over the past year, because of the Bougainville situation and
PNG's unhappiness at Australia's effort to provide more tied aid.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deng Xiaoping, China's reclusive senior leader, yesterday made a rare
appearance on state television to mark the lunar new year holiday.
It was the first time the 89-year-old Deng had surfaced publicly since
January last year when he was also shown attending an official ceremony on
the eve of Chinese new year.
Chinese TV devoted seven minutes to its coverage of Mr Deng's visit to
Shanghai where he has celebrated new year since 1988. He was shown greeting
municipal leaders and inspecting a recently-completed bridge over the
Yangtze.
Mr Deng appeared more frail than last year and required the constant help of
two of his daughters. The ageing leader's voice was not heard. Millions of
Chinese viewers could hardly have avoided the impression that his life is
slipping away, but his routine new year appearance was clearly aimed at
reassuring people he was still able to fulfil annual commitments.
Failure to show himself in Shanghai at this time would have strengthened
rumours that his health problems were terminal. He has been variously
reported to be suffering from prostate cancer, and also to have been
afflicted by a stroke.
China's leadership has been preparing for Mr Deng's death, but his departure
would leave an enormous gap at the top, ushering in a period of political
uncertainty. Since a high profile visit to southern China in early 1992, Mr
Deng has been urging speedier change, as if he realised time was running out
for him to ensure his reforms endured.
China's official Xinhua news agency reported that Mr Deng had been in
Shanghai for two months, during which time he had visited the city's new
Pudong development zone, its leading hotel, main shopping street and famous
Bund along the city's waterfront.
Mr Deng was said to have recited a poem after viewing Shanghai's
achievements: 'Watching in joy roads built today is better than reading for
scores of years,' Xinhua reported.
Mr Chen Yun, another of China's aged leaders, was also shown on television
welcoming the new year. Mr Chen, an economic conservative, has often been
portrayed as a leading opponent of Mr Deng's 'growth-at-all-costs' strategy.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Tokyo lays groundwork for US talks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's draft budget for 1994, published today, is expected to rein in
current spending but increase allocations for public works projects. Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will discuss the budget with
US president Bill Clinton tomorrow in Washington along with Japan's
Y15,250bn (Pounds 91bn) economic pump-priming package.
Japanese businesses have given the stimulus package, announced on Tuesday, a
good reception. But the fact that Mr Hosokawa was obliged to tone down plans
for a permanent income tax cut, to reconcile a government split on tax
reform, disappointed the financial markets, contributing to a 2 per cent
decline in Tokyo share prices yesterday.
The government's official economic forecaster yesterday predicted that Mr
Hosokawa's pump priming measures will deliver a sharp recovery this year.
However, this scenario drew widespread scepticism.
The Economic Planning Agency believes gross national product would grow by
2.6 per cent in the fiscal year to March 1995, a figure it admits is more of
a target than than an exact prediction. Yesterday, the agency belatedly
slashed its GNP growth forecast for the current year to the end of March,
from 3.3 per cent to 0.2 per cent.
Even Mr Hosokawa appeared sceptical at the scale of the upturn predicted by
the EPA, pointing out that there is a gap between the government and private
economic forecasts. The consensus among private sector economists in Tokyo
is for a fraction of a percentage point slight decline in GNP this fiscal
year, turning to a rise of around 1 per cent next year.
The EPA's target is based on a 2.4 per cent rise in domestic consumption and
a 5.2 per cent rise in private sector investment on homes in the year to
March 1995. Private sector forecasts had taken into account the Y5,850bn tax
cut in the package, but not the remaining Y9,400bn in public works spending,
cheap home and business loans and grants, explained an EPA official.
However, the EPA forecasts slow growth in industrial investment in plant and
equipment, up 0.1 per cent next year, from an estimated 7.2 per cent decline
in the current 12 months. Gloom on the industrial outlook was reinforced
yesterday by a 25.1 per cent decline in machine tool orders to a 10-year low
in 1993, reported by the Japan machine tool builders' association.
By contrast, evidence of a continued improvement in one consumer sector
emerged with a 57.5 per cent increase in sales of condominiums in Tokyo last
month, according to the real estate economy institute. That represents the
13th monthly rise running, helped by low home loan interest rates and a
continued fall in property prices.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Inkatha to miss deadline for all-race election

<TEXT>
The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party last night appeared to have chosen the
path of resistance to April's all-race elections, after talks between
right-wing groups, the African National Congress and the government ended in
failure.
Inkatha officials said the party would almost certainly allow Saturday's
deadline for the registration of political parties to pass, meaning they
could not legally contest the poll, unless the country's Electoral Act is
changed to extend the deadline, a possibility being considered by the
government.
But the white right wing indicated it was prepared to continue talking, and
might register provisionally, to keep its negotiating options open. This
raises the prospect of a split in the conservative Freedom Alliance, which
groups Inkatha with the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) and
the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, over the issue of electoral
participation.
South African business leaders will today travel to the KwaZulu capital
Ulundi to make a final attempt to persuade Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi not to boycott the poll. But their mission appears doomed to
almost certain failure.
Chief Buthelezi has made clear he will not take part in elections unless his
constitutional demands are met; there was no sign last night that the ANC
would agree to his demand that regional autonomy should be entrenched, not
only in the 1993 'interim' constitution, but in the final constitution to be
written by a constituent assembly elected in April.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Socialists clear way to buy Awacs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Social Democratic Party yesterday lifted its objection to the
government purchase of two US Airborne Early Warning and Control System
aircraft at Y55.4bn (Pounds 344m) each.
This will double the number of Boeing-made Awacs in the Japanese airforce
and improve its ability to detect an attack. The purchase comes when North
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme has created intense public
anxiety. The proposed Awacs purchase was already part of the 1991-1995
defence programme.
The Socialists' change of heart removes a potential block to the
government's 1994 draft budget, due to be unveiled today after being delayed
for two months by the difficulties over political and tax reform.
Another big US purchase, on top of Japan Airlines' decision last week to buy
Dollars 400m-worth of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, provides Premier Morihiro
Hosokawa with some ammunition against US criticisms of his recent economic
pump-priming package, when he meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow.
The Socialist party, the biggest partner in the seven-party coalition,
opposed the Awacs purchase for pacifist reasons, but lifted its embargo on
grounds that the increase in defence spending will be curbed sharply this
year. The need to pay 'due attention to Japan-US ties' also played a part, a
Socialist official conceded.
The defence ministry has asked for a 1.95 per cent budget increase to
Y4,730bn, the smallest rise in 36 years. The finance ministry is understood
to be pushing for an even lower figure, to the Socialists' satisfaction.

FT  10 FEB 94 / GM to set up Beijing venture
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the world's largest vehicle manufacturer, is to set up a
Dollars 120m (Pounds 82m) joint venture in Beijing to assemble kits to
improve engine performance under a contract signed at the weekend.
GM's share will be 51 per cent. Its partners, the local Beijing Wan Yuan
Corporation and Economic Technology Investment Development Corporation, will
take 39 per cent and 10 per cent shares respectively.
The new plant, the Wan Yuan-GM Automotive Electronic Control Company, will
begin production later this year. Initial output will be 300,000 units
annually with a target double that within a few years. Local components will
gradually increase to about 70 per cent. Kits will be fully imported in the
start-up phase.
The new product, an electronic control system, will be made to suit a wide
range of vehicles with minor adjustment. It will help reduce emissions and
improve fuel efficiency and engine power.
GM officials are concerned at possible initial resistance of Chinese car
makers, but hope the authorities eventually will require all cars to be
equipped with performance enhancing and emission-control systems.
GM is involved in a number of joint ventures in China, including production
of a 10-seater van at the Jin Bei plant in north-east China. GM shipped
7,500 US-manufactured vehicles and more than than 1,000 Opel sedans to China
in 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin is in urgent contact with world leaders in an
apparent attempt to avert a western military strike against Bosnia's Serbs
that could cause him severe problems at home, Mr Anatoly Krasikov, Kremlin
spokesman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Krasikov said Mr Yeltsin believed 'the medicine should not be worse than
the disease'.
The comment set out the Russian leader's opposition to proposed air strikes
on Serb positions around Sarajevo.
The former Yugoslavia is one area of world politics where Russia - with
historic ties with Serbia and the Serbs - has retained at least the
semblance of the status of a world power.
Romania also spoke out yesterday against Nato strikes, and Greece said it
would not allow Nato to use air support bases on its territory. Mr Evangelos
Venizelos, Greek government spokesman, said that Athens would withdraw its
crews from Nato surveillance aircraft over Bosnia if the alliance launched
air strikes. 'Our position is clear,' Mr Venizelos said yesterday as Nato
ambassadors met in Brussels. Athens opposed military intervention anywhere
in former Yugoslavia, he added. Greece's Nato ambassador was reported to
have made this point clear at the Brussels meeting.
Romanian officials said a negotiated, political settlement was 'the only
viable solution'.
In Moscow yesterday, parliament discussed the question of sanctions against
Serbia and Montenegro, and the possible withdrawal of the 1,200 Russian
peacekeeping troops from the former Yugoslavia.
The effect of sanctions on surrounding regions was also discussed in Geneva,
where ministers from seven countries close to former Yugoslavia met
international mediators.
Officials said the mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, wanted
the regional ministers to consider reconstruction needs in and around Serbia
and Montenegro once the conflicts were settled.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Nato's jets converge with its diplomacy: About 140 fighters
and bombers await the last throw of the dice on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nato alliance has more than 140 aircraft at bases in Italy and on
aircraft carriers in the Adriatic that could be mobilised if air strikes
were sanctioned against Serb positions around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Fighter and support aircraft as well as aircraft carriers from the US,
France, the UK, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Spain, are in the region, with
some armed jets already patrolling the skies over Bosnia.
Nato aircraft in the region include US F-15s, British Tornadoes and French
Super Etendards.
Military sources say the two aircraft best suited to any such raids were the
heavily-armed, slow-flying US ground attack aircraft, the A-10, known as the
'Warthog', and the AC-130, or 'Spectre' converted cargo aircraft.
The Warthog and the Spectre would be particularly well-suited to hitting
artillery and mortars hidden in the hilly and wooded terrain around the
Bosnian capital.
'They can see targets better because they fly much slower than the high-tech
jets, which also have the disadvantage that they need to react with
split-second timing if they want to hit the spot,' said another military
source.
The A-10 does not have its wings swept back like higher-profile jets and its
two engines are clamped to the fuselage in ungainly fashion. Heavily clad in
armour to protect it from anti-aircraft fire, its top speed is just 450
miles (730km) an hour.
Its main weapon is a seven-barrel revolving Gatling gun that can fire up to
70 30mm armour-piercing rounds a second, making a sound like a an industrial
saw.
It can also carry 28 500lb (227kg) bombs or even larger laser-guided bombs,
six air-to-ground Maverick missiles and has two pods for extra 23mm guns.
Twelve A-10s are based at Aviano in northern Italy.
Two AC-130 Spectre gunships are based at the southern port of Brindisi and
the US has two more on standby, ready to send to Italy if needed.
A modified version of the C-130 turbo-prop transport plane, it is armed with
a 105mm cannon and heavy machineguns. The aircraft uses sophisticated
electronics and laser sights for accuracy in attacking troops, tanks or
other equipment.
It usually carries a crew of 14, while the A-10 has just a single pilot. In
Italy, the UK has eight Tornadoes at Giola Del Colle in the south, as well
as nine Jaguar attack aircraft.
The HMS Ark Royal is alongside in the Adriatic with six Sea Harrier
dual-role attack aircraft. The US has more than 40 attack aircraft,
including the A-10s and AC130s. It also has 12 F-16s along with air-to-air
refuelling aircraft and further attack jets on board the USS Saratoga
carrier in the Adriatic.
The French have eight Jaguars and five Mirage reconnaissance aircraft, as
well as six Super Etendard fighters based on the Clemenceau carrier.
The Netherlands and Turkey have 18 F-16s between them, based in Italy at
Villafranca and Ghedi. Spain has one Casa support aircraft at Vicenza.

FT  10 FEB 94 / US pressed over new laws on shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European shipping nations and Japan are stepping up lobbying of the US
administration over proposed legislation which could damage non-US shipping
interests.
The legislation would impose penalties on countries which subsidise their
shipbuilding and require ships serving US ports to apply US labour laws.
The Consultative Shipping Group, an informal lobbying organisation
representing 14 shipping nations, aims to increase pressure on the US
administration, Mr Roger Clarke, its chairman, said.
'We wish to warn the US that if they persist with these measures they run
the risk of endangering international shipping,' said Mr Clarke, who is also
head of shipping policy at the UK department of transport.
Concern about possible US retaliation against nations which subsidise their
shipbuilding follows the adjournment earlier last month of OECD talks aimed
at restricting shipbuilding subsidies. These talks are to resume in Paris on
March 14-18.
Failure to reach agreement could strengthen pressure for implementation of
the Gibbons Bill, at present before Congress, and the Breaux Bill, before
the Senate. Both seek to impose penalties on nations which subsidise
shipbuilding.
The second area of legislation is the Clay Bill, which would require vessels
serving US ports to employ crews according to US labour laws and pay US
labour rates, which would severely affect cruise shipping. The group is also
worried about tough environmental conditions on tankers serving US ports.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Turkey's economic crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's economic crisis deepened yesterday in the wake of last month's
devaluation, with the government forced to raise rates on official paper to
a record 125 per cent, amid continued division over economic policy.
With many bankers arguing for a further realignment of the lira, Mrs Tansu
Ciller, the prime minister, is facing signs of internal opposition with her
own True Path party (DYP), anxious that the economic problems should not
affect the party's performance in next month's municipal elections. In a
move clearly aimed at appeasing her critics, the prime minister has
appointed Mr Cemil Dogan, an old ally of President Suleyman Demirel, as a
new co-ordinating minister on the economy, and announced creation of a new
money management board.
Turkey devalued by 12 per cent last month after a two-week run on its
currency, triggered by the announcement that Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's,
the two leading credit rating agencies, were downgrading Turkish risk.
The crisis resulted in the resignation of central bank governor Bulent
Gultekin. A replacement has still to be found. Indeed, when Mrs Ciller moved
to offer the job to Mr Zekeriya Yildirim - which the markets would have
welcomed - she was forced to retract after reports that he had had
consultations with Mr Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the main opposition Motherland
party.
Yesterday's sharp increase in Treasury bill rates, which compares with 78
per cent on January 19 for one-year paper, is clearly aimed at sucking in
excess lira liquidity which overhangs the market.

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Illarionov, the prime minister's former chief economist, is the
latest in a a long line of reformers to leave the Russian government saying
it is shackled to special interests.
Speaking immediately after his resignation earlier this week, Mr Illarionov
said Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's proclaimed end to 'the age of
market romanticism' had translated into a return to pandering to
representatives of industry and agriculture - who delivered their requests
for budgetary expenditure in plain envelopes.
Mr Illarionov, recalled in particular a visit to Lenin's home town of
Ulyanovsk, where he was sent by Mr Chernomyrdin to investigate whether a
local scheme for fixing prices could be extended to the whole of the
country.
After being given much food and drink, Mr Illarionov was handed an envelope.
The officials told him it contained a 'a special letter for the prime
minister' - a request for Rbs3bn to help Aviastar, the local aviation plant.
'I tried not to take the letter at all,' he recalls, grinning at his own
naivety. 'I did not want to lobby for any interests.' But finally, he took
the letter and decided to give it to Mr Chernomyrdin 'to see what would
happen'.
'I said, 'Victor Stepanovich, I do not know what we should do. I have never
got such a letter in my life. Perhaps we should give it to the finance
ministry to see if they've got the money'. He said 'Why? Give it to me.
Let's see if they need help. When you see such requests, give them to me'.'
Ms Ella Pamfilova, who resigned as social affairs minister, said at the
weekend she believed Russia's new leaders were 'gathering power into their
hands to preserve the bureaucratic system of distribution as their main
source of income'.
Things have deteriorated sharply since the departure of the first reformist
government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, said Mr Illarionov. 'Even under Gaidar, it
was not possible to leave a government office in a drunken state. Now it
happens very often. Ask the drivers who take people home.' He would not be
drawn on whether he had seen ministers in a drunken state, saying simply
that 'people in the apparatus do the same things as their chiefs'.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, made similar allegations at
the time of his resignation last month.
Mr Fyodorov, who admitted he never travelled around Russia because 'such
trips end up being just 'promising' trips', said it was his attempt to
impose fiscal discipline which really angered colleagues like Mr Alexander
Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture. Although he could control
spending he could not control the spending promises of others.
'You find that in 90 per cent of cases, money is misspent or people did not
need it.' Subsidies rarely reached their targets, thanks to corruption and
inefficiency, while those most in need of support felt abandoned by the
government.
'If you stand in front of the British Treasury for an hour and shout, nobody
will give you any money,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'But here it works, so why
should people stop doing it?'

FT  10 FEB 94 / Russia hit by delay in energy payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday announced a payments crisis in the energy
sector, which threatened 'to paralyse' both domestic and export deliveries.
The energy ministry's Infotek information service said that 'the total of
non-payments has taken on such proportions that in the near future. . . it
could completely paralyse economic activity on the part of energy sector
enterprises.'
January production of oil and gas condensate was down to 6.5m barrels per
day - a fall of 10.1 per cent on the previous January's output.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, a moderate reformer who yesterday appeared to be
struggling to continue market reform in an inhospitable environment, said
that among three different strategies being considered for economic reform,
the proposal for price controls, at least on 'natural monopolies' such as
rail traffic, electricity supply and other services, was most appealing.
The non-payments crisis, affecting in particular such basic industries as
coal and steel, has been hugely aggravated by the uncontrolled and steep
price rises brought in by the railways and the electricity companies, on
whose services the basic industries depend.
The independent miners' union yesterday again threatened action because of
delays of months in payments to their members - a constant feature of the
past few months.
The former Soviet republics, still supplied by Russia at below world prices,
are among the largest debtors.
The gas monopoly Gasprom said yesterday that while it was working flat out
supplying Russia and the 'near abroad,' it had received almost no payments
for January and had sent 'final demands' to the governments of Ukraine,
Belarus and Moldova.
These three countries, all without significant energy resources except coal,
owe many billions of roubles to the Russian energy suppliers - with Ukraine
alone owing over Rbs1,000bn for gas deliveries.
Gasprom told the official Itar-Tass news agency that payments were
outstanding from Ukraine and Belarus for just under half of the gas supplied
to the beginning of January, and for nearly 90 per cent of that supplied to
Moldova.
Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belorussian prime minister, underscored the
urgency of the energy issue facing his country when he said that 'if energy
prices in Russia and Belarus are not kept the same, then I will not sign the
agreement to merge the two countries' monetary systems.'
The draft agreement, which Mr Shokhin said could be signed next week, would
effectively re-integrate Belarus' economy back into Russia.
The cost to Russia of such a deal would probably be the conversion of the
devalued Belarussian currency into roubles at an unfavourable rate, the
supply of cheap energy and the opening of credit lines to Belarussian
industries.
Mr Shokhin spent much of yesterday meeting three groups of economists, all
of whom proposed wages and price controls and more state intervention.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French employees will be able to convert money from company profit-sharing
schemes into paid holiday if another government plan designed to reduce the
country's record unemployment wins approval.
The proposed money-for-time exchange is included in an update of the 1966
worker participation law proposed by the French cabinet yesterday. Another
feature of the scheme, yet to be approved by parliament, would allow
employees to take profit shares early provided they spend the money on a car
or home improvements.
The government's use of worker participation legislation not only to promote
industrial democracy but also to encourage consumption and counter
unemployment illustrates its determination to leave no stone unturned in its
quest for jobs.
However, with that interest in worker participation that distinguishes the
Gaullist RPR party from UK conservatives, Mr Edouard Balladur's government
is also proposing to give employees holding more than 5 per cent of their
company's capital (including profit-sharing schemes) the right to call a
general shareholders' meeting to elect worker representatives to the board.
Company chiefs are forecasting that investment will have risen by 3 per cent
in January, reversing a steady fall since 1991, according to a survey by
Insee, the government statistics agency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Poland's two-party governing coalition have patched up their
differences after a bruising clash over control of economic policy sparked
by the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, the deputy premier and finance
minister.
The compromise, which came on the eve of yesterday's large demonstration in
Warsaw by the Solidarity trade union, commits the coalition partners, the
Social Democrats (SLD) and the Peasant Party (PSL), to support this year's
draft budget but saw the SLD forced to abandon its support for Mr Borowski.
The SLD is now searching for a new candidate to head the finance ministry.
Meanwhile, Solidarity put well over 20,000 supporters onto the street in its
first public challenge to the coalition government, which has its roots in
the communist past.
The union is demanding changes in the budget to increase public sector wages
and cut planned energy price rises and threatens to back its demands with
selective industrial action.
The draft budget which goes to a final vote in parliament at the beginning
of next month has been agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
The budget is central to Poland's chances of winning a 20 per cent reduction
in its Dollars 32bn Paris Club debt at the end of March. The reduction is
linked to IMF approval of the country's economic policies.
During the crisis Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and PSL leader,
indicated that he would push for more expansionary policies and criticised
the tight budget prepared under Mr Borowski's direction as being 'a liberal
continuation' in a reference to the practice of free market governments
since 1989.
Now Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, who lost ground in the eyes of
the public during the clash, has managed to bring Mr Pawlak around to
supporting the budget. But he lost Mr Borowski and only managed to salvage
the principle that the finance ministry stays within the sphere of influence
of the SLD as originally agreed when the government was established last
autumn.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Politicians call for new board at BNL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of politicians yesterday called upon the Ciampi government to
appoint a new board to BNL, the treasury-controlled commercial bank, whose
chairman Mr Gianpiero Cantoni was forced to step down on Monday because of
magistrates' investigations into alleged corruption.
The call came from senators in the parliamentary commission investigating
the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) worth of unauthorised loans issued to Iraq by
BNL's Atlanta branch which came to light in 1989.
Mr Cantoni was brought in to clean up the problems left by BNL-Atlanta and
there has been no suggestion he has been linked to Atlanta. But he was a
Socialist appointee: as such the latest problems at the bank have
highlighted how Italy's ruling parties have carved up the top posts in the
state-dominated banking system.
In a statement the group of senators said: 'The government should intervene
immediately. The leadership needs to be renewed to provide stability for the
bank.'
At the same time, a majority of the senators on the BNL-Atlanta commission
rejected the view that the bank was a 'victim' of the Atlanta scandal. This
view was contained in the conclusion of a report delivered yesterday by Mr
Giampaolo Mora, the commission's president.
The majority backed the line taken by the US Congress' Banking Committee,
headed by Mr Henry Gonzalez, that the Rome head office was aware of the
operations of its Atlanta branch. Both BNL executives and members of the
then Christian Democrat-led government have denied such knowledge at
headquarters.
Yesterday in a potentially significant related development, US president
Bill Clinton gave the green light for new guidelines permitting a more
liberal declassification of documents relating to the BNL-Atlanta affair. In
turn this gave renewed impetus to the efforts of Mr Gonzalez' Banking
Committee to establish the truth.
The call for management changes at BNL also focused attention on the issue
of BNL's under capitalisation. In a treasury paper outlining government
plans for privatisation prepared in November 1992, BNL was estimated to need
at least L2,000bn (Pounds 797m) to improve capital ratios.
Speaking to journalists in Milan yesterday, Mr Mario Draghi,
director-general of the treasury, said the latest developments at BNL had
reinforced the urgency of putting the bank on a stronger financial footing.
He said the treasury remained committed to the recapitalisation and implied
this might come about within the year.
Mr Cantoni himself was yesterday required by Milan magistrates to confront
Mr Achise Marcori, former Socialist councillor at Segrate, a Milan suburb.
This followed claims by Mr Marcori he received L200m from Mr Cantoni linked
to a residential property development. According to the Ansa news agency, Mr
Cantoni said he was forced to pay L400m as the price for being able to carry
out the development.
Meanwhile further details emerged yesterday about papers the Bank of Italy
had sent to Rome magistrates on BNL loans to Mandelli, an engineering group
recently placed in liquidation. BNL's London branch is alleged to have
extended a L75m credit facility to Mandelli for dealings with a subsidiary
allegedly linked to Mr Cantoni's family business interests.

The German government has ordered government ministries and federal agencies
to offer all their vacancies in future to part-time as well as full-time
workers, as part of a programme to promote part-time employment.
The move was agreed by the cabinet in Bonn yesterday, following publication
of Monday's grim unemployment figures, which topped 4m for the first time in
the history of the federal republic.
Ms Angela Merkel, minister for youth and women's affairs, said federal
agencies had been told to report back on their progress in encouraging
part-time workers, who must be offered the same career prospects as
full-time civil servants.
The government maintains that 2.5m workers, mainly women, would like to work
in part-time jobs. However, currently only 17 per cent of jobs in Germany
are worked part-time, compared with 34 per cent in the Netherlands.
Ms Merkel said that a recent study indicated that at least 1.5m jobs could
be created by work sharing, and that 30 per cent of workers were ready to
work less and earn less.
The latest moves are part of the government's programme of deregulation and
privatisation measures, which amount to the main element in its job-creation
strategy.
Yesterday, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, again urged an
acceleration in deregulation and privatisation, measures, he said, which had
enjoyed widespread support at a conference in Bonn on the problem of
Germany's lack of international competitiveness.
He called for privatisation of the savings bank network - a move fiercely
resisted by the banks themselves - as well as the break-up of the monopoly
control of the gas and electricity grids.
The cabinet yesterday approved a new motorway tax for road haulage
operators, who will have to pay up to DM2,500 (Pounds 954) a year for heavy
trucks.
Mr Matthias Wissman, the transport minister, said it was possible a similar
tax would be introduced for passenger cars, but not before the end of the
year.
Germany wants such a measure to be introduced throughout the European Union.

<TEXT>
More than 20,000 German engineering workers demonstrated in the town of
Mannheim yesterday to protest against employer calls for a wage freeze and
benefit cuts, Reuter reports from Mannheim.
The protest was part of a campaign of token stoppages across Germany over
the past 10 days.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, head of Germany's IG Metall union, warned employers about
the consequences of a strike in the engineering sector and said the union
was prepared to make a compromise. But it was not prepared to make all the
sacrifices and carry all the burdens of companies' cost-cutting plans.
Union and employer officials are meeting on Friday for talks to try to solve
the dispute.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Oslo expects to meet EU deadline: Norway's new foreign
minister gives optimistic view of entry negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's new foreign minister, Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, said yesterday that Oslo
could complete its negotiations for entry to the European Union by the
deadline of next month and go on to win approval from the Norwegian
electorate in a referendum in the autumn or early winter.
Mr Godal's assessment, in an interview with the Financial Times, was the
most optimistic to date from a country usually seen as the most difficult
case in the present EU enlargement talks, which also include Austria,
Finland and Sweden.
It came despite what Mr Godal acknowledged were 'disappointing' positions
taken by the EU this week on the issues of regional and agricultural aid and
the prospect of further hard negotiations on fisheries policy. Mr Godal, who
took over as foreign minister last month following the death of Mr Johan
Jorgen Holst, said he did not underestimate the problems but that they could
be overcome given 'a sufficient degree of creativity' from both sides.
'I think we have strong political will in the (EU) council of ministers; we
have strong political will on the part of the applicant governments. There
is a political momentum now in the whole procedure which could favour a
solution to the remaining problems by early March.'
In that case, a referendum was likely in 'autumn or early winter', he said.
He was encouraged by a recent increase in public support for membership. 'It
is modest, but it is followed by an even larger decrease on the No side. So,
with a good negotiated result, and with the likelihood of Swedish and
Finnish entry and the further activation of the political arguments (in
favour) I foresee a Yes majority. It won't be easy, but we are closer to
that than people normally imagine, both in Europe and at home.'
However, Mr Godal, who was previously directly in charge of the EU
negotiations as trade minister, made clear he expected the onus of
compromise needed to conclude an accession agreement to fall on the Union
side.
Norway is demanding that Nordic agriculture be treated permanently as a
special case and wants a transition period for adjustment of its high farm
subsidies to EU levels. It is refusing to allow Union access to its
fisheries beyond quotas already agreed under the European Economic Area
accord and wants to continue to manage independently fish stocks in its
northern-most waters.
But Mr Godal said his country's agriculture and fisheries were 'peanuts in
the broader European context'. Norway would be a net contributor to the EU.
The accession agreement also had to 'pass the test of a referendum' among a
sceptical Norwegian electorate.
'It really depends on the political will and recognition among the Union
members to realise the importance of our positions,' he said.
'Why should they not give a clear signal to their negotiators on agriculture
and fisheries that for foreign policy reasons they have to find solutions to
these problems? . . . to the extent that this will be reflected in the
negotiating positions, we will have a solution.'

<TEXT>
A Portuguese court has made a landmark ruling against a group of
shareholders seeking Es20bn (Pounds 76m) in government compensation for the
nationalisation of their holdings following the country's 1974 revolution.
The precedent set by the court in the first compensation case to reach a
conclusion represents a victory for the centre-right government, which is
facing at least three other important claims in the courts. After a bitter
legal battle that began in 1987, a Lisbon civil court ruled against the
claim by five former shareholders in 10 companies, including eight banks,
that were nationalised by a communist-led government in 1975.
The group sought Es20bn in compensation based on the market value of their
shares at the time of the nationalisation and additional compensation to
make up for monetary depreciation. But the court ruled in favour of a
government proposal to pay them only Es1bn.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Tax rise will not harm recovery, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax increases in April will not harm the recovery, Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, claimed
yesterday, as figures showed the economy strengthening throughout the
regions.
In a speech to business leaders and academics at London's City University
last night, Mr Davies said: 'Those who argue that tax increases will stop
the recovery are making a political, not an economic, point.'
The speech coincided with the release of the CBI's latest survey of regional
industrial trends showing that UK manufacturing orders rose in every region
except Northern Ireland in the four months to January.
However, Mr Davies warned that investment intentions were 'worryingly weak'
because companies were looking for too high a rate of return. He added:
'Quite typically, corporations look for returns of 17 or 20 per cent before
they will grant new investment plans board approval. In a world of very low
inflation . . . these hurdle rates are high and imposing them may choke off
many good project opportunities.'
He said that while the tax increases were bound to have an effect on the
economy, past rises suggested that a slowdown in consumer spending was not
inevitable. Consumers might simply reduce their level of savings to offset
the tax impact.
'The government will be advised to reduce interest rates a little further as
the year proceeds, particularly if the exchange rate strengthens and/or
there is seen to be some adverse effect on confidence from the tax
increases,' Mr Davies said.
According to the regional survey, produced in conjunction with Business
Strategies, an economic consultancy, the largest increases in manufacturing
orders were in Yorkshire and Humberside, the south-east, Scotland and Wales.
Output has risen in most regions against a background of weak cost and price
pressures. The survey shows business optimism increasing, with companies
expecting overall demand and output to rise further in all mainland regions
over the next four months.
Export optimism about the year ahead has also strengthened, suggesting that
the recovery is not wholly dependent on domestic demand. Manufacturing
employment is still falling but the rate of job losses has eased.
The survey shows that companies in most regions, especially the West
Midlands and south-west, expect to increase investment in plant and
machinery in the next 12 months, mainly to raise efficiency. The survey says
companies cite inadequate net returns, rather than demand uncertainty, as
the main reason for limiting capital spending.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Israel and PLO sign crucial deal on self-rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night signed a crucial
security agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule. The deal, signed by Mr
Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
will give much-needed momentum to the peace process after months of delay
and bickering.
The full details, set down in a three-page set of principles and an
eight-page agreement, were not released. Mr Peres said they included
resolution of the two most sensitive security issues - control over the
Egypt-Gaza and Jericho-Jordan border crossings and security arrangements for
Jewish settlers in Gaza which would divide the strip into three zones.
Officials said this meant exclusive Palestinian control in the largest zone,
exclusive Israeli control in another zone around the Jewish settlements and
joint patrols, under Israeli control, in a third smaller zone.
Mr Peres said there was agreement in principle on the third main obstacle of
the past three months - the size of the Jericho area - but a final decision
would be taken only when Mr Arafat met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister. Mr Osama el Baz, political adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt, said the two sides had agreed an area 'a little more than 55 sq km'.
The agreement, however, fell short of bridging all the security issues,
leaving problems not resolved in Cairo to be negotiated under a new document
of principles called the 'Cairo document' which was also signed last night.
Mr Arafat said he had agreed to work with Mr Peres to overcome the remaining
problems. 'We are sure we can create a new era for our people,' he said. 'We
can say that Palestine and the name Palestine have returned to the map of
the Middle East.' Further talks are expected to resume next week in Paris
and in Cairo.
After lengthy talks, Mr Peres and Mr Arafat initialled the documents shortly
before midnight to loud applause at the Al-Itahidiya presidential palace in
front of President Mubarak.
The agreements, negotiated according to one Israeli official 'paragraph by
paragraph, line by line, word by word', broke a deadlock over the most
difficult obstacles preventing implementation of Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
It will unblock suspended talks on economic relations and the transfer of
civilian administration to Palestinian hands. Once the remaining issues have
been resolved, expected within two to three weeks, the stage will be set for
Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to sign a comprehensive protocol in Cairo, starting
an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho which was to have begun last
December 13.
Although last night's documents must be approved by the Israeli cabinet and
the PLO executive committee, this is expected to be a formality.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Nato orders Serbian pull-back: Air strikes threatened in 10
days unless Sarajevo artillery is withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato last night ordered the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery
encircling Sarajevo or face air strikes. The alliance ultimatum gave the
Serbs 10 days from midnight tonight to comply.
The dramatic Nato move, its most explicit threat of military intervention in
the 22-month Bosnian war, came a few hours after Bosnian Serb commanders,
under pressure, promised to move their guns from the hills around Sarajevo
and observe a ceasefire in the battered city.
US president Bill Clinton said Nato hoped that Bosnian Serb actions would
make air strikes unnecessary. 'But no one should doubt Nato's resolve,' he
said. 'Nato is now set to act.'
The 16-member Nato alliance decided to create a 20km (12.5 mile) 'exclusion
zone' around Sarajevo. All heavy weapons, including artillery, tanks and
mortars must be moved out of the zone or placed under United Nations
supervision.
Heavy weapons left inside this zone 'will, along with their direct and
essential military support facilities, be subject to Nato air strikes', a
communique warned.
Nato also warned that, even before the deadline, it was ready to unleash air
strikes on heavy weapons found responsible for shelling civilians in
Sarajevo.
The decision is a watershed in the history of the Nato alliance, which is
primed for offensive action for the first time since it was founded in 1949
to hold back communism. It came after more than 12 hours of talks, with
Greece, an ally of Serbia, dissociating itself from the ultimatum without
blocking it.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there was no need to go back
to the UN Security Council for fresh authority to conduct air strikes. He
appealed to Russia to support efforts to persuade the warring Serbs, Moslems
and Croats to reach a political settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Worner said there should be no speculation about the seriousness of the
10-day ultimatum. 'The deadline is firm . . . We are not looking to use
force. We prefer a negotiated solution agreed by all the parties.'
Nato explicitly authorised the commander-in-chief of allied forces in
southern Europe to launch air strikes at the request of the UN.
Air strikes taking place before the expiry of the deadline would need the
approval of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Mr Worner said.
After the deadline, attacks could take place simply 'in close co-ordination'
with Mr Boutros Ghali.
The Nato ambassadors hammered out the ultimatum in Brussels amid growing
political pressure in the west for a military response to last Saturday's
shelling of the Sarajevo market, when 68 civilians were killed and more than
200 wounded.
During more than 12 hours of intense debate, Canada voiced concern that an
open threat to intervene for the first time in the Bosnian civil war could
put at risk nearly 200 lightly armed Canadian UN peacekeepers trapped in the
eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica.
But the issue was pressed by France, the US and the UK. Britain, a long-time
sceptic on military intervention, supported a Franco-American draft setting
a deadline for a pull-back.
The wider diplomatic goal is to use a withdrawal to demilitarise Sarajevo
and persuade the Bosnian Moslems to agree to a political settlement.
The promise given by Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday was made in an accord
with the Moslem-led Bosnian government army in talks at Sarajevo airport.
General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia,
helped to bring about the accord, but voiced some scepticism. 'This is a
very small start to a very large problem. People should not read too much
into it as far as the overall situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is concerned,'
he said.
A senior Bosnian army commander said he did not believe the Sarajevo truce
would work. 'I think this is yet another game which the Serbs will get away
with,' he said.
With the threat of Nato air strikes hanging over their heads, Bosnian Serbs
are due to hold talks with their Moslem and Croat foes in Geneva today to
try to bring peace to Sarajevo. The talks were originally to have dealt only
with issues such as hotlines between the factions.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Civil service head asks Scott to 'undo damage' of inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Home Civil Service, yesterday urged Lord
Justice Scott to issue a statement about the media coverage that had
'permitted wild allegations and prejudging of issues' in the arms-to-Iraq
inquiry.
Sir Robin, who is also cabinet secretary, urged the judge to 'put the record
straight' about the conduct of ministers and officials in the arms-for-Iraq
affair.
In a prepared statement, he called for the inquiry to 'undo, so far as (is)
in its power, the damage which has been unfairly done to our system of
government, to the reputation of the civil service and to individuals'.
Sir Robin issued the statement after consulting Sir David Gillmore, head of
the Diplomatic Service, and Mr John Major, the prime minister.
While Sir Robin said that he made no criticism about the inquiry's
procedures, his attack does challenge the judge's insistence that the
hearings should be in public and openly reported.
Sir Robin described as 'victims' middle-ranking officials who 'could not
have been expected to be thrust into the limelight in the way in which they
have'.
Lord Justice Scott said yesterday that Sir Robin's statement 'would be
listened to by those to whom it was addressed'.
One of Sir Robin's concerns was the reporting of 'arms sales to Iraq'. He
said there had been no licences issued 'for the export of arms, that is,
lethal goods'. This is a question on which the judge has pressed former
witnesses.
Sir Robin yesterday repeatedly clashed with the judge and his counsel, Ms
Presiley Baxendale, QC, over the nature of ministerial responsibility, the
duty of civil servants, and his own role in the Iraq affair.
The cabinet secretary told the inquiry that ministers should only resign if
they were 'personally culpable', and justified 'half-answers' to parliament.
He said one of the strengths of Britain's system of government was 'that
invariably you can find out what happened'. The judge interrupted: 'I think
I would qualify invariably.'
Lord Justice Scott questioned Sir Robin about how former civil servants had
been stopped by the government from giving evidence to a parliamentary
inquiry into the Iraqi supergun.
The judge urged him to 'think critically about the established practices and
convention' of Whitehall.
Sir Robin is to give further evidence in public today.

FT  10 FEB 94 / Sterling falls sharply against leading currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling fell sharply yesterday against leading currencies after Tuesday's
quarter-point cut in UK base rates and against a background of political
problems for the government.
In London the pound closed at DM2.5708, more than 4 pfennigs lower than its
level before the rate cut and 2 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. It eased
further in New York to DM2.5672. Against the dollar it fell just under a
cent to Dollars 1.4605 in London, and closed at the same level in New York.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International, commenting on the
cut, said: 'This has not come across as a convincing, well-planned move.'
Many City traders complained they were unable to understand government
policy which eased rates while releasing a report indicating that inflation
could move up. The FT-SE 100 share index fell by 36.5 points before
recovering to finish 11.1 points lower at 3,429.1. UK long gilts finished
about  1/3 -point down.
Before the US and UK interest rate changes, sterling had been at recent
peaks against the dollar and D-Mark. It touched DM2.62 last month, a high
since it left the ERM in September 1992 and reached its highest level
against the dollar since October.

FT  09 FEB 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Vodafone acquires GMC stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 10th February 1994) appended to this article.
Vodafone, the largest cellular phone operator in the UK, has paid Pounds
29.2m for a one third stake in General Mobile Communications, the UK's
leading independent mobile telephone service provider, from Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, the French diversified services group.
GMC's main operation is Talkland, which controls about 50 branded retail
outlets in the UK for mobile telephones.
The Talkland stake will give Vodafone direct or indirect access to nearly
half of its 1m customers.
Talkland has about 210,000 subscribers, with more than half connected to
Vodafone's network. Vodac and VHL, Vodafone's wholly owned service-providing
subsidiaries, together have more than 330,000 Vodafone subscribers.
In addition to the sale price, Vodafone has agreed to lend GMC Pounds 29m
for investment in Talkland.
Talkland will continue to operate separately, and Vodafone said it had no
plans to acquire a further stake in GMC. Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's
director of corporate affairs, said: 'This is not a move to take over
aggressively the independent service providers: it was a good opportunity in
its own right.'
However, the acquisition marks a further contraction of independent service
providers, a key feature in the cellular mobile industry as regulated in the
1980s. Mercury One-2-One, the third cellular network operator which launched
last year, sought from the outset to minimise the role of independent
service providers.
The acquisition leaves about 10 large service providers without direct links
with either Vodafone or Cellnet, the second largest network operator owned
by BT and Securicor.
In 1992 CGE incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.6m. It expects a profit for
1993, before exceptional items.
According to Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone chief executive, 'service provision is
one of the cornerstones of the UK mobile industry, and Talkland is one of
the key players.'
CORRECTION
The Pounds 2.6m pre-tax loss for 1992 attributed to Compagnie Generale des
Eaux in yesterday's FT was in fact that incurred by its General Mobile
Communications subsidiary, in which Vodafone has taken a one third stake.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Simon sells Unichem Intl in drive to reduce
debt
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Engineering, the maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear,
yesterday agreed to sell Unichem International to the Western Company of
North America for Dollars 19.8m (Pounds 13.2m) cash.
The sale is part of the group's plan to raise Pounds 40m through disposals
as part of a drive to cut debt.
Since Mr Maurice Dixson became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out last
September group debt has been cut from Pounds 148m to below Pounds 120m.
In December, Simon sold its 50 per cent share in TR Oil Services for Pounds
6.2m. This disposal, coupled with the sale of Unichem International,
substantially ends Simon's involvement in chemical services.
Unichem International, based in Houston, had sales of Pounds 20.4m and
trading profits of Pounds 1.3m in 1992, the latest year for which audited
accounts are available. Net assets were Pounds 1.6m.

Degussa, the Frankfurt-based metals and chemicals group which has recently
completed the bulk of a rationalisation programme, yesterday reported group
earnings up 25 per cent for the three months to December. It predicted
further gains for the rest of the financial year to September.
First-quarter pre-tax profits rose by a quarter to DM60m (Dollars 35.3bn) on
turnover up 5 per cent to DM3.5bn, due mainly to a large increase in
earnings from the chemicals division which benefited from rationalisation
and improved demand.
KWU, the power-generation and distribution arm of the Siemens electronics
and electricals group, increased turnover by 32 per cent to DM8.7bn in the
year to September.

PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French cars group, yesterday announced sales of
FFr145.4bn (Dollars 24.6bn) last year, a fall of 6.2 per cent compared with
1992.
The company said the performance demonstrated resistance to the sharp
decline in the European car market, which contracted by 15.1 per cent last
year, and a strong final quarter.
During the October-December period, Peugeot-Citroen recorded a 13.1 per cent
share of the European market, compared with 12.3 per cent for the year as a
whole.
Just over FFr61.5bn of the group's total sales came from the French market,
a decline of 5.9 per cent. For France and western Europe, the sales figure
was FFr71.1bn, a decline of 9.2 per cent.
Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group slated for
privatisation, yesterday announced consolidated sales of FFr140.5bn for last
year, an increase of 11.6 per cent compared with 1992.
The strongest growth was achieved in international markets, where turnover
rose by 15 per cent to FFr79.4bn. In France, sales increased by 7.3 per cent
to FFr61.1bn.

FT  09 FEB 94 / US telecoms group plans network for City of London
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MFS Communications, the largest national provider of telecommunications
networks competing with the local Bell companies in the US, is to launch a
network in the City of London.
With turnover of Dollars 108.7m in 1992 and operations in 14 American
cities, MFS will be a powerful competitor to BT and Mercury. It has a record
of making swift inroads against former monopoly telephone companies through
aggressive pricing and marketing.
MFS's City of London network, which will be operational from April, will be
its first outside the US. It is planning extensions to other UK cities, and
expects to provide access to Paris and Frankfurt later this year.
It will interconnect its London network with the long-distance networks of
BT, Mercury and Energis, offering an end-to-end service at competitive
tariffs. MFS has built its business by competing with former local monopoly
carriers, offering access to long-distance networks.
Since the break up of the US Bell telephone company in 1984, local and
long-distance networks have been operated separately, with competition far
more intense in the long distance market.
The price of UK business phone calls is to fall on March 9, with the
abolition of the peak-rate calling band by BT and Mercury, cutting between
20 and 25 per cent from the cost of weekday calls made between 9am and 1pm.
BT's price cuts fulfil most of its obligation to reduce prices before July
by 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under a price cap agreement
with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator.
Residential customers, who will gain little from the abolition of the peak
rate, were the main beneficiaries of a new weekend rate cutting
long-distance call prices before Christmas. Mercury has matched BT's price
cuts, and claims still to be cheaper for most long distance calls.
The abolition of the peak rate will leave three charging bands: a standard
daytime rate applicable from 8am to 6pm on weekdays; a cheap rate for calls
between 6pm and 8am on weekdays; and a weekend rate.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, said Mercury had
'long been planning' to abolish its equivalent of peak rate but had been
prevented from doing so 'by the existing interconnect payments that we make
to BT'.
Mercury does not have a local network, and competes with BT for long
distance and international traffic. BT is already under pressure in its
local market from cable companies mostly US owned, building combined cable
TV and telephone networks.

<TEXT>
The Central Bank of Nigeria has set up a committee including representatives
from banking and industry to allocate the first foreign exchange sale of the
year to the private sector, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
Under a regulated system announced in last month's budget, the government
has fixed the exchange rate at N22 to the dollar, minimised the role of
banks in foreign exchange and outlawed the parallel market where the dollar
changes for at least N46.
The bank will allocate foreign currency pro rata to importers with 50 per
cent going to manufacturing industry, 30 per cent for finished goods and 10
per cent for agriculture. The remaining 10 per cent of foreign exchange will
be sold at the bank's discretion for invisible exports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Palestinians yesterday made good but slow progress towards
drafting a long-delayed agreement on security issues to implement
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho,
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, were due to meet President Hosni Mubarak,
who is mediating between the two sides. Neither side offered any clue
whether they would be able to initial a draft agreement last night or today,
when Mr Peres and Mr Arafat are due to leave Cairo.
Mr Peres said: 'We have to negotiate quietly. . . We shall try to conclude
as soon as we can. I cannot give you a date.' Mr Nabil Shaath, senior PLO
negotiator, said the two sides had resolved 'six or seven minor issues' in
morning talks. 'We are going a little slowly but we are going. . .'
Israeli officials confirmed the two sides were seeking to 'clarify' a draft
agreement reached between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland 10 days ago.
The talks mainly focused on details of a Palestinian presence at border
crossings; Israeli security arrangements at the borders and the operational
role of the Israeli army in protecting Jewish settlers remaining in Gaza
once Israeli forces have complete a troop redeployment.
Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, confirmed the Cairo talks were aimed
at initialling the security clauses of a protocol as a prelude to Israeli
troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho and the transfer of power to Palestinian
hands.
Mr Sarid said that once the security clause were initialled, the two sides
would have to hold at least two weeks of further talks in Paris and Egypt on
economics and the role of the Palestinian police force before Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Arafat could formally sign the
protocol.
'We do hope to conclude the security agreement today and if not today
tomorrow or after tomorrow,' Mr Sarid said. But he cautioned: 'Always the
beginning of talks is very positive and the atmosphere constructive but some
times it is difficult to translate that atmosphere into results.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise reduction in UK interest rates brought a turnround in a
declining futures market on a day that once again saw strong volume in the
traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
The early strength of the cash market failed to inspire a dull futures
sector, where the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 3,430, a
10-point discount to cash.
The announcement on the cut in interest rates brought a bounce to the March
future, which had fallen to the day's low of 3,425. Buyers returned
immediately, sending the contract soaring to the day's peak of 3,480 just
before lunch.
However, a poor gilts sector undermined March, as did the tentative start on
Wall Street, and the contract drifted lower for the rest of the session,
finishing at 3,440, a 3-point discount to cash. Volume remained good,
reaching 20,289 lots by the official close.
Business in the traded options was again heavy, particularly in the index
options. Total turnover was 63,915 contracts, of which 26,420 were dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option and 9,901 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. In the stock
options, British Gas led with 1,916 contracts traded, followed by Hanson at
1,896 lots and Lucas Industries at 1,560. HSBC, BTR and BT were also active.
Business improved on the OMLX Mid 250 market and 762 futures contracts had
been traded by the close.

<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical stocks received support from BZW, one of the UK's leading
investment banks, which issued 50m call warrants worth Pounds 223m on four
internationally traded stocks.
The issue, one of the largest in recent months, comes at a time when
securities houses are looking at increasingly sophisticated forms of trading
 -such as large over-the-counter options tailor made for individual clients
 -in order to satisfy a growing appetite for equities.
BZW's basket represents three Glaxo shares, 1 1/4 shares of each class of
SmithKline Beecham - the 'A's and the Units - one Wellcome and one Zeneca
share. The warrants were priced at 55p each, and 10 warrants give the right
to buy one basket for Pounds 44.64 any time until expiry on July 31, 1995.
In spite of the early weakness in the New York market and the international
nature of the stocks, Glaxo rose 8 to 672p, SmithKline 'A' 4 to 417p and the
Units 5 to 386p, Wellcome 9 to 646p and Zeneca 8 to 782p.
Oil major British Petroleum ignored a persistently weak oil price and
climbed 7 to 385p, with 10m shares traded, on hopes of a stronger dollar and
increased enthusiasm over prospects for an oil find west of the Shetland
Isles.
Analysts have been aware of the potential of the new field, known as
Foinavon, for some time but optimism was rekindled by a positive article in
a specialist trade publication. There is also informed talk that BP is
commissioning feasibility studies from engineering companies and discussing
financing arrangements with leading banks.
Also, any rate rise in the US combined with a rate cut in the UK would
normally lead to a stronger dollar against the pound - a situation which
would increase BP's currency gains. Burmah, which also gains from a stronger
dollar and is largely unaffected by a falling oil price because it
concentrates on refining, was squeezed up 19 to 870p.
The market remained unimpressed by GKN's long anticipated hostile bid for
helicopter manufacturer Westland Group for nearly Pounds 500m. The
engineering group already had a 28.3 per cent stake in Westland and is
buying the 18.7 per cent stake held by US group United Technologies as a
launch pad for its bid. GKN said its offer was for the outstanding ordinary
shares at 290p a share in cash or loan notes and it was making a
one-for-five rights issue raising Pounds 248m to fund the bid.
Shares in both companies registered little change, reflecting the market's
coolness towards the proposed deal. GKN firmed 2 to 582p, in trade of a mere
1.4m shares while Westland retreated from the day's high to also finish just
2 ahead at 307p, in negligible volume. The stock is very tightly held.
Several analysts said the fact that the offer was below the current market
price was an indication that it was not serious.
Reports that Forte has been outbid in its attempt to buy Ciga, the Italian
hotel chain, hit the shares and raised doubts among leisure analysts over
the company's European strategy. Forte, and Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund,
had made a Pounds 270m offer for the group. However, it was dwarfed over the
weekend by a Pounds 375m bid from Sheraton Hotels, valuing Ciga at a
colossal Pounds 150,000 per room.
Analysts were relieved that Forte was backtracking from a bidding war. But
some argued it would have to pay a premium price as there are very few
luxury hotel chains in Europe which qualify as potential targets.
'This leaves a hole in Forte's strategy - if they are unwilling to pay these
kind of prices it is unlikely to be filled,' said one leading specialist.
Another said it would increase pressure on the group to make sure it landed
the luxury Savoy chain. Forte settled 3 down at 252p, after 249p, with
turnover a busy 7.8m. Savoy was steady at 1028p.
Speculation that Stakis is close to buying a clutch of provincial hotels
helped the shares climb 6 1/2 to 92 1/2 p.
Price reductions by both BT and Mercury, owned by Cable and Wireless, hit
sentiment, particularly in the former. However, analysts said that although
the tariff changes would knock some Pounds 350m off BT's revenues, volume
increases were likely to claw back a sizeable portion. BT shares slid 4 1/2
to 459p. Cable and Wireless gained 4 to 518p. Dealers said sentiment was
little affected by news of another entrant into the telecoms market in the
shape of MFS from the US. Vodafone, paid Pounds 30m for a stake in a
distributor, the shares adding 8 to 616p.
Television group LWT jumped 35 to 737p after Granada, the leisure group,
announced that it was increasing its final offer for the company to around
Pounds 776m, the equivalent of 750p a share. Analysts said Granada was now
certain to acquire the television group but was paying a very high price.
The shares fell 8 at one stage before closing 2 off at 568p.
Building groups were marked sharply higher following the interest rate
reduction. Redland put on 18 to 638p, with UBS said to be strong buyers of
the stock. Spring Ram, meanhwile, saw hectic trading as the nil-paid rights
owned by the Rooney family were placed. The shares added 5 to 22p, with a
huge 30m traded. The ordinaries climbed 2 to 75p.

<TEXT>
International news and financial information group Reuters Holdings
experienced frantic trading as the company announced that it was splitting
its shares and came out with full-year results at the top end of market
expectations at Pounds 440m.
A share split, which will make the stock more marketable and liquid, had
been expected, but most analysts had anticipated a three-for-one deal at
best. When Reuters declared that investors would have four shares for every
one held, the market price moved up so fast that there were periods of
backwardation - a situation where the pace of trading leads to bid prices
being temporarily higher than the offer price. At one stage it was
technically possible to sell Reuters shares at 1980p and buy them back at
1947p.
Lehman Brothers raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 520m,
giving 88p of earnings. Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency's broker, raised
its estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 520m, while BZW adjusted to Pounds 505m
from Pounds 482m. The Reuters share price leaped to a high of 2018p before
closing 60 up on balance at 1971p after heavy turnover of 2m.

FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate cut triggers big gains
in equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two large takeover bids, a smaller bid, bumper profits from one of the
market leaders and, to cap it all, a surprise cut in UK interest rates
helped the London stock market's recuperation process after Monday's steep
fall.
Adding to an early bout of optimism was Wall Street's good performance
overnight plus gains in the Far East's two most important markets, Tokyo and
Hong Kong.
However, after the initial burst of enthusiasm, the London market began to
have second thoughts about the background to the interest rate cuts, and
these worries, combined with a shaky opening performance by Wall Street and
an abrupt about-turn in gilts, took the gloss off the market's performance.
Long-dated gilts ended the day showing losses of around  3/8 , having been
up by some 1 1/4 points at midsession.
Nevertheless, driven by the weight and importance of the day's news,
turnover in the equity market again topped the 1bn shares mark, eventually
reaching 1.02bn, continuing the exceptionally high volume levels seen in
recent months and ensuring that the City's securities houses are still
earning good profits from the market. Second-line stocks accounted for
655.8m shares, or 64 per cent of the turnover total.
Traders preferred to ignore suggestions that some of the market's biggest
marketmaking houses, wrongfooted at the end of last week and on Monday when
equities plunged in the wake of Wall Street after US interest rates were
increased, had again been caught out by a sudden shift in the market.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished a busy session a net 21.1 ahead at 3,440.2,
while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which was given a push by the two bids, for
Westland Group and LWT, advanced strongly to close 54.5 higher at 4,131.6.
Share prices began the session in fine form, bolstered by the good
performances from the leading international stock markets in the US and the
Far East. Adding to the good news was GKN's bid for Westland and Granada's
increased offer for LWT.
Opening some 27 points higher, the FT-SE 100 began to wilt after an early
flurry of support, but then raced ahead as the Bank of England signalled a
rate reduction of  1/4 percentage point. The cut in rates triggered some big
support across the market, lifting the 100 index to a day's high of 3,471.7,
up 52.6, by around midday, and the 250 index by more than 60 points.
Later, however, Wall Street's uninspiring opening, and weak international
bond markets, saw share prices gradually drift back to close on an uncertain
note.
Some dealers were perplexed at the timing of the rate cut, and pointed to
the continuing political difficulties facing the Conservative government,
although it was also noted that the Governor of the Bank of England had said
the rate cut was decided last week.
Others, however, remain convinced that the gloom mongers in the market will
be proved wrong. 'The cash market felt good all day and was only dragged
down from its best levels by gilts and the future, said the head of trading
at one of the top UK securities houses.
Reuters, the media group, spurted ahead after delivering top of the range
results and a share split seen as increasing the stock's marketability.
Redland responded to a UBS buy recommendation, while BT shares were
unsettled by the latest price-cutting move.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lower bond prices put brake
on US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Amid further weakness in the bond market, US stock indices generally
finished with little change yesterday in spite of sharp swings in some
individual share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a slight 0.29 off at 3,906.03, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.70 to 471.06. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite firmed 0.84 to 477.68 and the
Nasdaq composite added 3.50 at 782.70.
New York SE volume, at 318m shares, was heavy. Advancing issues led declines
by 1,165 to 949.
Overnight rallies on many foreign stock markets provided a positive tone for
Wall Street, which was already cheered by Monday's rebound from a 96-point
rout in the final session of last week. The Dow climbed about 10 points
within minutes of the opening bell.
However, in the absence of any leading economic news, share prices could not
sustain their forward momentum. News of a 4.2 per cent gain in
fourth-quarter non-farm productivity barely raised a ripple.
Instead, investors were distracted by the US Treasury market, which
continued to lose ground in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move to
tighten short-term interest rates on Friday. The bench-mark 30-year issue
was down  23/32 at 97 13/16 in late trading, amid concern over the issuance
of new supply by the Treasury.
Among the blue chips, heavy gains by some stocks were nearly balanced with
hefty losses by others. Caterpillar powered Dollars 3 1/2 ahead to Dollars
108, while General Motors was lifted Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 .
Sears Roebuck dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 after the retailer
disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter operating results. By
contrast, Allied Signal forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 77 3/8 after
posting fourth-quarter net earnings of 41 cents a share, against 32 cents a
year earlier, and boosting its dividend by 16 per cent.
Alcoa, another Dow Industrial component, showed no signs of stumbling. It
climbed a further Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 as investors followed
through on Monday's announcement of deep production cuts. 3M appreciated
Dollars 1 to Dollars 105 7/8 .
In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer was marked down Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/8
on warning of lower profits in the first quarter, following a sharp slowdown
in sales growth in the final three months of last year. The bearish
sentiment spilled over into some other drug stocks. Schering-Plough declined
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 .
Consumer products companies, which have stayed out of the limelight in
recent weeks, resurfaced with falls. Philip Morris shed Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 58 3/4 and Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57.
On the Nasdaq, America Online surged Dollars 3 to Dollars 73 1/2 , after a
Dollars 5 3/4 rise the previous day. The company, which offers information
services through home computers, announced a strategic alliance with NBC
late on Monday. Among other technology issues, Sierra On-Line jumped Dollars
3 3/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 on strong earnings, but Microsoft fell Dollars 2 to
Dollars 78 3/4 .
Canada
Toronto showed a slightly firmer bias after fairly active trading. The TSE
300 index ended 3.5 up at 4,452.2 and rises outpaced falls by 435 to 346.
Volume was 70.8m shares.
The 14 stock groups were evenly split between rises and falls. Industrial
products added 1.3 per cent and mining 1.2 per cent, while conglomerates and
real estate also posted gains exceeding 1 per cent. Pipelines declined by
1.1 per cent.
Brazil
Sao Paulo was 4.6 per cent ahead by the close as investors awaited a
congressional vote on a major element of the government's anti-inflation
programme, which was approved by congress later that day. The Bovespa index
gained 3,926 at 88,799, while turnover came to Cr176.8bn (USDollars 344.5m).
Late yesterday Brazil's congress approved a key part of the government's
economic stabilisation plan, voting in favour of a Dollars 16bn emergency
fund.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Government struggles to control Seoul's
advance - The rally looks set to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government intervention, helped by the three-day lunar new year's holiday
that begins today, has temporarily halted a recent surge on the Seoul
bourse. But analysts believe that the Finance Ministry will eventually have
no more success in controlling the market than Canute had in stopping the
waves.
The ministry has announced three sets of measures in the last three weeks to
curb stock speculation, which has sent the general index climbing towards
its record peak of 1,007, set on April 1, 1989. The result of the ministry's
labours began to bear fruit a week ago when the index reached 974 and then
went on a decline - although it rebounded yesterday, ending at 923, up 8
points.
The government has offered several economic reasons for cooling the market.
It fears that the bull run could cause distortions in economic growth by
diverting funds from industrial investments.
It has also expressed concern about inflationary pressure as investors start
spending their newly acquired capital gains, which are not subject to
taxation. Foreign capital flowing into the Seoul bourse - still considered
undervalued by Asian standards - has heightened inflationary worries, since
it would increase the money supply.
The measures also reflect the 'back to basics' approach on economic issues
favoured by the administration of President Kim Young-sam, who has preached
that hard work rather than financial spec-ulation should be the guid-ing
principle of Koreans.
But the government only has itself to blame for the stock market's buoyancy.
Its success in curbing inflation has depressed interest rates and,
consequently, the bond market. An anti-corruption campaign has dampened
speculation in the unofficial lending and property markets.
The government last year also sought to encourage the public to liquidate
their anonymous bank accounts and transfer the funds to the stock market by
offering to maintain its tax-free status for five years. The bourse has been
riding on a wave of liquidity ever since, matched by expectations that
corporate earnings will improve significantly this year.
The cooling-down measures include requiring institutional investors to make
a 40 per cent deposit on purchase orders and individual investors 80 per
cent. Financial institutions, which operate under close state supervision,
are being required to sell shares and buy monetary stabilisation bonds
instead. The amount of authorised new share issues is being raised to soak
up excess liquidity. But they appear to have little long-term impact, at
least on domestic investors. Stock deposits, a key indicator of potential
buying power, remain high.
The measures, however, appear to be discouraging foreign investors since the
deposit requirement makes share purchases cumbersome, or even illegal in the
case of US institutional funds, the largest bloc of foreign investors in
Seoul.
Some foreign brokers believe that is a deliberate goal of the policy.
Foreigners are already barred from acquiring more than 10 per cent of a
company's stock and the foreign quota was expected to be exhausted for
almost all shares by the end of the month. A western broker said: 'If nearly
all Korean stocks had their foreign shareholding limits filled, that would
have put increased pressure on the government to raise the shareholding
ceiling. These measures have put off that day by forcing foreigners to halt
or slow down buying.'
The result is that there is renewed questioning among foreign securities
houses about the government's commitment to financial liberalisation and its
willingness to rid itself of its traditional desire to meddle in financial
markets.
But other analysts argue that those doubts about state intentions may be
misplaced. Recent efforts to liberalise foreign exchange rules are likely to
encourage pent-up capital to flow out of the country, which will lessen
worries about inflation and persuade the government to relax its grip on the
market.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1% as hopes
rise for tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors were encouraged by Monday's rally on Wall Street and, in addition,
by their anticipation of the government's economic package, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
Share prices gained ground in spite of active profit-taking by dealers and
corporate investors in the afternoon session, the Nikkei average ending
236.83 ahead at 20,251.23 after an opening low for the day of 20,080.51, and
high of 20,526.45.
Reports that the coalition was poised to agree on a Y6,000bn tax cut for the
fiscal year to March 1995 spurred arbitrage buying in the morning, and the
rebound in New York equities also helped investor confidence. The record
economic stimulus package came after hours and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 7.37 to 1,343.95.
In the domestic market, traders were encouraged by buying orders from
institutional investors, who had been cautious until now. However, there was
profit-taking in the afternoon as dealers adjusted positions ahead of the
Hosokawa-Clinton talks on Friday, and the listing of the Nikkei 300 futures
contracts on the Osaka stock exchange next Monday.
The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 15.26 to 1,616.70.
Volume totalled 600m shares, against Monday's 310m, as sell orders emerged
around the 20,500 Nikkei level. Winners outnumbered losers by 824 to 210,
with 140 issues unchanged.
Banks, which have been depressed recently on selling by corporate investors,
bounced back. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y120 to Y3,220 and Fuji Bank Y10
to Y2,230. Brokers were also stronger, with Nomura Securities ahead Y10 at
Y2,270 and Nikko Securities gaining Y30 at Y1,320.
Telecommunications-related stocks were higher on the multi-media theme.
Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, appreciated Y20 to Y1,070 and NEC put
on Y10 at Y1,070. Companies in the mobile phone business were also bought.
Itochu, a trading house, moved up Y15 to Y695 and Nitsuko Y120 to Y1,600.
Shipping lines, regarded as laggards, were bought. Navix Line improved Y13
to Y342 and Iino Kaiun Y30 to Y650.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 320.19 at 22,021.11 in volume of 64.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y330 to Y6,880.
Roundup
Most of the region's equity markets closed either side of a percentage point
higher; none of Monday's big fallers came near to recouping their losses.
HONG KONG regained just 0.35 per cent after Monday's 6.1 per cent slide, the
Hang Seng index finishing 39.89 better at 11,454.16 on late bargain hunting
in blue chips.
Turnover declined from HKDollars 9.67bn to HKDollars 8.58bn. Properties and
banks saw a recovery in sentiment; traders said the cut in the weighting of
Hong Kong stocks by Nomura, the Japanese broker, had prompted some early
follow-through selling which had subsided by late afternoon.
BANGKOK recovered some of Monday's 6.8 per cent fall, helped by activity in
the banking sector. The SET index put on 20.92 at 1,365.73 in low turnover
of Bt8.3bn, after Monday's Bt10.9bn. However, the market remained some 20
per cent down from its January 4 high of 1,753.
Bangkok Bank advanced Bt7 to Bt194, with most of the rise coming in the last
few minutes of trading.
KUALA LUMPUR retrieved 14.70 of the previous day's 53.30 fall, the composite
index ending at 1,108.72. Volume fell from 208m shares to 159.9m.
MANILA added a temporary freeze on oil price increases and the government's
staving off of a strike threat by local labour groups to Wall Street's
strength, and the composite index closed 61.91, or 2.1 per cent, higher at
2,952.85.
However, brokers said the rally was not convincing, since the oil price
freeze was only a palliative.
BOMBAY kept itself in positive territory after Monday's near 6 per cent
gain, although some profit-taking crept in towards the close. The BSE index
rose 17.6 to 4,162.0.
AUSTRALIA gave the credit to New York and Tokyo as the All Ordinaries index
recouped almost half of Monday's loss, gaining 24.3 at 2,305.4 in turnover
of ADollars 715.11m.
Mining house CRA moved ahead 38 cents to ADollars 19.26, with analysts
saying the agreement between its Hammersley Iron unit and Japanese Steel
Mills for a 7.6 per cent iron ore price cut was around expectations, or a
little better.
NEW ZEALAND dropped from a midday high of 2,399.02 to finish with the
NZSE-40 index a net 8.19 up at 2,373.69.
Telecom advanced to NZDollars 4.88 in early trading ahead of its
third-quarter results, but ended 9 cents down on balance on the news at
NZDollars 4.65.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cuts rewarded in Belgium,
Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rate cuts were rewarded in Brussels and Oslo, but bourses lost some of their
early gains as Wall Street moved to marginal weakness in the American
mid-morning, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's Dax index rose 27.81, or 1.3 per cent, on the session to
2,107.21, but most of this reflected Monday's post-bourse gains. Turnover
fell from DM10.8bn to DM9.8bn.
The Ibis-indicated Dax closed the afternoon just 4.46 ahead at 2,099.57.
'The only high we had today was in the jobless figures,' mourned Mr Edgar
Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt.
Mr Benischek said that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank,
seemed determined that the D-Mark should not depreciate against the US
dollar and that interest rate prospects were weakened accordingly.
Not enough companies were producing an improving picture at the moment, he
said, although Degussa, which was an early cost cutter, came up with good
results yesterday and saw its shares rise DM13 on the session, to DM467.
PARIS turnover slipped below the FFr5bn level as many investors decided to
take a watching brief. The CAC-40 index closed 12.79 higher at 2,299.85, off
the day's high of 2,318.00.
Roussel Uclaf, the pharmaceuticals group, rose FFr28 to FFr724 on better
than expected 1993 results, assisted by good sales growth in the fourth
quarter. Paribas recently recommended a continued underweight position in
the sector, given that prices could come under greater pressure in the short
term. It did recommend Roussel however, noting that its position will be
enhanced further by restructuring.
Eurotunnel went in the opposite direction, down FFr1.85 to FFr50.15 after
announcing that the May 8 opening of the passenger service could be delayed.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by activity, particularly from UK and US investors,
among the heavily capitalised issues. The AEX index rose 8.11 or 1.9 per
cent to 436.54.
Nedlloyd added 10 per cent on a positive profit forecast for 1994, the
shares gaining Fl 7.00 to Fl 76.60. The group also said that it was
launching a Fl 300m convertible bond which would be used to repay debt.
MILAN recovered on domestic and foreign buying, the Comit index rising 12.87
or 1.9 per cent to a year's high of 677.75.
Fiat companies benefited as investors, trying to rebuild positions, met a
dearth of sellers. Fiat rose L173 or 3.6 per cent to L4,963 and Ifil added
L336 or 5.4 per cent to L6,544 amid renewed speculation that it might sell
all or part of its Rinascente stake. Rinascente gained L569 or 6 per cent to
L10,047.
The banking sector continued to receive support from the success of the IMI
privatisation and plans to force any group taking controlling blocks in
privatised banks to launch a public offer. Credito Italiano rose L131 or 5.2
per cent to L2,691 and BCI L195 or 3.7 per cent to L5,486. IMI, making its
debut on the bourse today, was quoted at L12,500-L13,000 on the grey market
yesterday, compared with the offer price of L10,900.
ZURICH encountered late profit-taking and the SMI index finished 7.4 ahead
at 3,097.2 after a high of 3,140.3.
Chemicals, however, held on to the best of their gains, Roche certificates
adding SFr110 to SFr7,180 and Ciba registered SFr15 to SFr920.
Banks, recently firm, were out of favour: CS Holding dipped SFr9 to SFr730
and UBS bearers dipped SFr8 to SFr920.
Alusuisse put on SFr16 to SFr624 as it forecast improved 1994 profits.
MADRID closed off its highs, but the general index still rose 4.81 to 353.98
in active turnover of Pta49.5bn. Electrical utilities were the strong
feature, after weakness in banks and construction on Monday.
BRUSSELS parlayed Monday's bank rate cut, and its relative strength that
day, into a new record high, the Bel-20 index ending 8.49 higher at 1,535.60
with basket trading again strongly in evidence.
OSLO rose in anticipation of a rate cut which came after hours, the
all-share index closing 14.63, or 2.2 per cent higher at 683.59. General
optimism was also reported ahead of tomorrow's string of 1993 results.
HELSINKI gained 2.3 per cent with banks and forestry in the lead, the Hex
index closing 44.2 higher at 1,943.6.
DUBLIN rebounded after Monday's 3.4 per cent slide, as the market was
encouraged by the interest rate developments in London. The ISEQ index added
46.29 or 2.3 per cent to 2,023.32.
ISTANBUL fell back more than 6 per cent as investors continued to transfer
funds into money markets to take advantage of high interest rates. The
composite index lost 1,131.16 to 17,081.15.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Rate cut lowers sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling yesterday moved lower against leading currencies after the Bank of
England announced a 25 basis-point cut in the minimum lending rate, writes
Philip Gawith.
The decision to reduce rates to 5.25 per cent from 5.50 per cent received a
mixed reception in the market. Some applauded the scope and timing of the
move, while others questioned the government's motives and said it would
harm sterling.
The pound fell some two pfennigs to trade at DM2.59 before recovering to
close in London at DM2.5956, compared with Monday's DM2.6111. It also
declined by more than a cent to end at USDollars 1.47, down from a previous
USDollars 1.4811.
While sterling's drop was by no means calamitous, observers said the extent
of its weakening left the rate cut 'at the margin' in terms of success.
The Bank's announcement caught the market unawares. Most observers had been
predicting a  1/2 percentage point reduction in late March ahead of tax
increases that come into effect in April. It is 10 years since the Bank last
cut rates by  1/4 point. Many in the market welcomed this new approach,
saying it lent greater flexibility to the conduct of monetary policy. Others
noted that it appears to represent a shift towards the more incremental,
fine-tuning of policy favoured by many countries in continental Europe.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, told reporters that future
interest rate cuts were likely to be of a similar size to yesterday's 25
basis points.
There was some puzzlement about the timing of the move. The government said
the announcement was timed to coincide with the release of its latest
inflation report, but some observers queried whether the report shed any new
light on the inflation outlook. The government firmly resisted suggestions
that the rate move was timed to obtain political advantage.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, commented: 'This has
nothing to do with elections or tax rises. It has everything to do with
wanting to have interest rates as low as they can be consistent with
maintaining downward pressure on inflation.'
One view is that the Bank would probably have liked to delay cuts for a
while, but had its hand forced by events. One commentator noted: 'They
probably recognised that if they did not move now they might not be able to
move at all.'
Three factors in particular have lessened room for manoeuvre: the new trend
in US interest rates; the prospect that the January inflation figures, to be
released next week, may well show inflation rising and make presentation of
a policy-easing difficult; and the fact that tax increases will soon be
taking effect.
Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, told reporters the
decision had been taken last week at his monthly monetary meeting with the
chancellor, and the announcement timed to coincide with the release of
yesterday's encouraging inflation report.
Another view heard in the market was that the size of the rate cut
represented a compromise between the government's wish for a  1/2 percentage
point change and the Bank's desire to hold its fire for the time being. The
Bank was said not to want to reduce rates too much ahead of an upcoming
gilts auction. The last auction was not particularly successful in
attracting funds.
The D-Mark and other EMS currencies traded in fairly narrow ranges with the
focus on sterling. Following Friday's increase in US rates, the German
currency held up quite well against the dollar to end at DM1.7658, slightly
lower than Monday's DM1.7630 close. It finished New York trading at
DM1.7650.
The Bundesbank continued its recent practice and set the weekly repo at a
fixed 6 per cent rate with a 14-day maturity. There had earlier been
speculation that it might set a lower rate, which would have indicated a
willingness for rates to fall.
Dealers in Frankfurt said the Bundesbank was intervening in the market,
buying D-Marks for dollars at around the DM1.7650 level. London dealers said
there was no evidence of the central bank's involvement in the market beyond
its normal covert operations.
The outlook for the yen remains fairly uncertain even after the passage of a
Y15.25trillion (million million) fiscal package. Although Japanese officials
said it should boost GNP by 2.2 per cent over a year, comments from senior
US officials made clear that the US has no intention of easing pressure on
Japan ahead of Friday's trade summit between President Clinton and Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, described the package as a
'modest step'. The yen closed in London at Y108.900 to the dollar,
marginally down from Monday's Y108.705. In New York it ended at Y108.75.
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 50m of late
assistance yesterday. Earlier in the day the Bank provided Pounds 1.024bn of
liquidity, compared to a revised forecast of a Pounds 1.1bn liquidity
shortage. The outright and repurchase agreements with the market were
conducted, following the rate cuts, at new rates of 5 1/8 per cent and 5
5/32 respectively.

The main precious metals prices extended this week's falls yesterday as
charts pointed to tests of the bottom ends of their recent ranges. The GOLD
price closed Dollars 4.30 down at Dollars 380.40 a troy ounce while silver
was off 11 cents at Dollars 5.23 1/2 an ounce. On trader suggested gold
could test support at Dollars 375. 'It will be an almighty battle to stop it
falling further,' he added.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA prices both ended the day
in the plus columns after coffee steadied itself late in the session
following a slide prompted by selling in New York. Dealers said coffee's
initial weakness had been inspired by a classic case of 'buy the rumour,
sell the fact' as the New York market fell after confirmation of a sharp
fall in certified stocks.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea re-export plan
angers growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian tea industry is up in arms about a proposal to import tea into
the country for blending with the locally grown tea and re-export. Growers
fear such a move could debase the quality image of the country's tea.
The idea has been around for some years, but the prospect is now looming
larger following the commerce ministry's decision to canvas industry opinion
about it.
Tea processing units located in the export processing zones are already
allowed to import tea for re-export in packets, tea bags or in instant form
with a minimum value addition of 20 per cent. But according to Mr SK Bhasin,
vice chairman of the Indian Tea Association this 'has not yielded any
worthwhile result'.
Tea blenders and exporters maintain, however, that it should be possible to
find fair tea in the world market at lower than Dollars 1.10 a kilogram, the
present average price for south Indian tea.
Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, director of Mcleod Russel, does not agree. 'The tea that is
available at less than Dollars 1 a kilogram is fibrous and stalky,' he says.
'Much of this tea in India will be treated as waste tea. Therefore, if we
import such tea and blend it with Indian tea for re-export, then our tea
will get a bad name in the world market.'
Mr RK Krishna Kumar, managing director of Tata Tea, estimates that India
generated about 35m kg of tea waste in 1993 in the course of producing over
755m kg of marketable tea.
'Not many gardens in the country have the expertise to extract tea solids
from tea waste,' he says. 'The tea solids which are water soluble are used
to make instant tea. Till now, we are using only a small portion of the tea
waste to extract tea solids and caffeine. India is the only tea producing
country in the world which strictly enforces quality standards and does not
permit the marketing of tea waste. We must not allow the import of tea waste
in the name of fair tea.'
The tea producing industry feels that once the import of bulk tea is allowed
the importers will press the government to let them sell some of it, blended
with Indian tea, in the domestic market. Units in the export processing
zones are generally allowed to sell 25 per cent of their production in the
domestic market. However, the value-added tea produced from imported tea is
not allowed to be marketed within the country.
According to Mr Ahmad: 'If low value foreign tea finds its way into the
Indian market, it will spell disaster for teas grown in south India, Dooars,
Terai and Cachar'.
Mr Bhasin rejects the contention of the import lobby that 'the re-export of
tea to be imported in bulk will supplement India's present export of around
200m kg'. He thinks such a move would simply lead to replacement of Indian
tea exports with teas from other countries. 'The government must not
forget,' he warns, 'that India generally has a surplus of over 200m kg of
tea which must be exported if there is not to be a crash in tea prices.'
However, Mr SM Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, argued at tea convention
organised last year by the consultative committee of plantation associations
that India whose annual per capita consumption of the beverage was a
'negligible' 630g, should take steps to 'accelerate the growth of domestic
tea consumption, which would allow the mopping up of the relatively low
quality surpluses of Indonesia, Kenya and Malawi'.
He suggested that this would make room for the higher quality and higher
priced teas from India in the world market 'without setting off a price
war'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Joint venturers to develop
Argentine mine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's MIM Holdings and International Musto Explorations of Canada have
announced they will jointly develop Argentina's first world class mine in a
Dollars 600m project.
The Bajo de la Alumbrera copper and gold mine in the Andes foothills,
1,000km north-west of Buenos Aires, is said to be the largest of its kind in
Latin America and one of the ten largest in the world.
Musto completed an 18 month feasibility study of Bajo de la Alumbrera last
year. It established reserves of 5.8bn lb of copper and 10m troy ounces of
gold, giving the mine a life of at least 20 years.
Argentina's Andes are believed to have geology similar to Chile, which has a
major mining industry. But development was until recently hampered by
restrictive legislation, political and economic turbulence and lack of a
local mining tradition. Last year Argentina reformed its mining laws,
scrapping controls on foreign investment.
Mr Lukas Lundin, Musto's president, said the open cast mine would begin
production in 1997 at an initial rate of 200m lb of copper and 470,000
ounces of gold a year. He expects a return on investment of at least 15 per
cent. The companies have signed a letter of intent and plan to sign a
contract in March.
The mine will be developed as a 50:50 joint venture with MIM responsible for
operating and financing the project. Mr Phil Wright, MIM's executive general
manager for corporate development, said MIM would provide Dollars 240m for
the project, with the remainder coming from bank project financing.
The property belongs to the state-owned YMAD mining corporation, which will
take a 20 per cent share of net profit. Musto holds 100 per cent tenancy of
the mine.
The government has promised not to change the project's tax treatment for 30
years, exempted import duties for equipment and placed a 3 per cent cap on
royalties.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian producer cuts iron
ore price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hamersley Iron, the big Australian iron ore producer yesterday announced
that it would cut iron ore price by an average of 7.6 per cent, following
the annual round of negotiations with the Japanese steel mills.
Hamersley, part of the CRA group, said that the price of lump ore would
decline by 5.9 per cent to 33.26 US cents a dry long ton unit, while the
price of fine ore would fall by 9.5 per cent, to 25.66 cents. This gives a
weighted average decrease of 7.6 per cent. The minimum volume to be
delivered has been set at 19m tonnes - the same as last year.
This is the third successive year of price cuts. At the beginning of 1993,
the price of fine ore fell by 11 per cent, and lump, by 9 per cent.
Hamersley admitted that the negotiations had been 'unusually complex and
lengthy', and stressed that 'agreement should be seen in the context of the
parlous state of the Japanese economy'.
'The combined losses of the Japanese mills will exceed Y240bn this year and
they are forecasting further reductions in steel production and iron ore
demand next year. Furthermore, the fact that suppliers of other raw
materials have already granted significant price decreases only serves to
raise buyers' expectations', said Mr Roddy Kinkead-Weekes, Hamersley's
managing director for sales and marketing.
The last comment was a reference to the recently-announced coal price
contracts with the Japanese mills, which saw Australian producers take price
cuts of up to 9.5 per cent.
Hamersley described the iron ore deal as 'mutually satisfactory' under the
circumstances - a view generally shared by analysts, and CRA shares rose 38
cents to ADollars 19.26.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU warned against
protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European farming industry must abandon protectionism against
agricultural imports from eastern Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade
commissioner, said yesterday.
Sir Leon, addressing the annual meeting of the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales, said relations with eastern Europe were one of the most
important issues facing agriculture in the EU in the next few years.
He warned of 'disastrous consequences' if the EU failed to help its east
European neighbours to make a peaceful transition to mature democracy and
stability.
'In the longer term, it is likely that parts of central and eastern Europe
will be able to benefit from exporting onto the world market without
subsidy, because they have the potential to be tremendously efficient,' he
said. 'This is a prospect which has to be confronted with courage and
generosity, not with fear and protectionism.'
Concern about an influx of cheap imports from eastern Europe has maintained
restrictions on farm products in the association agreements which give
preferential trade treatment to Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak
republics, Romania and Bulgaria.
The UK soft fruit sector is currently worried about Polish imports of fruit
pulp for processing. Mr David Hadley, a senior agriculture ministry official
at the meeting, admitted certain sectors faced problems but said EU trade
concessions to eastern Europe were 'pretty small'.
Sir Leon, speaking by video because he was detained in Brussels by the
foreign ministers' meeting, said Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
depended heavily on agriculture.
But these sectors were undergoing upheaval. 'Production levels have fallen,
privatisation is changing the size of holdings and the type of farming which
is practised, previous markets and distribution networks have disappeared,'
he said.
The EU must help efficient restructuring by offering expertise and funds and
by gradually increasing market access and refraining from harmful practices.
'For example, we need to look carefully at our system of export refunds,'
said Sir Leon. 'We have recently ended refunds on apple exports to the Czech
and Slovak Republics because our exports were causing serious problems for
local apple producers.'
Sir Leon sought to reassure EU farmers that the Gatt deal would allow common
agricultural policy support to continue unchallenged for nine years, thanks
to the 'peace clause' agreed between the US and the EU.
But he said one of the main aims of future direct aid to farmers must be to
protect the environment.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusuisse's Essen plant to
close permanently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alusuisse-Lonza is to make the first permanent aluminium output cut to be
announced following the agreement by some of the world's big
aluminium-producing countries to reduce global annual supply.
The Swiss group is to shut its smelter at Essen in Germany with the loss of
400 jobs. The smelter has an annual capacity of about 130,000 tonnes but
recently has been producing only between 40,000 and 50,000 tonnes.
Alusuisse says the smelter has suffered substantial losses and 'even if
western producing countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States can
put into effect agreements on desired production cuts, no significant
improvement can be expected for the foreseeable future in the situation for
central European aluminium smelters'.
As the market absorbed the news from Alusuisse and the overnight statement
from Alcoa (the Aluminium Company of America) that it would immediately cut
annual output by another 100,000 tonnes, aluminium's price on the London
Metal Exchange rose to Dollars 1,310 a tonne.
However, chart-based selling of most LME metals affected aluminium in quiet
conditions and the price fell back to close at Dollars 1,295.50, down
Dollars 5 a tonne. Analysts said metal prices were due for a correction
after recent sharp rises. Also the market was quieter than usual because of
the Chinese New Year.
Alusuisse previously closed its Swiss smelter and is now left only with two,
one in Iceland, producing about 96,000 tonnes a year, and the other in
Norway, producing an annual 40,000 tonnes. It said it had no plans to cut
output at these plants.
Alcoa's new cuts, which will result in a first-quarter charge, affect the
Rockdale, Texas, and Wenatchee, Washington, smelters.
Analysts suggested that Pechiney's Venthon smelter in France, producing
about 30,000 tonnes a year, was another candidate in Europe for permanent
shut-down.

The flood of equity-linked international offerings from South-East Asian
companies shows no sign of abating, with large deals lined up from Indonesia
and Thailand.
Indofoods, Indonesia's largest food company which dominates the Indonesian
instant noodle market, is planning to launch an international equity or
equity-linked offerings for a total of up to Dollars 800m this spring,
investment bankers said. UBS has won the mandate for the deal.
Meanwhile, Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, launched a Dollars 400m
10-year convertible Eurobond issue earlier this week which is due to be
priced later this month.
Aokam Perdana, the Malaysian timber company, is planning a Dollars 125m,
10-year convertible Eurobond issue, which will raise money to refinance its
existing borrowings as well as providing new funds. Details of the issue
have not been finalised. Jardine Fleming has been appointed lead manager.
While there have been plenty of Thai convertible Eurobonds in recent months,
few Malaysian companies have taken the opportunity to launch such issues.
Asian equity specialists point out that this partly reflects the quite
favourable financing opportunities in the domestic market.
Aokam was quoted on AP-Dow Jones saying the issue will allow it 'to access
the currently favourable market for Asian Euro-convertibles and to diversify
its funding sources'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National in Dollars 1bn FRN offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Floating rate notes were the flavour of the day in the international bond
market once again, as Friday's quarter-point rise in US short-term interest
rates continued to stimulate investor interest in this particular sector.
Looking ahead, syndicate officials said the market was preparing for a
handful of large global straight bond issues, including a Dollars 750m deal
for the National Bank of Hungary and a Dollars 750m offering for the Asian
Development Bank.
Abbey National launched a Dollars 1bn five-year FRN with a coupon of
three-month Libor minus 6.25 basis points. The bonds were priced at 99.71 to
give a yield of three-month Libor, currently quoted at 3 1/2 -3 9/16 per
cent.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey's director of corporate finance and capital
markets, said the Fed's move had provided an obvious opportunity to do a
floating rate issue, adding that investor demand for FRNs has been strong in
recent months.
Goldman Sachs, lead manager for the deal, said it had wanted to bring a
large, liquid FRN issue at around Libor to take advantage of fund manager
appetite for floating rate dollars. The lead manager said it had seen
renewed demand for Canada's recent Dollars 2bn five-year FRN deal, which
convinced it that a large deal for Abbey would work.
In pricing the Abbey deal, Goldman said it looked at recent FRN issues such
as the Dollars 2bn issue from Province of Ontario which currently offers a
yield of Libor plus 7 basis points. However, other syndicate managers
remarked that the pricing on the Abbey deal was 'very tight'. The bonds will
break syndicate today
The sterling sector saw plenty of excitement, reflecting the volatile
conditions in the underlying UK government bond market. The quarter-point
cut in the UK base rate first thing in the day sent gilt prices as much as a
point higher in the morning and made the launch of certain sterling deals
more difficult.
As a result of the base rate cut, Baring Brothers decided not to use the
fixed price re-offer system for the Pounds 100m, five-year Eurobond deal
which it brought for IKB Finance, the German bank which specialises in
lending to medium-sized industries.
Also in the sterling sector, De Beers Centenary, the Lucerne-registered part
of the De Beers group which holds all of the non-South African interests,
launched its first bond issue.
The bond proceeds will be used partly to repay some of the company's short
and medium-term borrowings, and partly to augment existing facilities.
The Pounds 150m 15-year deal has a coupon of 8.25 per cent and offers a
yield of 165 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. The issue,
which was aimed predominantly at UK investors, had a launch price of 98.973
and traded up to 99.00-99.25 by late afternoon.

<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier planning a flotation on the US stock
market by the end of next month, scraped into profitability in the fourth
quarter with net income of Dollars 10.5m compared with net losses of Dollars
695.2m last time.
The company said yesterday that the figure would have been higher without
the impact of an Dollars 85m accounting charge relating to new labour
contracts. Operating profits were Dollars 74.8m compared with operating
losses of Dollars 185.4m last time, it said.
For the full year, the airline reported a turnround from operating losses of
Dollars 376.2m to operating profits of Dollars 292.4m. But it was still in
the red after tax, showing net losses of Dollars 115.3m compared with losses
of Dollars 1.08bn last time. The previous year's figures included
non-recurring pre-tax charges of Dollars 792.7m.
Northwest Airlines left the stock market in 1989 when it underwent a Dollars
3.65bn leveraged buy-out. It narrowly escaped bankruptcy last year by
persuading employees to accept a 37.5 per cent equity stake in the company
in return for labour concessions valued at Dollars 886m over three years.
USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake,
yesterday intensified airline competition in the US domestic market by
announcing widespread fare cuts on services departing from 96 of the 213
cities it serves.
The cuts are more radical than the special offers announced by several other
US airlines in the last few weeks because they have no special conditions
attached and will stay in force indefinitely.
USAir, which serves mainly the eastern half of the US, said some of the cuts
had been made in response to fares being offered by low-cost competitors
like Continental Airways and Southwest Airlines, and others had been made to
discourage low-cost operators from entering its markets.

Quebecor, the printing, publishing and forest products group, reported a 93
per cent gain in operating income in 1993, with better results from most of
its businesses.
Net income from operations was CDollars 75m (USDollars 57.2m), or CDollars
1.11 a share, against CDollars 56.2m, or 85 cents, a year earlier, up 31 per
cent. Revenues were CDollars 3.1bn, up 21 per cent.
However, after special items final net profit was CDollars 74.6m, or
CDollars 1.10, against CDollars 87.3m, or CDollars 1.34.
The company's biggest single unit is Quebecor Printing, north America's
second-biggest commercial printer. It has just acquired 49 per cent of
Groupe Jean Didier, France's leading commercial printer. Later Quebecor will
take full control of Didier which has annual sales of about USDollars 350m.
Quebecor Printing said it was also looking at acquisitions in Italy and the
UK.

Sanwa Tatemono, a Japanese property developer, has filed for court
protection under the bankruptcy law with debts totalling Y124.3bn (Dollars
1.14bn), the largest financial failure in three months.
The decision by the company, which does not have a stock exchange listing,
will be a serious blow to its creditor banks, including Nippon Trust Bank
(NTB), Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Sakura Bank.
According to Teikoku Data Bank, the private credit research agency, NTB, the
company's largest investor, has over Y30bn in loans and loan guarantees.
The bank expects to write off the bulk of its loans to Sanwa, which is
unrelated to Sanwa Bank, and intends to avoid falling into the red by
covering the losses incurred with proceeds from stock sales.
However, analysts fear such sales will depress NTB's unrealised gains on its
stock portfolio.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gibraltar group builds 7% stake
in Montedison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Montedison, the Italian industrial group which is part of the
troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, rose by L11 to
L1,197 yesterday after news that a mysterious buyer now controlled almost 7
per cent of the stock.
The admission came from Codelouf, a little-known Gibraltar-based concern
operating out of London. A lawyer acting for Codelouf said it would own 4
per cent of Montedison's voting shares at the end of the current stock
market account, ending February 28.
Codelouf, whose ultimate owners are unknown, has also acquired about 380m
Montedison share warrants, accounting for a further 2.9 per cent of the
voting capital on conversion.
The news goes some way to explain the surge in Montedison's share price
since shareholders and bank creditors agreed on a restructuring plan late
last year. The restructuring, which has seen Ferfin's stake in Montedison
fall to about 30 per cent from around 48 per cent, also involved one of
Italy's largest share and warrant issues.
Rather than being left to the underwriters - largely made up of Montedison's
leading bank creditors - the issue was strongly taken up, and the group's
stock has powered ahead on the back of extremely high daily trading volumes.
The high turnover and steadily rising share price have triggered speculation
about stake building, possibly ahead of a bid. Montedison is Ferfin's main
industrial operation, and controls a number of important subsidiaries such
as Montecatini (chemicals), Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar) and Edison (energy).
Among potential raiders are the Fiat-controlled Gemina holding company,
possibly in conjunction with Mediobanca, and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former
Ferruzzi executive, who now runs an independent merchant bank. All have
denied stake building.
Earlier this month, Italy's Consob stock market watchdog confirmed the
extraordinary volume of trading in Montedison shares, but said no
shareholder had yet reached 2 per cent of the capital, at which stage a
formal announcement must be made.

However, analysts fear such sales will depress NTB's unrealised gains on its
stock portfolio, which totalled Y65.4bn at the end of September last year.
Sanwa invested heavily in office buildings, golf course developments and
resort development projects in Perth, Australia during the late 1980s.
However, the plunge in asset prices and the subsequent economic downfall
hurt demand, leaving the company with mounting debts.
Hakuhodo, Japan's second-largest advertising agency, reports
non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year ended November, its first
profit in four years.
The company posted a 10.8 per cent pre-tax profit rise, to Y4.72bn, in spite
of a 5.8 per cent fall in sales, to Y526.3bn. It was the third consecutive
yearly fall in sales, and was blamed on cuts in advertising costs at
Japanese corporations.
After-tax profit fell 55 per cent to Y207bn due to special losses stemming
from an increase in pension payment reserves.
For the current year to November, the company expects pre-tax profits to
halve to Y2.48bn, on unchanged sales.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Polypropylene venture probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A chemicals joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Montedison, the
industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire, could dominate the
technology for producing polypropylene in Europe, the European Commission
said yesterday.
The Commission opened an in-depth inquiry into the Dollars 6.6bn joint
venture to find out whether such dominance could hamper competition in the
polypropylene sector.
Brussels officials said the companies' technology - Spheripol developed by
Montedison and Unipol developed by Shell and Union Carbide of the US - was
used by 70 per cent of the world's polypropylene manufacturers.
However, Shell said it was querying the Commission's official statement on
the investigation because Unipol was not covered by the deal, which brings
together most of the two companies' polyolefin activities.
The inquiry could last up to four months, further delaying a deal which was
first discussed in September 1992. Talks were first held up last May by the
collapse of the Ferruzzi family's business empire, and only went ahead when
the second phase of a restructuring plan was agreed before Christmas.
Both Shell and Montedison said yesterday they had expected the Commission to
open an in-depth inquiry into the deal, because of its size - the joint
venture would become the world's largest polypropylene manufacturer - and
complexity. If the Commission decides the venture is anti-competitive it can
block it or, more likely, ask for the deal to be amended.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bonanza for Chicago exchanges -
Surging volumes fuel the profit-sharing debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, toasted a year
of record volume in December with the prediction that 'under the right
conditions, like the Fed changing its interest rate policy, the roof could
blow off this place'.
Last Friday the Fed struck, reversing its five-year-old policy of easier
credit, and Mr Sandner got his volume explosion. In the biggest single day
in futures industry history, the CME turned over an estimated 2.5m
contracts, exceeding the previous record by nearly 1m contracts.
The surge of business at the CME, which was echoed in the financial futures
pits at the its big futures rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, and in
over-the-counter interest rate swaps dealings, came as money managers rushed
to re-adjust their interest rate hedges.
Since interest rate risk products account for more than 80 per cent of their
business, this upsurge in volatility was a bonanza for the two big Chicago
futures exchanges. But it not only translates into higher income for the
exchanges: it is bound to accelerate the debate over who gets to share in
those profits.
Unlike their much newer European counterparts, the CBoT, the CME and the New
York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) are owned by their individual members, for
the most part a tightly-knit cadre of independent futures traders and
trading companies.
The exchanges are non profit-making entities, organised more like private
clubs than businesses. Members benefit from exchange success indirectly.
They do not collect dividends from the exchange.
When fees exceed expenses, exchange profits are invested in the exchange or
put into an equity fund. To this end the CME last year spent Dollars 28m to
double the size of its trading space and is investing Dollars 20m to upgrade
trade clearing technology. The CBoT and the Nymex each have multi-million
dollar building plans in the pipeline. Members' equity at the CBoT topped
Dollars 128m last year, and was over Dollars 100m at the CME.
Exchange leaders are now looking for a way to unlock some of those dollars.
Mr Sandner believes the inability to distribute profits discourages
investment in the exchange. At the same time, the CME's success in the form
of seat prices is keeping new blood away. Seats, changing hands for Dollars
650,000 or so, are beyond the pocket of young traders.
He thinks a profit-making structure that separates trading rights from
equity ownership, and prices them separately, would benefit the exchange,
and has ordered a comprehensive examination of the issue.
The plan looks set to be controversial in that it could eventually end floor
trader control over exchange governance. However, the promise of cash
returns - dividends - could dispel any exchange dissent.
At the CBoT, an internal study last year criticised the exchange for
strategic blindness and disorganised governance. Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, the
management consultancy, has studied alternatives to the existing operating
structure in the wake of that report, and will produce its findings later
this year.
Mr Daniel Rappaport, chairman of Nymex, has asked the exchange's lawyers and
investment bankers to draft a for-profit ownership plan. Having a means to
distribute exchange profits is important, he says, because the interests of
the exchange are no longer tied exclusively to the floor.
Nymex, the central marketplace for world energy trading, sits at the edge of
an information highway it is anxious to explore. It already has a
computerised after-hours trading system, Access, and will soon launch
Enersoft, an electronic information service for the natural gas industry. To
support these off-floor investments, Mr Rappaport says, members must be able
to share in their profits.
Mr Rappaport says the switch to profit-making status, long avoided because
of its income tax liabilities, will not change exchange ownership. 'We are
not intending to go public,' he says. 'The same people will own the
exchange.'
However, he admits that the trading and ownership rights now bound into a
Nymex membership could be 'unstapled' some time in the future.
Plans for dividend-paying futures exchanges, however, could run foul of an
important constituency - the exchanges' public customers. Mr Hal Hanson,
chairman of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group for
broker-dealers who represent public customers, contends that rather than pay
dividends to self-interested traders, exchanges should lower customer
trading fees and other costs.
'These exchanges ought to be in business to meet their customers'
requirements,' Mr Hanson says. 'If they're successful doing that it has an
enormous benefit to the floor trader, because it is the public orders that
make this trading system work.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Non-defence business grows at
Lockheed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US aerospace group, said its non-defence businesses grew to 36
per cent of its total sales in 1993, up from 33 per cent in 1992, Reuter
reports.
Sales to foreign countries for the year ended December 26 1993 rose to 13
per cent of the total, against 8 per cent a year earlier.
In the fourth quarter, the defence industry group earned Dollars 135m, or
Dollars 2.13 share, on sales of Dollars 3.7bn, compared with net income of
Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.95 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.9bn.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive, said: '1993 was an
outstanding year for Lockheed. We had a solid increase in earnings,
generated substantial cash flow and significantly reduced outstanding debt.'
He added: 'Our strong cash flow and rapidly improving debt position give us
the flexibility to explore other means to enhance shareholder value,
including strategically and financially attractive acquisitions.'
He said the company reduced its outstanding debt in 1993 by Dollars 400m and
by the year-end, its net debt to capital ratio was 42 per cent, against 46
per cent in the first quarter.
In 1993, Lockheed acquired Lockheed Forth Worth to heighten its position in
the military aircraft market. The acquisition was a primary factor in
year-over-year sales and earnings growth, Lockheed said.
'With a firm backlog of nearly 600 F-16 tactical fighter aircraft, the Forth
Worth company will continue to have a very positive influence on our future
earnings and cash flow,' Mr Tellep said.
At the year-end, total order backlog was Dollars 28.9bn, nearly 50 per cent
over the Dollars 19.4bn backlog at the end of 1992.
In the full-year, the group recorded net profit of Dollars 422m, or Dollars
6.70 a share. This compares with a loss of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 4.58,
for 1992 after a one-time accounting charge.
Excluding the charge, there would have been a net profit of Dollars 348m, or
Dollars 5.65 a share, for 1992.

42 per cent stake in LanChile, Chile's leading airline. The shares could
change hands for around Dollars 19m.
SAS said the stake was no longer strategically important following the
collapse of its plans to merge with Swissair, Austrian Airlines and KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines in the so-called Alcazar project. It stopped flying to
South America in January 1992.
The holding is being bought by two Chilean investors, the Cueto family and
Mr Boris Hirmas, who already own 20 per cent of the airline. The Chilean
government is expected to sell its 22 per cent holding in the airline soon.
SAS said the disposal would produce a small capital gain. The move is not
connected to its broader restructuring plan which aims to cut costs by
SKr2.5bn (Dollars 313m).
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, is selling
three finance subsidiaries to GE Capital, part of the General Electric group
of the US.
The units all belong to the bank's FinansSkandic subsidiary and have total
assets of SKr5.8bn. The businesses being sold are SkandicBilfinans, a
vehicle financing unit; Vendax, a computer leasing specialist; and Nordic
Finans, which concentrates on office and data equipment.

Allstate, the diversified US insurance group which was floated on the stock
market last summer, reported a further profits rebound in the final quarter
of 1993 after heavy losses from hurricane Andrew the year before.
Mr Wayne Hedien, chairman and chief executive, said the company would be
able to 'accelerate growth in our major business segments sooner than we
anticipated,' thanks to its stronger operating profits and the proceeds from
sales of securities.
Allstate reported net income of Dollars 259m, or 57 cents a share, for the
final quarter and Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 2.99, for the year. In 1992, it
had losses of Dollars 139m in the final quarter and Dollars 825m (Dollars
500m before accounting changes) for the year. Hurricane Andrew led to
post-tax losses of Dollars 506m in the quarter and Dollars 1.65bn in 1992.
Leaving aside the hurricane, operating income rose to Dollars 1.16bn in the
year from Dollars 1.04bn, as overall revenues grew by 3.5 per cent to
Dollars 20.9bn. Underwriting results in the property and casualty business
improved, with the combined loss ratio falling to 103 in 1993 from 105 the
year before.

Mattel, the US toy-maker that took over the Fisher-Price toy company in
December, reported consolidated net losses of Dollars 42.7m for the fourth
quarter, but said it would have made net profits of Dollars 62.4m without a
Dollars 115m pre-tax charge relating to the merger - 26 per cent more than
the consolidated figure for the comparable quarter.
The merged company reported net income of Dollars 117m for 1993, but said
the figure would have been Dollars 226m without the merger costs, compared
with a consolidated figure of Dollars 184.8m for the previous year.
Mattel said net sales rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 754m in the fourth
quarter. Although the company will have to deal with the effects of a
strengthening dollar on its overseas earnings this year, it said substantial
operating efficiencies should flow from the integration of Mattel and
Fisher-Price over the past two months.

High levels of stock market activity helped McIntosh Securities, Australia's
only quoted stockbroking firm, to a ADollars 9.6m (USDollars 6.9m) profit
after tax but before abnormals. McIntosh is the product of a merger with the
Australian operations of Britain's Baring Securities.
The figure compares with a loss of ADollars 3.1m in the same period of 1992.
Operating revenues surged by 67 per cent to ADollars 58m.
McIntosh said that, on a calendar year basis, 1993 was its most profitable
trading period since 1989 - a result attributed partly to 'the buoyant
trading conditions in the securities industry,' and partly to internal
operational changes.
The wave of new issues coming to the stock market also helped push up the
results.
An abnormal profit of ADollars 12.1m from the sale of Equinet alsohelped,
leaving profits after tax and abnormals at ADollars 21.7m, compared with a
loss of ADollars 4.34m a year ago.

Charoen Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the listed Thai agro-industry company of
the multinational CP group, yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in net
profits, to Bt1.2bn (Dollars 47.2m) last year from Bt1.15bn in 1992.
The company said it expected higher revenues in 1994 from prawn feed, which
already accounts for more than 60 per cent of CPF's sales. Thailand is the
world's largest producer of farmed shrimp, and the feed market is expected
to grow 15 per cent in 1994.
CPF is planning to build a third prawn feed plant in Thailand, and is
considering investments in Vietnam, Mexico and the Indian sub-continent.
CPF earnings per share were Bt10.01 for the year, up from Bt9.59 the year
before. Revenues and other figures have yet to be released.
Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and CP Northeastern, CPF subsidiaries, both
announced lower profits.
BAP's net profit fell to Bt104.4m from Bt118.4m, while CPNE's was down to
Bt84.2m from Bt88.9m.
CPF also holds 5 per cent of TelecomAsia, the recently-floated CP company
installing 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Highveld Steel checks four-year
profit slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profit at Highveld Steel and Vanadium, the Anglo-American owned
metals producer, has advanced 16 per cent to R86.1m (Dollars 25.1m) in the
year to December 31, against R74.4m in 1992. The result marks the end of a
four-year slide in profitability.
An improved total dividend of 50 cents is declared, compared with 45 cents
last time. Highveld has offered a scrip alternative - taken up by
controlling shareholder the Anglo American Industrial Corporation - to
conserve its cash resources as it continues to finance its 33 per cent share
of the R2.5bn Columbus Stainless Steel expansion project.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said resurgent domestic demand for steel -
associated with the construction of a number of large capital projects and
renewed economic growth - improved export steel prices, lifted by good
demand from China, and the rand's weakness against the dollar were the main
features of the year.
Turnover rose to R1.69bn from R1.49bn, with about half of sales derived from
steel operations and the remainder spread between the group's ferro-alloy,
aluminium can and stainless steel interests. Mr Boyd said most of Highveld's
facilities were operating at or near full capacity, with the exception of
its Vantra vanadium plant.
A higher tax charge offset the improved operating performance, so that
distributable profit before abnormal and extraordinary items slipped to
R69.3m from R70.8m, equivalent to 78.3 cents against 80 cents a share.
However, Highveld benefited from a one-off R57.9m deferred tax credit,
related to the reduction in the corporate tax rate in 1993, and R23.5m in
proceeds of the sale of one-sixth of its original stake in Columbus to the
state-owned Industrial Development Corporation.
Bottom-line income jumped to R150.7m from R76m.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has been partially privatised over the
past three years but is still 50.1 per cent government-owned, yesterday
provided further evidence of the recovery in the Australian banking sector.
It reported a 32.1 per cent rise in after-tax profits in the six months to
end-December.
CBA said it made a net profit of ADollars 317.9m (USDollars 228m) in the
period, compared with ADollars 240.7m a year earlier. Earnings per share
were 35.5 cents, up from 27.8 cents, and the interim dividend goes up by 4
cents to 24 cents.
CBA admitted it had been a mixed half-year. Competition in the mortgage
market, the pressure on margins following the general reduction in interest
rates, and low levels of demand for business finance hampered progress.
As a result, interest income fell by just over 10 per cent to ADollars
3.04bn, and operating profit slipped to ADollars 2.13bn, compared with
ADollars 2.25bn in the previous year.
The interest spread during the half-year was 3.34 per cent, against 3.61 per
cent, while the interest margin dropped by almost 10 per cent, to 3.86 per
cent.
However, the boost to profits came from a much lower charge for bad and
doubtful debts. This totalled ADollars 182.9m in the six months, against
ADollars 346.5m last time.
By the end of the period, CBA's net non-accrual loans stood at ADollars
1.29bn, down 27.3 per cent on the ADollars 1.77bn at the end of 1992.
CBA said staff expenses were stable at ADollars 826.7m, with some initial
savings from the bank's operational restructuring offset by a resumption of
superannuation payments last July.
Looking forward, CBA said the improving economy should further help the bad
debt situation, and increase business demand for finance. However, it warned
that 'strong competitive pressures . . . will continue'.
'The contraction of revenue has stabilised in the past six months, but the
constraints on net interest income will remain in the short-term at least,'
said Mr David Murray, managing director. The outcome for the full year, he
added, should be 'satisfactory'.

<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest carrier by turnover, yesterday
announced a long-awaited restructuring plan designed to increase operating
profits by Y26bn (Dollars 239m) in 1994-95. ANA made post-tax profits of
Y2.4bn on sales of Y808bn during the year to March 1993.
ANA said turnover should be boosted by transferring about 20 per cent of
planning and administrative staff to sales and marketing positions. No
decisions had been made about new routes, acquisition of new aircraft and
capital investment, it added.
The plan includes a 10 per cent reduction in staff through reduced
recruitment, natural attrition, and the introduction of contract employees
for some cabin positions. The company expects to have trimmed the workforce
by 1,500 by March 1996. It stressed there would be no compulsory
redundancies.
Mr Seiji Fukatsu, president and chief executive, said: 'The global slump in
demand for air travel, continued recession at home and increased
competition, have left ANA facing the toughest challenge since its
foundation.' The company said it expected turnover to fall during the 12
months to March by 3 per cent to Y782bn, and was cautiously optimistic about
keeping in the black.
Separately ANA announced the conclusion of a deal with its rival, Japan Air
Lines, to co-operate in a number of areas, including maintenance facilities
for the Boeing 777 jets the two companies are buying.
This is the first time the two companies, which have been fierce
competitors, have formed a major alliance on technical matters and reflects
the growing need each faces to cut costs in the face of the industry slump.
The agreement is expected to save Y8bn to Y9bn over a five-year period, the
companies said. Both JAL and ANA are undergoing cost-cutting exercises in an
effort to reduce their high costs which have damaged their competitiveness
amid the slump in business and first class air travel, particularly among
Japanese leisure and business travellers.
Under the agreement, the airlines will jointly purchase parts for the Boeing
777, which will enter their fleets from 1997, as well as the Boeing 747 and
767.
The two airlines will also co-operate in repairing parts and in the
development and preparation of technical and staff training manuals, and
will share hangar space and other technical facilities such as engine test
cells they said.
'We're both in the same boat. We have huge inventories of spare parts and
pay enormous rents for hangar space,' JAL said.
The deal comes a week after JAL decided to pick the same Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines as ANA for the 777.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Indian group finds cure for
investment lethargy - Ranbaxy Laboratories is well placed to capitalise on
government reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Parvinder Singh, chairman of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's second-largest
drugs company, started building international links long before they became
fashionable in India.
Examining the success of the large western multinational pharmaceutical
companies, he decided in the early 1980s to concentrate on exports and seek
foreign partnerships. Ten years before Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, embarked on his widely-praised liberalisation, Mr Singh was
already establishing ties around the world.
Today, Ranbaxy's exports amount to over 30 per cent of its turnover; by the
year 2000, they are planned to rise to 45 per cent.
The group has a trading company in Hong Kong, joint venture manufacturing
plants in Nigeria, Malaysia and Canada, and another under construction in
southern China. It is talking to potential partners for joint-venture
marketing companies in the US and in Europe. It has an agreement with Eli
Lilly of the US for the sale of Eli Lilly products in India.
To help fund these ventures, Ranbaxy plans to tap international markets this
spring with a Dollars 100m equity issue.
The family-owned company has suffered from its share of the in-fighting
which has hit a number of Indian business families. Mr Singh, aged 51, took
control of Ranbaxy from his father Mr Bhai Mohan Singh, the company's
founder. However, Mr Singh senior tried to retain an influence over Ranbaxy
long after he handed over day-to-day management to his son in the early
1980s. Unlike some other family rows, however, these conflicts have not
prevented Ranbaxy from growing faster than any other leading Indian drugs
group.
With sales of Rs5.6bn (Dollars 180.6m) in the year to March 1993, and
pre-tax profits of Rs770m, Ranbaxy is still small by the standards of the
western drugs companies which dominate the international markets. Mr Singh,
however, is convinced that by exploiting the right niche opportunities he
can compete with the leaders, even in industrialised country markets.
The key to his plan is the fact that patents on important
internationally-known branded drugs expire in the next few years. They
include drugs in the two areas in which Ranbaxy has specialised: antibiotic
preparations made from flouroquinolones, and anti-bacterial medicines based
on cephalosporins.
Mr Singh says both drugs are reasonably difficult to make - so western
groups wanting to compete with the former patent-holders will value
Ranbaxy's techniques.
Mr Singh faces some formidable hurdles. First, the Indian pharmaceuticals
market has long been squeezed by strict government price controls, designed
to bring cheap medicines to the poor. These have limited the industry's
profits, and so its capacity to invest in research.
Also, operating under tightly-regulated conditions, it has had little need
to develop high-quality marketing skills. While the government is
considering easing restrictions, drugs companies do not expect radical
changes in the regime.
Moreover, Indian law has until now not acknowledged patents on products,
only on processes. So, Indian companies have been free to copy western drugs
simply by devising different ways of producing them. This has done nothing
to foster competition in product research and development.
At the same time, western companies have had every reason to be cautious
about sharing know-how.
Mr Singh says Ranbaxy has coped with these conditions better than other
Indian companies by not neglecting investment in improving production and
marketing.
In the 10 years to March 1993, the company's net asset rose from Rs141m to
Rs630m. Its plants in India and abroad are modern and have won official
approval from standards authorities in western countries, including the US's
tough FDA.
The emphasis on internationalisation has permeated the whole company, says
Mr Singh. 'Everyone has it at the forefront of their mind not to be
satisfied with success in the Indian market, but to aim for world markets,'
he says.
Mr Singh says Ranbaxy has also distanced itself from other Indian drugs
companies by advocating that India should accept western countries' demands
and protect products as well as processes. This may now be inevitable, as
India has accepted the conclusions of the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks,
in which the participants agreed to strengthen patent laws.
However, it may take some time for the laws to be enacted, and for the
enforcement agencies to be established.
Mr Singh argues that product patents are in Indian companies' long-term
interest: only such patents will encourage the Indians to develop their own
products.
Mr Singh is sure that India has the potential to become an innovator in
pharmaceuticals, given the quality of research engineers and the success of
Indian emigrants in other countries.
'We have the right ingredients for success,' says Mr Singh, who himself has
a doctorate in pharmacy. 'Deep-down we have an inquiring mind-set. Now that
the country is opening up, in the next five to 10 years there will be a
change in the industry. We will become more research minded.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pfizer shares tumble after
profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pfizer, until recently the US's highest-flying drugs company,
tumbled again yesterday as the company issued a muted profits warning for
the current quarter.
It also down played the most optimistic expectations of earnings growth for
the year as a whole.
Yesterday's comments, made at an analysts' meeting in New York, also dented
the shares price of other big drug companies, as investors marked down their
expectations of growth in the sector as a whole.
Pfizer first disappointed the market three weeks ago, when it reported a
sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final months of 1993, to 2 per cent.
With a range of new pharmaceuticals launched since 1989, Pfizer had been
expected to do better than its rivals in resisting the effects of price
pressures in drugs markets around the world.
Pfizer's shares dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/8 yesterday. They have
fallen 15 per cent over the past three weeks, wiping Dollars 3bn off the
company's stock market value.
Yesterday, the company said first-quarter results would be 'somewhat
tempered' by the effects of foreign exchange adjustments and higher research
costs. Also, although it said sales growth would be in 'the low double
digits' this year, it added that there would be no immediate sales rebound
after the lacklustre final quarter of 1993.
That had been caused in part by a reduction in inventory levels by drug
wholesalers, but there was no indication inventory levels would rise again,
it added.
The company also said it expected earnings per share for 1994 to be within
market expectations of Dollars 4.10-Dollars 4.25, although it added it was
unlikely to reach the upper end of this range.
Mr William Steere, chairman and chief executive, predicted improvements in
operating profit margins of 1.5 per cent this year, and 2 per cent in each
of the next two years.

threat to its retail hardware business by forging a partnership with Home
Depot, the US retail warehouse operator.
Home Depot will pay CDollars 200m (USDollars 149.2m) for a 75 per cent stake
in the joint venture, to be known as The Home Depot Canada. Molson will hold
the remaining 25 per cent.
Home Depot Canada will take over and expand the Aikenhead's chain of
home-improvement warehouse stores currently wholly-owned by Molson.
Aikenhead's has seven outlets, each with about 125,000 sq ft of selling
space, and stocking some 35,000 items.
Aikenhead's has operated without serious competition, but faced a threat
from Home Depot, which had planned to set up its own operation in Canada.
Mr Bernie Marcus, Home Depot chairman, said the deal with Molson provided an
opportunity to penetrate the market 'more quickly and more profitably'.
The partnership aims to expand Aikenhead's to 50 outlets, including seven
new stores within the next 12 months.
Home Depot, with 269 stores in the US, is the latest of several US
warehouse-store operators to move into Canada. With huge volumes, direct
deals with manufacturers, and cheap premises on the outskirts of cities,
they are able to undercut traditional retailers.

AlliedSignal, the US high technology group, yesterday underscored its
sharply improved performance with a 29 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net
income, a stock split and a 16 per cent dividend increase.
Its share price and profits have soared since Mr Lawrence Bossidy, formerly
at General Electric, took over as chairman in 1991 and began a wholesale
restructuring.
AlliedSignal reported earnings of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, up
from Dollars 138m, or 98 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales rose
from Dollars 3.05bn to Dollars 3.06bn and the operating margin rose from 6.1
per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Since its shares have risen 193 per cent since the start of 1991 it is
making a 2-for-1 stock split, and making shares available for this by
redeeming a stock purchase scheme, or poison pill, set up to guard against a
hostile takeover.
Shareholders will get a special 5 cents a share payment in addition to the
first-quarter dividend of 29 cents. The company also plans to increase the
dividend to 33 1/2 cents a pre-split share from the second quarter.
For the full year, the group reported net income of Dollars 411m, or Dollars
2.90, against a loss of Dollars 712m, or Dollars 5.05, after accounting
changes.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sculley claims his technology
'gem' was flawed - The former Apple chief's resignation from Spectrum and
subsequent lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By resigning as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information
Technologies, Mr John Sculley fulfilled the predictions of many in the
computer industry, who said his decision to jointhe small communications
technology company last October was hasty.
After just four months with Spectrum, he abruptly resigned on Monday and
filed a lawsuit against Mr Peter Caserta, Spectrum president and former
chief executive, alleging Mr Caserta lured him to Spectrum with 'fraudulent
misrepresentations and omissions'.
The lawsuit also alleges a plot by Mr Caserta to reap profits from stock
sales after Mr Sculley's hiring sent Spectrum stock soaring.
Mr Sculley is seeking at least Dollars 10m in damages, noting his reputation
has clearly been sullied by the events of the past four months. The question
remains, however, how Mr Sculley, a prominent US business leader, former
chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, and former Pepsi executive,
could find himself in such a position.
Industry analysts suggest he was so dazzled by the technology that his
business judgment evaporated.
At Apple, Mr Sculley became so enamoured with the potential of Newton,
Apple's hand-held personal digital assistant, that he appeared to loose
touch with the company's core personal computer business, critics charged.
However, he believed that in Spectrum he had found a technology 'gem'; a
company with key patents covering technology for linking computers to
cellular telephones to enable wireless data communications.
Yet the 10-year-old company, with 1993 revenues of just under Dollars 100m,
has never returned a profit and has a history of aggressive self-promotion,
legal disputes with competitors and problems with regulators.
Mr Sculley 'could have had his pick of jobs in the industry' when he left
Apple last year, said one former colleague.
But Mr Sculley said he had 'caught the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial bug'.
He saw Spectrum an an opportunity to build a company, and talked of plans to
make it as well recognised as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor
company or Microsoft, the personal computer software leader.
By his own admission, he 'stumbled on to Spectrum'. He was entranced by a
demonstration of the company's technology, staged by Mr Caserta, at Mr
Sculley's Connecticut home. Initially, according to Mr Sculley and Mr
Caserta, Spectrum's interest was in licensing its technology to Apple
Computer.
'I never had any negotiations about joining them or anything else until
after I separated from Apple,' Mr Sculley said in October.
Immediately after his resignation from Apple, however, Mr Sculley flew
overnight from California to New York and initiated talks with Mr Caserta
about joining Spectrum. Then followed four days Mr Sculley described as 'the
most gruelling of my life'.
Working day and night, with a team of engineers and patent attorneys he
hired to examine Spectrum's technology, Mr Sculley drew up an employment
agreement with Spectrum. On the following Monday morning he announced he was
joining the company.
'Of course, I did my own due diligence before I joined up,' Mr Sculley said
at the time. But this focused almost entirely on Spectrum's technology and
the validity of its patents, a spokesman for Mr Sculley said this week.
Mr Sculley says he did not know, when he joined Spectrum, that it was under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither was he
aware Spectrum had used questionable accounting practices - booking revenues
from licensing agreements in advance of receiving payments.
Spectrum asserts, however, Mr Sculley was 'fully aware of the circumstances
that he now cites as his reasons for departing' both before and during his
time at Spectrum.
On Monday, the company restated its earnings to deduct Dollars 6.4m from
second and third-quarter revenues. The same amount will be added in
subsequent periods, the company's new accountants said.
Whether or not Mr Sculley was told of Spectrum's current problems, it seems
the company's past dealings should have alerted him. While Mr Sculley says
he was not aware of an SEC probe, he did know that Spectrum was facing
related shareholder lawsuits when he joined the company.
The SEC's investigation of Spectrum is believed to focus on an episode last
year, when Mr Caserta announced the company expected 'tens of millions of
dollars' in patent royalties from a new licensing agreement with AT&amp;T.
Spectrum's stock price soared, then crashed the next day when AT&amp;T
challenged Spectrum's claim and said it expected royalty payments to be much
lower.
Spectrum had a reputation for aggressive promotion. Its former chairman, Mr
Dana Verrill and a former boardmember, Mr Gene Morgan, had appeared on
television 'infomertials' touting the company.
In 1990, the National Association of Securities Dealers removed Spectrum
from its listings when its capital fell below required minimums. The company
was relisted in 1992 after a stock offering.
It has also had to restate its earnings in the past, due to accounting
problems. Last May it made an adjustment for 'correction of inaccurate
accruals of certain items into income (in 1992)'.
However, industry analysts felt Mr Sculley had minimised the damage by his
quick departure. Numerous technology companies will still be vying for Mr
Sculley's attention, predicted one analyst, 'but perhaps he will be more
cautious in choosing his next position'.

<TEXT>
The French government is expected to finalise plans by the end of next month
for a FFr3bn to FFr4bn (Dollars 508m-Dollars 678m) recapitalisation of
Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled banking group.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who last year was appointed chairman of Credit Lyonnais
with a brief to stabilise the bank following the aggressive expansion
strategy pursued by Mr Jean Yves Haberer, his predecessor, has for months
been in discussions with the economy ministry over the recapitalisation.
Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on a report in yesterday's Les Echos,
the French financial newspaper, that the recapitalisation would be completed
before the announcement of its 1993 results in late March. However,
government officials indicated that it should be concluded over the next few
weeks.
The recapitalisation follows months of uncertainty for Credit Lyonnais,
which has been clouded by controversy over the write-offs left by Mr
Haberer's loans policy. It fell into a net loss of FFr1.8bn in 1992 and made
a net deficit of FFr1.05bn for the first half of 1993 when its capital ratio
slipped to only just above the legal minimum of 8 per cent.
Mr Peyrelevade is expected to make further hefty provisions for 1993 to
clean up the balance sheet in preparation for Credit Lyonnais's
privatisation. Analysts suspect that this would take the capital ratio below
the minimum.
The loss for 1993 could be FFr3bn to FFr4bn 'which suggests that Credit
Lyonnais will need a capital injection of the same order', said Mr Stephane
Arrouays, European banking analyst at BZW Securities.
The French government, under fire from the European Commission over its
latest FFr2.5bn recapitalisation plan for the Bull computer company, is
thought to be anxious to restrict its direct capital injection into Credit
Lyonnais to under FFr4bn.
Other options include accelerating Credit Lyonnais's asset sales and
floating off FFr25bn to FFr28bn of its property in a newly-formed
state-controlled company.
A similar scheme was implemented before the privatisation of the Credit
Commercial de France banking group in 1987.

Caterpillar, the world's biggest producer of construction equipment, is
forming a joint venture company to produce construction machinery components
in St Petersburg.
The venture, Nevamash, will be 65 per cent owned by Caterpillar, with the
remaining shares held by Kirovsky Zavod, a St Petersburg-based manufacturing
company. No other terms were disclosed.
The agreement comes after a year of expanded activity by Caterpillar in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and the signing of three engine-related
joint ventures.
The latest deal, however, marks its first non-engine venture in the CIS.

<TEXT>
Sears, Roebuck, the US's third-largest retailer and the majority owner in
Allstate Insurance, has reported record earnings for 1993. However, it
disappointed Wall Street with flat fourth-quarter results.
The shares fell steadily throughout the day to close Dollars 3 1/4 lower at
Dollars 47 3/4 .
After record losses in 1992, Sears underwent heavy restructuring last year,
selling its brokerage business, Dean Witter Reynolds, its Coldwell Banker
real estate unit, and a portion of its Allstate holding.
Sears posted fourth-quarter income from continuing operations, excluding
special items, of Dollars 544.6m, or Dollars 1.39 a share, compared with
Dollars 482m, or Dollars 1.29, in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Revenues dipped to Dollars 14.7bn, from Dollars 15bn a year ago. However,
Sears said revenues from continuing operations were up 8 per cent over last
year.
For the year, Sears had income from continuing operations before special
items of Dollars 1.70bn, or Dollars 4.36 a share, compared with Dollars
1.03bn, or Dollars 2.78, in 1992.
Revenues fell to Dollars 50.8bn, from Dollars 52.3bn last year. However,
Sears said revenues from continuing operations were up 6.5 per cent.
Considering a Dollars 635.1m gain on the sale of Allstate, Dollars 76m in
tax benefits during 1993, losses from insurance claims linked to Hurricane
Andrew, and restructuring charges in 1992, net income was Dollars 2.37bn in
1993, compared with losses of Dollars 3.93bn in 1992.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said restructuring saved the company Dollars
200m in corporate expenses in 1993, mainly due to lower interest expenses.
'While we are very pleased with the success of the dramatic actions in 1993,
we are most excited about the operating performance of our merchandising and
insurance businesses, the foundation of the new Sears,' he said.
'We established significant momentum in 1993 and are focusing our efforts to
continue it in 1994.'

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stora, Europe's biggest forestry group, yesterday reported profits of
SKr530m (Dollars 67m) for 1993, a sharp swing from the SKr1.42bn loss a year
earlier.
The company benefited from cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona, and a
strong performance from its financial arm. It was able to increase
production and deliveries, even though market conditions remained weak and
local currency pulp and paper prices were below 1992 levels. The dividend
was maintained at SKr6.50 per share. The weaker krona helped lift sales to
SKr49.8bn, up 4.4 per cent.
Cost reductions of more than SKr2bn and a hefty one-off gain from the sale
of convertibles helped lift operating income to SKr1.38bn from SKr401m. The
improvement would have been greater but for Stora's production base in hard
currency European countries, particularly Germany.
The improved overall result owed much to a sharp drop in financial expenses
to SKr850m from SKr1.82bn. Stora Financial Services lifted profits to
SKr802m from SKr279m.
In the fourth quarter, Stora achieved a SKr236m profit, turning round a
SKr926m deficit in the same 1992 period. The result benefited from some
higher prices, indicating the market had bottomed.
Stora said it had finalised terms to sell Tarkett, an international flooring
company, to CWB Capital Partners, a London-based acquisition fund, for
SKr3.46bn. The group will book a SKr800m pre-tax capital gain on the deal,
to be included in its 1994 figures.
Stora's shares climbed SKr7 to SKr462 on its better-than-expected
performance.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Toyota plummets 48.7% to Y83bn
in six months

<TEXT>
Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, suffered a 48.7 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits in the six months to end-December in one of the worst business
periods in the company's history.
Pre-tax profits plunged to Y83.24bn (Dollars 764m) from Y162.34bn in the
corresponding interim period a year ago largely as a result of the weak
domestic market and the adverse impact of a sharply stronger yen.
Operating profits fell by 84 per cent to Y9.34bn - the steepest decline
suffered by the company. The ratio of operating profits to sales at 0.25 per
cent was the worst the company has experienced.
Sales fell by 13 per cent to Y3,987bn from Y4,564bn, the first decline in
turnover for seven years.
Toyota's deteriorating financial performance underlines the severity of
Japan's economic downturn, as well as the impact of the yen's sharp
appreciation against the dollar and the impact of weak demand in European
markets.
Several of Japan's leading carmakers, including Nissan and Mazda, have
suffered heavy losses following three successive years of falling new
vehicle demand in the domestic market.
Toyota, which has a calendar financial year unlike most Japanese companies
which report to March, had been able to avoid falling into loss mainly as a
result of its cost-cutting efforts, Mr Masami Iwasaki, executive
vice-chairman said.
The cost cutting efforts, which had saved Y70bn, had been more than wiped
out by foreign exchange fluctuations, which had reduced operating profits by
Y100bn. Every Y1 rise in the value of the Japanese currency against the
dollar translates into a loss for Toyota of Y10bn, it said.
While Toyota expects a moderate recovery in Japan in the second half to
June, it believes weak European demand and the adverse impact of the high
yen will continue to weigh heavily on second-half profits.
The company is forecasting pre-tax profits of Y200bn for the full year, down
from Y286.45bn previously on sales of Y8,100bn against Y10,210bn. The sales
forecast is lower than its previous forecast of Y8,700bn made in August
although the pre-tax forecast in unchanged.

Group profits for Schering, Germany's pharmaceutical and agrochemical group,
last year fell 3 per cent to DM254m (Dollars 149.4m) after a 2 per cent rise
in sales to DM5.36bn.
In spite of the fall in profits, the group increased its dividend to DM14.22
from DM13 in 1992.
Schering said sales growth was divided evenly between increased volume and
the affects of fluctuations in the exchange rates. Pharmaceutical sales rose
6 per cent, widening the share of total group sales to 77 per cent from 74
per cent.
The group expects to lift its earnings over the next few years through sales
of Beteseron, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis patients. Sales for
the drug, introduced late last year, totalled DM7m, although the group had
expected a turnover of about DM30m, rising to DM300m this year.
Schering last year underwent a restructuring programming following the
merger of its agrochemical division with Hoechst in a bid to concentrate on
the core pharmaceutical business. The merger is expected to produce an
annual turnover of DM3bn, making it the world's second largest company in
this sector. Hoechst will hold 60 per cent of the shares, the remainder will
be held by Schering.

FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: US brewer woos Czech bride-to-be
 -Anheuser-Busch's courtship of Budejovicky Budvar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, has come a step closer to
winning the bride it always wanted - Budejovicky Budvar, Czech brewers of
the famous Budweiser Budvar beer. The two had been kept apart by communism
and a long and bitter trademark dispute.
The US company's courtship was made official last month with a Czech
government announcement that Anheuser-Busch had been selected as exclusive
negotiating partner for the sale of a minority stake in Budvar.
The Czech company makes what many consider the best Czech beer, and one of
the world's top quality brands. Since the overthrow of communism in 1989,
and Prague's privatisation of state companies, more than 30 brewers
including leading European groups have showed an interest in taking a stake
in Budvar.
The US company, which claims a 9 per cent share of the world beer market, is
hoping to buy up to 34 per cent of the Czech brewer. Mr Jack Purnell,
Anheuser-Busch International (ABI) chairman and chief executive, said:
'We've had a very promising first session (of talks) with the government.'
If negotiations succeed, ABI, the international arm of Anheuser-Busch, will
have won one of the most famous Czech corporate names. Decades of legal
feuding over the use of the Budweiser trademark will come to an end.
Budweiser, or Budejovicky in Czech, was chosen as the name for his beer by
Adolphus Busch, the US company's founder more than a century ago. Later, the
use of the same brand name brought the Czech and US brewers into conflict,
with two agreements in 1911 and 1939 only partially resolving the dispute
which has limited the two companies' access to foreign markets. The American
Budweiser can only be sold under the name of Bud in large parts of Europe,
while Budvar cannot sell its beer in north and central America.
Mr Purnell said negotiations would deal simultaneously with the trademark
dispute and the purchase of a stake in Budvar.
In recent years, ABI has rapidly expanded its activities outside the US with
ventures and partnerships in Japan, Britain, Italy, Canada, Ireland and
Korea. Last year it bought a 17.7 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo, Mexico's
largest brewer for Dollars 477m, and a 5 per cent stake in Tsingtao Brewery,
China's largest brewer, for Dollars 16.4m. In 1992, Anheuser-Busch beer
sales reached Dollars 7.6bn.
The Budvar brewery is small, producing about 570,000 hectolitres
representing about 3 per cent of total Czech beer production in 1992. But
with exports of 362,000 hectolitres representing almost 38 per cent of total
Czech beer exports, it is the country's leading beer exporter.
With Budvar and a trademark agreement, ABI could expand its penetration of
the European market on two separate fronts: by being able to market its own
Budweiser without legal obstacles, and by building up Budvar's share of the
market among mature drinkers.
The products would not compete. 'Bud has a distinctively fresh taste
attractive to the young. Budvar has another taste profile. (Drinkers of
each) tend not to be the same people. The brands don't conflict with one
another at all,' Mr Purnell said.
Critics say Budvar will be swallowed up by ABI, which wants to expand
markets for its own brands. Others say Budvar should remain in Czech hands.
The Czech republic has the world's highest per capita beer consumption. Beer
drinking is a popular custom cutting across classes, and the Czechs are
proud of their local brands.
So what if the deal doesn't go through. 'Well, we haven't been brought to a
standstill because of the dispute. Both sides are harassed by it, and both
would gain (from a deal). We've been persistent and peaceful, but the
biggest problem is some bad perceptions of our company,' Mr Purnell said.
ABI has been wooing the Czech public and government stressing the company's
record as an employer and its philanthropic works with donations of Dollars
500,000 to the US Business School in Prague, Dollars 50,000 to the south
Bohemian University in Ceske Budejovice, along with scholarships and
training grants.
In full-page advertisements in the Czech press, ABI argued a deal would
secure Budvar's future. The Czech Republic would become the centre for ABI's
European beer operations. ABI would take a stake in breweries in southern
Bohemia if the government merged them. 'But Budvar will never be changed,'
stressed Mr Purnell.

share in Polish brewery

<TEXT>
Brau und Brunen, a leading German brewing and soft drink company, has taken
a 25 per cent share in Okocim, a listed Polish brewery with about 8 per cent
market share and a high profile brand name, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw.
Okocim was told by Brau and Brunen of the share purchase last week. The news
surprised the industry which has seen the government barring foreign
investors from brewing privatisations.
Changes in Poland's securities laws which come into force next week bring
the point at which share purchases have to be referred to the securities
commission and the anti-monopoly board down from 33 per cent to 25 per cent.
A purchase of 33 per cent would trigger a mandatory bid for Okocim's
remaining equity.
However, Brau and Brunen has said it did not intend to increase its share
above the 25 per cent which cost the German company an estimated Dollars
20m.

term
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anheuser-Busch, the biggest US beer company, yesterday marked the end of a
lacklustre year by reporting net income of Dollars 166.8m for the fourth
quarter, little changed from the Dollars 161.6m reported last time.
For the full year, it reported net income down to Dollars 594.5m from
Dollars 917.5m, but the latest figure included the effects of a pre-tax
restructuring charge of Dollars 565m in the third quarter. If all unusual
charges were stripped out, the company said, the figures would have shown
net income falling to Dollars 980.6m from Dollars 994.2m.
Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch's leading beer brand, has seen declining sales in
recent years.
The group is suffering from widespread price discounting by competing
brewers. But new products such as Budweiser Lite helped maintain market
share at 44.3 per cent of all US beer sales in 1993.
The company said beer sales and volume growth were hit by slow economic
recovery in important selling areas along the US West Coast and aggressive
discounting.
In spite of this, it sold a record 87.3m barrels of beer in 1993, an
increase of 0.5 per cent over the previous year.
Gross sales rose to Dollars 13.19bn from Dollars 13.06bn for the full year.
Earnings per share, fully diluted, fell to Dollars 2.17 from Dollars 3.20,
but Anheuser-Busch said they would have risen to Dollars 3.55 from Dollars
3.46 without the effect of unusual charges.
For the quarter, gross sales rose to Dollars 3.26bn from Dollars 3.12bn
while earnings per share rose to 62 cents from 58 cents. Mr August A. Busch
III, chairman and president, said the company was pleased with the
performance of its premium beer brands in 1993, considering the competitive
conditions in the beer industry.
'Budweiser continues to dominate across all demographic segments. Bud Light
had another excellent year in 1993 with double-digit growth. Bud Light
continues to outpace its major competition, and we believe the brand is well
positioned to become the leading light beer brand in the US.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: UES - cut, rolled but far from finished /
State subsidies are still a threat to private steel companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Red hot and still molten inside, two continuous 'blooms' of newly-made steel
snake their way out of a Pounds 75m casting complex at UES Steels' Aldwarke
works in Rotherham on their way to be cut, rolled and finished.
The continuous caster and related plant, commissioned in 1989, is the most
visible sign of some Pounds 250m of capital spending made by UES since it
was formed in 1986 from the merger of the engineering steel interests of GKN
and the former British Steel Corporation.
The boost to productivity it provides is one reason why Mr David Stone,
managing director of UES Steels, says the company is 'probably the largest
but definitely the leading' European producer of engineering steels -
specialist steels used in forged automotive parts such as crankshafts and
axle beams and in everything from downhole boring to general machining.
Mr Stone is less happy, however, about some of the external factors
affecting the company. 'State subsidies are keeping companies going which
should shut,' he says. 'They are threatening the viability of private
companies which are more efficient.'
In spite of December's Brussels agreement on state subsidies in Europe's
steel industry - which involved Sidenor of Spain, one of UES's competitors -
Mr Stone is not confident that the issue has been resolved. Like many in
British industry he wants the European Commission to show more teeth in
applying the rules banning subsidies, and in particular to prevent further
subsidies being allowed rather than reacting after the event.
For a company such as UES these are not just political debating points: the
subsidies issue is directly relevant to the performance of the company and
the prospects of its employees.
The continued existence of subsidised producers is one reason why prices for
steel scrap - the main raw material for companies such as UES - have risen,
says Mr Stone. 'They can pay more than they need for scrap'.
When UES was forced to cut jobs last year, it blamed unfair competition
caused by subsidies to some of its competitors, along with scrap prices  -
up from about Pounds 50 a tonne to Pounds 90 a tonne in the past 12 months -
and the high cost of electricity in the UK. UES makes its steel by putting
scrap into electric arc furnaces. 'Subsidies, scrap and electricity prices
are absolutely fundamental,' says Mr Stone. The company's Templeborough
steelworks in Rotherham, which closed in November with the loss of 250 jobs,
could be seen as a casualty of the European steel scene, he claims.
As if that was not enough, UES is also embroiled in a trade dispute
involving its exports to the US of leaded bar - steel to which lead is added
to make it more easily machined. This business is normally worth some Pounds
30m a year. It is appealing against anti-dumping and countervailing duties,
which have reduced its US exports of the product by one third.
Then there is the recession in the UK and continental Europe which, along
with overcapacity in the engineering steels sector, has depressed selling
prices. With about 60 per cent of group sales going to the automotive
industry, UES has to deal with powerful customers in a buyers' market.
The result was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.3m on sales of Pounds 565m in 1992
at UES Holdings, which groups the steel, forging and other closely-related
interests.
The deficit was the first for the company, and the recession affected all
its businesses. But the steel division in particular is feeling the
pressure, says Mr Stone, and is still trading at a loss. The size of UES,
and its position in the European market, means it is important for the UK
steel industry as a whole, as well as to shareholders in British Steel and
GKN, which own 60.9 per cent and 39.1 per cent respectively in UES Holdings.
The company was by far the biggest of the government-sponsored 'Phoenix'
reorganisations of the steel industry in the mid-1980s, and after the
closures of the past 20 years virtually is the UK engineering steels
industry.
It started shakily, says Mr Stone, but things went well for three years,
with profits peaking at Pounds 67.3m on sales of Pounds 814m in 1989. Since
then, he says, 'things have gone off the boil'.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, the two owners have been taking an increasing
interest in their progeny: in September they amalgamated the UES Holdings
executive committee into its board structure to improve communications with
the businesses. As a result, the company has a part-time non-executive
chairman, Mr Don Ford, but no chief executive - Mr Graham Mackenzie, the
former incumbent, left by mutual agreement when the changes were announced.
If the short-term situation looks difficult for UES Holdings, it does have a
number of things in its favour. As at British Steel itself, there has been a
relentless drive to cut costs.
The workforce has been reduced from more than 11,000 at the end of 1988 to
about 7,000 at the end of last year. As early as 1990, UES grasped the
nettle and closed the Brymbo steel works at Wrexham, with the loss of 1,100
jobs.
Nearly four years later the retrenchment is continuing and 400, mainly
staff, jobs are going in the steels division - about 10 per cent of the
remaining workforce. But Mr Stone says no further cuts are planned.
However, the company has also grown. It has made a string of acquisitions
since 1986, upstream in certain strategically important parts of the scrap
business and downstream in stockholding and in bright bar - a shiny steel
processed from 'black' engineering steel and used in hydraulic and other
applications.
It has a seemingly impregnable hold on the UK engineering steels market,
with a share of about 68 per cent. Its output of about 1.5m tonnes of stee1
from Aldwarke and from the smaller, more specialised steelworks at
Stocksbridge, north-west of Sheffield, is enough to serve a UK market and
leave room to exploit export opportunities.
On the back of the company's investments and cost-efficiency, the outlook Mr
Stone foresees for UES Steels is growth relative to the market, which has a
long way to go to match capacity, he says.
His hope is that weaker players in the European industry will fall by the
wayside, allowing UES to raise its market share even if the amount of steel
it produces does not rise.

The directors said that any such offer would be structured in such a way
that there would be no dilution of the net asset value of the existing
shares and units and no reduction in the asset cover of the existing zero
dividend preference shares.

<TEXT>
Westminster Scaffolding Group's financing proposals were approved at an
extraordinary meeting held on Monday.
As a result of the restructuring, the USM-quoted company's equity comprises
448.28m ordinary 1p shares, of which 203.98m were issued to capitalise all
outstanding loan stocks totalling Pounds 3.52m.
In addition, 188.8m new ordinary shares were issued at 1 1/2 p per share
pursuant to the placing and offer. The offer was over-subscribed 1.74 times
and excess applications have been scaled down.
At the EGM, Mr Michael Pelham, chairman, said completion of the fund raising
and restructuring had removed the constraints of the company's loan stocks
and had given it the resources to move forward in improving market
conditions provided by the gradual recovery of the UK construction industry.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Freeman accepts Pounds 19m Sheffield
Insulations bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield Insulations, the distributor of thermal insulation and related
products, yesterday made an agreed bid for Freeman Group, valuing the
insulation, distribution and fabrication specialist at Pounds 18.6m.
Mr Bill Forrester, Sheffield chief executive, said the acquisition would
strengthen the company's UK insulation distribution activities, and would
provide 'an important new base in continental Europe.'
Sheffield is offering eight of its ordinary shares for every nine Freeman.
At yesterday's closing price of 288p, up 18p, the offer was worth 256p per
Freeman share.
Freeman shares, up 22p to 242p yesterday, were standing at 204p on January
17, the last dealing day before the announcement of a possible offer.
A mix and match offer gives Freeman shareholders the chance to accept
instead cash and loan notes to the value of 225p a share.
This would be funded by placing 3.28m new ordinary shares at 256p to raise
about Pounds 8.3m net of expenses.
The placing, which represents about 5 per cent of Sheffield's existing share
capital, is underwritten by Samuel Montagu.
Sheffield said it had already received irrevocable acceptances from
Freeman's directors and other shareholders in respect of 4.15m shares, or
about 57 per cent of the company.
Holders of the new ordinary Sheffield shares will not receive the final
dividend, estimated at 3.6p for the year ended December.
Sheffield, which last year acquired WMS Group for Pounds 52.9m, estimates
its pre-tax profits for the year at not less than Pounds 9.75m.
Freeman shareholders will receive a second interim dividend of 4p once the
offer becomes unconditional. Freeman estimates its pre-tax profits for the
year to end-December at not less than Pounds 950,000.

Elan, the Irish drug delivery company, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds
60.7m (Pounds 58.2m) for the nine months to December 31 after exceptional
charges of IPounds 85.1m. There were profits of IPounds 13.2m last time.
The result was achieved on turnover 18 per cent higher at IPounds 76.9m
(IPounds 65m). Operating profits rose by 43 per cent to IPounds 17.9m.
The exceptional charges included a IPounds 59.3m write-off of research and
development costs on the acquisition of Drug Research Corporation in July
last year.
A further IPounds 25.8m related to the flotation of Advanced Therapeutic
Systems in a rights offering to shareholders last August, equivalent to a
one-off dividend payment. Under US rules Elan is classified as a growth
stock and not permitted to pay dividends.
Elan's main listing is in New York, although its headquarters and main
manufacturing base are in Ireland. It is also listed in London and Dublin.
Losses per share came out at 175p, against earnings of 41p. Excluding the
exceptional costs earnings were 71p.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Parkside to join market with Pounds 32.8m
price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parkside International, the packaging group that underwent a Pounds 3.2m
management buy-out five years ago, yesterday finalised its flotation,
pricing the shares at 110p to give a market capitalisation of Pounds 32.8m.
The company is raising a total of Pounds 12m through the sale of 11.04m
shares. Of this, Pounds 7m of new money is being raised before expenses from
the sale of 6.36m shares. The remaining shares are being sold by directors
and senior management for Pounds 3m, and by investment institutions for
Pounds 2m.
Mr Geoffrey Stewart, the chief executive who led the MBO from Jarvis Porter,
said the new money would be used to continue expansion.
The management would retain 40 per cent of the company and had agreed to
sell no shares for two years, he said. The institutions had agreed not to
sell any shares for one year, and were retaining 22 per cent.
Parkside specialises in flexible packaging, which uses reels of plastic or
paper sheeting, and plastic labels. Among its leading customers are Tate &amp;
Lyle, Walkers crisps, Coca Cola and Andrex. It has two factories in Leeds
and another, opened in 1992, near Wakefield.
Mr Stewart said the company had spent Pounds 6m in upgrading its technology
since the MBO and was planning to spend Pounds 3.25m on capital investment
to end-February 1995, with a further Pounds 4m the following year.
In the year to February 28 1993, pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.86m on
turnover of Pounds 21.9m. The company, which employs 236 people, is
forecasting pre-tax profits in the current year of Pounds 2.2m. Earnings per
share are estimated at 6.5p, which gives a prospective p/e of 16.9.
The notional dividend of 3p would give a gross yield of 3.4 per cent.
Brokers to the issue are Panmure Gordon.

750,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depressed consumer spending and increased competition cut pre-tax profits at
Heiton Holdings, the Dublin-based steel stockholder,builders' merchant and
DIY retailer, in the six months to October 31, writes Gerard Baker.
Despite a rise in turnover from IPounds 30.1m to IPounds 31.6m, pre-tax
profits dropped 20 per cent from IPounds 945,000 to IPounds 753,000 (Pounds
722,000).
Mr Diarmuid Quirke, chief executive, said that while the steel stockholding
and builders' merchant division, which accounts for the bulk of the group's
business, saw profits rise, the DIY side had had a more difficult six
months.
Weak consumer demand, the growth of capacity in the market and start-up
costs associated with the Galway branch of Atlantic Homecare, the main DIY
subsidiary, had reduced profits.
Earnings per share were 1.74p (1.9p). The interim dividend is held at 0.65p.
Mr Quirke said that growing consumer confidence, lower interest rates and
new public building projects gave good grounds for optimism.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Graham issues pathfinder and shows 25% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Group, the builders' merchant about to be demerged by BTR, the
industrial conglomerate, returned pre-tax profits ahead 25 per cent to
Pounds 13.5m last year, on sales just 8 per cent higher at Pounds 374m.
Graham, one of the first companies in the building materials sector to come
to the market for some years, published its pathfinder prospectus yesterday.
It is seeking a listing through the placing and public offer of 114.6m
shares and is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 200m and
Pounds 250m.
The Luton-based company has had a difficult time in recent years, falling
from the leading position in the builders' merchant league to fourth place
with a UK market share of 5 per cent.
Profits have fallen by 60 per cent since the peak in 1989. Mr Ian Mills,
managing director, said this had been due both to recession and the pursuit
of volume at the expense of margin.
Mr Mills stressed that the group had substantial opportunities following the
appointment of new management and a strategic review last year. 'We will
increase the gross margin by adding value,' he said. Last year, Graham's
gross margin declined by 0.5 of a percentage point to 21.8 per cent.
Debt is expected to be Pounds 19.6m after the demerger, representing 22 per
cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Mills said this was expected to come down in
future, in spite of a Pounds 36m, three-year capital expenditure programme.
Capital expenditure has been significantly increased in the past year as
Graham began to refurbish its 148 branches.
Dividend payments this year are expected to equal approximately half of
Graham's after-tax profits, which were Pounds 12m in 1993 giving earnings of
10.5p (8.1p) per share.
Graham intends to pay one third of the dividend at the interim stage.
BTR is selling Graham and other distribution businesses to focus on
manufacturing and reduce its onerous debt. Earlier this year it completed
the Pounds 120m disposal of Summers Group, the US electrical wholesaler.

<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK waste contractor which recently issued a profits
warning, yesterday sought to improve its internal controls with the
appointment of a chief operating officer to replace Mr Roger Hewitt, the
chief executive who resigned abruptly last month.
It is understood that the group still intends to appoint a chief executive.
Mr Gordon Waddell, the chairman, is acting as chief executive until a
replacement is found.
Shanks said Mr Michael Averill, former managing director of the group's
environmental division, would take responsibility for all but the
commercial, construction and financial operations. He will report directly
to Mr Waddell.
Mr Hewitt is understood to have left the group last month following pressure
from institutional investors over Shanks's performance and a lack of
confidence in its management.
The company also announced the closure of its office in Aylesbury as part of
its cost-cutting programme. Shanks announced at the interim stage that some
Pounds 5m was to be cut out of costs. While there have already been a number
of redundancies, it is expected that there will be further rationalisation.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Anglia Secure to focus on nursing home activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglia Secure Homes is proposing a series of changes which will result in
its withdrawing from sheltered housing and concentrating on its nursing
homes activities.
The company also announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.11m for the
year to September 30, against Pounds 15.5m. The improvement was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 17.5m). Losses per share came out at 22.2p
(46.9p).
The moves include the disposal of the sheltered housing business and its
associated debt, the acquisition of two companies in the contracted nursing
home sector, and the raising of Pounds 3.4m net through a subscription and
rights issue.
The shares were suspended at 12p yesterday while the changes take place.
The new company will be known as Care UK and be 60 per cent owned by Nash,
Sells &amp; Partners, a venture capital company.
Anglia is acquiring the outstanding 72.1 per cent holding in Haven
Healthcare from Nash for 172m shares and Community Health Services from Nash
and National Home Loans for 100m shares.
The new shares will trade on the USM. The existing 10p shares are being
split into 1p ordinaries and 9p deferred. The company also intends to reduce
the share capital and share premium accounts.
Anglia is also retaining its 50.1 per cent interest in Haven Services, its
joint venture with Commercial Union.
The sheltered housing activity was financed mainly by bank loans, which
amounted to Pounds 22.1m at September 30. The recession, high interest
rates, and provisions against the fall in property values have left the
group with a deficit on capital and reserves of Pounds 6.52m. The banks have
conditionally agreed to relieve the new company of the debts associated with
the housing business.
The company is offering 49.6m shares in a 3-for-2 rights issue at 4 1/4 p a
share. A further 47m shares are being offered for subscription at the same
price. The proceeds will fund a payment of Pounds 3.3m to the banks.
As shareholders are not able to take part in the subscription they are being
offered warrants on a 2-for-3 basis, with each warrant entitling holders to
buy a share at 4 1/2 p in the future. Nash is offering to buy the warrants
at 0.88p.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MBO planned at Ferranti plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers from Ferranti International's Cairo Mill component manufacturing
business are planning a buy-out of the Oldham-based plant which employs 490
staff and had turnover of Pounds 30m last year.
Ferranti Components, which designs and manufactures specialist
micro-electronic components for use in defence and civil applications, was
specifically not included in the MBO plans covering the bulk of Ferranti's
operations unveiled by another team of managers in December.
The four-man Cairo Mill buy-out team, led by Mr Angus Mincher, general
manager, and advised by Ernst &amp; Young, plans to present a bid to Ferranti's
administrative receivers, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot from Arthur
Andersen, early next month. Potential financial backers for the bid have
been approached.
The receivers, who welcomed the latest buy-out proposal yesterday, were
appointed in early December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share rescue bid for
the ailing defence electronics group.
Explaining the MBO proposal, Mr Mincher said: 'We have now formulated a
strategy to develop the business from its existing base. Our order book
represents more than a year's work. This gives us time to win back customer
confidence which has inevitably been strained over the recent difficult
weeks.
'We will be looking to develop our business both in existing core areas and
by diversification in the medium term. We have a strong skills base in the
Oldham plant which we will develop further.'
Mr Mike Davis of Ernst &amp; Young, added: 'The components business has the
necessary ingredients for a successful buy-out, a sound product base, blue
chip customers and a strong management team.'
Separately, it emerged yesterday that the administrative receivers have
taken the highly unusual step of writing to the Cairo Mill employees
advising them that they do not anticipate any further redundancies, and
promising that if there are more redundancies employees will be given at
least one month's notice.
In the letter Mr James Gleave, the Manchester-based Arthur Andersen partner
responsible for the plant, says: 'I hope (this step) gives you extra
confidence both in the future of Cairo Mill and our ability to sell the
business without any need for further job losses.'

<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial is launching its first purely UK-based investment trust
in its 125 year history. The Income Growth Investment Trust aims to achieve
long-term income growth above the rate of inflation, and capital growth
greater than the FT-SE A 350 index.
'Many British companies have now strengthened their financial position and
improved their ability to pay higher dividends over the longer term,' said
Mr Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Management. Companies
included in the FT-SE A 350 index were best placed to benefit from an upturn
in the UK and its trading partners.
The fund is targeted at private investors wanting to hold shares in a
personal equity plan. Dividends will be paid quarterly, and the warrants,
issued on a 1-for-5 basis, will be traded as a unit with the shares for the
first 43 days.
The public offer period is from March 1 to 22, and dealings in the units
start on March 29. The fund will have an initial life of 10 years.

FT  09 FEB 94 / 3i moves into fund management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the UK's largest investment capital company, has raised a Ecu300m
(Pounds 236m) fund for investment in continental Europe in a move that takes
it for the first time into the business of managing funds for other
institutions.
The group will co-invest equity with the fund in unquoted investments mainly
in France, Germany, Italy and Spain where it already has offices.
Mr Neil Cross, international director, said the UK would remain 3i's core
market. But moving into fund management was an 'important strategic venture'
for 3i that would probably lead to other funds being raised and managed.
The fund will be one of the largest ever raised for equity investment in
continental Europe where the venture capital market is growing more quickly
than the more mature UK market.
3i already makes about 25 per cent of its equity investments in continental
Europe. It has invested Pounds 250m in some 200 continental European
companies and believes it is already the leading independent private equity
investor in France and Germany.
Mr Cross said the group's capital base was not currently proving to be a
constraint on that level of investment while the main European economies
remained at the current levels, but by raising the fund the group had
increased its flexibility.
The fund will allow 3i more scope to syndicate deals and to structure more
of the equity investments required in the growing European private equity
market.
3i, which is owned by the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England, was due
to float last year, but the issue was pulled after a number of the
shareholders changed their minds.
Yesterday's launch of 3i as a fund manager - a move which will boost the
revenue stream in its profit and loss account - has sparked speculation that
flotation might again be moving off the back burner. 3i's shareholders will
have noticed that venture capital investment trusts are trading at discounts
to asset value which are historically very small.
Mr Cross denied the launch of the new European fund had anything to do with
plans for a flotation which remained no more than a long-term objective.
3i, which is itself contributing Ecu100m to the fund, will have raised the
Ecu300m from about nine institutions in Europe, east Asia and the US, a
comparatively small number for the size of fund.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Reuters to build US presence on back of
Quotron purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings said its recent decision to purchase Quotron, the US data
services business, was a crucial step in building the UK group's presence in
North American equity markets.
Mr Peter Job, Reuters chief executive, acknowledged that the business was
'not in a happy state' and said cancellations already in the pipeline would
reduce its customer base from 40,000 terminals to the mid-30,000s - about 20
per cent of the market.
However, Mr Job was confident that Quotron could be improved by injecting
Reuters services and infrastructure into the network, and that an increasing
number of US users would also be interested in the European share
information.
Including revenue from Instinet, Mr Job said the US now outweighed the City
of London as Reuters' biggest single market. Excluding Instinet, the group
said the revenue and profit contribution by the Americas grew rapidly in
1993. Profits trebled from Pounds 12m to Pounds 37m. Revenue grew by 32 per
cent to Pounds 285m and by 12 per cent at comparable rates.
The profits contribution from Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by 6 per
cent to Pounds 353m and revenue by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.08bn, which was 5
per cent at comparable rates.
The Asia/Pacific contribution rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 175m with
revenue ahead 26 per cent to Pounds 385m, a 3 per cent increase at
comparable rates.
Net cash of Pounds 450m was down from Pounds 710m, reflecting last year's
Pounds 350m share repurchase, accelerated capital spending and increased
spending on acquisitions.
Operating profit before interest grew by 20 per cent to Pounds 380m.
Interest income declined by 9 per cent to Pounds 60m following the share
repurchase, and would decline further next year.
Capital expenditure increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 268m,influenced by a
stronger dollar while expenditure on subscriber equipment rose 40 per cent
to Pounds 143m.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;O to spend Dollars 680m on new liners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, the shipping, transport and
property group, announced that Princess Cruises, its US-based subsidiary,
had placed orders for two new superliners from Italy's Fincantieri
shipbuilding yard.
The ships, with passenger capacities of 1,950 and 2,500 will cost Dollars
295m (Pounds 197m) and Dollars 385m respectively, and will be delivered in
1997.
The first is a sister ship to the company's 77,000-ton Sun Princess, due to
be delivered by Fincantieri in January 1996. The other is dedicated to the
Caribbean market.
The two ships are being financed with loans at 8 per cent over 8 1/2 years.
P&amp;O, through Princess Cruises, is one of the three leading companies in the
world cruise market.
At present it operates nine ships in North America, the largest market,
carrying 430,000 passengers annually. It commands a 40 per cent share of the
Alaskan cruise business but lies behind its two rivals, Carnival and RCCL in
the Caribbean.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O executive chairman, said the North American market had
grown by about 10 per cent a year for the past 10 years.
Recent research, however, suggested that only 5 per cent of the total
available cruise customers took cruises.
The strengthening economic recovery in the US was expected to increase
demand for both Caribbean and Alaskan cruises.
Bookings since the start of the year had risen and passenger yields had
improved.
In addition to the US market, P&amp;O operates two general cruise ships in
Europe and one in Australia. Next year, a third ship will begin service in
Europe.
Lord Sterling said that the P&amp;O cruise division was 'one of the fastest
growing and most consistent profit earners and cash generators in the P&amp;O
group'.
It does not publish separate figures for the cruise division, but according
to Mr Richard Sanderson, of brokers Panmure Gordon, the passenger shipping
division is likely to see pre-tax profits rise to about Pounds 150m for the
year to December 31, of which half will derive from passenger cruises.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Palmerston reveals funds shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Palmerston Holdings, the lossmaking property group whose shares have been
suspended at 10p since the beginning of October, yesterday announced that
there was a deficiency in its shareholders' funds of about Pounds 39.2m.
The shortfall derived mostly from guarantees given in favour of its
subsidiary and associated companies, the directors said. In the accounts for
the year to March 31 1992, shareholders' funds showed a surplus of Pounds
1.78m.
Having failed to reconstruct its finances in other ways, Palmerston is
continuing with its plan to enter a company voluntary arrangement with its
creditors under which they would refrain from exercising any of their rights
for six months.
During the six months, the group would seek an investor to inject new
capital or pay the creditors. Palmerston feels this would produce a more
satisfactory outcome for creditors and shareholders than the alternatives of
receivership or liquidation.

Betacom, the telephone equipment supplier 66 per cent owned by Amstrad,
reported higher interim operating profits, although the rise was constrained
by supply difficulties with its new product range.
The group reported operating profits of Pounds 43,000 in the six months to
December 31 compared with an Pounds 8,000 loss on turnover from continuing
operations which expanded to Pounds 6.91m (Pounds 6.67m).
However, interim pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 103,000, against Pounds
350,000 a year ago when the outcome was boosted by a Pounds 213,000 profit
on the sale of fixed investments.
Earnings per share fell to 0.15p (0.46p).

<TEXT>
Abtrust is seeking to increase the size of its New Dawn investment trust by
more than 50 per cent with a conversion share issue. The trust, which
invests in the Far East excluding Japan, currently has assets of about
Pounds 80m.
A placing of the C shares has already raised Pounds 29m, net of expenses,
and the public offer, which opens today, could raise up to Pounds 15m more.
Shares in the trust have been trading at a slight premium to net asset value
in the last few months.
C shares will be issued at 250p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares, exercisable at 270p between 1997 and 2000. The C shares will be
converted to ordinary shares when 90 per cent of the new money has been
invested.

<TEXT>
Amersham International is to invest Pounds 3m in Scitech Genetics of
Singapore in an effort to develop a kit that will speed up the diagnosis of
viral infections such as hepatitis. This is the company's first deal in
south-east Asia.
Scitech said yesterday that it expected the kit would be available in about
18 months.
Amersham insisted the deal did not mark its return to the business of
medical diagnostics - it sold its diagnostics activities to Kodak in 1990
for Pounds 84m.
Amersham will instead use the expertise developed in Singapore to
manufacture a kit for sale to research laboratories for the measurement of
DNA in cells.
Scitech will be able offer a diagnostics service to hospitals, but is
prevented under the agreement with Amersham from selling the kit, said Mr
Trevor Nicholls, Amersham's head of life sciences marketing.

alleges that Mr Caserta's 'short-term goal was to reap huge profits by
selling large blocks of Spectrum stock driven up in value by the public
announcement that Sculley had joined the company'. Spectrum said Mr Sculley

FT  09 FEB 94 / Asian markets fail to rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR MARKETS STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets around the world responded positively to Monday's recovery on
Wall Street, although the shock of Friday's 96-point drop in the Dow left
most of them short of recouping their losses.
In Asia and the Pacific Basin, none of Monday's big losers recovered much
ground. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained just 0.35 per cent after Monday's
6.1 per cent slide. Thai equities rose 1.6 per cent after a 6.8 per cent
drop, and their Malaysian counterparts by 1.3 per cent after a 4.6 per cent
downswing the day before.
In Japan, the Nikkei average, which lost only 1.4 per cent on Monday,
recovered virtually all of that ground with a 1.2 per cent improvement.
Japanese equities then showed further strength in London dealings, inspired
by the government's economic stimulus package.
Continental Europe's bourses started well, but slipped back after mild
weakness in US equities in the American mid-morning. Rate cuts were rewarded
by a new high in Belgium's Bel-20 index and, in anticipation, by an
above-average 2.2 per cent gain in Norway.
Wall Street started well but profit-taking was keeping a lid on the market
by mid-session, amid further weakness in the bond market and lingering
concern over the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy.
European government bond markets failed to hold on to early gains after an
indirect signal from the German Bundesbank that it had no immediate plans to
lower German interest rates. Investors interpreted the central bank's
decision to set its 14-day repurchase agreements at an unchanged fixed rate
of 6 per cent as a sign that it was unlikely to cut interest rates before
March.
In the wake of the UK interest rate cut, other leading currencies took a
back-seat.
The dollar was slightly firmer against both the D-Mark and the Yen.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Sheraton trumps Forte bid for Ciga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sheraton, the international hotels group owned by ITT of the US, last night
emerged as the surprise buyer of Ciga, the troubled luxury hotels chain
controlled by the Aga Khan.
Sheraton's offer of about L900bn (Pounds 353m) easily topped the Pounds 270m
bid from Forte, the UK hotel and restaurant chain, which had for some time
been considered the front runner. Forte said it was asked last Monday if it
could match Sheraton's offer but decided it would not do so.
Few details of Sheraton's proposal emerged officially, amid surprise among
Italian bankers that the group had been prepared to make such a high offer
for the loss-making Ciga without looking closely at its books. But the offer
is believed to involve a L940bn capital increase - corresponding to Ciga's
outstanding short-term bank indebtedness, to be underwritten by its creditor
banks.
Assuming it obtains at least 50.1 per cent of the shares, Sheraton would
then launch a public tender offer priced at between L720 and L740 a share
for the banks' stake and any remaining shares floating on the market.
Ciga's troubles stem mainly from its high debts, which now exceed L1,000bn,
and the recession, which has sliced demand for five star hotel
accommodation. The group has also suffered from an imbalanced portfolio of
hotels, with too many properties bunched in the same cities.
Attempts to remedy matters by selling some properties where it was
over-represented coincided with the recession, and failed to attract buyers
at the price levels Ciga expected.
Forte's revised proposal had been made in tandem with the Quantum Fund,
controlled by Mr George Soros, the US investor. Forte was to provide Pounds
33m and the Quantum Fund Pounds 135m. The balance was to have been made up
with deferred payments over the next two to three years.
Forte said that while it was disappointed not to have captured Ciga, it
believed there would be other opportunities to purchase European hotels. It
said its shareholders would not have thanked it for making a higher offer as
Ciga was making a loss even before interest payments and depreciation and
would have required major restructuring.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Granada lifts hostile bid for LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City sentiment appeared to be moving in favour of Granada Group last night
as the rental, television and leisure group increased its offer for London
Weekend Television to around Pounds 776m, or 750p a share.
Granada's final offer in the hostile takeover battle came after talks
between the two sides broke down. The new offer of 13 new Granada shares and
100p cash for every 10 LWT shares represents a near 10 per cent improvement
over the original six-for-five paper bid. The cash alternative has been
increased from 528p to 686p.
Granada shares closed 2p down at 569p yesterday, while LWT rose 35p to 737p.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said he would have liked to
get agreement but the two sides had been 'miles apart' on price, with LWT
talking about 860p a share.
He said the increase 'recognises that people have high expectations in this
sector'. The offer would not dilute earnings in the first full year, he
added.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said the revised offer was still
inadequate. He emphasised that LWT's published estimate of 1993 earnings per
share at 28.4p was 25.7 per cent higher than the figure Granada used for its
original offer. 'And yet the number of Granada shares on offer has gone up
by only 8.3 per cent. LWT shareholders will also suffer an 18.7 per cent
decrease in dividend income if they accept. What sort of increase is this?'
he asked.
The view among City analysts last night was that the Granada offer was
likely to be accepted.
Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, who last month
advocated that the Granada offer be rejected, said of the improved bid:
'It's only just there. It's hardly generous and it's still hostile.'
Privately senior LWT executives admitted yesterday the outcome would be
close but they expressed confidence that they would retain the support of
their main institutional shareholders.
The Granada offer, which represents 26.4 times LWT's estimated 1993 pre-tax
earnings of Pounds 43.8m, closes at 3pm on Friday February 25.
If LWT retains its independence it might look again at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees,
a company in which it already has a 20 per cent stake. The problem of
Yorkshire's two broadcasting licences - when LWT would only be allowed to
add one - would still have to be sorted out.

FT  09 FEB 94 / The ups and downs of interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They do it not by halves but quarters these days, it seems. The Bank of
England yesterday dropped into a rare quarter-point mode when it prompted a
fall in bank base rates to 5 1/4 per cent, countering the US Federal
Reserve's upward nudge of the federal funds rate to 3 1/4 per cent.
There is a strong whiff of compromise about the Bank's failure to go
straight to 5 per cent. The London markets responded positively to begin
with, but in fact the change could be viewed negatively - as implying that
the low point for short-term interest rates this cycle may be quite close.
Meanwhile, eat your hearts out, efficient market hypothesisers. It was
widely anticipated that the US Federal Reserve was about to raise short-term
interest rates by a quarter or half-point. Yet when the news came, the
world's securities markets suffered a minor panic. So much for the markets'
ability to discount expected changes smoothly.
True, it is possible to argue that all we have seen in the past two or three
days is over-active marketmakers chasing shadows. Real money does not appear
to have been on the move and indeed the London stock market had almost fully
recovered at one stage yesterday before tailing off again. It is slightly
worrying, though, that the US Treasury long bond yield should have drifted
higher, because this above all is where a tightening might have been viewed
positively.
What could justify the jitters? In equities one widely expressed concern is
that there is an unusually large quantity of amateur money riding the bull
market. Some Dollars 280bn of net new money cascaded into US stock and bond
mutual funds last year, and spilled over into emerging markets, while
household bank deposits fell.
Yet as a paper from the doggedly bullish Goldman Sachs argued last week,
private investors are actually rather slow to react to interest rate
changes, the usual time lag being at least a year. One might add that a mere
quarter-point change would surely scarcely register in the punters'
consciousness.
The real issue here, though, is that a lot of sophisticated investors may be
trying to run ahead of the anticipated panic of the herd. So there may be
several minor attempted sell-offs before the retail investors finally get
the message.
A possibly more important theme is that there may be an unusually large
amount of speculation propping up the securities markets, and more
specifically a dependence upon money borrowed at low interest rates. This
has been a particular feature of the US bond market, where the banks have
been encouraged by the Fed to generate solvency-restoring profits along an
exceptionally steep yield curve. In the UK too, last week's banking figures
showed a sharp jump in lending to the financial sector during the final
quarter of 1993.
Even the doziest players in the US Treasury market have now been given
formal notice that they must unwind their positions (though most have been
already shifting their strategy for several months now). The quarter-point
hike is only a starter, and although the spreads along the yield curve have
changed little, they could be dwarfed by potential capital losses. To take
the extreme case, the price of the benchmark long bond has dropped by 8 full
points since it peaked in October, rather nasty if you are leveraged (though
the banks are focused less ambitiously around the five-year dates).
The burden of financing the US fiscal deficit will therefore shift from the
banking system to other domestic and international investors. This explains
the upward drift in bond interest rates.
There are also the unknown hazards of derivatives. The extraordinary profits
earned by some of the players last year gave prima facie indications of
large discontinuities in the markets. A change of trend could be difficult
to handle.
But now the action is switching to the foreign exchange markets. After a
year when many currencies slumbered and the army of dollar bulls grew staler
and staler, the markets are now faced with the long-awaited relative rate
shift as the US raises and Europe continues down.
But we wait to see whether the Bundesbank, having preferred for some weeks
to be a wallflower, will join this interest rate tango.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Reuters raises profits by 15% and splits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reuters Holdings rose by 60p to 1971p after the UK-based financial
information and news group combined the announcement of a 4-for-1 share
split with strong results and a bullish forecast for revenue growth.
Pre-tax profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 440m in 1993, while revenue
increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.87bn thanks partly to sterling's
weakness. With currency changes stripped out, sales growth was 8 per cent
and reached 10 per cent in the second half.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'We are maintaining price stability for
the third year running, barring some upward and downward adjustments which
reflect currency movements. We believe we have a sound basis for achieving
double-digit revenue growth this year without reliance on price increases.'
Mr Rob Rowley, finance director, said earnings per share would grow more
quickly this year than profitability due to the Pounds 350m share
repurchase, made at Pounds 14 per share in September.
Mr Job said the gradual improvement in the first half continued to gather
pace in the second: 'Conditions were good not only in our most developed
markets such as the US and UK, but also in emerging markets like China,
Latin America and east Europe. In our most sluggish major market, Japan,
there were early signs of improvement.'
The group said it was a 'particularly good year' for established transaction
products such as equity trading on Instinet, which doubled its revenue to
Pounds 120m and nearly tripled its operating profits to Pounds 38m.
Mr Job said: 'For our new products, the challenge is to gain liquidity.' The
foreign exchange matching product, Dealing 2000 Phase 2, showed promise.
Progress had been less good with Globex, which trades futures on screen.
Volumes continued to rise with the Matif exchange in Paris, and talks
continued with the Chicago exchanges.
As well as the 4-for-1 ordinary share split, each American Depositary Share
will be redefined to comprise six new shares instead of three. Subject to
shareholder approval, dealing in the new shares will start on April 18.
Earnings per share rose to 72p from 56p under FRS 3, but the previous year's
figure was reduced by the inclusion of a previously extraordinary tax
charge. Adjusting for that, earnings grew by 16 per cent. A final dividend
of 19.8p (15.9p) raises the total by 23 per cent to 26p (21.2p).

FT  09 FEB 94 / US phone company to launch City business network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition among tele-communications operators for UK business traffic is
set to intensify sharply with the launch of a network in the City of London
by US operator MFS Communications.
The news came as BT and Mercury announced the abolition of their peak-rate
calling bands, cutting between 20 and 25 per cent off prices for weekday
calls made between 9am and 1pm.
MFS is the largest competitor to the local Bell companies in the US in the
provision of telecommunications networks. The company, which had a turnover
of Dollars 108.7m (Pounds 72.4m) in 1992 and operates in 14 US cities, will
be a powerful competitor in the UK. It has a record of making swift inroads
against former monopoly telephone companies with aggressive pricing and
marketing.
MFS's City of London network, due to start in April, will be its first
outside the US. It plans extensions to other UK cities, and expects to
provide access to Paris and Frankfurt later this year.
BT's price cuts announced yesterday fulfil most of its obligation to reduce
prices before July by 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under a
price cap agreement with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator.
Residential customers, who will gain little from the abolition of the peak
rate, were the main beneficiaries of a new weekend rate cutting
long-distance call prices before Christmas.
Mercury has matched BT's price cuts, and claims to be cheaper for most
long-distance calls, although discount schemes confuse the picture.
BT and Mercury will both abolish peak rates on March 9, from when a
three-minute BT local call on a weekday morning will cost 15p instead of
20p. A three-minute national call will be 10p cheaper.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT group managing director, said: 'This latest price
change not only cuts the price of calls for all our customers, but also
makes our price structure much simpler and easier to understand.'
Mercury competes with BT for long-distance and international traffic. By
contrast, MFS has built its business by competing with former local monopoly
carriers, offering access to long-distance networks.
BT is already under pressure in its local market from cable companies,
mostly US owned, building combined cable television and telephone networks.
Cable operators have more than 300,000 telephone customers and are growing
rapidly. They plan to invest more than Pounds 5bn in UK cable over the next
five years.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Whitehall admits aid for arms in dam deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Precise amounts of British foreign aid were offered to the Malaysian
government in return for arms purchases as part of a preliminary agreement
between the two governments, the Foreign Office said yesterday.
The disclosure, that a protocol for a Pounds 1bn arms deal signed in March
1988 by the two governments contained 'figures relating amounts or
percentages of civil aid to amounts of arms purchases', is the most
compelling evidence to date that the government breached its own guidelines
that the provision of aid should not be linked to arms sales.
The admission was made last night in a parliamentary written answer by Mr
Alastair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, in response to a question from
Mr Alan Williams, the Labour MP for Swansea West. The allegation that the
protocol contained an aid-for-arms formula was first made last week in the
Economist magazine.
Last month, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had said that the
protocol included 'a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects
under this programme' ', but gave no hint that precise amounts of aid were
offered. In an interview last week, Lord Younger, who was defence secretary
at the time and signed the protocol, said he had 'no recollection' that it
contained an aid-for-arms formula.
Soon after the signing of the protocol, Lord Younger was advised by the
Foreign Office that aid could not be linked to arms sales, so in June 1988
he wrote to the Malaysian government to inform them of this.
Last night, the Foreign Office would not reveal the specific amounts of aid
offered in the protocol. However, the disclosure strengthened claims made by
Labour MPs that the donation of Pounds 234m of aid to the Malaysians to help
build a dam on the Pergau river was made in return for the arms deal.
Mr Williams, a member of a backbench committee that has investigated the
affair, said that yesterday's disclosure 'destroyed the government's
pretence'.
He said: 'For five years ministers have not just been economical with the
truth, they have been miserly with the truth.'

Precise amounts of British foreign aid were offered to the Malaysian

The disclosure, that a protocol for a Pounds 1bn arms deal signed in March

Labour MPs that the donation of Pounds 234m of aid to the Malaysians to help
build a dam on the Pergau river was made in return for the arms deal. At the
end of last year, a National Audit Office report criticised the method of
funding for the dam chosen by the UK government.
It has also emerged that the aid was given despite opposition from the
Overseas Development Administration, which is supposed to have
responsibility for administering the Aid and Trade Provision used to fund
the dam.
Foreign Office officials said yesterday that Cabinet Office guidelines on
the distribution of official documents made it highly unlikely that the

FT  09 FEB 94 / Budget tax changes 'hit middle incomes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour found new ammunition yesterday in its battle against the government's
taxation policy after an independent think-tank claimed that the tax rises
introduced in the last two budgets would be mainly at the expense of people
on middle incomes.
In a report published yesterday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the
tax rises announced last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke and his predecessor as
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, would largely reverse the overall reduction of
taxation in the late 1980s.
Direct taxes on incomes were reduced in the 1980s while indirect taxes,
levied on consumption, will now account for much of the revenue rise. Those
who gained from the cuts in the 1980s will not be those who lose from the
increases.
The IFS said people on middling incomes would be particularly hit by the
last two budgets because of changes to mortgage interest relief, married
couples' allowances and value added tax on fuel.
It claimed that the poorest 10 per cent of the population would have lost an
average of Pounds 3 per week from tax changes in the decade to 1995, while
the richest 10 per cent would have gained more than Pounds 30 per week.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, claimed the figures showed how the
Conservatives had turned the tax system into 'the most powerful weapon for
reinforcing inequality and creating record unfairness in British society'
and that the government had created 'the most unfair tax system since the
1930s'.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, countered that
Tory taxation policy had boosted wealth creation, improving living standards
and increasing the amount of tax paid by high earners.
'The figures show that a man on average earnings with two children has seen
his real take-home pay grow by over Pounds 80 a week since 1979,' Mr Dorrell
told BBC radio.
The report showed that households' disposable incomes will have risen by an
average of Pounds 4 per week since 1985, but that these gains are
distributed unevenly. High-income households gained substantially from
reductions in income tax, whereas poorer households gained little and will
lose from the increases in indirect taxation.

FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada's inability to secure a recommendation for its increased offer
leaves LWT's shareholders with a decision they will not relish. The
industrial logic for consolidation may be clear. The financial argument is
also more compelling. Nevertheless, the big institutional investors, which
control most of LWT's stock, will be reluctant to sell out a management that
has done such a good job in delivering shareholder value.
But any sympathy will be tempered by fear of what will happen to LWT's
shares should the bid fail. The media re-rating is unlikely to sustain the
shares at the current level. Many shareholders, with stakes in both
companies, will also be mindful of the damage that would cause Granada, too.
That suggests the offer will succeed, however shame-faced some investors may
feel.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fear about Reuters was that it had lost its growth momentum. But it now
appears that the stalling in the rate of screen installations at the end of
the 1980s reflected the cyclical downturn in financial markets rather than a
terminal decline in prospects. Reuters' annual results certainly highlight a
strong upturn in activity. Even when currency gains are stripped out,
Reuters achieved double-digit revenue growth in the second half of 1993 and
forecast that trend would continue this year. Instinet has been the star
performer, almost tripling its profits contribution to Pounds 38m. Moreover,
although Reuters' prices may not rise in 1994, its margins should still
widen due to an improving product mix.
Despite its Pounds 350m share buy-back scheme, Reuters ended the year with
Pounds 450m in the bank. An increasing rate of installations, higher
research and development costs and recent acquisitions will absorb much of
this year's cash flow. But Reuters retains substantial resources to back the
seedcorn investments it has scattered in other fields should any promise to
sprout shoots.
In the short run, Reuters will have to work hard to make sense of Quotron,
which is experiencing a high rate of cancellations reducing its subscription
base to well below 40,000. The uncertain future of Globex may also cause
some anxious moments. But the chief concern of investors will be how great a
premium they are prepared to pay for what is now the UK's biggest media
business. Reuters' rating of 27 times 1993 earnings is certainly racy. Then
again, many other media stocks sit on just as fat multiples with far less
justification.

FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to adjust to the idea that Westland, in such deep trouble eight
years ago, is now worth over Pounds 500m. But the company's medium term
prospects have been transformed by good management and the Royal Navy's
order for the EH-101 helicopter. Having sweated through the hard part of the
recovery, Westland may be forgiven for feeling that GKN's bid is
opportunistic. Faced with the current offer, shareholders may agree.
Despite GKN's brave attempts to make a helicopter look like an armoured
personnel carrier, there is little overlap between the two defence
businesses. The industrial logic of the deal is thus weak. On the other
hand, profits from the Warrior fighting vehicle will slow in 1996, just as
the EH-101 comes on stream, making the deal look wonderful on an analyst's
spread sheet. At that stage, Westland's UK earnings would also release a
large slug of GKN's pent-up Advance Corporation Tax.
Yet GKN has come in at a discount to the current market price. Admittedly,
it is offering other shareholders the same deal it struck with United
Technologies, and it already holds 47 per cent of the shares. But to reap
the ACT benefits, GKN needs at least 75 per cent of the equity. Relying on a
few institutions to tip it over 50 per cent, and then hoping that everyone
else will cave in rather than remain a minority holder, is a dangerous game
in a share with Westland's growth prospects. Clearly, there would be more
money available for a recommendation, but that looks unlikely at anything
like the current price.
There are financial risks with a small company shouldering such large
defence contracts. Ironically, those concerns might increase if Westland
were to win the British Army attack helicopter order with the Apache. Even
so, it looks as though GKN wants Westland more than Westland needs GKN.

FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Cut down to size
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A quarter-point cut in the base rate was baffling after last week's upbeat
economic report from the Treasury. After last night's inflation report from
the Bank of England, it is even more so. Though the report expresses
satisfaction with the underlying fall in inflation, it attributes a large
part to the one-off effect of supermarket price cutting. It contains nothing
which calls out for an immediate fall in rates. Indeed, it suggests that a
rise in underlying inflation is more likely than a further fall. Against
that backdrop, markets were left groping for an explanation for the rate
cut. The more it pondered, the more worried the gilts market became. Long
issues lost all their early gains and more.
The natural temptation was to assume that the main motivation was political.
The government faces difficult local and European elections in May and the
prime minister has said he expects Tory support to revive as voters see the
economy recover. He cannot risk the elections coinciding with a fresh
economic slowdown induced by April's tax increases. Such an interpretation
is impossible to prove. But in the absence of anything better, it is likely
to stick.
For its part, the Bank seemed prepared to accept a quarter-point cut on the
basis that it was better to be safe than sorry about the impact of the tax
increases, but it was adamant in seeing no justification for a half-point
cut. Perhaps the quarter point was a compromise, but the fact that rates are
moving in such small stages suggests they must be near their trough. That is
a bitter pill for the gilts market, especially if politics are influencing
monetary policy. Sterling's sharp fall against the dollar last night
reinforced the belief that US investors were moving on from gilts. The
government cannot afford to see them go. It still has a lot of paper to
sell.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts surrender early gains after buyers
fail to materialise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds shot up by more than one point immediately after
yesterday's unexpected quarter point cut in bank base rates as traders
scrambled to cover short positions.
However, they lost their gains as hopes of follow-through buying failed to
materialise. By the end of the afternoon long-dated gilts were around a  1/2
point lower but the shorter end showed gains of just under a  1/4 point.
Analysts attributed the lack of buying interest to sterling's weakness,
which put off international investors, and to the domestic political
situation which had taken the gloss off the rate cut. Some feared that the
recent political difficulties of the ruling Conservative government would
hang over the market for some time.
Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International,
said yesterday's rate cut had also raised fears in the market that it might
be the last in the UK's current interest rate cycle.
However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said he
would be surprised if it this was the last rate cut, especially in view of
comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, that future
interest rate cuts were likely to be of a similar size to yesterday's  1/4
point cut.
'Yesterday's  1/4 point cut will do next to nothing to help the economy so
it must be seen as part of a continuing package of rate cuts,' said Mr
Bootle.
In his view, the UK authorities must be keen to show the market that
interest rates could come down in the UK despite last week's rise in US
interest rates. Furthermore, the rate cut appeared to be justified by the
Bank of England's favourable inflation report which was published yesterday.
The March long gilt future on Liffe stood at the day's low of 116 towards
the close of trading, down  1/2 point on the day and down from the day's
best level of 117 23/32 .
German government bonds and futures also gave up their gains yesterday as
the odds stacked up against an early cut in German interest rates. The March
bund future on Liffe fell 0.13 point to 98.91 in the late afternoon, down
from the day's high of 99.37.
Traders said the release yesterday of better-than-expected jobless data for
January, the Bundesbank's decision to set a tender at an unchanged fixed
rate of 6 per cent, and the D-Mark's weakness had led the market to believe
that the Bundesbank would delay any interest rate reductions until March.
The very long end of the market was also put under pressure by the
government's decision to increase volume in the 6.25 per cent 2024 bund by
DM3bn. The yield on the 30-year bund rose to 6.45 per cent from 6.38 per
cent on Monday.
Mr Andre de Silva, analyst at PaineWebber, noted that the 30-year bunds were
now yielding 59 basis points more than 10-year bunds, which compared with
spreads of 57 basis points in the Netherlands, 56 basis points in Italy and
54 basis points in France.
French government bonds traded in a narrow range as the rate cut in the UK
was offset by the Bundesbank's announcement of an unchanged repo tender.
The March notional bond contract lost 0.38 point to 128.68 in the late
afternoon, down from an intraday high of 128.94.
Japanese government bonds and futures showed little change from their Tokyo
levels in European trading hours as dealers digested the contents of the
government's Y15,250bn package of tax cuts, government spending and loans,
designed to pull the economy out of recession.
The March future, which had risen just over a  1/2 point in Tokyo, traded
around its Tokyo closing level of 114.30 in the afternoon in London. The
yield on the benchmark JGB no 157 stood at 3.48 per cent in London,
unchanged from its final level in Tokyo.
Mr James Greener, analyst at Toyo Trust International, said that although
the market impact of the fiscal package had been broadly neutral, a likely
consequence would be larger and more frequent auctions by the Ministry of
Finance.
He expected the next Y600bn auction of four-year paper to be announced today
with a coupon of 2.8 per cent.
'The market is likely to cope because there is plenty of cash on deposit but
it needs to be teased out with a decent coupon,' Mr Greener said.
Prices on short-dated US bonds held steady after the Treasury's auction of
new three-year notes, but concern over inflation brought further weakness to
the long end of the yield curve.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 lower
at 97 7/16 , with the yield rising to 6.44 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note eased  1/32 to 99 3/16 , to yield 4.417 per cent.
With no first-tier economic reports on offer, the market's sights were
focused squarely on the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding
operation, which began yesterday afternoon with the sale of Dollars 17bn in
three-year securities. Traders had approached the auction with caution, in
view of the Federal Reserve's decision last week to nudge up short-term
interest rates for the first time in five years.
In the event, demand for the Dollars 17bn issue proved adequate. Bonds were
awarded at an averaged yield of 4.83 per cent, slightly above expectations.
The inflation-sensitive long end fared poorly, however, posting moderate
losses for the fourth consecutive session. With January producer price data
due out Friday, the issuance of Dollars 11bn in new 30-year securities
tomorrow was seen as an obstacle by many traders. The market was fearful the
report would contain more bad news on inflation, which would undercut the
value of the long bond.
A Dollars 12bn auction of 10-year notes is scheduled for this afternoon.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Concern grows in Tory ranks after MP's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, JIMMY BURNS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern about the political consequences of the bizarre death of a
Conservative MP was growing among Tory backbenchers yesterday, in spite of
plans by Mr John Major to launch yet another attempt to shore up his
government's authority.
Party leaders sought to distance the government from the death on Monday of
Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, which was still being investigated by
police last night.
'I think the public will take the view that this kind of tragedy could take
place in any party, in any organisation, and will view it in that way,' said
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman.
The circumstances of Mr Milligan's death, which were leaked by junior police
officers, prompted a flood of rumours about other MPs. Mr Milligan was found
on the floor of his west London house, wearing women's underwear and with a
plastic bag over his head.
The cause of Mr Milligan's death was unclear. A post mortem was
'inconclusive'. Scotland Yard refused to rule out murder.
Shocked Tory MPs drew comfort from the reluctance of Labour and the Liberal
Democrats to exploit the affair, which is regarded by the opposition parties
as a personal matter.
Party officials hope the opposition silence will ensure that the political
impact is less damaging than other recent scandals such as the admission by
Mr Tim Yeo, a junior minister, that he had fathered a child outside
marriage.
But some Conservatives said the response to Mr Milligan's death demonstrated
the danger of the prime minister's determination to stand by his back to
basics campaign for a return to traditional values.
'The back to basics campaign is too inward-looking,' said Ms Emma Nicholson,
Tory MP for Devon West. 'It has become a self-destructive slogan. I think we
should drop it.' Downing Street said Mr Major would use a visit to Leicester
to insist that he is 'supremely confident' about the government's prospects.
However, the government's difficulties intensified last night after a
critical speech on Europe by Lord Tebbit, a leading Thatcherite, and an
admission by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, that the government was not
totally in control of events.
Asked whether he intended to mount a leadership challenge, Mr Clarke said in
a radio interview that 'nobody is going to be a Conservative prime minister
unless we can get the government into control and put it in a position where
it has a reasonable prospect of winning the next election'.
The government is expected to announce that the Eastleigh by-election will
be held on May 5 to coincide with local elections.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Clarke nudges interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The change in UK base rate announced by the Bank of England yesterday came
as a surprise, the surprise being not so much the fact of a cut, as its
small size. This was the first quarter-point cut since April 1985. What does
such fine-tuning of interest rates mean and does it make any sense?
The justification for the small change in the base rate of interest was
provided by the Bank's inflation report, published - not coincidentally - on
the day the cut was announced. It has three main messages: first, inflation
has turned out significantly lower than forecast last November, partly
because of large reductions in food prices; second, underlying inflation is
projected to stabilise at about 2-3 per cent from the middle of this year,
well below the forecasts made last November; but, third, 'the risks to the
central projection for inflation are asymmetric - a rise in underlying
inflation seems more likely than a further fall'.
If lower-than-expected inflation was thought to justify yesterday's
reduction in base rates, the relatively high risk of an unfavourable future
outcome justified only a small one. In response, the authorities decided to
do something, but not much.
With base rates down to levels last seen very briefly in 1977, the
chancellor also argues that 'it is right to reduce the magnitude of interest
rate changes'. Yesterday's quarter-point reduction is, for example,
proportionately equivalent to a half-point cut with base rates at 11 per
cent. It will also generate a reduction of some 10 per cent in the
short-term real rate of interest. While small, therefore, the cut is not
absurdly small.
For all that, the move is mainly symbolic. The authorities have decided to
adopt the monetary policy equivalent of the lifting of the governor's
eye-brows.
Mr Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve demonstrated only last Friday the
effectiveness of an intrinsically trivial change in interest rates, at least
when it comes from a respected institution and signals the turn in the
interest rate cycle. But what does this particular change symbolise? One
part of the answer is that Mr Kenneth Clarke is fairly content with the
economy's likely performance. Another part is that the authorities believe
they can fine-tune monetary policy in response to emerging news about both
inflation and economic activity.
The criticism of the fine-tuning is that it assumes an implausible amount of
knowledge. The criticism of what Mr Clarke calls prudence is more serious.
It is that this is just another word for complacency.
The Bank's inflation report shows that employees' expectations of inflation
have been running considerably above actual inflation and wage settlements.
This means that they have been forced by high unemployment to accept lower
than desired wage increases. Since unemployment remains high, pay inflation
may fall further. Moreover, retail price inflation is forecast by the Bank
to turn out lower than employees expect, even with the tax increases in the
pipeline.
The economy may also slow. As the report points out, if real disposable
income were to stagnate over the next two years, a growth rate of 2 1/2 per
cent a year in real consumption would require a decline in the personal
savings ratio to 6 per cent, a level last seen in 1988. Given the tax
increases in prospect, such stagnation in real disposable incomes is
conceivable. How likely then is the steep decline in the savings rate,
particularly given the still exceptionally high ratios of personal debt to
income?
In short, the Bank could still be too pessimistic on inflation, which might
fall faster than forecast, partly because of current capacity
under-utilisation and partly because of slow growth in demand. If so, the
chancellor may find himself making several of these quarter-point cuts.
Politically, this would give him more days on which to announce good news.
Economically, such fine-tuning has little to recommend it. But provided the
chancellor responds swiftly to developments, it need not do much harm
either.

John Major's arrival in Leicester last night on the first of his promised
meet-the-people tours has not put an end to No 10's bunker mentality.
Desperate to boost morale ahead of the local elections, Major has invited
half a dozen of the Tory party's top women activists for a tete-a-tete next
month at Downing Street. But the distinguished guests have been told that it
will not be an open session where any old gripe can be aired.
Instead they are required to submit - in advance - two written questions.
Major has promised to answer one question from each. The sort of treatment
one might expect to be dished out to errant kids rather than party
stalwarts.

Poor old British Telecom. Its young rival, Mercury, really does seem to be
running rings round it in the public relations battle over its biggest ever
single price cut.
No sooner had Michael Hepher, BT's group managing director, addressed the
nation yesterday morning on BBC radio's Today programme, than up popped a
man from Mercury saying his company was also cutting its prices. Hepher then
moved across to BBC breakfast TV, only to find himself sparring with Terry
Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition strategy.
Hepher, keen to maximise the impact of what should have been BT's biggest
publicity coup in years, had agreed to carry on the debate with Mercury on
ITN's lunchtime news. However, when BT heard that Mercury chief executive
Mike Harris had delegated one of his flunkies, the indefatigable Rhodes,
Hepher bowed out. BT's press office said last night that Hepher had wanted
to debate the subject with the 'organ grinder, rather than the organ
grinder's assistant'.

Even former United Nations secretaries-general are no longer treated with
respect. Javier Perez de Cuellar - whose cv boasts more than 30 honorary
degrees and 'the highest decorations of nearly 40 countries' - was to be
found in London yesterday giving an impassioned talk about the importance of
democracy to the Anglo-Peruvian society.
'I am 100 per cent a democrat and think that all problems can be solved by
democracy,' opined de Cuellar. 'Oh yeah,' piped up a Colombian scribbler,
somewhat peeved when the great man pooh-poohed the notion of solving the
international drugs problem by legalising the trafficking of narcotics. 'We
have a long-established democracy in Colombia and we haven't solved all
these problems,' she averred.

A private lunch in Johannesburg yesterday offered an intriguing insight into
both the African National Congress and one of South Africa's leading
newspaper groups.
Host was David Kovarsky, chief executive of Times Media, whose publications
include Business Day, the Sunday Times and the Financial Mail. Guest of
honour was ANC president Nelson Mandela. Surprisingly absent, as a result of
ANC objections, was Nigel Bruce, editor of the Financial Mail.
Bruce was paying the price for having offended Pallo Jordan, a member of the
ANC executive and the organisation's information supremo; Jordan was invited
to the lunch. Three years ago Bruce, in an article on South Africa's service
sector, referred to Johannesburg waiters as 'truculent tribesmen with a
thumb in the soup and an eye on the clock'.
When the ANC received Kovarsky's invitation to lunch, Jordan made clear that
he and Mandela would only attend if the author of this slur was not present.
Two weeks ago Bruce wrote to Jordan accepting that the comment might have
been in poor taste, expressing 'sincere regret' if it had caused offence,
but saying that he did not deserve to be branded a racist on this account.
Jordan spurned the olive branch and, with Kovarsky's reluctant approval,
Bruce withdrew from the lunch, saying to Jordan: 'I do not wish to force my
company on you or anyone else.' What's for dessert?

FT  09 FEB 94 / Swoop for a tempting morsel: GKN's bid for Westland comes as
the helicopter industry undergoes restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland's position as an independent company and the UK's only helicopter
manufacturer always looked vulnerable after its controversial rescue eight
years ago. But there is a particular irony in yesterday's Pounds 500m
takeover swoop by GKN of the Yeovil-based helicopter manufacturer.
Westland's financial crisis in 1986, precipitated by an abortive attempt to
develop the W30, a civil version of its Lynx military helicopter, led to a
full-blown cabinet crisis with the resignation of Mr Michael Heseltine, at
the time defence secretary, and the then trade and industry secretary, Mr
Leon Brittan.
The issue was whether Westland should end up under American control or as
part of a new European helicopter consortium led by Aerospatiale of France.
Yesterday the company appeared on the verge of falling into the hands of a
venerable British engineering company, better known for its expertise in the
car components industry.
Westland's initial reaction was to describe the GKN bid as 'unwelcome'. But
while GKN's timing caught it by surprise, it had already been bracing itself
for a takeover approach in the past few months. Ever since United
Technologies (UTC), the US conglomerate and owner of Sikorsky, the world's
biggest helicopter manufacturer, indicated last year it intended to shed its
18.7 per cent equity holding in Westland, the die appeared to be cast for
Westland's independence.
UTC's shareholding dated back to the original Westland rescue package, when
the US company was flanked by Fiat of Italy and Hanson, the industrial
conglomerate, as core shareholders of the UK helicopter group. In 1988, GKN
bought the Fiat and Hanson holdings, giving it a 22 per cent stake in the
company as well as a mutual agreement with UTC to have first rights on each
other's Westland interests.
Armed with UTC's agreement on Monday to sell its 18.7 per cent stake to GKN,
and with a big minority of the shares under its belt, the UK engineering
group launched its full bid. If successful, GKN will secure a more solid UK
base for Westland. The question is whether a takeover by GKN would provide a
long-term solution for Westland and helicopter development in the UK as the
industry consolidates in the US and Europe.
Mr Alan Jones, the Westland chief executive who will take over next month as
chairman from Sir Leslie Fletcher, has restructured the company during the
past four years and placed it on a sounder footing. Although helicopter
deliveries are at a low ebb - the company only delivered four last year -
there are encouraging prospects in the shape of Westland's new EH101 naval
and transport helicopter, developed with Agusta of Italy. It has continued
to make good profits from helicopter spares and overhaul business and is
bidding, in a partnership with McDonnell Douglas, for the UK army's Pounds
2bn requirement for a new attack helicopter.
Westland has also been cutting its cost base sharply, and has shed more than
2,000 jobs in the past six years. In addition, it has expanded in the civil
aerospace business, supplying components and structures for large airframe
programmes. Its Pounds 1.45bn order backlog guarantees it three years of
sales.
But for all this successful restructuring, Westland still faces a problem of
scale in an industry undergoing a profound shake-up. In Europe, Aerospatiale
of France has merged its helicopter business with that of Deutsche Aerospace
to create the Eurocopter joint company, the world's second-largest
helicopter manufacturer. In the US, McDonnell Douglas had considered selling
its helicopter division because it felt the operations would profit more
from forming part of a bigger group, while the company focused on its other
defence activities. McDonnell Douglas has since decided to hold on to its
helicopter business, but has made no secret that it would still consider a
sale if the right opportunity arose.
Although Westland might be too small to compete alone, its restructuring and
EH101 helicopter have made it an attractive target for GKN. Sir David Lees,
GKN chairman, conceded the improved outlook at Westland was an important
reason for his company's move. GKN acquired its original stake in Westland
as a means, eventually, of developing its defence activities. 'We looked
upon our stake in Westland as an option: it was a question whether we would
exercise that option or sell it,' Sir David explained.
Although GKN is the UK's leading supplier of light armoured vehicles, its
defence business occupies a modest position in its industrial portfolio. The
defence division had sales of about Pounds 120m last year, representing
deliveries of Warrior armed vehicles to the Ministry of Defence. This
compared with total group sales of about Pounds 2.5bn.
For GKN there were two stark options. First, it could seek control of
Westland or sell its stake; second, and more significant, it had to choose
whether to increase its overall presence in the defence sector or pull out
altogether. At a time when far-reaching changes are taking place among the
big contractors, all defence companies are facing the hard decision of
whether to persevere in the business or divest.
Sir David said the company had considered both options. Factors swaying the
decision included changes in the defence market following the cold war,
GKN's success in penetrating the Middle East export market last year with
its Warrior vehicle, and progress in Westland's EH101 programme.
Sir David believes the post-coldwar environment has increased demand for
rapid-deployment military equipment, such as armoured vehicles and
helicopters. Although defence spending has been cut, the emphasis is on
mobile battlefield equipment for localised conflicts, peacekeeping and
internal security. 'The threat of more regional conflicts like Bosnia,
Somalia or the Gulf are unfortunately very real. Helicopters and armed
vehicles are very useful products in these military situations,' he said.
Although GKN's contract to supply Warrior vehicles to the MoD ends this
year, an order for an unspecified number of armoured vehicles from Kuwait
will maintain Warrior production until 1997.
Apart from complementing GKN's activities in the specialised niche of
rapid-deployment battlefield equipment, Westland would provide the
engineering group with a hedge if future export sales of armoured vehicles
failed to meet expectations. Simply put, by the time the Kuwaiti contract
runs out in 1997, Westland should be starting the production runs of its new
EH101 helicopter.
Sir David said GKN started thinking seriously about expanding its defence
business last year, when there were signs that UTC was interested in selling
its stake in Westland. The US company is in the throes of its own
restructuring, and is competing against Westland in some product areas,
notably with its proposed S92 large helicopter which would rival the EH101.
Everything suddenly seems to have fallen into GKN's lap: the UTC holding has
now given it a 47 per cent stake in Westland and ultimate, if not perhaps
immediate, control of the helicopter maker; it has boosted the size of its
defence division into a Pounds 500m-sales-a-year operation, making it the
third leg of its core businesses, along with automobile components and
industrial services; it has also insured itself against any future swings in
the defence sector by positioning itself in both the armoured vehicles and
helicopter markets.
Whether this can provide a sound, long-term basis for GKN's expanding
defence interests and for the UK helicopter industry is an open question.
The prospect of the imminent revival of talks between British Aerospace and
the General Electric Company to establish a single, large UK defence group
could have profound repercussions for Westland and its prospective new
owner.
BAe has made no secret of its interest in eventually entering the military
helicopter business - the missing link in its comprehensive defence
aerospace activities. Two years ago, it joined forces with GEC to make an
unsuccessful bid for the EH101 contract from the MOD, but was beaten by
Westland, partnered by IBM. It has now linked up with the Franco-German
Eurocopter group to challenge Westland for the army's new attack helicopter
requirement. The predator is still prowling around Westland.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Into uncharted territory: The careful calculations that lay
behind yesterday's cut in UK base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Treasury and Bank of England, yesterday's decision to cut bank base
rates by a quarter percentage point to 5.25 per cent was a judgment of
Solomon.
Inflation, whether measured by the 'headline' retail prices index or by the
government's chosen 'underlying' inflation rate of RPI minus mortgage
interest payments, is set to rise in the months ahead as the indirect taxes
decided in last year's two Budgets are put into effect.
On the other hand, as yesterday's Bank of England inflation report makes
clear, the rise will come from a much lower base than assumed just three
months ago so that, with luck, the official target ceiling of 4 per cent for
underlying retail price inflation will not be breached either this year or
next.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, focused yesterday on recent economic
indicators in his explanation for the first quarter-point rate change since
1985. But the discussions between the Bank and Treasury that led up to the
decision when Mr Clarke met Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, a week ago,
were concerned just as much with the future.
The UK economy is heading into uncharted territory, requiring judgments by
policymakers for which recent experience is a poor guide.
The biggest imponderable is the fiscal tightening that takes effect from
April when the tax increases decided last year really begin to bite. The
increased tax burden in 1994-95 - at Pounds 8.4bn or 1.3 per cent of gross
domestic product - looks formidable. But nobody can tell how the public will
react to the mix of frozen tax allowances, increased national insurance
contributions, reduced mortgage interest relief and lower married couples'
allowance, and value added tax on domestic fuel and power.
Will the tightening choke off the recovery, as many have warned? Or will low
inflation, falling interest rates and increased consumer confidence caused
by falling unemployment prompt people to reduce their savings from the most
recent recorded level of 10.6 per cent of disposable income and so keep up a
healthy level of consumption?
The strength of the economy since the November Budget favours the second
scenario. But if the economy is so strong, will not people want higher wages
to offset the increased tax burdens and set off a wage-price spiral similar
to those that were so familiar in the past?
The Bank and Treasury hope that they will not. They have taken comfort from
the way in which the inflationary pressures unleashed by sterling's
devaluation in September 1992 were absorbed by industry, wholesalers,
retailers and employees, and they are hoping that wage pressures will stay
subdued after the tax rises because there is still thought to be
considerable slack in the economy.
It is this slack, or output gap, that has enabled the UK to cut rates at a
time when economic growth appears to have risen above its long-term trend
rate. The US, where the economy is growing faster and recovery is further
advanced than in Britain, last week decided to nudge its short-term interest
rates higher by a quarter of a percentage point precisely because it feared
the economy was absorbing its slack and might run into inflationary
bottlenecks.
Yesterday's move is further evidence of the freedom given to the monetary
authorities by the pound's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. The UK's rate cut came as the Bundesbank was
disappointing hopes of lower German interest rates by leaving its
significant 'repo' rate unchanged at 6 per cent. The UK base-rate reduction
exerted only moderate downward pressure on the pound and the exchange rate
of sterling seems to have played no more than a minor role in the
discussions leading up to the interest rate cut.
Instead, by timing the cut for the same day as the Bank's inflation report,
the authorities were keen to emphasise how interest rate decisions in
Britain are now determined primarily by the medium-term inflation outlook.
In choosing a day when Mr Clarke left London early on a trip to Paris and Mr
George was conferring with fellow central bankers in Basle, they may also
have sought to take the drama out of the move.
All the signs are that the final decision was finely balanced. The Bank
certainly would have opposed a cut of half a percentage point for fear that
it might fuel inflation.
The quarter-point base rate cut will have little perceptible impact on the
UK economy. Indeed, the Halifax Building Society said yesterday that it
would not change its borrowing or lending rates following the move.
But the rate reduction will reverse a slight tightening of monetary
conditions that had arisen because inflation has been more subdued than
anticipated since November, so pushing real interest rates higher. In that
case it will do no harm.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Dial Asia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia-Pacific has the world's fastest growing regional economy. But beyond a
handful of developed countries, its telecommunications networks are
primitive. According to the World Bank, across much of the region they
'continue to perform substantially and chronically beneath the needs of
their respective economies'.
Virtually all of the medium- and low-income countries in the region have
long waiting lists for telephone lines. In nearly half of those countries it
would take until 2000 or later to meet existing demand on the basis of
recent growth rates. China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam - to take just the
larger lower-income states - provide less than one phone line per 100
people.
All governments in the region recognise the problem. Most of them also sense
the solution: liberalisation of laws restricting the provision of
telecommunications services. But across the region they are prevaricating,
willing the end but suspicious of the means - particularly if it involves,
as it inevitably does, the admission of overseas companies as partners in
new ventures.
Their main fears are for control and jobs. Ministers see telecommunications
as 'strategic', so do not want to forfeit state control. They also worry
that privatisation and competition will result in large-scale cost-cutting,
as it has in developed countries.
Both fears are unfounded or exaggerated. Privatisation of existing operators
is not the first essential, as the World Bank study rightly notes. The
priority is to license new operators to build lines and provide services,
and to guarantee a sound regulatory and investment environment. That can be
done without losing ultimate state control, notably by use of 'build,
operate, transfer' contracts of the kind being pioneered by some countries.
Similarly, privatisation need not involve the sale of a majority stake. The
critical objective for developing countries should be to acquire a strategic
partner with cash and telecoms knowhow.
Governments would do well to study Venezuela's experience. In the two years
since a consortium led by the US operator GTE took a minority stake in the
country's state telephone company, it has received more network investment
than in the previous 20 years. The moral is not restricted to
telecommunications.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Leading Article: EU secrets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in June 1992, the
governments they thus rebuffed have spoken frequently of the European
Union's need to improve its image by showing greater 'openness'.
Unfortunately, the rhetoric about transparency and accountability is still
mocked by the practice.
Debates in the council of ministers remain shrouded in unnecessary secrecy.
The Commission, for all its promises of a more systematically open approach,
has yet to produce change where it matters. Now the member states are
becoming embroiled in an embarrassing legal wrangle over attempts to limit
public access to information on their decisions.
The member states cannot be faulted on the stated aim of their code of
conduct on information, which is to allow unrestricted access except where
monetary stability, national security, commercial confidentiality, privacy
or relations with non-member countries might be endangered. In December,
however, the council, by majority vote, inserted an exemption giving EU
institutions the right to reject requests for information that could be
'contrary to the efficiency and good order of the institution'.
Infuriated by this potentially open-ended confidentiality clause, the Dutch
government has decided to seek annulment of the code of conduct in the
European Court on the grounds that a purported attempt to improve the rights
of EU citizens should have been settled by unanimity rather than majority.
Its action is thoroughly welcome. If the December decision is not changed,
it will seriously undermine such moves to 'openness' as have already
occurred and allow EU institutions to maintain their traditional approach:
that all information is secret unless they decide otherwise.
Reversing this move, however, will only be a first step in bringing genuine
transparency to EU affairs. Ideally, the Union would adopt a comprehensive
freedom of information act along US lines, and allow the full televising of
its main legislative body, the council. As a basic minimum, it should
publish the full agenda before council meetings and disclose how governments
voted thereafter. Only then will the citizens of EU member states be able to
exercise proper scrutiny of the decisions being taken secretly in their name
in Brussels.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Not as bleak as it looks: Some essential truths about
Northern Ireland are becoming clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London and Dublin governments are to give a new push to their initiative
for peace in Northern Ireland. In their joint Anglo-Irish declaration,
launched two months ago, they held out the explicit possibility of eventual
unification of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of
Ireland wanted. But the essential pre-condition for setting this initiative
in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first declare a ceasefire.
That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected the offer; but
the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and shooting suggests that a
permanent ceasefire is not very likely. The UK and Irish prime ministers
meet next week to see where they go from here; it looks as though they need
to think again.
The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that the IRA was
tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and might give up. Yet even
if the terrorists are tired, it requires great faith to conclude that they
can now be converted to democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were
prepared to give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held
hostage by the out-and-out extremists.
If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two governments must
rethink their initiative from top to bottom. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, has said Britain will press ahead with new moves,
including devolved local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a
political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and perhaps the hard
unionists, will be a meagre affair beside the comprehensive agenda of the
December declaration.
Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks, because various
parts of the truth are now being made plain. First, the declaration gives
explicit recognition not just to the undeniable old fact, that Northern
Ireland is historically and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the
new political fact, that its future will be decided not in London but in
Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two governments say
their aim is 'a new political framework founded on consent'; and a purely
British passage says 'it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement
between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of
self-determination, on the basis of consent, if that is their wish'. Neither
passage can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster, let
alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants.
Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of the claims of
Irish unity (though only by consent) is unprecedented. But the corollary of
the principle of consent is that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause
of Irish unity, makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a
denial of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern Ireland, the
two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of a victory of one over
the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a political victory for the
nationalists, because the immediate consequence would be more terrorism by
extremist Protestants, most probably a civil war.
If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of 'reconciliation,
leading to a new political framework', that would be wonderful; but it may
be too much of a miracle to hope for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn
Fein will both be politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities
offered by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to speak
for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that terrorism takes
precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is ruled by the IRA, not the
other way round.
But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in the declaration
is with the definition of the concept of consent. The reason for the
terrorism by Catholics and Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even
if the terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact, there is
never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of political majority, either
for keeping or for changing the constitutional status quo, which could be
counted on to produce a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern
Ireland question.
The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern Ireland will be
decided not by local parties or local majorities, but by agreement between
the governments of Britain and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule
out any idea of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic
terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish declaration.
When the two governments say their aim is 'a new political framework, within
Northern Ireland, for the whole island, and between these islands', they are
talking about shared authority, almost a de facto condominium.
One detailed study* has argued for a de jure condominium, through an
Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary innovation in
constitutional practice, and would have difficulties with the old-timers in
the House of Commons. But it would make logical sense, because it would rule
out, for ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory by
one community at the expense of the other. And it could also make a creative
political contribution to the development of interstate relationships in the
context of the European Union.
But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at least let us
have no more talk of self-determination. We have seen what it has achieved
in former Yugoslavia, and we do not need that kind of self-determination in
Northern Ireland.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover gains a hopeful platform for
the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON BATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The points raised by Messrs Wiltshire and de Looze (Letters, February
2) about the sale of Rover Group to BMW seem based more on emotional
patriotism than fact.
I find it surprising that Mr Wiltshire should consider it a sad conclusion
of the deal that the Rover 800 replacement will be based on a BMW platform.
What is so terrible about using a platform from a motor company recognised
as building the finest chassis in the world?
Moreover, he believes that, as a consequence, the R&amp;D work on this model
will be concentrated in Germany. He overlooks the fact that no fewer than
three of Rover's model ranges (200/400,600 and 800) are based on Honda
platforms, yet the Rover versions were not developed in Japan.
And it is wrong to suggest BMW is interested only in Land Rover. BMW is
buying Rover for its expertise in smaller, front-wheel-drive vehicles - an
example of how technology will flow both ways in this deal.
Mr de Looze asserts three Rover models are 'overdue for replacement' (800,
200/400, and the Metro). While few would dispute this in the case of the
Metro, sales of the 200/400 and 800 suggest car buyers disagree.
It is regrettable Rover is to pass out of British ownership. But it would
have been sadder had it continued to suffer the indifference,
incompatibility and restricted investment offered by BAe. Mr Wiltshire
threatens to stop buying Rover cars. Is this the best way to help Rover's
33,000 British employees? Simon Bates,

FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of local reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC MILLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your extensive coverage of the problems associated with local
government reform in England unfortunately did not include a reference to
the publication on Thursday last week of a study by accountants of the cost
of reform in Scotland. It is entitled Local Government Reorganisation in
Scotland: A Critical Evaluation of Costs.
The study estimates the cost of change is between two and three times the
figure quoted by the secretary of state for Scotland, with none of the
resultant operational savings claimed by the govern-ment.
As has been pointed out in your columns, it is extraordinary that the
government is intent on pursuing in the UK measures with such high
transitional costs (amounting to Pounds 400m for Scotland alone), when the
national priority is to ensure the country's emergence from recession. To
the cash costs of the change have to be added the opportunity costs of the
disruption of services to industry and the community, with no confidence
that benefits - financial or other - will follow.

Sir, Lucy Kellaway regales us ('Time to walk and talk', February 4) with
amusing examples of new management jargon, but ignores a reason for it.
Linguistics specialists tell us words colour our thinking and so influence
our actions. The new jargon does not merely seek to mystify; it helps shift
the agenda. Words such as 'reward', rather than 'pay', and 'rightsizing',
rather than 'redundancies', bolster managerial authority. We may laugh at
jargon but we should know its purpose.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Minnows swim in fresh waters: Patrick Harverson examines the
inroads made by Japanese securities houses on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the battle between economic superpowers, investment banking is a business
where the US has dominated Japan. Even in Japan's home market, the Tokyo
subsidiaries of some of the biggest US securities houses - Salomon Brothers,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - have established good profit records that
some Japanese firms, struggling with the effects of recession, might envy.
While a few big US firms have thrived in Tokyo, their Japanese counterparts
have found it difficult to shine on Wall Street, where US houses have always
dominated.
The balance may now be changing. Competition from Japan's 'big four'
securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko - is intensifying. The
lucrative mainstream of broking, trading and underwriting of stocks and
bonds remains overwhelmingly in US hands, where large distribution networks
and established corporate relationships give American firms an edge. But in
some niche businesses, Japan's big four have built market share relatively
quickly, by applying large amounts of capital and trading skills acquired
locally. The Japanese have also piqued their Wall Street rivals by poaching
many top traders and bankers with the lure of hefty pay packages.
Daiwa America, for example, has established itself as one of the most
profitable players in specialised mortgage-backed securities trading; Nomura
Securities International, in little more than three years, has become one of
the main participants in the still small business of 'program' trading, in
which firms execute, usually with computers, large-volume stock trades for
US institutions; Nikko Securities International has become heavily involved
in the trading of financial futures (contracts for buying or selling
securities at a later date); Yamaichi International is developing a presence
in specialist equity products such as derivatives and arbitrage (trading in
different markets to take advantage of price differences).
In part, diversification has been forced on the big four. Since the early
1990s, the dollar's slide against the yen, the faltering Japanese economy
and the volatility of Tokyo share prices have gradually squeezed the
business that American subsidiaries of Japanese securities firms
traditionally relied upon: selling US securities to Japanese customers and
Japanese securities to US institutions.
Mr Stanley Ginsberg, a senior vice-president at Daiwa America, says when
demand for dollar assets from Japanese clients began to dry up, 'it was
clear that the business (in New York) would have to localise . . . and that
Daiwa America could no longer be a single-service shop'.
Other Japanese firms reached a similar conclusion: the answer has been to
'Americanise' their US subsidiaries. At Daiwa America, one of the first
moves was to bring in Mr Andrew Stone, a former Salomon Brothers
mortgage-backed securities trader, who hired a team of top professionals in
the field from the best Wall Street firms such as First Boston and Merrill
Lynch. Daiwa has pioneered new products which package non-traditional
mortgage assets, such as loans secured on mobile homes, into securities.
Daiwa has subsequently added futures trading and equities arbitrage to its
mortgage backed securities business.
Nikko Securities International has followed many US firms and diversified
into the fast-growing Latin American investment banking market, where it is
underwriting yen-denominated bonds issued by local companies. 'This is a US
firm, so we should act like a US firm,' says Mr Ryosuke Suzuki, chairman of
Nikko's New York operation.
Nomura has gone furthest in reshaping its US subsidiary. The change started
in 1989, when Mr Max Chapman, former president of US investment bank Kidder
Peabody, was appointed co-chairman of Nomura Securities International, the
Japanese firm's US affiliate. He was the first American to fill such a
senior post at a big four firm.
When Mr Chapman arrived, 'this company was essentially a branch office, a
sales office, for Nomura Tokyo', says Mr Joe Schmuckler, the head of equity
derivatives at NSI, who joined the new chairman from Kidder. As well as
overhauling the firm's management, Mr Chapman encouraged the development of
swaps and other derivatives trading, asset management, mortgage-backed
securities, and international equity and bond underwriting.
The common thread through all the changes at the big four has been a shift
in business away from buying and selling securities on behalf of customers
towards trading the firm's own money. Tokyo head offices have therefore had
to allow the US operations greater freedom.
There are still limits, however, on the autonomy the parent companies are
willing to grant. When Nomura's Mr Chapman wanted to buy a Dollars 10m stake
in a small Latin American bank, a region he believes crucial to NSI's
future, Tokyo refused his request.
Any nervousness on the part of Japanese parent companies could be explained
by the experience of the mid-1980s, when the big four tried to challenge
Wall Street firms in the lucrative business of underwriting US company
securities.
The Japanese failed then to make a big impact because they lacked a network
of salesmen and brokers, established corporate relationships and investment
banking skills. They were also used to handling straightforward but
high-volume transactions. The big four eventually realised, says Mr John
Keefe, securities industry observer with the Keefe Worldwide consultancy in
New York, 'the techniques that work in the Tokyo markets - mass offerings of
low-price services - are out of date for the US, where there is more of a
premium placed on offerings tailored to the individual issuer and investor'.
The Japanese securities firms in New York rule out attempting to go down
that route again. Mr Schmuckler of Nomura says: 'We've recognised that it's
going to be a tall order . . . for us to be looked at as a value-added
distributor of US equity products to Americans.' Mr David Sexton, a director
and senior executive vice-president at Yamaichi International, agrees that
winning underwriting business from US companies has 'historically been a
tough nut for all Japanese firms to crack'.
For the big four, however, the strategy of concentrating on niche businesses
is already paying dividends. NSI, after losing money in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, will make more than Dollars 125m in the 1993-94 fiscal year, up
from Dollars 25m the year before.
Others have been reluctant to give figures, but Daiwa says its
mortgage-backed securities operation has turned its US affiliate into a
profit centre, Yamaichi claims to have been in the black for two years,
while Nikko says earnings are gradually improving.
The response to the Japanese revival on Wall Street has been muted. The
chief executive of a top US securities house says: 'I don't think they've
made much progress. They don't do much underwriting for US corporations, in
stocks or bonds. Have they developed a credible government (securities)
trading operation?'
The intention of the Japanese firms, however, has not been to dominate US
underwriting or bond trading. They may be the big four at home, but in New
York they would rather blend into US markets, profiting from smaller, less
high profile, businesses.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Outlaw upwards-only provisions on
commercial rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From V A G TREGEAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Now that there are signs of recovery in the property market it might be
worth considering again the sense and legality of upwards-only rent review
provisions in commercial leases.
It has been the consistent practice of landlords and their agents in the
last 25 years to insist on upwards-only rent review provisions. I am aware
of no significant exceptions since 1966.
I have seen two booms and their respective collapses from 1973 and 1989. In
the recent 1980s boom, the premium for space in the City of London was so
high and the imposition of upwards-only rent reviews so remorseless that one
might be tempted to conclude there was a conspiracy.
The subsequent crash, however, accompanied by high interest rates, found
tenants with falling revenues locked into upwards-only clauses which
prevented rentals reflecting market trends. The consequence has been
insolvency for many, so aggravating the recession, and a considerable amount
of unlet space at rents less than half the boom-year peak. This agony
prompts one to discount the conspiracy theory.
At present, upwards-only rent review clauses are enforceable on grounds that
they are part of a freely negotiated commercial bargain by the parties. This
is rubbish. Tenants locked into high rents that are unaffordable in a
recession suffer a powerful restraint on trade.
In recent negotiations, rentals are enticingly low. Yet the upwards-only
rent review emerges unharmed. There are some deals that modify it, but I
submit these are rare and, as the market goes up, the old habit will be
reinforced again.
As the damage to businesses and profitability both for tenants and landlords
has been so obvious in recent years, surely the time has come to outlaw
upwards-only rent review provisions.
Some may argue that abolition will damage the balance sheets of property
companies and the banks and institutions which lend to them. Recent events
should show these banks and institutions the folly of favouring one small
group of customers over the majority - the tenants. Regrettably, however,
the lessons have not been learnt.
Legislation is the only way to end this pernicious practice.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Auschwitz must be preserved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir SIGMUND STERNBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Christian Tyler's perceptive article (February 5)
in which he raises the question of the future of Auschwitz and its
conflicting role as a memorial, museum and tourist attraction.
I agree with Dr Jonathan Webber: a Jewish memorial is needed and an
educational centre outside the camp should contain all exhibition material.
A possible venue, already extant on the camp's perimeter, is the convent
nuns vacated in 1993 (not 1992) after intervention by the Pope. The convent
building is now empty and in danger of being vandalised. It should be
utilised while the camp itself is left 'silent and eerie', in the words of
Dr David Cesarani.
We should be guided by the survivors who, like Ben Helfgott, feel strongly
that what is left should be preserved. The Holocaust denyers and revisionist
historians will continue to claim that the most evil of crimes never
occurred. But the appeal should be to those who wish to know the truth of
what happened at Auschwitz, why it happened and to ensure it never happens
again.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Polish composer of wide acclaim / Obituary of
Lutoslawski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday morning, just two weeks after his eighty-first birthday, the
composer Lutoslawski died in his native Warsaw. That was something like a
lucky accident, for from the late 1950s - when his Funeral Music for strings
earned him wide international acclaim and interest - Lutoslawski had spent
long periods abroad, teaching in America, Scandinavia and England as well as
conducting his own works. He was soon laden with commissions, honorary
doctorates and prizes. Recently the South Bank devoted a retrospective
series of concerts to his music, and it enjoyed a quasi-popular success that
few living composers could expect.
Lutoslawski was already forty-five when the Funeral Music (an In Memoriam
for Bela Bartok, whose musical character it reflected in its own rigorously
constructed way) made him internationally known. His discovery proceeded in
opposite directions. On the one hand his already substantial oeuvre,
scarcely known outside Poland, offered a wealth of happy finds: in
particular his witty, cross-grained expansion of Liszt's 'Paganini'
variations (from 1941, when he eked out a living by playing cafe-piano), now
a duo-pianists' staple, and the grandly exuberant, playful, slightly
menacing Concerto for Orchestra (1954).
In the other direction, there were his newer, radically exploratory pieces,
from before the Funeral Music and after it - and on and on: the later
Lutoslawski never repeated himself. He pursued various ideals of form,
always original, often oblique and yet transparent. For a time he flirted
(like the Hungarian Gyorgy Ligeti) with 'aleatoric' writing, in which
individual players are left to realise free notation in their own ways, but
strictly contained within the whole composition.
The common factors were always 'definiteness of intention', razor-sharp and
unmistakeable; a superb ear for well-placed, unexpected instrumental colour;
and a dangerous sense of humour (peculiarly Polish, perhaps). To those, the
music of his last two decades - from the Cello Concerto for Rostropovich -
added a stern eloquence, which flowered broadly in his third and fourth
symphonies, but turned laconic and even savage in his series of contrapuntal
Chains for smaller ensembles.
The London Sinfonietta was among the beneficiaries of that series. It is sad
to think that the Chains are broken off now: they amounted to a public
exhibition of a first-class composer's developing thoughts, and one awaited
each new instalment with excited anticipation. It is consoling to remember
that there is plenty of late Lutoslawski that cries out for further,
rewarding acquaintance still; and to reflect that his long career culminated
' unlike most composers', contemporary or long-past ' in a quarter-century
of deserved admiration.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Opera North stars in the South / Review of 'Gloriana'
at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its production of Britten's unlucky Coronation opera Gloriana, Opera
North invaded Covent Garden for the first time on Monday. (The company has
done several trade-offs with the ENO, but it was never exactly 'Opera North'
that we saw at the London Coliseum.) Its moment was well chosen, and so was
the piece. This Gloriana - conducted by Paul Daniel, directed by Phyllida
Lloyd, designed by Anthony Ward - establishes a new stature for the opera,
does that with a whole, committed company, and in so doing reminds us of a
path the Royal Opera might have taken 20-odd years ago, but didn't.
First, the opera itself (one more London performance on Thursday). By common
consent, it bears the restrictive marks of its 1953 origin: semi-official
status as 'the Coronation opera', a felt need for pageantry and Englishry -
not then Britten's natural inclinations - and a resultant compromise between
'public' music and the intimate kind of music-drama that the composer
preferred. Though the crypto-romantic story of Queen Bess and her maverick
Earl of Essex (in William Plomer's libretto after Lytton Strachey) seemed to
offer both-way opportunities, the final score shifts from foot to foot
between Festival of Britain pomp, fey neo-Elizabethan lyricism and darker
post-tonal kicks.
If those elements are not seamlessly melded in the Opera North show, they
are held in a fine, persuasive balance. Ward's stark, effective sets fill up
the Royal Opera stage handsomely, glowing in Rick Fisher's light-designs,
and his costumes are splendid. Miss Lloyd's staging is clean, cogent, bold,
exactly to the purpose: after this production, her Opera North L'Etoile and
her London play Six Degrees of Separation, I should trust her with anything.
Daniel and his orchestra search deep into the score, and bring it up in high
profile with dense, pointed force. The Opera North choruses act as
compellingly as they sing.
Above all there is Josephine Barstow's Elizabeth I, a marvellous monster of
grand feeling and ressentiment, just what Gloriana ideally requires. As
usual, she gives us something unique and memorable; if she had been granted
a naturally glamorous voice too, she might not have striven (who knows?) to
become the great actress-musician that she is. Her Essex is Thomas Randle,
whose macho vocal thrust may be inapt for the haunted 'Second Lute Song' but
contributes hugely to his developing character, recklessly wild and
truculent.
On this page last December, Max Loppert praised the production and its
principals after its Leeds premiere. I should add only some tributes to Paul
Nilon's elegantly sung 'Spirit of the Masque' (which is choreographed to
firm dramatic purpose by Kate Flatt, like the courtly dances later); Hilary
Jackson's diamond-cut lady-in-waiting; and David Gwynne's ripe Ballad
Singer.
Opera North cultivates a regular company of such artists, whereas the Royal
Opera nowadays keeps only a few third-leads and comprimarios on contract -
thus condemning itself (unlike the New York Met, or La Scala or the Vienna
Opera) to largely bought-in casts, and leaving the ENO as the metropolitan
house where the best British singers can find their feet and develop. That
division strikes me as artificial and short-sighted. Just why should
London's 'premier' opera house be content to serve as a profitable stop for
international stars in transit?
The Russian conductor Gennadi Rozhdestvensky has withdrawn from the new
Royal Opera production of Massenet's Cherubin because of artistic
differences, writes Antony Thorncroft. The romantic opera will open, as
scheduled, on Monday, February 14 with Mario Bernardi in the pit.
A busy work schedule limited Rozhdestvensky's appearances at rehearsals and
some of the young singers in the production, which is directed by Tim
Albery, found him difficult to work with. Mario Bernardi has conducted the
work at the Santa Fe Opera.

Estate.

Comedy, we are told with irritating frequency, is to the 1990s what rock and
roll was to the 1960s. Comedians, it is said, have taken over from rock
stars as youth icons. Stand-up comedy, they claim, used to be a low-key
occupation for journeymen, but today's young comedians are stars: look at
Paul Merton in all those soap commercials. Once it was the Rolling Stones
who represented rebellion and the rejection of the older generation's
values, but today it is Steve Coogan, Christopher Morris and the rest of the
team from The Day Today.
It is drivel, of course: part of the naive arrogance of the younger
generation which always thinks it has just invented everything 'shocking',
from free love to loud music. They believe Merton and Ben Elton are
unprecedentedly big stars because they do not realise how large Max Miller
and George Formby loomed in the public imagination of their grandparents'
generation. They honestly believe that there is something quite new and
different about the success of French and Saunders because they are too
young to remember how Morecambe and Wise bestrode the nation via television
in the 1960s. Tell them that M &amp; W used to attract audiences of 20m and
more, as did Steptoe And Son, ratings much larger than any comedian gets
today, and either they refuse to believe you or they say 'Ah, well, that was
in the days before the audience was split by all these new channels,'
overlooking the fact that Coronation Street is still able to pull in more
than 20m today.
There may have been a brief period when London's Comic Strip was brand new,
before The Young Ones reached the screen, while Alexei Sayle was still doing
''Allo John Got A New Motor?' with hysterical energy (last week on BBC2's
All New Alexei Sayle Show he was sending up his own youthful performance of
that rap satire as though it had been some sort of Vera Lynn number; he is
becoming sadly mellow) when only a small band of cognoscenti realised what
was happening.
For a few months, while the spore remained underground, perhaps there was
some strength in the Rolling Stones analogy; had she known about it, your
mother wouldn't have liked it.
But today? The comedy rebels of the underground burst through the surface
long ago to be assiduously cultivated by television's head gardeners. Some
of them are proving perfectly acceptable successors to the older generation
of comedians. Harry Enfield is more than a match for Dick Emery, though not
notably more revolutionary. Newman and Baddiel operate at much the same
intellectual level as Cannon and Ball. Trying to decide whether Reeves and
Mortimer are funnier than Little and Large is like trying to decide which is
more sophisticated, steamed cabbage or boiled sprouts.
In The Man From Auntie on BBC1 on Thursday nights Ben Elton is showing that
he can easily abandon the tedious political correctness with which he used
to curry favour from crowds of lager swilling students, and deliver
sustained comedy monologues which are worthy of Dave Allen. True, Allen has
a tougher line on religious and what you might call philosophical subjects,
as you can currently see in his Monday night repeats on ITV. But Elton can
build a bigger head of laughter in those increasingly frenetic attacks that
he launches on - say - 'crap design'. Last week's onslaught, beginning with
the all-metal teapots in motorway service stations, which can only be picked
up after the tea has gone cold, was a highly professional and very funny
piece of work.
However, the idea that Elton represents for the 1994 teenager what Brian
Jones represented for us in 1964 is laughable. Or it would be were it not so
sad. What it indicates is not the strength of television comedy but the
weakness of rock music: after the rebel years of the Stones, then androgyny,
punk and grunge, where was there to go? The supposed wickedness of today's
youth programmes such as The Word on C4 on Friday and Saturday nights is so
pathetic that it is easy to see why young people would be keen to find
something else with which to identify. Comedy might serve if there really
was something stirring going on, but the enthusiasm which Elton and some of
his contemporaries bring to talk of 'poos' and condoms just does not seem
very outrageous these days.
The chief characteristic of much of the new generation of comedians is not
any sort of rebelliousness, let alone dangerous anarchy, but an
inward-facing fascination with the mass media. The main strength of
Absolutely Fabulous is the accuracy with which Jennifer Saunders' scripts
have satirised the world of glossy women's magazines and PR parties, and the
eclecticism of excess - booze, drugs, food, sex, new age crazes, clothes -
among those who throng the fringes of this little universe. The mistake of
the second series has been to enlarge the role of the boringly square
daughter, Saffron, who was originally just a foil to her mother and Patsy;
and to step more and more often outside that claustrophobic little world of
Bollinger, poser phones, and bikini-line waxing.
Tomorrow, we are told, Edi and Patsy are off to Morocco. Better, surely, to
have mounted an expedition to Harvey Nicks.
Even Sayle, who has tried to distance himself from the 'alternative' comedy
brigade, though working with virtually all of them, frequently looks inwards
to the mass media for laughs. Last week he told us that Sarah Dunant of The
Late Show had been taken down the nick for a good kicking because the police
profoundly disagreed with something she said about the poetry concrete of
John Cage. He ended the programme with a sight gag, appearing in consecutive
shots wearing ludicrously different outfits, flowery trousers and so on, and
complaining 'I'm sure I didn't have these on in the last shot', a joke
concerned entirely with the concept of continuity.
As for The Day Today, they not only limit themselves to jokes about the mass
media, but specifically to jokes about news and current affairs programmes.
Since its strength comes from the precision with which they parody the
manners and mannerisms of foreign affairs reporters, news anchormen and so
on it is difficult to convey the feel of the programme.
Though standards vary from series to series (Abfab 2 may improve but so far
it is sadly inferior to Abfab 1) and even from week to week, there is surely
little doubt that many of the programmes coming from this new generation of
comedians are an improvement on much of the old stuff. Channel 4's new
American series Home Improvement, and ITV's new vehicle for Penelope Keith,
Law And Disorder, remind us how lazy, repetitive and predictable the
conventional sitcom has become. There is just the one gag in Home
Improvement: dad, who presents a DIY television series, is a complete
disaster when it comes to doing anything around his own home. And the series
trundled out for Penelope Keith these days remind you of those boards at
fairgrounds with holes to stick your head through: you just provide the
face.
So the younger comedians are wafting a bit of fresh air into the system,
which is surely no more than they should be doing. It would be exciting if
they were leading a revolutionary movement, intent upon some radical form of
cultural subversion, infiltrating the dusty corridors of television comedy,
taking with them an army of young viewers ready to turn things upside down.
However, the evidence on screen suggests that most of them are about as
rebellious as Harry Worth or Benny Hill, and most of the programmes coming
our way are approximately as unsettling as a Bing Crosby musical. Even today
Lenny Bruce really would look revolutionary on television - and he has been
dead for 28 years.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: A very British 'Pinafore' - Operetta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one puzzling thing about Sunday's concert performance of this 'Entirely
Original Nautical Comic Opera' was why it should be in the London
Philharmonic's 'International Series'. The cast was British as could be, and
the conductor too, and most of the (sensibly reduced) orchestra.
To other questions there were obvious answers. Why do a concert Pinafore at
all? Because it will fill the Royal Festival Hall, if it has enough singers
with Names. Why should singers who have earned their Names in grander music
bother with G&amp;S? Because they think it will be fun, and it is nice to sing
to a happy audience. How can they be so sure that the audience will be
happy? Because nearly all the latter have it heard it many times before -
they have probably sung in it; and if few modern singers with Names can
mimic the vintage D'Oyly Carte style, their modern Personalities should make
piquant compensation for any falling-away from orthodoxy.
And so they did, and it was fun. Roger Norrington conducted the piece at a
brisk clip. Though three of the announced soloists had dropped out of play,
their replacements - just slightly lesser Names - gave full measure: Neil
Jenkins as a fervent, upstanding Ralph, David Thomas adapting his Handelian
bass manners to ripe Edwardian melodrama for Dick Deadeye, Marilyn Hill
Smith a model of D'OC diction and innocence as sweet Josephine.
Her sire Captain Corcoran was David Wilson-Johnson, her nearest competitor
in the diction-stakes, artful about underlining any political innuendo with
a newly up-to-date echo (as Gilbert's lines seem regularly to have). The
Butterfly and the First Lord of the Admiralty were Sarah Walker and Benjamin
Luxon, both of them emitting Personality on an expansive, shamelessly
appealing scale. The London Philharmonic Choir, reduced but energetic, sang
the crew of the Pinafore and the sisters, cousins and aunts with a will.
By sheer talent and cunning, Gwion Thomas almost turned the Boatswain into a
major character; and in the still smaller roles of Hebe and the Carpenter,
the young mezzo Ruby Philogene and bass Jonathan Best were
disproportionately good. All in all, the performance was engaging enough to
silence quibbles. I append one plea nevertheless, about diction.
Not unlike Walton's Facade, the G&amp;S operettas make great play with setting
Gilbert's consciously clever, scansion-heavy texts to deceptively simple
music with an easy flow. The apparent clash between those things, and the
witty accommodation that Sullivan engineered between them, is the heart of
the matter. No doubt the old D'OC company preserved its authentic' stagings
too long - but its practised, ultra-lucid, front-of-the-mouth delivery still
seems the best way of bringing G&amp;S to full comic life. That is vanishing
now. We shall come to miss it.

Did you know that the RAF made regular spy flights over the Soviet Union
long before America's U2 spy plane was shot down in 1960? That more than 40
'allied' aircraft were shot down and 250 aircrew lost? That 138 are still
unaccounted for, and that relatives are still trying to find out today what
happened to them? Timewatch tells the story (8.00 BBC2).
In Middlemarch the Lydgates' money worries worsen and when Tertius tries to
advertise their house for letting, Rosamond countermands his orders and
demands that they move to Bath or London. Flighty hussy. Raffles returns to
squeeze more money out of Bulstrode (you knew he would) and Ladislaw
discovers the spiteful terms of Casaubon's will (9.30 BBC2).
Walk On The Wild Side promises to report on those aspects of youth culture
that 'youth programming' tends to ignore. So instead of drink, violence and
crime on some Scottish housing estate, this will be about pony clubs and
queueing for the Proms? Er, no. This is about drink, violence and crime
among teenagers on a Glasgow housing estate (11.05 C4).

'From baked beans to counting beans,' is how Philip Powell describes his
latest career move.
Powell, 41, starts on Friday as the Central Statistical Office's first
director of marketing in a move that underlines the CSO's determination to
make its numbers pay under the Australian Bill McLennan.
A marketing professional since he left the University of East Anglia with an
economics degree, Powell's most recent job was with the Cow and Gate baby
food group. Before that he was in New Zealand where he did some work for
Heinz.
But Powell maintains that 'maximising the value of the CSO's statistics as a
product' will not be such a departure from the past. Statistics have become
increasingly important as a tool of marketing in recent years. His goal now
is to see how they can be packaged and made more user-friendly - at a price,
of course - although those numbers regarded as a public good will still be
available to the press.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lyndon Bolton, 57, managing director of the Dundee-based Alliance and Second
Alliance investment trusts, has signalled his retirement after 31 years with
one of Britain's biggest self-managed investment trust groups.
The Alliance trusts, which are over 100 years old, have always kept a low
profile. Management expenses are the lowest in the industry and a
single-minded concentration on investment performance resulted in the
winning of The Sunday Telegraph investment trust group of the year award for
three years in a row.
The change-over is not being hurried. Gavin Suggett, 49, who joined in 1973
and is Bolton's deputy, has been appointed joint managing director and will
take over sole responsibility in April 1995. Bolton, a non-executive
director of TSB and General Accident, will not remain on the board when he
retires. William Berry, senior partner of Edinburgh solicitors Murray Beith
&amp; Murray WS, has been appointed a non-executive director of the two trusts,
replacing Sir Douglas Hardie.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: The cleaner choice - Should
the green motorist choose a diesel or petrol car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many motorists seeking a car that is both economical and relatively
inoffensive environmentally must have reached the end of last week in
confusion over whether to choose a diesel or petrol vehicle.
On Thursday, a UK government panel of scientists warned that increasing
traffic density threatens to create harmful airborne levels of benzene,
linked with a form of leukaemia. Nearly 80 per cent of airborne benzene
comes from petrol cars. Only 9 per cent comes from diesels.
The level of benzene would be much lower if most cars continued to use
leaded petrol (benzene partly compensates for lead's absence). Yet for a
long time motorists have been encouraged to switch to unleaded fuel to help
to keep organ-damaging lead out of the atmosphere.
Some motorists might have been tempted to explore the merits of diesel cars,
heavily promoted by the motor industry recently as more
environmentally-friendly and economical than petrol cars.
Yet little over a week ago the Quality of Urban Air Review Group (Quarg), a
panel of experts appointed by the UK's department of the environment,
criticised diesel cars for their emissions of nitrogen oxides - a factor in
smog formation and 'acid rain' - and tiny particulates strongly suspected of
causing cancer.
The panel warned in a report that by early next century there could be cause
for 'considerable concern' about the deterioration of air quality in urban
streets if diesel cars continue their current strong sales acceleration -
they already account for about one in five new cars sold in the UK.
Not surprisingly, the report prompted an instant, hostile response from the
motor industry, which had been given no prior warning of it. Car makers said
it was 'misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound'.
The industry's concern is understandable to some extent. The UK car market
is still at a fairly early stage of recovery from one of its steepest
recessions on record, and is worried that confused motorists might now, if
only temporarily, opt to stay out of the showrooms. An adverse report on
diesels' possible carcinogenic hazards in the 1980s helped to reverse
Germany's diesel boom and hit car sales overall.
And while the German market has begun to climb again, some in the diesel car
industry such as John Maddell, a senior executive of Lucas Industries, say
it led to Germany's motor industry losing its technological lead to the
French.
Now that the furore over the Quarg report has faded, it is becoming apparent
that the differences between the motor industry and the panel are more in
degree than fundamentals. The industry retains its belief that the panel, in
arriving at its 'considerable concern' warning, is not taking enough account
of technological progress being made to further reduce the two pollutants -
nitrogen oxides and particulates - for which diesel has been most
criticised.
The report pays due tribute to the advantages of diesel over petrol. These
include much reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, the inescapable by-product
of combustion linked with global warming, and of two other pollutants,
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.
It acknowledges that, currently at least, commercial vehicles - mainly
trucks and buses - are much bigger culprits than diesel cars in terms of
poor urban air quality.
At the heart of the Quarg report lie its projections about the share of the
total car market likely to be taken by diesel cars and the effect that this
will have in terms of all the pollutants they emit but mainly particulates -
of which the notorious black diesel smoke forms only a part (see above
chart).
What the panel views as the potential reduction of particulate emissions
through technological progress - and tighter EC emissions standards for all
cars from 1996 - is apparent in the chart. At a constant 16 per cent share
of the market, the amount of particulates emitted by diesel cars would be
halved from around 65 kilotonnes to 30 kilotonnes by the year 2005.
However, in the steepest growth scenario, with the diesel share of new car
sales rising to 49 per cent, the volume of particulates emitted would be
little changed from 1991 levels and government goals of improved urban air
quality would be unfulfilled.
The industry's complaint is that this scenario does not take adequate
account of current and future developments in diesel technology; that
diesels tend to maintain a consistent emissions performance whereas petrol
engines and their catalysts degrade and become much 'dirtier' after 50,000
miles; and that the relative lack of large-scale testing of vehicles in use
in city centres downplays the heavy emission of pollutants by
catalyst-equipped petrol cars on short journeys because their 'cats' do not
reach full operating temperature.
In reality, the jury will be out for some time before either side can be
proved right.
Industry technologists maintain that substantial improvements are still to
come from refining technologies already in use, such as exhaust gas
recirculation and electronic management of fuel systems.
Still several years away, however, are possible leaps in anti-pollution
technology for diesel vehicles.
Most promising among them is an oxidation catalyst for diesels, mainly to
cut nitrogen oxide but also capable of reducing particulate emissions. This
research is being led by Japan, and the Mazda car company is believed to be
near to making them commercially available. Research is also continuing on
particulate 'traps', which would capture the particles and then burn them
off at intervals.
When these are coupled with the introduction of low-sulphur diesel fuels,
the volume of both particulates and nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel cars
should fall substantially. Under a recent EC directive, the permitted level
of sulphur in diesel fuel will fall from around 0.5 per cent by weight now
to 0.2 per cent by weight on October 1 this year and to 0.05 per cent in
October 1996. 'The problem could easily disappear,' says Roger King,
spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Whether it does or not, the industry's fears that the public will shun
diesel cars on environmental grounds may be exaggerated. Car makers last
week were reporting few signs of customer concern.

FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Melbourn promoted at NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A chain of moves in the top management of National Westminster Bank was
disclosed yesterday, led by the appointment of John Melbourn, the bank's
head of group risk, to succeed Bert Morris as the bank's deputy chief
executive.
The reshuffle is one of the most significant changes to the bank's senior
roster since Derek Wanless was appointed chief executive in 1992. The
changes, which all involve bank insiders, will take place from March 1.
Melbourn, a 56-year-old who was thought to be a contender for the chief
executive's job when Derek Wanless was appointed, is one of the bank's most
experienced hands, having headed international operations and its
relationships with large companies.
Wanless says that Melbourn is 'a tremendous banker' who would bring a wide
range of experience to the post. Melbourn will work alongside Morris until
September, when the latter is due to retire.
Melbourn will retain board responsibility for credit risk, and the handling
of large corporate restructurings. But his current deputy, Fred Pointon, has
been appointed to the post of general manager of group risk in his place.
A second significant change announced yesterday is the appointment of Phil
Wise, the current chief executive of group services, as chief operating
officer at NatWest Markets, the bank's corporate and investment banking arm.
Wise, 45, has worked with Martin Owen, the chief executive of NatWest
Markets, before when the men brought together the bank's treasury
operations.
Like other securities houses, NatWest Markets had a good year amid buoyant
bond and equity markets. Wanless has signalled that the bank is considering
ways of building on its investment banking business to help raise revenues.
NatWest Markets' two senior managing directors, Roger Byatt and John
Howland-Jackson, have been appointed deputy chief executives. Wise will be
succeeded at group services by Trevor Blackler, general manager of UK branch
business. Stuart Chandler, general manager for human resources and strategic
development, has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive
for UK branch business with responsibility for technology and human
resources.

FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Price Waterhouse partner appointed finance director
at Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Evans, a partner at accountants Price Waterhouse, has been appointed
finance director of chemicals company Courtaulds. He has had 10 years'
involvement with Courtaulds at PW and has been in charge of the group's
audit for the past year.
Evans replaces Michael Pragnell, who becomes director responsible for
Courtaulds' new polymer products division. He spent less than two years in
the job, taking over in July 1992 from Richard Lapthorne who went to British
Aerospace; previously he was responsible for Courtaulds' coatings
activities.
The reshuffle is the result of the regrouping of the company's activities
into three business areas from April 1. As part of the reshuffle, current
coatings and Far East director Eryl Morris becomes development director,
responsible for planning, development, research and technology, and Neville
Petersen, currently chief executive of European coatings activities, joins
the board in charge of coatings activities worldwide, except the Far East.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Trees branch out - Willow and
poplar are being grown for fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Goodwin is at the cutting edge of farming technology. He is one of
five British farmers involved in a pioneering project to grow willow and
poplar as a fuel crop that is commercially viable and kind to the
environment.
Winter is a busy time on Goodwin's 75-hectare cereal farm in Essex, 50 miles
north-east of London. This is when the one-year-old trees have to be cut
back, or coppiced, so the stumps sprout. The new shoots, which can grow up
to four metres in the first year, will be harvested after two to five years
and turned into woodchips to be burned for electricity.
Coppicing of woodland goes back to the middle ages. But growing tree crops
for fuel on arable land has only taken root in Europe in the past few years.
Sweden, with vast forests and a strong commitment to renewable energy,
already has about 9,000 hectares under commercial production.
Now farmers in the European Union are becoming interested because of the
introduction of compulsory set-aside, under which they can grow non-food
crops without forfeiting subsidies. The National Farmers' Union will debate
the issue at its annual meeting in London today.
Cereals and oilseeds, straw and farm waste are all being tried for fuel. But
arable coppice is seen in Britain as having the greatest potential, in terms
of cost and impact on the environment. The government is funding the Pounds
1.1m five-farm project and last year included coppice in the list of
non-fossil fuels from which electricity companies are obliged to obtain some
of their power.
Goodwin, whose family has grown willow for cricket bats for a century, is
enthusiastic about the new use of the tree. 'As far as its environmental
attractiveness is concerned, I don't see anything coming close to it,' he
says.
Although weed-killer is used to protect the young trees in their first year,
coppice does not need constant applications of agrochemicals during its
30-year lifespan. The nutrients in soil previously used to grow cereals,
coupled with annual leaf fall, can replace fertiliser. Sewage sludge can
also be used, offering one solution to the problem of disposal that will
arise when dumping sludge at sea is banned in 1998.
The trees attract wildlife. 'We have found more than 40 species of bird
within our plantations,' saysGoodwin. 'We wouldn't have seen a fraction of
those under cereal production.' Access is provided for walkers and riders to
open space around the trees, and there should be none of the visual
objections associated with wind turbines.
The burning process is surprisingly clean, too. Coppice releases no more
carbon dioxide when burned than it absorbs during growth, emissions of
nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are low and the ash can be recycled as
fertiliser. The wood crop produces about 30 times the energy used to grow
and harvest it, compared with an energy ratio of less than two-to-one for
the diesel substitute made from oilseed rape.
Establishing a plantation is currently expensive at Pounds 1,300 or more a
hectare. But grants are available from the Forestry Authority. The
government is also considering encouraging coppice production on fixed
set-aside land by 'rolling up' five years' worth of subsidies into a lump
sum of about Pounds 1,550 a hectare in the first year. The expectation is
that coppice will require little or no financial support once established as
a commercial crop.
With such attractions, many farmers are contemplating coppice as a way of
sustaining rural employment. But most are hesitant until there is a proven
market. That is why a group of farmers and businessmen set up Border
Biofuels in 1992 to build power plants fuelled by woodchips.
The company is applying for a licence for a 5MW plant - enough to supply
electricity to a small town - near St Boswells in the Scottish Borders.
Initially the Pounds 6m plant would burn forestry residue but this would
gradually be replaced by coppice. The company hopes to assemble 30 or more
farmers growing up to 2,000 hectares to supply the plant.
'It's a commercial crop with a margin comparable to cereals, subject to the
market being established,' says Harry Frew, a director. Once coppice took
off, cuttings would become widely available and the high cost to new
entrants of about 10p a cutting could be slashed to 1p or 2p.
Several regional electricity companies are interested as well. South Western
Electricity (Sweb) is applying to build a 2.5MW power plant in Cornwall,
using 18,000 tonnes of dry coppice a year from local growers. It has plans
for three other wood-fuelled plants of 5MW to 10MW in Hampshire, Suffolk and
Northamptonshire.
'We're keen to break this chicken-and-egg situation of no-crop-no-market and
no-market-no-crop,' says Gerry Swarbrick, power resources manager. 'We
believe renewables deserve a chance to demonstrate themselves on a
commercial basis. We expect these technologies will one day stand on their
own two feet.'
There is a long way to go. The UK government aims to stimulate a modest
1,500MW of new electricity-generating capacity from renewable sources by the
end of the decade - about 3 per cent of the country's electricity needs.
Coppice would initially be a tiny part of that, with only about 100 hectares
so far being grown.
But the government-sponsored Renewable Energy Advisory Group presented a
striking vision of its potential as the technology improves. It forecast
that if 2.8m hectares - 16 per cent of agricultural land - were turned over
to coppice by 2010, the energy created could amount to 22 per cent of
electricity consumption.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Opening up with an eye on confidentiality: The Treasury's
efforts to collaborate more with the world beyond Whitehall are assessed by
Peter Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Alan Budd, now chief economic adviser at the UK Treasury, attacked the
department 15 years ago for ignoring advice from outside, he was a London
Business School economist. Now that he is on the inside he may recall his
criticisms as he answers charges today from industrialists that the
department is divorced from reality and too secretive.
Budd, who has been at the Treasury since 1991, will be one of four senior
Treasury officials addressing a private meeting in London with 70 business
executives. The meeting, 'Treasury: Villain or Victim?', has been organised
by the Whitehall and Industry Group, a charity trying to dismantle barriers
between the private and public sectors.
The Treasury, Britain's most important government department, which controls
public spending, taxation and interest rates, has for years been criticised
for paying too little attention to the world outside Whitehall.
Critics reckon its introverted style has contributed to policy mistakes, in
particular the lack of preparedness for the inflationary boom of the late
1980s, the recession which followed and the currency crisis which forced
Britain out of the exchange rate mechanism.
That attacks on the Treasury are nothing new is clear from Budd's 1979
comments, made in a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs. But as the
criticism grew during the 1990s, the department tried to recognise its
failings, grappling with issues similar to those faced by many
private-sector organisations. A leading part has been played by Sir Terry
Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, who engaged as a part-time adviser
Wendy Pritchard, a consultant specialising in helping organisations to make
cultural shifts.
Pritchard was behind recent moves by the Treasury to reduce the number of
top posts and improve the effectiveness of decision-making, while Budd - who
came to the Treasury from Barclays Bank, where he was economic adviser - has
put into practice some of the prescriptions in his 1979 address.
He has set up a committee of business people who meet three times a year to
relay views from industry to the department's economic forecasters. He also
oversees the work of the Treasury's panel of seven (now six) 'wise men' -
outside economists who supply policy advice and forecasts to the Treasury.
Budd has also encouraged Treasury officials to be more receptive to thinking
from outside Whitehall. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of
Economics who works part-time at the Treasury, says Budd has been 'an
outstanding success' in 'encouraging the flow of ideas into the Treasury'.
Roger Humber, director of the Housebuilders Federation, a trade body for
construction companies, has noticed a difference, too. In the late 1980s, he
says, the Treasury spurned the federation's efforts to promote a dialogue
about economic trends. 'The Treasury view was that we (housebuilders) were
responsible for inflation - they wanted nothing to do with us.' But around
1992, says Humber, 'the Treasury became more interested in hearing our
views'.
Talking to outsiders does not always go smoothly. Treasury officials fear
that they may let slip some piece of policy advice which government
ministers would rather keep to themselves.
Greg Parston, director of the Office of Public Management, a consultancy
specialising in public-sector organisation, recognises that because of
confidential policy discussion, there are limits to how much officials can
open up. 'But because the Treasury is spending our (taxpayers') money they
should recognise the public has a right to inquire how it manages itself.'
Budd says the principle that officials advise ministers in confidence must
be safeguarded. 'The challenge is to ensure that the analysis on which such
advice is based reflects the best possible sources of knowledge . . . I
think the Treasury is more exposed to independent advice than ever before.'
The changes have not satisfied everyone. Bill Martin, UK economist at Swiss
bank UBS and among the Treasury's fiercest critics, thinks it 'is still too
secretive'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Management: Unhappy returns - Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh
warn that many companies are in danger of underinvesting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELROY DIMSON and PAUL MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the last few years, real interest rates and inflation have fallen in
most leading industrialised countries, while stock markets have climbed to
new peaks.
How have these changes in capital market conditions affected the cost of
capital? More important, have companies fully adjusted to this brave new
world?
For most companies in most countries, the cost of capital has fallen. Yet
when considering new investment projects, many are still living in the past,
and seeking a required rate of return (RRR) which is simply too high.
By ignoring the worldwide fall in the cost of both debt and equity capital,
there is a real danger that these companies will underinvest, or wait too
long before embarking on important projects.
This could seriously affect their competitive position. The biggest losers
will be companies whose capital budgeting systems are the least responsive
to changes in market conditions.
Underinvestment would be particularly ironic in today's market conditions.
Stock markets have risen partly because of the lower RRR which investors are
now demanding. If companies ignore this when appraising their own
investments, this would not only be inconsistent, but would reflect a lack
of shareholder orientation.
Markets have also risen because of the better profits outlook and the
increase in profitable investment opportunities. Companies which underinvest
and fail to exploit these will find their share prices prove unsustainable.
Part of the problem is that managers are often unclear about the effect
capital markets should have on their investment decisions. There is too much
focus on accounting systems, and too great a rigidity in project appraisal
criteria. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that an organisation is
using the right cost of capital in the right way.
This problem is not new. Some years ago, an organisation which was
investigating underinvestment in the UK initiated an informal survey of
capital budgeting procedures used in large British companies. An important
question was, what level of return on capital was required for a project to
be regarded as acceptable.
Based on the first batch of responses, it became clear that the 'hurdle'
rate of return ranged from less than 10 per cent to 40 per cent or more.
A partial explanation for this puzzlingly wide spread was provided by the
next company approached. Here, the finance director asked for clarification.
What, precisely, was meant by required return? Was it the accounting rate of
return, or the discounted cash flow rate? Was it the return on capital or on
equity? Was it the real or the nominal return? The pre- or post-tax return?
And for what time period and level of risk?
At this point, the researcher realised that he would need to re-interview
all his previous respondents to ask them what they had meant.
Clearly, asking 'What is your required rate of return?' can produce varied
responses. In the debate on whether companies are demanding too high a
return on capital, it is crucial to define what we mean by the RRR.
Investment projects, by definition, involve spending money 'up front' in the
hope of a financial return later. Best practice in terms of project
appraisal involves estimating both the initial costs and expected future
cash flows, and then discounting these at the appropriate RRR to determine
whether the investment adds value for shareholders.
The initial investment in any project clearly has a cost, namely the
expected return which would otherwise have been available from investing the
money in the capital markets over the same period and at similar risk. The
RRR is the opportunity cost of capital for a stock market investment that is
comparable to the proposed project in terms of maturity, risk exposure and
tax treatment.
Taking each of these factors in turn, a project's maturity might broadly be
thought of in terms of the classifications used by the Financial Times for
fixed interest securities, namely up to five years, five-15 years, or more
than 15 years.
Second, the project's risk exposure may be visualised on a continuum from
riskless government bonds to equities (or even a leveraged position in
equities).
And third, the project's cash flows should be estimated after deduction of
corporate tax, which in many European countries, including the UK,
incorporates prepayment of personal tax on dividends.
For a risk-free investment, a rough guide to the required return on a
five-15 year investment is the yield to redemption on index-linked or
conventional government bonds of appropriate maturity. In the UK, after
deducting personal tax and rounding to the nearest whole number, this is
currently some 2 per cent in real terms or 5 per cent in money terms. This
implies an inflation rate of around 3 per cent per annum.
Risky investment can only be justified if it commands a risk premium.
Historically, equities have generated an average annual real risk premium of
approximately 8 per cent compared with government bonds. The typical company
uses debt as well as equity in its capital structure, however, which makes
its shares more risky than its underlying assets.
A typical risk premium for a company's underlying investments would
therefore be lower, say 6-7 per cent after tax.
For an investment project of typical risk, we must add a premium of 6-7 per
cent to the real risk-free interest rate of 2 per cent. The required rate of
return is around 8-9 per cent in real terms, or 11-12 per cent in money
terms. The days of looking for 20 per cent or more are behind us - at least
for the moment.
There are naturally differences between the required returns that are
appropriate for low risk projects, and those that should be demanded of
higher risk proposals. Companies may classify investments according to their
risk, and then adjust the cost of capital according to each project's risk
attributes. But the starting point for these adjustments should typically be
the company's overall cost of capital.
Our contacts with companies suggest that many have not responded
sufficiently to falling inflation and lower real interest rates. As a result
their managements are demanding an excessive return from new investment
projects.
They run the risk of investing too little and too late, and of failing to
share fully in the economic recovery.

Business School's Risk Measurement Service.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Jobs: Warning - this weapon can backfire / Time management
has its uses but is unlikely to make you super-efficient in five easy steps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time management books are like diet books. Both hold out the hope of
changing your life forever: one by making you thin and beautiful, the other
by making you efficient and successful.
Both are surefire publishing successes. Thin-Think, Slim for Life, You Don't
Have to DIET] and Lean Revolution are recent big sellers on the health
shelves, while in the management section are titles such as Better Time
Management, Perfect Time Management, The Complete Time Manager and Manage
Your Time.
Yet there is no proof that people have either lost weight or become more
productive as a result of their improving reading. Indeed, there is some
evidence to suggest the reverse. People who constantly go on diets are
likely to be fat. Similarly those who get fixated on getting the right
events into their Filofaxes or electronic organisers may be letting the
management of time get the better of them.
'You get to the point where too much time management can be a stress in
itself,' says Marge Malcolm, an ex-comprehensive school teacher and founder
of LPC Consultancy. 'People start living by the clock. And if someone jumps
in front of their train in the morning they think, 'What a bloody nuisance,
I'm going to be late.''
Managers who charge round with their personal organisers all day, getting
home shattered at 8pm for specially allocated 'quality' time with their
families are deluding themselves. 'Talk of quality time is escapism', says
Malcolm. 'Its not quality time. It's just time.'
The books are only the tip of the time management iceberg. Time management
courses have become a staple of executive training, and in the last decade
have proved a great money spinner for their providers. So much so that it is
hard to find many managers who have never been sent one.
It is not difficult to understand why both the books and the courses are so
popular. They play on your worst nightmares of being out of control, and
then offer a simple formula that promises to make you master of your time.
The slim volume, Perfect Time Management, begins with the warning that if
you don't manage your time, you will be inefficient, ineffective, won't get
promoted, will be despised by both subordinates and your boss, and will be
first in line to be made redundant.
The answer, according an 'energising one day seminar' entitled How to Manage
Priorities and Meet Deadlines, lies in 24 'power pointers'. These, it
promises, will 'boost your productivity Now]'
The power points consist of tools to combat procrastination, personalised
action plans that take into account your 'natural energy cycle', three easy
steps to spot unrealistic goals, and four easy steps to stop other people
from wasting your time.
If only it were that simple. The techniques of time management are all
sensible enough. Keeping a clear desk, writing lists of priorities, never
handling a piece of paper more than once, reducing the amount of time spent
in meetings, discouraging people from disturbing you, doing telephoning and
memo writing in batches - all these tips make sense. But not everyone can
live like that.
My own experience of time management courses has been a sobering one. I have
been taught how to keep my desk tidy, and how to organise myself. I know all
about colour coding of files and priority setting. I know how to classify
work as important, unimportant, urgent and non-urgent.
Yet my desk is deep with old newspapers and press releases. I have no
consciousness of my priorities: I do whatever seems most pressing at the
time, accepting that I will be interrupted throughout.
Apparently, I am not unusual. Malcolm has consulted 300 managers in the
insurance industry who have attended courses and found that only 10 per cent
have taken the lessons to heart. She argues that such tricks only help
people who are that way inclined anyway. Managers who love making lists may
pick up some further tips on how to make even better ones. But those who are
by nature badly organised may attend the courses and buy the books but will
only add to the piles of paper that already litter their desks.
Malcolm's own approach to time management is more flexible. Despite her
dismissal of more formal techniques, she does believe that even the most
shambolic persons can change their ways. She claims to have helped managers
ranging from undisciplined underwriters to chaotic Oxford dons. She belives
that the answer is to look at each person individually, and to start small.
The first step, she says, is to get each person to draw up two lists and
compare them. One is of what they want to achieve, the other of what they
actually do achieve. Getting people even this far is a challenge - many
managers cannot account for how they spend their time, and need constant
nannying to keep a log for even one day.
Most, she says, are horrified at how much time they waste, particularly in
meetings and interruptions, and are horrified at how far their actual day
departs from the desired one. They are then asked which bits they are
willing to change, and what price they are willing to pay.
'The aim is to try to stop them feeling guilty about what they are not
doing, and to make a few small decisions', she says. The idea is to start by
changing something manageable, like leaving work on time. She advises
managers to make appointments to meet people after work, to ensure they get
out of the door at the appointed hour. She also tells them to give
themselves a reward for compliance.
In many cases changing one small thing works wonders, making people feel in
control, less guilty and less stressed. Once that is accomplished they may
be ready to tackle another task.
Time Manager International, a Danish owned consultancy which since 1975 has
trained over 2m managers worldwide to be more efficient, argues that the
results from time management courses can be more dramatic than Malcolm's
individual drip-drip approach to efficiency.
Chris Lane, chairman of TMI UK, argues that virtually everyone can benefit
so long as the courses are handled right. He says there are two sorts of
people: 'people' people and 'task' people, and what works for one type will
not work for the other.
'Time Management should not be about desks and diaries, but about putting
your head above the morass and saying what is this all about?', he argues.
Lane has a large white board in front of his desk, just in case he should
forget what he himself is trying to do. On it his mission is written in
large letters: he must do good consulting work, he must signal a clear
vision to others in the company, and so on. 'I look up and think: what have
I done today to do those?', he says. Lane reckons this sort of technique
works with everyone: only people who are in deep depressions or who are
going through severe psychological crisis are beyond help.
I imagine a large notice above my desk saying 'My mission is to write more
articles of a consistently higher standard' and wonder what effect it would
have. It would certainly keep my colleagues amused.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Building societies unmoved by 'tiny change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies were unmoved by yesterday's  1/4 -point cut in the base
rate, although Citibank, the specialist mortgage provider, reduced its
standard mortgage rate.
The large societies took the view that the base rate cut was too small to be
worth translating into a change to mortgage or savings rates.
But they welcomed the reduction as a signal of the government's commitment
to a low interest rate era and as encouragement to the recovery in the
property market.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
described the base rate cut as 'a very tiny change which is unlikely to have
any impact although it might reduce costs for centralised lenders'.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Halifax, the largest society, said:
'This looks like a technical adjustment and is not at present sufficient to
cause us to rethink our mortgage or savings rates.'
It is unlikely that other building societies would act very differently from
Halifax. The remaining nine of the largest 10 societies said they would not
change their rates for the time being.
Abbey National, the bank that is the UK's second-largest lender, said the
cut was too small to justify the cost of changing mortgage rates, although
the bank indicated that it would rethink if there was another 1/4 -point
drop in base rates soon.
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, said it would like to
encourage continued recovery in the housing market, but 'we are conscious of
the impact that a further mortgage rate cut would have on our savers'.
Alliance &amp; Leicester said there were no plans to make any changes but it
would be watching the money markets and its competitors.
Centralised lenders such as Citibank do not share the same mortgage-funding
constraints as building societies because, like the banks, they can obtain
funding from the money markets. Citibank said yesterday that it had reduced
its standard variable mortgage rate to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent with
immediate effect for new customers.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Police scrutinise futures markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Criminal Intelligence Service is investigating possible
activities including money-laundering by organised crime on London's futures
markets.
The investigation, which started four months ago, was undertaken with the
co-operation of London's five futures exchanges including the London
International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and the London
Metal Exchange (LME).
It was prompted by concern that futures markets in London could be
vulnerable to criminal activities such as money laundering, as they have
been in the US and other markets, rather than because of any individual
cases.
Det Insp Graham Saltmarsh, head of NCIS's organised crime unit, described
the undertaking as an overview, prompted by anecdotal information.
New money-laundering regulations form part of the criminal justice act which
comes into force on April 1. This will place much more onerous
responsibilities on parties that are unwittingly involved in money
laundering.
Mr Hamish Ramsay, legal counsel for the Futures and Options Association, the
futures industry trade body, said: 'The new regulations will assist in
tightening controls for second and third-tier institutions and this will
have a positive effect on the futures and options industry in the UK.' The
association is holding seminars on the issue of money-laundering.
On futures exchanges individual member firms, such as brokers and banks, buy
and sell futures contracts on behalf of clients. The exchanges do not,
however, know the identity of these clients. Consequently the paper trail
may be hard to follow.
If the examination shows that money-laundering is occurring, it might be
possible to change the structure of exchanges to block this route.
Det Insp Saltmarsh said: 'We are not just interested in feeling collars but
in disrupting organised crime.'
According to Mr Richard Parlour, a legal expert at Clifford Chance, a
minimum of Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) of dirty cash is believed to enter the
world's financial system every year.
The NCIS also said that at a later stage it might investigate whether
organised crime had penetrated the toxic waste industry. 'It has happened on
the Continent and in the US, although there is no evidence it has happened
here,' it said.
The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors said the NCIS's fears
seemed 'highly unlikely - there are too many checks on waste management
these days'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Tax changes 'hit middle incomes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour found new ammunition yesterday in its battle against the government's
taxation policy after an independent think-tank claimed that the tax rises
introduced in the last two Budgets would be mainly at the expense of people
on middle incomes.
In a report published yesterday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the
tax rises announced last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke and his predecessor as
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, would largely reverse the overall reduction of
taxation in the late 1980s.
Direct taxes on incomes were reduced in the 1980s while indirect taxes,
levied on consumption, will now account for much of the revenue rise. Those
who gained from the cuts in the 1980s will not be those who lose from the
increases.
The IFS said people on middling incomes would be particularly hit by the
last two Budgets because of changes to mortgage interest relief, married
couples' allowances and value added tax on fuel.
It claimed that the poorest 10 per cent of the population would have lost an
average of Pounds 3 per week from tax changes in the decade to 1995, while
the richest 10 per cent would have gained more than Pounds 30 a week.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, claimed the figures showed how the
Conservatives had turned the tax system into 'the most powerful weapon for
reinforcing inequality and creating record unfairness in British society'
and that the government had created 'the most unfair tax system since the
1930s'.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, countered that
Tory taxation policy had boosted wealth creation, improving living standards
and increasing the amount of tax paid by high earners.
'The figures show that a man on average earnings with two children has seen
his real take-home pay grow by over Pounds 80 a week since 1979,' Mr Dorrell
told BBC radio.
The report showed that households' disposable incomes will have risen by an
average of Pounds 4 per week since 1985, but that these gains are
distributed unevenly.

</HEADLINE>

Both loss-making Gooda Walker Names and the Lloyd's agents they are suing
took a positive view yesterday about the outcome of a High Court hearing on
an application to adjourn one of the biggest legal actions at the insurance
market.
No ruling was given after the hearing, held in chambers rather than in open
court. Mr Andrew Pincott, senior partner at Elborne Mitchell, solicitor for
the agents, said the 'application for an adjournment has itself been
adjourned until February 28. It is still very much a live application.'
The Gooda Walker Action Group, which is organising the Names' action due to
begin on April 26, said Names 'will not have their case adjourned to next
year. (Defending members' agents) did not obtain a change in the date of the
trial.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / Oil yard problems forecast to persist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish oil platform fabrication industry faces difficulties until at
least 1996, according to Mackay Consultants, the Inverness consultancy
specialising in North Sea affairs, David Lascelles writes. One of its four
large yards - possibly two - may have to close down.
The firm estimates that capacity use was less than 20 per cent last year and
notes that employment has fallen by 5,500 in the past 18 months.
The report attributes the decline primarily to the overall decline in UK
North Sea work. Other factors include a move away from conventional steel
platforms, a lack of competitiveness and increased competition from other
fabricators.
Mackay notes that only one leading yard, UIE at Clydebank, near Glasgow, did
well in 1992-93 though its work will currently run out in May.
Of the others, Highland Fabricators at Nigg on the Cromarty Firth and
Trafalgar House at Methil, Fife, performed disappointingly, and McDermott at
Arderseir, near Inverness, disastrously.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Bank accepts inflation risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury and Bank of England have accepted, when deciding yesterday's
1/4 -point cut in interest rates, that there is a risk that inflation could
start to gather pace again, the Bank's latest inflation report makes clear.
The report forecasts a slight rise in underlying inflation - as measured by
the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments - throughout this
year from 2.7 per cent in December. But the Bank's 'central projection' is
that RPIX, as the underlying rate is known, will be just more than 3 per
cent by the end of next year, and so within the government's 1 per cent to 4
per cent target range.
Both RPIX and the 'headline' retail prices index are set to rise in the
coming months as the indirect taxes announced in last year's two Budgets
come into effect and earlier mortgage interest rate cuts drop out of the
12-month comparison.
In the next two months the gap between RPIX and headline RPI, which was 1.9
per cent in December, will largely disappear.
The report acknowledges that recent inflation figures have been better than
expected and this observation provides the intellectual underpinning for
yesterday's rate cut. It notes, however, that the projected path of RPIX to
the end of 1995 keeps inflation in the upper half of the government's target
range and that the risks to this projection are 'asymmetric' in the sense
that a rise in underlying inflation is more likely than a further fall.
It is no surprise that the Bank favours a refined version of the underlying
inflation measure, which excludes local authority and indirect taxes as well
as mortgage payments, which it calls RPIY. This has fallen sharply in recent
months, and at 2.3 per cent is in the lower part of the government's target
range.
Some of the recent decline in RPIY has reflected a one-off fall in
supermarket food prices. The Bank expects this measure to stabilise around
2.5 per cent from the first half of this year.
Its hope is that people will focus on RPIY. But it notes that inflationary
expections, particularly among wage bargainers, are above the rates of
inflation that have recently been achieved.
The Bank says: 'Keeping inflation low and getting it into the lower half of
its target range depends on an adjustment of expectations to a low-inflation
world.' Ultimately, progress to higher levels of output and employment
depends on how far 'everyone involved in decisions on saving and investment
and on wages and prices' is convinced that inflation will be kept down.
The Bank admits that it is difficult to gauge the strength of the present UK
recovery and that judgments on the state of the economy are unusually
uncertain.
In particular, the Bank is concerned that wages may yet rise in response to
the fall in take-home pay caused by planned tax increases and pose a risk to
the present combination of continuing output growth and low inflation.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Tories threaten de-regulation revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Conservative backbenchers is threatening to deny the government
greater powers to repeal legislation.
The threat emerged as the de-regulation bill last night gained its second
reading. The bill would allow the government to repeal primary legislation
by statutory order.
A Liberal Democrat amendment depriving ministers of the proposed new powers
was defeated by 320 votes to 287, a government majority of 37.
However, a number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the
government when the bill reached the committee stage. Mr Richard Shepherd,
MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, said he was concerned about the constitutional
implications: 'One day we may form the Opposition. I urge a very cautious
rethink of this measure.'
Mr Edward Garnier, Tory MP for Harborough, said he had 'constitutional
concerns' over the bill's provisions relating to ministers' powers. He said
such concerns 'are well meant and sincere'.
Government whips fear difficulty in overturning any Lords amendment aimed at
diluting the powers ministers seek.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry minister responsible for de-regulation, last
night said the powers were mainly designed to repeal uncontroversial
legislation. He made it clear that 'every regulation in place is under
review'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, played on Conservative
fears that the government was trying to weaken parliamentary procedure by
suspending acts of parliament using statutory instruments which only need a
90-minute debate. This was 'a Henry VIII clause', he said, because of 'that
monarch's tendency to absolutism'.
He went on to say that of 3,500 regulations being examined by the
government, 71 per cent had been introduced since the Tories came to office
in 1979. 'It is not our regulations they are complaining about, it is their
regulations,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said he
recognised the case for shedding regulations that were 'a genuine barrier to
efficiency and understanding'. He added: 'But there are clear concerns as to
how this can be done, what the mechanisms should be and how we can ensure
that this is properly addressed and properly debated.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / City baffled by timing and size of cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City economists and opposition politicians at Westminster were baffled both
by the timing of yesterday's interest rate cut and by its size.
They argued that the 0.25 percentage-point cut was unlikely to have any
impact on economic recovery - and one leading City economist was concerned
that the move had coincided with new political difficulties for the
government.
Treasury ministers stressed that the cut reflected a more optimistic
assessment of inflation prospects rather than concern about the pace of
economic recovery.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, said that officials at the
Treasury and Bank of England had scrutinised a range of indicators showing
that inflation was subdued - and that this was the principal factor behind
the policy easing.
He stressed that there was no reason to doubt that the recovery in the UK
could be sustained, and he dismissed suggestions that the decision was
designed to offset the unsettling effect on world equity markets of last
Friday's 0.25 percentage-point rise in US interest rates.
'This has nothing to do with elections and tax rises,' Mr Portillo said. 'It
has everything to do with wanting to have interest rates as low as they can
be, consistent with maintaining a downward pressure on inflation.'
Opposition MPs doubted that the easing of monetary policy would improve
economic prospects.
Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour Treasury spokesman, welcomed the cut but believed
it would do little to offset tax rises, which could check the economic
recovery. He said the cut was so small that home owners might perversely
regard it as the final easing in UK monetary policy.
The Institute of Directors also said it was difficult to understand the
logic behind the UK authorities' decision. 'A  1/4 per cent cut is unlikely
to have any major impact on the economy and may be seen more as a morale
booster,' said Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD institute's policy unit.
'We can only assume that the chancellor of the exchequer is now developing
his strategy to offset the impact of the tax increases, which will remove
large quantities of money from people's pockets and damage the recovery.'
Mr Gavyn Davies, managing director at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,
welcomed the easing in monetary policy. But he was disappointed that the
rate cut had occurred on the same day that the government was embarrassed by
the mysterious death of one of its backbenchers.
He said the UK authorities needed to quell the suspicion in financial
markets that the timing of recent rate cuts had been inspired by political
difficulty rather than economic reality.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, president of the Engineering Employers Federation,
said: 'We welcome the cut in rates, we would have liked more but every
little helps.'
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said: 'I don't think a cut of 0.25 per cent will make a huge
difference to business, but it is obviously a move in the right direction.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / Long-term outlook improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The longer leading index of UK economic activity has begun to rise once
more, pointing to a favourable long-term outlook for the economy, Graham
Bowley writes.
The rise was revealed in figures published yesterday by the Central
Statistical Office.
Increases in business optimism and the rise in house-building starts in the
final quarter of last year boosted the index, which is supposed to signal
turning points in economic activity about 13 months in advance.
The shorter leading index, which indicates turning points in activity five
months in advance, and the coincident index, which tracks the business
cycle, both continued to rise, providing further evidence of the favourable
short-term outlook.

FT  09 FEB 94 / BT and Mercury under attack: Competition will hot up with
the launch of another telecoms network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most significant telecommunications announcement yesterday was not BT's
price cuts, long trailed and necessitated by an agreement with the
regulator.
It was the launch of a telecoms network in the City of London by MFS, the
largest national provider of urban networks competing with the local Bell
telephone companies in the US.
The entry of MFS into the UK will greatly intensify competition in the
business telecommunications market, with ramifications far beyond.
MFS operates fibre networks in 14 US cities, including Chicago, New York,
Los Angeles and San Francisco. It provides 'last-mile' connections for large
urban users, allowing them to link up to long-distance networks without
going through the local Bell companies.
Nynex, the Bell company covering New York, estimates that it has lost about
40 per cent of its private-line traffic - mostly from Wall Street and the
business sector - to 'competitive access providers' including MFS.
MFS timed its launch to coincide with BT's price cuts, claiming that even
after them it would offer City companies large savings on their telecoms
bills.
It will levy no rental fee or connection charge, and has only four charge
bands, all highly competitive with BT and Mercury prices. But users must
have an annual telecoms bill of at least Pounds 600 per line, limiting the
likely take-up to large corporate customers.
MFS's competition is as much Mercury as BT, an indication of the pressure
being exerted on the BT/Mercury duopoly, formally abolished in 1991 but
still largely intact. Mercury is estimated to have about two-thirds of the
City's outgoing long-distance traffic.
With the entry of MFS the City becomes one of the world's most competitive
telecommunications markets.
In addition to BT and Mercury at least four companies - Worldcom, Sprint,
ACC, and Esprit - are reselling long-distance and/or international lines
leased from BT and Mercury. Worldcom, subsidiary of a large US operator, is
making particularly fast progress. It has more than 300 UK customers, most
in the City, reselling international lines to them.
Mercury's position in the long-distance market will come under further
assault later this year from Energis, the subsidiary of National Grid
erecting a national network on electricity pylons. Like Mercury, Energis
will reach customers in three ways: by direct connections, by indirect
access through BT or other local operators, or by leased lines.
Meanwhile, Colt, another US-owned company, is building a local network in
the City and plans to offer a public service, connecting to the public
network, from mid-March.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Dublin cool on Mayhew plan for talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government yesterday gave a cool response to proposals sent to
Dublin at the weekend by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.
Its stance underlined the differing emphases of the two governments over the
next step to be taken in the Ulster peace process.
Dublin is not planning an immediate response to the British government's
latest proposals to renew round-table talks in Northern Ireland, but will
make its own suggestions 'for additional areas of discussion' in the coming
weeks.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, described Sir Patrick's
proposals as 'a checklist of relevant points in relation to the
recommencement of talks', and emphasised that any new talks must be on the
basis of the joint declaration and the three-strand talks that broke up
without agreement in November 1992.
Unease with the latest British proposals, which outline the creation of a
new assembly in Northern Ireland, was underlined by a Dublin spokesman who
said the Irish government 'will be making suggestions for additional areas
of discussion'.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that next week's UK-Irish
summit in London will review progress on the joint declaration.
The British and Irish prime ministers are due to meet on February 19 to
attend the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham, and it is expected
that Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will also be involved in the discussions.
Ulster unionists last night reacted angrily to the news that Sir Patrick had
already provided Dublin with the ideas he wants pursued.
Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for east Belfast, said the
disclosure that Britain had given details of its latest thinking to Dublin
was an 'outrage' .

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, issued the following statement on
yesterday's cut in interest rates.
'After discussion with the governor of the Bank of England on the prospects
for inflation, I have decided that it would be appropriate to reduce
interest rates by a further 0.25 per cent. Inflation has been lower than
expected. Looking ahead inflationary pressures appear subdued.
'With interest rates and inflation at historically low levels, the time is
right to reduce the magnitude of interest rate changes. The reduction of
0.25 per cent continues the government's prudent approach to monetary policy
and its commitment to low inflation.'
Mr Clarke said he consider-ed many factors, including:

FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel 4 chiefs may challenge 'safety net' levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 yesterday served notice that it may try to re-negotiate its
financial 'safety net'. This system will result in the channel paying Pounds
38.2m to the ITV companies for 1993.
The safety net, which was spelt out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, means that
Channel 4 has to give to ITV 50 per cent of any advertising and sponsorship
revenues earned above 14 per cent of all UK non-satellite revenues. A
further 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund and Channel 4 can keep the
rest.
In return, if Channel 4 revenues fall below 14 per cent, the channel is
compensated first out of the reserve fund and then directly by ITV.
The mechanism, supported by Channel 4 at the time, was designed to help
protect its minority-programme remit as it competed with ITV.
Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said his board accepted the
principle of the funding formula but it was now providing 'a safety net and
subsidy of considerable significance to the more enthusiastic bidders (those
that bid high for their franchises) for new Channel 3 (ITV) licences'.
Because of Channel 4's success last year, Carlton Television will get Pounds
5.6m, London Weekend Pounds 4.17m, Central - now controlled by Carlton -
Pounds 5.65m, and Granada Pounds 4.08m.
'The continuing support of the board of Channel 4 for the principles of the
funding formula will depend on the impact of any further revisions to the
act or regulatory rules which may further disadvantage the competitive
positioning of Channel 4,' Sir Michael said.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, which
hands the money over to the ITV companies, conceded it appeared strange to
'pay your major competitor for your success'.
But he added: 'The scheme also provides vital protection to the channel,
with its special remit, in tougher years which may lie ahead.'
The Radio Authority, the body that regulates commercial radio, yesterday
launched a debate about what to do with new FM frequencies, which will be
available from 1996. The frequencies are likely to be the last to come to
commercial radio for the foreseeable future.
Possibilities for the frequencies include a fourth national commercial radio
service and a new local service for areas that already have a local
commercial station.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Tebbit attacks 'illegal' EU domestic subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Tebbit last night coupled a blistering attack on law breaking and
corruption by Britain's European Union partners with a coded appeal to Tory
leaders to model the party's Euro-election manifesto on the principles in
Lady Thatcher's Bruges speech of 1988.
Speaking less than a week after another controversial attack on foreign
corruption by Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief Treasury secretary,
the former Conservative party chairman hit out at 'illegal' state subsidies
provided by various EU countries for domestic industries.
Branding Rome 'the agricultural fraud capital of Europe', he described the
scale of criminal fraud linked to the Common Agricultural Policy as
'gargantuan'. He urged the government to refuse to allow any decision to be
taken at the 1996 inter-governmental conference unless the CAP was reformed.
'How can politicians have spent so much time and energy railing at the tax
on domestic heating whilst simply ignoring the vastly greater, far more
regressive food tax . . . of some Pounds 1,400 per family per year?' he
asked.
In a typically robust address to the anti-federalist Bruges Group, Lord
Tebbit mocked a 'defeatist, compromising streak' in the Conservative party
'which would disagree with most of what Margaret Thatcher (then prime
minister) said at Bruges'.
But he saved some of his harshest words for the Liberal Democrats, who are
widely expected to pose a severe threat to the Tories in a number of
Euro-constituencies, particularly in southern England.
The Liberal Democrats were 'to a person, not merely compromisers but
full-hearted articulators of the doctrine that Britain is incapable of
self-government', he said.
This view was shared by the Labour leadership, 'but not by its grass-roots
supporters'.
The former party chairman's advice to his 'friends in government' for the
European elections in June was accordingly to 'stand - and robustly at that
 -on policies which would be supported across the country, across all
classes and creeds, through all age groups and right across party lines'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel tunnel rail service delayed again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The long-delayed launch of train services through the Channel tunnel is to
be postponed again, it was announced yesterday.
Some problems are taking longer than expected to resolve, explained
Euro-tunnel, the company which runs the tunnel. They included hitches in the
hydraulic system and alarm warning lights. 'The systems work, but in some
areas we have not achieved the reliability we want,' the company said. 'In
the hydraulics, for example, we need to make a few adjustments.'
Passenger shuttle services are not therefore expected to start on May 8 as
previously planned. Freight services, previously due to start next month,
may be delayed until April or early May. They are nevertheless scheduled to
start before May 6, when the tunnel will be officially opened by the Queen
and President Francois Mitterrand.
Eurotunnel said the tunnel was structurally sound and no significant
problems had been encountered, but the complexity of the commissioning
programmes had meant some tests had had to be repeated and others had been
rescheduled.
'We want to offer a completely reliable service and we thought it was better
to guarantee this even if it meant a slight delay before opening,' said Mr
Christian Zbylut, director of Eurotunnel's freight operations at Calais.
He said the problems that had been revealed during tests were usual in such
a high-technology project. 'On one locomotive there are about 500 tests
which have to be performed,' he said.
The Pounds 10bn project was originally planned to open in May last year but
has been hit by recurring delays. Control was handed over to Eurotunnel by
Transmanche Link, the contracting consortium, last December.
The Road Haulage Association said it was disappointed by the delay, but did
not believe that large numbers of road hauliers had intended to use the
tunnel from the outset. Those affected would re-route shipments to ferry
services.
CTL, a freight company that had planned to run two trains a day through the
tunnel to Italy starting on March 14, said it was better for Eurotunnel to
delay the launch so that when it did start it could provide a reliable
service.
Eurotunnel yesterday offered refunds to passengers who had planned to travel
through the tunnel in May. Passengers who are able to delay their journeys
can use their tickets when the tunnel opens.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Lib Dem change on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats have refocused their European strategy to maximise
their chances of taking a number of Tory seats in the June European
elections.
The new policy, launched yesterday, emphasises decentralisation and
diversity instead of what one senior Liberal Democrat called 'loose talk of
a united states of Europe'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, denied that the party was
watering down its commitment to a federal Europe but conceded that there had
been 'a change of presentation'.
The party has also gone back on its earlier pledge to reduce defence
spending by 50 per cent - which if implemented could have led to the loss of
jobs in the south-west - in light of the rise of nationalism and instability
in eastern and central Europe. Mr Ashdown said: 'Anyone who looked around at
the world in 1989 and said it was exactly the same in 1993 would be a fool.
It's not true of the government and its not true of us.'
The Liberal Democrats, who currently have no representation in the European
Parliament, have earmarked between three and 10 of the UK's 81 seats that
they believe are winnable.
The party's campaign strategy is to use the European elections to expand
throughout the south of England out of its stronghold in the south-west.
The Liberal Democrats' new policy document on Europe, Making Europe Work For
Us, refers only to the concept of a federal Europe in terms of
decentralising power to enhance its appeal to Conservative voters.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Managers 'block flexible working'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Old-fashioned management culture is a far more significant obstacle to the
introduction of flexible working time than employee resistance, says a
survey of 1,000 personnel executives for Group 4, the security company, and
the magazine Personnel Today.
Nearly half the managers cited management culture as blocking flexible
working and only 24 per cent employee resistance. Almost all respondents
said they would maintain or increase the number of staff they employed under
non-standard contracts.
Increasing part-time working was favoured by 47 per cent of respondents, 46
per cent favoured flexible working, 43 per cent job-sharing, 30 per cent
annualised hours and 26 per cent tele-commuting. The managers said the
recession had made it easier to introduce flexible working, and 64 per cent
said it had increased productivity.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Publican wins beer purchase test case
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publicans engaged in a long-running campaign against the terms of their
leases with Inntrepreneur, the joint venture between Courage and Grand
Metropolitan, yesterday won a significant victory in a High Court test case,
John Mason writes.
An application by Courage for a injunction to ban Midlands tenant Mr Martin
Bayliss from breaking the terms of his lease in buying half his beer stocks
from wholesalers at cheaper prices, was refused by Mr Justice Morritt.
The ruling could spark similar actions from other Inntrepreneur tenants
dissatisfied with their leases. Up to 200 other tenants are understood to be
considering action.
The ruling will remain until the European Commission reaches a decision
later this year on whether the UK's brewery tie system is legal under
European competition law.
Mr Bayliss had claimed that the terms of his lease, requiring him to buy all
beer direct from the brewers, made it impossible to buy stock and pay rent
on his Solihull pub. If able to buy at discounted prices, he could save
Pounds 10,000 a year, he told the court.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Buck for Iraq arms passes to Sir Robin: The cabinet
secretary will face a difficult public test at the Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robin Butler, KCB, CVO, cabinet secretary and head of the Home Civil
Service since 1988, has a reputation as a consummate mandarin, hugely
experienced in the ways of Whitehall and prepared to defend them
unflinchingly.
Today he will face a stiff public test when he gives evidence to the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
In an attempt to anticipate the conclusions of the Scott report, Sir Robin
is expected to confirm that steps have been taken to improve intelligence
gathering, and co-ordination between government departments generally.
But he faces politically tricky questions about the accountability of
ministers, the duties of civil servants, and his own role in co-ordinating
government policy on Iraq.
Since Lord Justice Scott began his inquiry, the machinery of government has
come under unprecedented public scrutiny as officials and ministers have
been cross-examined over their decisions during the 1980s and early 1990s.
Officially, Sir Robin has been under instructions from the prime minister to
ensure that the inquiry has full support from witnesses and is provided with
all the documentation it needs. But from the outset Whitehall has been
extremely nervous about the inquiry.
Whitehall insiders say Sir Robin was less than pleased by the judge's
decision at the start of the inquiry to publish an exchange of letters. This
showed Sir Robin attempting to curb the inquiry's powers and to ensure that
the government reserved a right of veto on what the judge eventually
published.
Sir Robin lost that battle, but that has not stopped him from picking up on
the disquiet shared by those of his troops who have been grilled by the
judge in a manner they are not accustomed to.
Those close to Sir Robin say he sees his role today primarily as raising
morale in Whitehall, as well as calming public unease over the role of
officials and ministers as revealed so far by the Scott hearings.
In evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee just over a
year ago.
Sir Robin rejected the suggestion that standards of the civil service had
declined in recent years.
Questioned about Matrix Churchill, he told the committee: 'In the particular
cases you have mentioned, I don't believe that they add up to a very
conclusive body of evidence that anything is going wrong.'
Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC have yet to be
so convinced.
Lady Thatcher told the inquiry in December that 'distribution of
intelligence within government and the machinery for ensuring that those who
need to know have speedy access to relevant information are matters which
the inquiry may consider should be followed up with the cabinet secretary.
'Either the machinery was there and was not effective . . . or else the
machinery itself was defective.'
Mr John Major told the inquiry that while ministers were responsible for the
acts of civil servants, they were not accountable for action by their
officials of 'which the minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge'.
To the extent that the cabinet secretary co-ordinated the functioning of the
government machinery, including the circulation of Whitehall information
throughout the arms-for-Iraq affair, the buck stops with Sir Robin.
Judging by the line of questioning pursued by the inquiry team in recent
weeks, Sir Robin may be asked whether responsibility lies beyond him, and if
so with whom.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Superstore plan dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, yesterday dropped its plan to build a
superstore on the outskirts of Yeovil, Somerset. The scheme ran into strong
local opposition, with protestors occupying vacant buildings in the town
centre.
The decision comes less than a fortnight after Sainsbury said it would
continue with its programme of opening 20 superstores a year for the next
four years. The company denied that the withdrawal had any bearing on its
overall development programme, and said it was because Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, had given consent for a Safeway store about a mile
away.
Sainsbury said that since it first sought a Yeovil site in 1986 'the
provision of food shopping in the town has increased dramatically'. It had
negotiated a clause with South Somerset District Council that allowed it to
withdraw if consent was given for another supermarket within five miles.
The council supported Sainsbury but opposed Safeway's scheme. After a public
inquiry Mr Gummer approved the Safeway plan in December.
Recently the Department of the Environment has taken a tougher stance on
out-of-town developments. On Monday Mr Gummer urged local authorities to
discourage them.

FT  09 FEB 94 / More big losses for Lloyd's forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is set to announce heavier-than-expected losses when it
reports its results for 1991 and 1992 over the next 18 months, Chatset, the
company that analyses the insurance market's figures, said yesterday.
In its latest forecast Chatset estimates that losses will amount to Pounds
2.05bn for 1991 and up to Pounds 1bn for 1992, bringing the market's
cumulative deficit since 1988 to more than Pounds 8.5bn.
The 1991 loss, to be announced in May this year in line with Lloyd's
three-year accounting system, is expected to be widely spread across the
market.
Even so, many Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported Lloyd's - are expected to have difficulty meeting calls.
Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset, predicted that the solvency test, in
which Lloyd's assesses the ability of Names to meet liabilities in order to
continue trading, would be 'extremely difficult'.
Explaining the 1991 loss, Chatset said a rise in cargo and hull claims and
inadequate rates had depressed the results of marine insurers. 'Rates had
not increased either far or fast enough,' it said.
US risks were also inadequately priced and claims from catastrophes such as
typhoon Mireille in Japan and the Calgary hail storms in Canada would also
leave many underwriters with losses.
Lloyd's had also been hit by poor investment returns and
higher-than-expected syndicate expenses, partially because of the cost of
administering more than 200 syndicates no longer in business. 'Lloyd's does
not have the funds invested to create returns to meet the losses that they
are generating,' Mr Rew said. This remained the market's 'fatal Achilles
heel'.
About half the 1991 loss will stem from claims on syndicate years of account
that have been left open because of uncertainty.
This so-called 'back year deterioration' would also keep Lloyd's decisively
in the red in 1992, Chatset said. It predicted 1992 'would be another bad
year for Lloyd's' and 'an overall loss of up to Pounds 1bn if old years
continue to ravage the figures'.
By contrast 1993 has 'all the hallmarks of a first-class year', following
rate increases and the absence of any heavy catastrophe claims. But Chatset
questioned whether profits would be sufficient 'to cover back year
deficiencies' and other costs.
Chatset, which has often been highly critical of Lloyd's, said in the
editorial to its latest Lloyd's League Tables that Names should accept the
market's Pounds 900m settlement offer. 'Chairmen of action groups hype their
membership up with cries of there being more money in court . . . Our advice
would be to take what is on offer and be grateful for small mercies.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / Minister acts over college dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Boswell, the minister for further education, yesterday intervened in
the dispute between further education colleges and their lecturers over new
contracts.
Lecturers may now find that they can only receive pay rises if they sign new
contracts.
The Natfhe lecturers' union announced earlier this week that it would hold a
one-day strike on March 1 against new contracts that would add seven hours
to the working week.
Mr Boswell is backing the Colleges' Employers' Forum, which negotiates on
behalf of most college principals in England and Wales.
All further education colleges were removed from local authority control in
April last year and were incorporated as independent organisations.
He told the forum that he was withholding Pounds 50m from colleges' budgets
to be released only 'when there had been satisfactory progress within
colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'.
He said current contracts for lecturers included 'restrictive practices',
and added: 'The model contract which the CEF has drawn up eliminates these
restrictive practices.'
Natfhe gave an angry response. Ms Sue Berryman, the union's chief
negotiator, said: 'It's ironic that the colleges are supposed to have been
set free, and then we get this kind of interference.'
She said the government was jeopardising its own programme of expanding
further education.
The forum described the union's strike as 'futile' and pointed out that only
58 per cent of its members had voted in the strike ballot last month. Of
these, 62 per cent supported strike action.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Newspaper offer may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium including Mirror Group Newspapers that last week launched a
bid for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent, is now free to
increase its offer.
The consortium had offered Pounds 2.60 a share for the 52 per cent of
Newspaper Publishing stock that it did not already own. But the bid quickly
became academic after Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland
bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing at Pounds 3.50 a share.
The consortium - which also includes the founders of The Independent led by
editor-in-chief Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, as well as El Pas of Spain and La
Repubblica of Italy - is now considering increasing its bid.
After talks with the Takeover Panel, the consortium said yesterday: 'The
consortium has chosen not to be bound by the statement that was made not to
increase its offer for the share capital of Newspaper Publishing.'
An early decision is unlikely. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper
Publishing, has embarked with fellow non-executive director Sir Kit McMahon
on a series of talks with all parties involved. These are not due to be
completed before next week and any further bids are unlikely until then.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel 4 chiefs may challenge 'safety net' levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 yesterday served notice that it may try to renegotiate its
financial 'safety net'. This system will result in the channel paying Pounds
38.2m to the ITV companies for 1993.
The safety net, which was spelt out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, means that
Channel 4 has to give to ITV 50 per cent of any advertising and sponsorship
revenues earnt above 14 per cent of all UK non-satellite revenues. A further
25 per cent goes into a reserve fund and Channel 4 can keep the rest.
In return, if Channel 4 revenues fall below 14 per cent, the channel is
compensated first out of the reserve fund and then directly by ITV up to 2
per cent of total revenues.
The mechanism, supported by Channel 4 at the time, was designed to help
protect the channel's minority programme remit as it sold advertising in
competition with ITV for the first time.
Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said his board accepted the
principle of the funding formula but it was now providing 'a safety net and
subsidy of considerable significance to the more enthusiastic bidders (those
that bid high for their franchises) for new Channel 3 (ITV) licences'.
Last year Channel 4 audience share rose to just under 11 per cent and
advertising and sponsorship revenue reached Pounds 330.1m, 18.2 per cent of
total relevant revenue.
The windfall will mean a payment of Pounds 5.6m for Carlton Television,
Pounds 4.17m for London Weekend, Pounds 5.65m for Central, now controlled by
Carlton, and Pounds 4.08m for Granada. The tiny Channel Islands TV company
gets Pounds 15,000.
'The continuing support of the board of Channel 4 for the principles of the
funding formula will depend on the impact of any further revisions to the
act or regulatory rules which may further disadvantage the competitive
positioning of Channel 4,' Sir Michael said.
He added that money was being taken out of Channel 4 programming budgets at
the same time as reports that ITV was reducing its network programme budget.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission which
will receive the money before handing it over to the ITV companies, conceded
it appeared strange to have to 'pay your major competitor for your success'.
But he added: 'The scheme also provides vital protection to the channel,
with its special remit, in tougher years which may lie ahead.'
Unless the broadcasting act is changed the present financial rules will stay
in place until at least 1997.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Debate launched on radio FM slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority yesterday launched a debate about what to do with new FM
frequencies which will be available from 1996 - the last likely to come to
commercial radio for the foreseeable future.
Possibilities for the 105 MHz to 108 MHz frequencies include a fourth
national commercial radio service and a new local service for all areas that
already have a local commercial station.
The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, suggested yesterday
that the industry's rate of growth was also an important factor to be
considered.
The authority set out four options, most mutually exclusive, for discussion:
A fourth national network that could reach more than 90 per cent of the
population.
Services similar in size and number to the present Independent Local Radio
network, including the possibility of stations switching from AM to FM
frequencies.
A new network lattice of stations classified by size, for example reaching a
radius of up to 10km (6 1/4 miles), 15km or 40km.
A combination of the services in the second and third options but
concentrated in populated areas.

FT  09 FEB 94 / NUT votes to continue boycott of schools tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest teachers' union yesterday decided to press ahead with its
boycott of national curriculum tests in England and Wales for another year.
The move by the NUT increases the chances of renewed political difficulties
this summer for Mr John Patten, the education secretary.
But teachers' unions are now split, as leaders of the other two unions have
opted to call off the test boy-cott.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, announced the action after a poll of
members had found 89.9 per cent support for continuing the union's campaign
against the tests and the associated teacher assessments. Only 31.2 per cent
of the union's school members participated.
He said: 'The evidence of this survey is there. Teachers want time to teach.
They do not want to waste time on unnecessary and unsound statutory
assessment and testing systems.'
Tests would not take place in many schools if the NUT carries out its
threat. Both the other two unions, the NASUWT and the ATL, have agreed not
to take over the work of NUT members taking industrial action.
The two associations for head teachers have both recommended that the
boycott should be lifted, but have said they will not put pressure on
teachers who continue with industrial action.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority
which sets the tests, said: 'The NUT appears not to be recognising how much
has already been done to help teachers by limiting these tests to the
essentials - national language, mathematics and science - and by finding
ways of relieving them of administrative work. My only concern is the
interests of the children.'
The Department for Education also attacked the decision. It said parents
would not understand why the NUT had not dropped the 'unnecessary' boycott
in line with the other unions.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Lib Dems shift focus to capture Euro seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats have refocused their European strategy to maximise
their chances of taking a number of Tory seats in the June European
elections.
The new policy, which was launched yesterday, emphasises decentralisation
and diversity instead of what one senior Liberal Democrat called 'loose talk
of a united states of Europe'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, denied that the party was
watering down its commitment to a federal Europe but conceded that there had
been 'a change of presentation'.
The party has also gone back on its earlier pledge to reduce defence
spending by 50 per cent - which if implemented could have led to the loss of
jobs in the south-west - in light of the rise of nationalism and instability
in eastern and central Europe.
Mr Ashdown said: 'Anyone who looked around at the world in 1989 and said it
was exactly the same in 1993 would be a fool. It's not true of the
government and its not true of us.'
The Liberal Democrats, which currently have no representation in the
European Parliament, have earmarked between three and 10 of the UK's 81
seats which they believe are winnable.
The party's campaign strategy is to use the European elections to expand
throughout the south of England out of its stronghold in the south-west.
To this end the forthcoming by-election at Eastleigh - caused by the death
of Mr Stephen Milligan - could not have come at a better time for the
Liberal Democrats.
Mr Milligan held Eastleigh for the Conservatives with a majority of 17,702.
The Liberal Democrats need a swing of just more than 11.6 per cent to take
the seat, well below the 35.4 per cent achieved at nearby Christchurch.
The Liberal Democrats' new policy document on Europe, Making Europe Work For
Us, refers only to the concept of a federal Europe in terms of
decentralising power to enhance its appeal to Conservative voters in the
south of England.
It says: 'This is the vision of decentralist federalism to which the Liberal
Democrats are committed: a streamlined and effective European Union in which
power is exercised at the lowest level.'
It contrasts this with Conservative attempts 'to twist the word federal out
of all recognition, to equate with their bogey of a centralised Brussels
superstate'.
In an attempt to embarrass the government, the Liberal Democrats tabled an
early day motion noting the government's links with the European Peoples
Party, which 'works towards the realisation of a united states of Europe'.
Mr Ashdown said those who were passionate about Europe had to explain to
people, concerned about jobs and prosperity, the practical advantages of
having a pro-European policy.
'Our task is to show that Britain needs to take a lead in making Europe work
for people,' he said.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Sainsbury abandons plan for Somerset superstore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, is abandoning its plans to build a
superstore on the outskirts of Yeovil, Somerset. The scheme ran into strong
local opposition, with protestors occupying vacant buildings in the town
centre.
The decision, announced yesterday, comes less than a fortnight after
Sainsbury said it would continue with its programme of opening 20
superstores a year for the next four years. Sainsbury denied that the
withdrawal had any bearing on its overall development programme, but said it
was because Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, had given consent for a
nearby Safeway store.
Sainsbury said that since it first sought a Yeovil site in 1986 'the
provision of food shopping in the town has increased dramatically'. It had
negotiated a clause with South Somerset district council which allowed it to
withdraw if consent was given for another supermarket within five miles.
The council supported the Sainsbury store, which would have had a gross area
of more than 50,000 sq ft and parking for 460 cars, but opposed Safeway's
scheme, about a mile away. After a public inquiry Mr Gummer approved the
Safeway plan in December.
Recently the Department of Environment has taken a tougher stance on
out-of-town developments. On Monday Mr Gummer urged local authorities to
discourage it.
Sainsbury was to pay about Pounds 6m for the site and the county council was
to provide Pounds 2m towards a new access road and other infrastructure
costing Pounds 5.1m. But the plans caused protests because of the impact on
the Wyndham Hill green space and the town centre.
Objectors from Earth First, an environmental pressure group, occupied an
empty Tesco store in the town. After a High Court eviction order they moved
into another derelict building.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Calais cuisine troubles Rosbifs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of having to eat boeuf bourgignon and drink house wine in some
anonymous hotel on the outskirts of Calais has provoked British immigration
staff to ballot on boycotting work on the French side of the Channel tunnel.
More than 650 immigration service members of the NUCPS civil service union
are being asked to boycott work at the village of Coquelles.
The UK authorities have decided not to establish a permanent station on
French soil to inspect UK-bound traffic using Eurotunnel's rail shuttle
service. Instead the Immigration Service intends to send staff for a two-day
shift. Officials estimate that staff will have to make stopovers about seven
times a year. The union says it will be nearer 20 times.
Immigration workers, who object to their deployment overseas in principle,
say the arrangements for working in France are unacceptable. They object to
having no choice of accommodation and the fact that they will be obliged to
dine there, with no allowance for eating elsewhere.
Mr John Oliver, NUCPS branch secretary, said members objected to the absence
of choice. 'Many of our members are vegetarians. In addition, how many
French hotels serve breakfast at 5am when we have to get up for our early
shift?'
Mr Oliver said he had heard that French immigration workers, who would be
doing similar shifts in the UK, had also objected.
The ballot result will be announced later this month and if successful the
boycott will begin when the tunnel officially opens.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Ministers consider pulling out of ILO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are deciding whether to withdraw the UK from the International
Labour Organisation in protest at the growing threat of condemnation of its
industrial relations policies at this June's ILO conference.
The main cause for expected ILO censure is the ban on trade unions at the
GCHQ communications headquarters in Cheltenham. The ban was introduced just
over 10 years ago by Baroness Thatcher.
Efforts to settle the issue failed last December after a meeting between Mr
John Major, the prime minister, and civil service union leaders.
Mr Major said he believed there was a conflict of loyalty between a worker
belonging to a union and working in the communications centre.
The talks had been encouraged by the ILO in 1992 as a way of trying to end
the deadlock. Now the Trades Union Congress is seeking an ILO censure of the
government in June. The matter is being discussed by the ILO's Committee of
Experts, which will decide by April whether to recommend condemnation.
Union leaders believe Britain could be given a 'special paragraph' of
criticism in the ILO annual report, a sanction that has been used against
Haiti and North Korea.
Under the ILO's procedures, Britain would have to give two years' notice of
its intention to pull out of the organisation. It would also be bound by
conventions it had signed on good labour standards even if it was no longer
a member.
Ministers have also suspended plans that were being drawn up in the
Department of Employment to commemorate the ILO anniversary. These included
a dinner and the establishment of a fellowship for workers from developing
countries.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Gould expected to quit politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould, a former leading member of Labour's shadow cabinet, is
expected to announce this morning that he is to quit politics.
Senior Labour officials forecast that Mr Gould was preparing to leave the
Commons after he issued a statement inviting journalists to a press
conference at Westminster today.
There was some irritation among party officials that Mr Gould had not given
advance notice to the leadership of his intentions. He is understood to have
written to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, but the letter had not been
received late last night.
Colleagues said that Mr Gould, who quit the shadow cabinet last year in
protest at Labour's support for the Maastricht treaty, had become
increasingly disenchanted with the direction of Labour policy.
Mr Gould had some success in promoting alternative policies through the Full
Employment Forum, a pressure group for a return to traditional Keynesian
policies.
More than 30 Labour MPs joined the group, indicating a significant level of
support for his views. He was particularly anxious to combat the
conservative approach favoured by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
who is one of Labour's leading modernisers.
However, Mr Gould had confided to friends that there appeared to be little
hope of influencing the party leadership before the next election.
It was not clear whether Mr Gould planned to leave the Commons immediately,

Party officials said they would be relaxed about a by-election in Dagenham,

FT  09 FEB 94 / Tribunal told of 'cover-up' on forex deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerns raised by a London bank officer when she was asked to destroy
suspicious foreign exchange deal notes went unheeded by management, an
industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
In 1992, Adam and Co, the Edinburgh-based private bank now owned by Royal
Bank of Scotland, announced a Pounds 21m loss from unauthorised foreign
exchange dealing.
Ms Tracey Humphreys, 30, a former assistant supervisor at the Pall Mall
branch of Adam and Co, yesterday suggested to the tribunal in Croydon, south
London, that the problems could have been discovered much earlier had
managers heeded her warnings.
Claiming unfair dismissal when she was made redundant in March 1993, she
accused Mr Richard Donaldson, the director who dismissed her, of attempting
to cover up for his own incompetence.
The bank said Ms Humphreys was made redundant because of the transfer of
foreign exchange operations to Edinburgh. She had been given a formal
warning for carrying out unauthorised money transfers from her own account
at the bank. Ms Humphreys said she made the transactions without knowing it
was against bank procedures.
Ms Humphreys, who joined Adam and Co in October 1990, said she had raised
her concerns with Mr Donaldson nearly a year before her dismissal. She had
also informed the then finance director Mr Jeremy Lowry, who has since left
the bank.
She said she was told by foreign exchange dealers to destroy deal
confirmation notes because the deals had been cancelled.
Mr Donaldson told the tribunal: 'The events of the foreign exchange had
nothing whatsoever to do with my reasons for considering Tracey Humphreys
for redundancy.'
After the hearing, he said he referred Ms Humphreys to Mr Lowry as the
appropriate person to deal with her concerns. 'It had absolutely no
relevance to her dismissal case.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / Carsberg slams revised banking code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday described
the revised code of banking practice as a wasted opportunity. The code was
published yesterday and his attack was the first of many criticisms which
came from, among others, the Consumers' Association and National Consumer
Council.
Sir Bryan said that banks and building societies had 'wasted an opportunity
to make a step increase in consumer protection'. He added that the code
'ignores major areas of consumer concern' by failing to introduce a
self-regulatory requirement to give 'best advice' to customers being offered
a range of financial services.
The code, accepted voluntarily by more than 280 banks and building
societies, is a second edition of the guidance that was issued two years ago
and imposes some fresh obligations on those who sign up to it.
These include requirements to give customers at least 14 days' advance
notice of charges and interest; not to pass customer information to other
companies in their group without the customer's express written consent, and
not to make giving this consent a condition of providing basic banking
services.
Sir Bryan was among those questioning the code's timetable, which gives
organisations until the end of 1996 to introduce pre-notification.
Mr Chris Lendrum, chairman of the working party of representatives from
banks and societies which drew up the changes, said that very complex system
changes were involved in the new arrangement, and that competitive pressures
might well contribute to earlier implementation of the change.
Some banks and societies already give customers advance notice of charges
and interest.
There was also confusion about the impact on existing customers of the new
requirement for express written consent for passing personal account details
within a bank's group of companies.
Barclays Bank, which used to make giving such consent a condition for
customers applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans, said it would
seek 'clarification' of whether and how the new code would apply where
consent had already been given in those circumstances.
Mr Maurice Healy, a member of the committee which reviewed the code and made
recommendations to the joint working party, said that the committee
envisaged that other companies in a group should not be able to use such
information until the customer had consented again.
Nor does the code resolve two issues affecting customer confidentiality on
which banks have not reached agreement with the data protection registrar.
These are 'host mailing', where an institution posts to its customers
information from another organisation, and the form of customer consent
required for passing on certain information to credit reference agencies.
Other changes in the second edition include an obligation to ensure that
customers and staff are aware of internal complaints procedures, and a
requirement to make information about the rates on interest-bearing accounts
readily available.
The new code will to come into effect in late March. The review process is
likely to start again in two years' time, with a further edition being
published in 1997.

FT  09 FEB 94 / MPs tell board not to hinder milk plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs on the Commons agriculture committee yesterday criticised the Milk
Marketing Board for its handling of plans to open the Pounds 3.3bn milk
market in England and Wales to competition.
The committee said the board, established by statute as sole supplier of
milk from farms, did not take sufficient account of milk buyers' interests
in its original proposals to turn itself into a farmer co-operative called
Milk Marque.
'This exercise in brinkmanship has been the principal cause of the current
delay and uncertainty which the industry is undergoing,' the committee said.
Government objections that the proposals could undermine competition have
forced the board to postpone market liberalisation from until November.
The committee urged the board to treat seriously the agriculture ministry's
continuing 'hesitations' over the plan. 'One rebuff for the MMB might be
regarded as a misfortune. A second would be immensely damaging to the
industry,' it said.
When the board is abolished, farmers will be free to sell their milk either
to Milk Marque or to dairy companies.
The committee said it recognised the anxiety of the Dairy Trade Federation,
which represents distributors and processors, that Milk Marque might sign up
80 per cent of farmers. But it criticised the federation for intransigence
in its opposition to the milk board's plans.

proposed to smooth controversial world trade issues

<TEXT>
An ambitious attempt to heal the rift between trade, environment and
development interests was launched yesterday with the publication of seven
key principles designed to guide decision-makers on trade and environment
issues.
The principles* are the work of a nine-strong expert group brought together
by the Canada-based International Institute for Sustainable Development.
The group is hoping that the principles will help underpin the current
debate in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over its future work on
trade and the environment. This work is due to be decided by ministers when
they meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round global trade
accords.
Developing countries have expressed anxiety that rich nations could bar
their goods on environmental pretexts.
Mr Richard Blackhurst, head of economic research at Gatt, said on Monday
that the principles encompassed Third World concerns by opposing
protectionism and dealing with the issues of resource transfer and poverty
alleviation essential for sustainable development.
The seven principles are:
Prices of goods and services should reflect their full costs, including
environmental costs.
Policies should promote equity, especially by tackling Third World poverty,
which is a prime cause of environmental degradation.
Trade and development policies should respect 'environmental integrity'  -
the need to preserve species, ecosystems and the like which cannot
necessarily be costed. 'Such special conservation measures may represent an
important exception to normal trade rules,' the group says.
Subsidiarity - the taking of decisions at the lowest level consistent with
effectiveness. In particular, the group says countries should not use trade
or other coercive measures to try to eliminate differences in national
environmental standards. 'Where there are significant transborder
environmental impacts, solutions should be sought multilaterally,' the group
says.
International co-operation on environment, development and trade policies
should be strengthened. The group says international disputes procedures
should be capable of addressing simultaneously environment, development and
economic interests.
Policies should be guided by scientific knowledge and, where uncertainty
exists, by the 'precautionary principle'.
Decision-making should become more open to public participation, with access
to information for all those affected. Dispute settlement procedures should
also be transparent, the group says.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US cars cost 40% more in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new US-Japan government- sponsored study, to be published today, finds
US-made cars are sold in Japan for an average 40 per cent more than in the
US, giving Japanese cars an average 20 per cent cost advantage in their
4.3m-vehicle home market.
The study, which figures in broader talks this week over a negotiating
framework, was conducted by one US and one Japanese research company by
agreement between their two governments. Its release, at a time when the US
is demanding improved foreign access to the 4.3m Japanese car market,
clarifies the obstacles facing foreign carmakers.
According to the study, the cost of getting foreign cars approved and
adapted in Japan costs up to 5.4 per cent of the estimated transaction
price. Import, distribution, advertising, pre-delivery and construction of
repair facilities also drive up costs.
With land and building prices high, distribution is another obstacle. Only
40 per cent of Japan's dealers handle car imports along with their domestic
models, compared to 94 per cent in the US. Only 5 per cent of the dealers
handle only imports, compared with 22 per cent in the US.
Demand for US cars is hurt by the relatively low trade-in value,
particularly compared with European-made cars. The latter also have the
advantage of having made big investments in exclusive dealerships in the
early 1980s, whereas American companies used Japanese-owned dealer networks.
US car companies say they are prepared to invest in the Japanese market,
given some assurance of success.
In the clash over car trade, US officials yesterday were insisting they are
prepared to walk away from an inadequate agreement. They are insisting on
numerical goals for 'steady and significant increases' in import
penetration.
Japan's negotiators are equally insistent that they will not agree to
numerical indicators, but the numbers being put forth - 100,000 foreign car
purchases a year - have been raised by the Japanese themselves in earlier
negotiations.
US negotiators want a significant increase in the number of direct franchise
agreements between Japanese dealers and foreign vehicle makers; an increase
in North American content in parts made by Japanese companies in the US;
significant regulatory reform, deregulation and simplification of Japanese
government standards and certification; and expansion of business
relationships between US and Japanese vehicle companies.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo 'backsliding' on chips accord -
Trade relations in jeopardy, US manufacturers warn Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan is backsliding on efforts to open its markets to foreign semiconductor
manufacturers, the US semiconductor industry has warned in a letter to
President Bill Clinton ahead of his meetings with Japanese Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa this week.
US-Japanese trade relations are in jeopardy because of deteriorating results
from the 1991 US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement, the chip makers said,
noting that the accord had become a 'litmus test' as to whether real
progress could be made in the troubled US-Japan trading relationship.
'If this agreement fails, given all the priority and effort given to it by
both countries' governments and industries, there is little reason to
believe that any other negotiations can succeed,' the chip makers said.
'We can't help but feel that we are drifting toward an era of confrontation
and recriminations. This is unfortunate because it is completely avoidable,'
said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry
Association, a trade group representing US chip makers.
'The US semiconductor industry wants sales, not sanctions,' said Mr Daryl
Hatano, SIA vice-president. 'But we feel that we are being pushed in that
direction.'
The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market rose above a 20 per
cent target established in the trade accord in the fourth quarter of 1992,
encouraging the Clinton administration to site the agreement as a model for
other sectors because it established 'measurable results'.
However, over the past three quarters, the foreign semiconductor market
share figure has fallen to 18.1 per cent. Emergency talks between the two
governments last month in Tokyo failed to produce any agreement on stemming
the decline.
'The forward momentum has been lost and we are very worried about
backsliding,' said Mr Procassini.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: EU agrees to scrap 4,700 cheap import
quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday reached agreement on a comprehensive overhaul
of its import regime coupled with a strengthening of its commercial defence
weaponry.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed to scrap some 4,700 national
quotas on cheap imports which have existed for the past 30 years, mainly
against so-called state-trading countries such as China and North Korea.
A new EU-wide quota will cover a limited number of textile products as well
as seven categories of Chinese imports, including crockery, kitchen
ceramics, gloves, low-cost footwear, and transistors.
Despite continuing objections from the UK, ministers agreed to make it
easier for the EU to take action against unfair traders. The main difference
is that the Council of Ministers will retain the power to impose definitive
anti-dumping or countervailing duties, but these will now be decided by a
simple majority only.
This change reverses the earlier position whereby a UK-led free trade bloc,
usually including Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, blocked anti-dumping
duties through a qualified minority. The reform was agreed in principle last
December as part of the price France demanded for supporting an agreement in
the Gatt world talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the new import regime and
the streamlined operation of trade weapons would offer business more
certainty and transparency.
'I don't regard this as a contradiction to open trade. Open trade means
trade according to rules. If rules are broken by other people, it is no use
having (just) the right to defend oneself. You have to have the capacity to
defend yourself.'
On China, ministers agreed to raise the quota on cheap plastic shoes from
22.6m to 35m pairs. Other quotas on low-cost leather shoes remain at around
60m pairs. The quotas do not apply to so-called high-tech running shoes,
according to Brussels officials.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, UK foreign minister, said the new rules did not
amount to a great blow to free trade. But the UK believed it was important
in the follow-up to the Gatt negotiations concluded last year to stand up
for free trade. 'We don't want, post Uruguay Round, to resume
protectionism.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Elf may reduce stake in refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting aimed at resolving differences over one of eastern Germany's
largest investment projects will take place today between Mrs Birgit Breuel,
head of the Treuhand privatisation agency, and Elf Aquitaine, the French oil
group.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as Elf chairman last August, is seeking to
reduce his company's stake in the Leuna refinery from 65 per cent to 35 per
cent as part of his strategy of curbing investments and increasing profits
at the oil group. Elf, which is in the final stages of privatisation, saw
net profits fall from FFr6.2bn in 1992 to FFr1.1bn (Pounds 120m) last year.
The rebuilding of the Leuna refinery, based in the state of Saxony-Anhalt,
is seen as a crucial element of the Treuhand's long-term strategy for the
region. It wants the refinery to provide the basis for a petrochemical
industry developed around Leuna, as well as provide jobs in a depressed
region of eastern Germany.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, had already told Mr Edmond
Alphandery, his French counterpart and Mr Gerard Longuet, the French
industry minister, that the uncertainty surrounding such an important
project must be removed.
Under the terms of the 1992 agreement with the Treuhand, Elf undertook to
rebuild with Thyssen Handelsunion the refinery with a total investment
commitment of DM4.3bn (Pounds 1.64bn). The aim was to develop by 1996 a
facility with a capacity of about 10m tonnes per year and secure at least
1,000 jobs.
British Petroleum and Statoil had also competed for Leuna, but could not
match Elf's much larger investment commitments. Under the deal, the French
company gained control of the Minol network of service stations in eastern
Germany.
Elf has repeatedly said it would find new partners for its reduced stake in
Leuna. It is even considering reducing annual capacity to 8m in order to
reduce the total investment requirement. But Treuhand officials yesterday
said the company had found 'no takers'. It remains unclear if Elf's contract
with Minol would be affected if it reduced its stake without finding
partners. In any case, Treuhand officials confirmed it reserved the legal
right to impose penalties for any breach of contract.
The Leuna investment project is backed by subsidies amounting to about 35
per cent of the total investment. Despite opposition from Germany's oil
companies, which criticised the subsidies on the grounds of unfair
competition, the federal government in Bonn, the European Commission, the
Leuna board, and President Francois Mitterrand pushed hard for Elf's
acquisition of Leuna and Minol.

FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Peru challenges Gatt criticisms over
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peru has abandoned its long-standing import substitution policy and put
decades of state intervention into reverse, but the private sector has been
slow to respond, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade secretariat says
in a report which it published yesterday
The report blames high interest and tax rates, competition from the informal
sector (which is estimated to account for almost 40 per cent of gross
domestic product), inadequate infrastructure, an overvalued exchange rate,
and terrorism.
However, this view was challenged as outdated by Peruvian officials when the
Gatt council met this week to discuss the report, originally compiled in
spring 1993.
The latest figures showed nearly 7 per cent GDP growth for 1993, with a
further 5 per cent growth expected this year, officials said.
Inflation had been brought down from a peak of 7,650 per cent in 1990 to 40
per cent in 1993, with the aim of reaching single digits in 1995.
The struggle against terrorism was being won and the informal sector was
being steadily integrated into the formal economy, partly as a result of tax
reforms.
Peru's efforts since 1990 to liberalise trade and increase domestic
competition, in the context of a comprehensive economic stabilisation
programme, generally win Gatt's praise. The report notes that average tariff
levels have been slashed from 66 per cent in 1989 to 16 per cent in June
1993; the government is aiming at a 15 per cent uniform tariff by January
1995.
Price controls, subsidies, quotas and foreign exchange restrictions have
been scrapped and there has been a thoroughgoing privatisation programme.
The reforms and recent legislative changes have helped restore the
confidence of foreign investors, the report says.
Though Peru accounts for just 0.11 per cent of world trade, it is the
world's largest producer of fishmeal and cochineal, the second largest
silver and zinc concentrates producer, the third largest lead concentrates
producer and the fifth largest copper producer.
Peru is also the world's largest producer of coca leaves and the rapidly
growing illicit trade in coca-cocaine products is now estimated to equal
one-third to one-half of recorded merchandise exports.

backsliding,' said Mr Procassini. Although US industry executives expect a
modest rise in the 1993 fourth quarter figure, it is not expected to meet US
demands for an average 20 per cent market share for the year.
'The most disquieting aspect of this deterioration in foreign market share
is the Japanese side's complete unwillingness to sense the seriousness of
the problem or to commit to take any extraordinary steps to reverse the
decline,' Mr Procassini said.

Israel and Palestinians yesterday made good but slow progress towards
drafting a long-delayed agreement on security issues to implement
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho,
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the
mediator, for several hours of talks which broke up early today.
Mr Peres said progress had been achieved and that both sides hoped to reach
a deal at a meeting today, when both he and Mr Arafat are due to leave
Cairo.
Israeli officials confirmed the two sides were seeking to 'clarify' a draft
agreement reached between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland 10 days ago.
The talks mainly focused on details of a Palestinian presence at border
crossings; Israeli security arrangements at the borders and the operational
role of the Israeli army in protecting Jewish settlers remaining in Gaza
once Israeli forces have completed a troop redeployment.

India's exports rose 22.2 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.74bn) in
December 1993, extending a surge which began in April, according to
government figures.
The data will comfort the government as it prepares its 1994-95 budget, due
to be announced later this month. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister,
who launched economic reforms in mid-1991, hopes rising exports will help
fuel broad-based growth in the Indian economy.
Exports in the year to March 1993 grew by just 3.6 per cent due to a slump
in sales to the former Soviet Union and because of unrest following the
sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. In early 1993-94 exports recovered sharply
although the underlying improvement was exaggerated by the late shipment of
orders initially delayed by the riots.
More recent figures indicate exports are continuing to grow and suggest the
government's pro-export policies are starting to produce results. For the
nine months to the end of December, exports rose 19.9 per cent to Dollars
15.7bn - well ahead of the government's target of a 15-16 per cent rise.

<TEXT>
Prospects for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa appeared
grim last night after right wing leaders said, constitutional negotiations
had reached a 'dead end' and they would probably boycott elections in April.
Mr Rowan Cronje, chairman of the conservative Freedom Alliance, said after a
meeting of alliance leaders: 'There is really no sense in carrying on with
negotiations. We are faced with a serious difficulty, which is
insurmountable.'
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party
which has said it will boycott April's elections unless the constitution is
changed, sounded an even more ominous note.
Asked if Inkatha would register to take part in elections before Saturday's
deadline, even if only to keep its options open, Chief Buthelezi said: 'That
would be taking away our bargaining chip, so we cannot do that. Quite
clearly we've reached some kind of dead end.'
There remains an outside chance that talks can be revived before the
deadline, and that Alliance parties can be persuaded to register, but this
will depend on whether the ANC is willing to make further concessions to the
right wing Freedom Alliance on regional autonomy.
Talks came to a deadlock over this issue on Monday night, when the ANC and
Freedom Alliance were unable to bridge the large gulf between them: the ANC
wants a strong central government and the Freedom Alliance wants a federal
state with strong regional powers.
There was no sign yesterday that the ANC was preparing concessions on this
issue.
If the ANC makes no further offer to amend the constitution, Inkatha is
likely to try to prevent the April 27 elections from taking place in large
parts of Natal province, as well as in troubled East Rand townships near
Johannesburg where Inkatha has a strong base in migrant workers' hostels.
This will lead to widespread violence.
It was not clear last night whether the white right wing would also boycott
elections, as parallel talks between the white right and the ANC on a
homeland for Afrikaners are due to continue. If the white right participates
in the election, this will weaken Inkatha's efforts to resist but will still
leave a serious threat of violence in many areas.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Japan to cut drug prices by 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry yesterday confirmed it intends to cut
prescription drug prices by an average 6.5 per cent. The cuts, part of a
regular series of reductions every two years, will be implemented on April
1.
The move will further undermine a sluggish Japanese medicines market, the
world's second most important. Analysts believe it is at present growing at
only 3 per cent a year.
Japanese groups will be most affected, being so dependent on the domestic
market. The cuts represent another blow for European and US companies, which
over the past 12 months have endured often radical health care reforms in
Germany, Italy, the UK, France, and Spain.
The growth of the US market, the world's largest, is also decelerating as
changes transform the customer base.
Drugs groups operating in Japan have been informed how their medicines will
be affected by the latest cuts. They can now appeal. The ministry expects to
complete talks by the second week in March.
The cuts are based on a complicated formula dependent on the levels of
discounts offered by wholesalers to hospitals and pharmacists. The new price
is fixed by the ministry at the transaction price plus 13 per cent. No
prices will be increased. The 6.5 per cent reduction compares with a cut in
1992 of 8.1 per cent.
Antibiotic prices are expected to suffer most because they are discounted
more than other drug classes. The 6.5 per cent average reduction does not
include additional 'special' cuts on fast growing successful medicines such
as cholesterol-lowering drugs and interferons.
These extra cuts have caused anger among domestic and foreign companies
which believe the measures represent panic efforts to cut health care
spending.

nine months to the end of December, exports rose 19.9 per cent to Dollars
15.7bn - well ahead of the government's target of a 15-16 per cent rise.
However, imports in the same period rose by just 6 per cent because of
continuing sluggish demand for imported machinery and other capital goods.
Weak demand for imports has lifted India's foreign exchange reserves to the
record level of more than Dollars 10bn, helping to stabilise the rupee and
to give India a comfortable reserve.
It also reflects a prolonged slowdown in industry. Figures published
yesterday showed industrial production in the seven months to the end of
October, the latest period for which data is available, rose just 1.6 per
cent. Manufacturing output was up 1 per cent.
Like last year, industry is urging the government to use the budget to raise
spending and boost demand. But there are limits to how much the government
can increase its own spending to encourage growth because of a sharp rise in
public sector borrowing.
The fiscal deficit for 1993-94 could be as high as 6.5 per cent of GDP,
compared with a target of 4.5 per cent. Economic growth is expected to be
about 4.5 per cent, broadly in line with government forecasts, but the
management of public borrowing has been hit by lower than expected tax
revenues and higher than planned spending, including increased food
subsidies.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Hosokawa finds a lot to be sorry about: Japan's political
realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chaotic events of the past six days have exposed the precarious tenure
of Prime Minister Hosokawa and the strength of the finance ministry.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, scion of a famous Samurai clan, was yesterday reduced
to apologising - at least six times during his half-hour press conference -
for the abruptness with which he last week announced a Y6,000bn a year tax
cut and the introduction of a 7 per cent 'welfare' tax.
An exhausted looking Mr Hosokawa bowed yesterday, physically as well as
symbolically, to the wishes of the Social Democratic party, the largest
member of his seven-party coalition, which had threatened to leave the
government over the welfare tax.
Mr Hosokawa's decision to freeze the proposed new levy, which was to have
replaced the present 3 per cent consumption tax, means the shaky loyalty of
the Socialists has been assured - for a while. The income tax cut,
meanwhile, is to be authorised for just one year, pending discussions on how
to finance it, representing only a small concession from the finance
ministry's fiscal conservatives.
Mr Hosokawa's original tax plan, prepared by leaders of the centre-right
Japan Renewal party and Clean Government party with the fin-ance ministry's
advice, was rapidly withdrawn after other coalition members, including Mr
Hosokawa's own Japan New party, were furious at not having been consulted.
'I apologise for giving the impression that the tax proposal was hastily put
together or that it was done abruptly at a closed-door meeting,' Mr Hosokawa
said yesterday. Decision-making in Japan's first coalition government was
bound to be prone to 'a lot of trial and error'. He promised to make sure
decisions were made 'more smoothly' and to consult coalition members in
advance.
'Clearly, Mr Hosokawa is walking a tightrope,' said Mr Peter Tasker chief
strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. 'He is swaying in the wind, has
wobbled and just about regained his balance. He doesn't look strong.'
What is certain is that Mr Hosokawa's high-handed tactics have caused his
popularity to waver, down to 52.5 per cent according to yesterday's Nihon
Keizai Shimbun newspaper, a drop of 12.2 points from its previous survey in
December.
The tax drama is a sharp reminder that for all the confrontations in
Japanese politics since the coalition came to power six months ago, a
traditional all-party consensus is still needed for some decisions.
The government wrongly thought it could ram through the tax changes in the
same way it had opened the rice market and reformed the electoral system,
argues one political commentator. However, the rice agreement was
inevitable, because of international pressure for a trade agreement, while
the public was unconcerned about the fine details of the compromise on
political reform.
Mr Hosokawa again had to turn to the finance ministry to help prepare the
final tax accord; a sign of the vacuum left by the collapse of the LDP's
policy-making committees with its election defeat last July. The accord
simply 'rubber-stamped the finance ministry's views', scoffed Mr Yoshiro
Mori, LDP secretary general.
Mr Hosokawa insisted yesterday that the ministry did not force its opinions
on the government, contrary to several analysts' belief that the ministry is
pursuing its own independent programme of fiscal conservatism, almost as if
it were a political party. Finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii said his
ministry's basic views were incorporated in the compromise since the
possibility of raising the sales tax at a later date had not been excluded.
The ministry, supported by Mr Ichiro Ozawa's JRP, has long wanted a rise in
consumption tax to increase the proportion of government funding derived
from indirect taxation so as to compensate for the fall in income tax
revenue from a fast ageing population.
Finance ministry officials concede they have been priming the public for
economically sensible tax reform - and anecdotal evidence suggests that many
ordinary Japanese believe consumption tax should rise. And of course those
officials deny they have a hidden agenda.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Main aim is to increase consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The centrepiece of the Japanese government's package is a Y5,850bn (Pounds
35.29bn) tax cut in order to boost consumption funded by deficit covering
government bonds.
This year, the government will implement a Y3,840bn cut in income tax, a
Y1,630bn cut in residential tax, a Y70bn passenger sales tax cut (through a
reduction in the rate from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent), and a Y310bn cut in
corporate taxes.
This is to be done by abolishing a special corporate tax, originally
implemented to finance Japan's Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf War, at
a rate of some 1 per cent of pre-tax profits.
In addition to the central tax cut of Y5,850bn, there is a further Y170bn
reduction in inheritance taxes, making the total tax cut Y6,020bn.
Residential and income tax cuts will be reviewed at the end of the year,
together with a scheduled reform of the whole tax system.
The fiscal spending portion of the package announced yesterday totals
Y9,400bn.
A third of this will be spent on measures increasing public and private
buying of land to provide liquidity to the country's stagnant property
market and assist corporations wanting to unload their property holdings.
The spending element includes a Y780bn in advance acquisition of land for
public works, Y1,500bn in advance property purchases by local authorities,
and Y500bn in supplying low interest rate loans to a land-buying
organisation, which will act as a broker between sellers and buyers of land
in the private sector.
Public works spending by the central government on infrastructure such as
sewage systems and roads totals Y2,810bn, while Y610bn will be spent on
improving educational and research and development facilities, and Y300bn on
projects carried out by local governments.
To promote further purchases of houses, some Y1,200bn is allocated to low
interest rate housing loans by the Housing Loan Corporation. Increases in
low interest rate loans for small and medium businesses totals Y1,360bn,
while Y230bn will be spent on agricultural infrastructure ahead of the
opening of the country's rice market.
Tax incentives to promote investments in plants and equipment will total
Y100bn, while Y10bn will be spent on employment subsidy schemes to help
middle-aged workers facing an increasing threat of unemployment due to
labour rationalisation.

Tokyo's financial community welcomed the government package yesterday
although much of the buying had been done last week, when the government had

The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, which fell 287.03 points on
Monday, rebounded 236.83, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,251.23.
The bond market, recently depressed by fears of extra supply of government
bonds to finance the income tax cut and economic package, gained ground. The
yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark fell 2.5 basis points to 3.5 per cent
as investors regarded the over-supply factor as already discounted in the

FT  09 FEB 94 / Banks offered escape from bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than two years, the weakness of Japan's banking system has
depressed the stock market while persistent fears of a credit crunch have
undermined business confidence.
The Finance Ministry and the banks have traditionally dealt with bad loans
by slowly writing off their loans. But declining investor confidence and
increasing criticism over the delay in write-offs have forced the inclusion
in yesterday's package of measures allowing banks to shift deteriorating
assets off balance sheets.
The ministry will allow banks to set up a company to buy restructured loans
 -loans on which the banks have agreed to waive interest rates in order to
help financial restructuring - made to non-bank financial institutions, such
as housing loan companies.
During the late 1980s, banks, brokers, and manufacturers tried to take
advantage of low interest rates and booming stock and property markets by
setting up finance companies, many of which now face financial problems due
to reckless lending.
After selling off a restructured loan at a discounted price to the company,
which the banks themselves will have to fund, a bank will write off the
difference and the company will monitor the financial restructuring of the
borrower.
The ministry also urges banks to accelerate the write off process or to make
provisions against their bad and risky loans.
The Finance Ministry also wants the banks to step up the use of the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, set up last year to buy the property
collateral of problem loans.
The guideline also recommends banks to increase their capital base through
issuing preferred stock and subordinated loans. In order to add liquidity to
the property market, the ministry will ease restrictions on property-related
lending.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Hurd rebukes Chinese envoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's ambassador to Britain was rebuked yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
UK foreign secretary, for suggesting to British companies they would suffer
discrimination in China because of the dispute between London and Beijing
over Hong Kong.
Mr Hurd said trade relations between China and the European Union would be
affected if companies failed to win business for political reasons.
Mr Ma Yuzhen, the ambassador, has met executives of many leading British
companies doing business in China and has warned them that Chinese people
would be offended by Britain's stance on Hong Kong and would therefore be
more willing to deal with companies from other countries.
The possibility that UK companies could miss out on the boom in Chinese
investment and trade because of the Hong Kong dispute has aroused serious
concern among British industrialists. British exports to China have been
rising sharply, though from a low base.
Businessmen, though reluctant to be seen publicly disagreeing with the
government over its policy on Hong Kong, have recently been meeting
ministers and officials.
However, Mr Hurd told a parliamentary select committee: 'I am not saying the
ambassador is exceeding his functions, but I think that British businessmen
would be well advised not to take his analysis at face value.'
Mr Hurd said: 'That kind of discrimination for political reasons is
something which the European Union would have to take very seriously.'
He said European foreign ministers had briefly discussed the subject in
Brussels on Monday and that it was relevant to China's trade relations with
the EU and to China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, plans to raise the issue of trade
discrimination against EU member states when he visits Beijing in the next
few weeks.
Officials said Mr Ma had been called to the Foreign Office and was told by a
senior official that his remarks to British companies were unhelpful.
Businessmen said the ambassador had been careful not to suggest that the
Chinese government itself would discriminate against British companies. But
he and other Chinese government officials have repeatedly said Sino-British
trade was bound to suffer from poor relations resulting from the Hong Kong
impasse.
However, businessmen have not yet been able to identify any contract which
has failed to be awarded to a British company because of the dispute.

Retailers and small businesses were unimpressed by Mr Hosokawa's package.
Few believed it would boost the economy or improve their short-term sales.
Most interest was focused on the tax cuts.
Mr Kenichi Mitsumori, president of a small printing group employing five
workers in central Tokyo, said he expected the economy to deteriorate
further this year in spite of the income tax cuts. 'The income tax cut won't
really affect consumers' attitudes, so I don't expect any changes in my
business,' he said.
'There won't be any recovery until the automotive sector picks up. One of my
clients is a US carmaker, so the bilateral trade talks are probably more
important for my business than any tax cuts,' Mr Mitsumori said.
Sales staff at a small Tokyo clothes store were equally unimpressed. 'The
proposed tax cuts will only really affect the spending patterns of
high-income earners. For most households, earning between Y7m (Pounds
43,346) and Y8m a year, life will continue to be hard, and they will
continue to refrain from buying luxury clothes,' said one manager. Turnover
at the shop had been stagnant and was unlikely to improve in the short term.
Ms Kokusai Kikau, president of a small travel agency, took a dim view of
prospects. 'I don't think the tax cut will have any influence on my
business. Most of my clients are middle class, and still manage to take a
trip to Hawaii. I don't think the cuts will help these people to increase
the number of times they go abroad.'
The Isetan department store chain said the tax cuts might boost disposable
incomes, but it was hard to gauge the likely impact of the measures.
