FT  09 FEB 94 / Double-income family can do with this boost: Cuts 'will make
a considerable difference'

Mrs Keiko Miyaguchi is happy with the compromise tax plan which she expects
will be a significant boost to her spending plans this year.
'We have been penny-pinching these days because the outlook has been
uncertain, so it will be nice to see a cut in those taxes which make up a
large proportion of our tax burden,' Mrs Miyaguchi says.
With two children in college, a mortgage and an active social life, the
Miyaguchis, both in their early 50s, feel they can use a boost to their
double income.
'I don't think I would save the money but use it to travel, buy a new car
and other goods that we have refrained from purchasing,' says Mrs Miyaguchi,
who works as a filing clerk at a large firm of lawyers in central Tokyo.
'Besides, interest rates in Japan are so low it is hardly worth saving.
'My understanding is that we are in the income bracket that benefits most
from the tax cut, so I think it will make a considerable difference to us,'
she says.
Her husband works for a large construction company and is among those who
have been fortunate enough not to see their pay suffer significantly despite
the recession.
But not all families are as fortunate as the Miyaguchis, who receive two pay
packets each month and have already bought their own home, and will see
their financial burden ease as the children graduate from college over the
next few years.
The tax cut will have a minimal beneficial impact on lower-income families,
according to studies conducted by several private think-tanks.
A family with income of Y5m (Pounds 30,978) a year, will have an extra
Y40,000 a year to spend, according to an independent study.
That is enough for one member of the family to make a day trip from Tokyo to
Kyoto, or for the family to buy a dozen or so extra beers a month.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Blow to Clinton's healthcare reforms: CBO says plan would be
drain on budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congress's independent budget monitors dealt a severe blow yesterday to
President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan with an analysis that
sharply undercuts the administration's claims that its proposals will reduce
the federal budget deficit within a few years.
The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan agency, said the Clinton
plan would indeed cut health spending from its current path and would, from
2004 on, cut the budget deficit.
But the CBO's analysis shows that for the next 10 years the plan would be a
much heavier drain on the federal budget than the administration has
calculated.
'For the six year period from 1995 through 2000, the administration's
estimates indicate that the proposal would reduce the deficit by about
Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn). In contrast, CBO estimates that the deficit
would increase by more than Dollars 70bn over that period,' the study says.
Mr Clinton's healthcare proposals have suffered a string of setbacks over
the last week, with three big business groups denouncing his plan and opting
for the slimmer version proposed by Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee.
In a further reversal, CBO also concluded yesterday that the Clinton plan
would 'establish both a federal entitlement to health benefits and a system
of mandatory payments', and should therefore be reflected in the budget in
the same way as the social security programme.
Although largely symbolic, this conclusion provides ammunition to
Republicans who contend the Clinton plan will create a vast government
bureaucracy.
Mr Clinton counterpunched yesterday with a speech to General Motors workers
in Shreveport, Louisiana.
'Our plan does not put the government in control of health care. What it
does is to reduce the control of the insurance companies and give more
influence to workers and businesses,' Mr Clinton said.
He also dismissed the significance of the CBO report.
'We'll fix that. . . That's a Washington policy wonk deal,' Mr Clinton said.
Mr Robert Reischauer, CBO's director, said yesterday that he issued his
organisation's study with 'considerable foreboding that the information
contained might be used largely in destructive rather than constructive
ways'.
He emphasised that the differences between the CBO and White House estimates
were a small fraction of health spending in the US, or even in comparison to
the deficit.
Mr Reischauer also said the Clinton reform would save the US Dollars 337bn
on its total health bill over the next decade, reducing overall health
spending by Dollars 150bn in 2004.
But the analysis is a body blow to the administration, which had calculated
that, even allowing a cushion of Dollars 41bn, its plan would cut the
projected budget deficit by Dollars 59bn in 1995-2000.
Mr Clinton had expected higher government costs, because his proposal
subsidises small businesses and low-income individuals, and extends coverage
of prescription drugs and long-term nursing under the government-run
Medicare programme for the elderly.
But he planned to offset this by savings on Medicare and Medicaid, and by
higher tobacco tax.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Talbott sees need for strong Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott, nominated to be deputy secretary of state, yesterday told
Congress his belief in a close US-Israeli relationship was 'unshakeable', as
was his conviction that a strong Israel was a strategic asset to US
interests.
But in the course of an intermittently uncomfortable session with the Senate
foreign relations committee, he admitted: 'I don't feel the way I did 13
years ago on this. I simply changed my opinion.'
Part of a Time magazine article in 1981 otherwise complimentary to Israel
warned that the Jewish state could become a strategic liability to the US.
Mr Talbott countered that, as a commentator, he had often expressed himself
'in words appropriate to the heat of battle of the time' that no longer
reflected his views.
Mr Talbott's assurances notwithstanding, several Democratic committee
members felt obliged, for their own political purposes, to deliver a few
blunt lectures. Typical was that from Senator Joseph Biden from Delaware,
who told the nominee: 'I don't think you understand the Middle East as well
as you do the former Soviet Union.'
Mr Talbott broke no new ground in his prepared testimony and in answering
questions. He insisted that the US could not be a spectator to unfolding
events in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Congress yesterday averted a clash with finance minister Fernando
Henrique Cardoso when it approved the first of two votes on an emergency
fund to help balance the government's budget.
Mr Cardoso, who had threatened to resign if the fund was defeated, finally
won Congress' support following last-minute concessions apparently designed
to limit education cuts. He is now expected to push ahead with the next
steps in his economic stabilisation programme, designed to tackle inflation
of more than 40 per cent a month.
The emergency fund is designed to give the government more control over
spending and raising new money. It will hold and directly distribute
spending which would normally be immediately transferred to states and
government agencies. By retaining these resources, the government will be
able to claim a balanced budget.
About Dollars 16bn of tax and social contributions will be channelled into
the fund, slightly more than was expected when Mr Cardoso announced his
package last year. He was forced to negotiate an increase in the fund after
Congress defeated a proposal for a slight increase in corporate tax.
Instead, the government will raise taxes and social contributions on banks
and retain federal employees' income tax now transferred to the states.
The fund is being set up through a constitutional amendment and therefore
requires a second vote.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Chiapas's gentle military strategist: Damian Fraser profiles
the self-styled guerrilla 'sub-comandante' who has transfixed Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month after the guerrilla uprising in the southern state of Chiapas,
Mexico is transfixed by the figure of 'sub-comandante' Marcos, as he calls
himself, the spokesman and chief strategist of the self-styled Zapatista
rebels.
The sub-comandante formally reports to six Indian leaders who are the
supreme authorities of the Zapatista army. But they themselves describe
Marcos as the Zapatista military strategist, and have appointed him as
interpreter to the outside, non-Indian world.
He has only been seen in public wearing a black balaclava that reveals
nothing more than pale skin, a large nose and chestnut brown-green eyes. He
seems to have a moustache and beard, and to be in his 30s. Other than that,
his identity is hidden from the public.
But since peasant guerrillas first seized several towns in the impoverished
state, Marcos has gripped the country with a series of ironic, sometimes
poetic and always compelling communiques that have arrived at Mexico's main
independent newspapers from his base deep in the Chiapas jungle.
When President Carlos Salinas decided to offer the guerrillas amnesty for
taking up arms, Mr Marcos asked whether they should be pardoned for dying of
hunger, for not staying silent in their misery, for not accepting a gigantic
history of contempt and abandonment, for dying of dysentery, cholera and
typhoid, in a string of more than 150 rhetorical questions.
'Who should ask for a pardon and who should give it?' he asks in the letter,
which along with others has turned Marcos into a cult hero for much of the
country's urban middle class.
On Monday, Multivision, a subscriber-only television station, broadcast the
first full-length television interview with Marcos. He was soft spoken,
humorous and self-deprecating, even admitting to errors in the uprising on
New Year's Day.
He said the lack of land and Mr Salinas's decision to end land reform was
the detonator of the rebellion. He described a movement made up almost
entirely of Indians from Chiapas, who received no help from the church,
foreigners or other social groups.
In the clearest terms yet, he described the Zapatista battle as political
rather than military, as one of mobilising public opinion against what the
rebels see as the government's iniquitous economic programme and the
country's authoritarian political system.
Asked why the Zapatista uprising did not spread, Marcos replied: 'We did not
expect that, we did not expect that the people of Mexico would say 'Oh look,
here are the Zapatistas, now it is our turn' and pick up their kitchen
knives and attack the first policeman that they found. We thought the people
would say what they have said - something is wrong in this country,
something has to change.'
Despite the brutal nature of the uprising, in which policemen were killed by
rebels in cold blood, Marcos has been proved right. The uprising has
unleashed a wave of criticism of government policy and forced it to accept
on paper a broad political reform. According to an opinion poll in Este
Pais, an independent magazine, 61 per cent of Mexicans sympathise with the
Zapatistas.
The sympathy for the sub-comandante in part stems from disillusionment with
existing political leaders. While Marcos has been able to engage the public
in a dialogue, the speeches of Mexican politicians are generally tedious and
earnest.
In spite of his balaclava and guerrilla outfit, Marcos sounds remarkably
moderate and avoids leftist dogma. He thus almost immediately dropped the
original guerrilla demands for the resignation of the government and
replaced them with calls for democracy and justice, especially for the
country's indigenous peoples.
'Marcos is articulating very elegantly the aspiration of many Mexicans,'
says Mr Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist at the Colegio de Mexico. 'His
success is a testimony to the poor state of the political parties.'
Marcos has instead painted the government as the extremists, especially when
the army was accused of human rights abuses in the first part of the
conflict. 'We will not take the country a hostage. We do not want to, nor
can we, impose on Mexican society our idea through force of arms, as the
current government imposes its project for the country through force of
arms,' he wrote in one of his earlier communiques.
Marcos is fond of evoking the heroes of Mexico's 1910 revolution, and much
of his support may be linked with the public's romantic view of that period
in Mexican history. Ironically, Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary peasant
leader after whom the rebel army is named, is one of the heroes of Mr
Salinas, and his picture hangs on the wall in his office.
'The cultural values of Mexicans accept violence as a way to arrive at
power,' says Mr Federico Reyes Heroles, the editor of Este Pais.
The government, which has used revolutionary ideology to give it a
legitimacy that elections have not, is now finding that out to its cost.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Canadian tobacco taxes cut sharply
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada yesterday sharply cut tobacco taxes in the hope of curbing the growth
in cigarette smuggling across its border with the US.
But the government balanced excise tax cuts with measures to avert a
backlash from anti-smoking groups, including a new 'health-promotion' surtax
on cigarette makers' profits and a promise of tighter curbs on the sale and
promotion of tobacco products.
The cross-border smuggling boom has its origins in high excise taxes, which
have pushed retail cigarette prices up to about CDollars 45 (Pounds 23) a
carton in Canada, almost double the US level. The problem is most acute in
Quebec, where contraband products now account for an estimated two-thirds of
total cigarette consumption.
Social and political concerns have put pressure on the government to clamp
down. Much of the traffic has fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Tensions have grown between law-enforcement authorities and Indian reserves,
which straddle the border and are a favourite route for contraband.
In addition, Quebec separatists have sought to portray the smuggling issue
as an example of the francophone province's interests being ignored by the
rest of the country.
The measures announced yesterday include a CDollars 5 tax cut per carton of
cigarettes, bringing federal taxes down to CDollars 11 a carton. Provinces
willing to cut their taxes by more than CDollars 5 will have the cuts
matched by the federal government.
The three-year surtax on tobacco companies is expected to raise about
CDollars 200m. Ottawa will levy an export tax of CDollars 8 per carton to
reflect the fact that most of the smuggled cigarettes originate in Canada.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Productivity in manufacturing up 5.3% in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of 7.8 per cent in the
fourth quarter and by 5.3 per cent during 1993 as whole, the Labour
Department reported yesterday.
The rapid growth of productivity - output produced per hour - helps explain
the accelerating pace of economic recovery in the fourth quarter, when gross
domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent.
In sectors other than manufacturing, productivity growth was less rapid, but
still impressive. For all non-farm businesses, productivity grew at an
annual rate of 4.2 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 1.6 per cent during
1993 as a whole.
Last year marked the second year of unusually strong US productivity growth.
Manufacturing and non-farm business productivity grew by 4.3 per cent and
3.1 per cent respectively in 1992.
The productivity gains are helping put downward pressure on inflation. In
non-farm businesses, unit labour costs rose 1.9 per cent last year, against
2.0 per cent in 1992, a sharp deceleration from previous years.
In manufacturing, unit labour costs declined by 2.4 per cent last year after
a 0.1 per cent gain in 1992.
Productivity growth is typically robust in the early stages of an economic
recovery. But many economists believe the exceptionally strong gains of the
past two years also reflect structural changes: extensive corporate
restructuring in response to more intense foreign competition in an
increasingly integrated global economy.
During much of the 1980s, non-farm business productivity grew at an annual
rate of 1 per cent or less.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott, nominated to be deputy secretary of state, yesterday told
Congress that his belief in a close US-Israeli relationship was
'unshake-able', as was his conviction that a strong Israel was in the best
US national interest.
His comments, added to his formal testimony to the Senate foreign relations
committee, were designed to address recent criticism that he might harbour
reservations about the extent of the US commitment to Israel.
Speaking with care, Mr Talbott added that he fully supported all the
policies of an administration which had achieved much in facilitating the
Middle East peace process.
Although Democratic senators on the committee gave him a warm welcome,
Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina and longtime scourge
of the State Department, said he had 'profound concerns' about Mr Talbott's
qualifications for the job. 'We don't need another policy wonk sitting in an
ivory tower,' he tartly observed.
Specifically Mr Helms questioned Mr Talbott's recent record as
ambassador-at-large dealing with former Soviet republics. He quoted recent
remarks by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, who speculated that the
disintegration of the Soviet empire might be reversible, and Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the former Russian finance minister, who had accused Mr Talbott's
'rosy optimism' of undermining Russian reformers.
In his prepared remarks, Mr Talbott conceded that the US engagement with the
former Soviet states had been 'exhilarating but vexing'. But he said the US
could not remain a spectator, its involvement had 'already made a
difference,' and it was important to 'take the long view.'
He predicted that Nato would evolve towards 'maximum inclusiveness' should
Russia remain unthreatening, but that its membership and security guarantees
could be expanded faster to meet any new menace.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Unemployed exceed 4m in Germany: East bears brunt of rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in Germany climbed above 4m in January, with the eastern states
bearing the brunt of the increase and western Germany recording its highest
postwar jobless levels.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, said the figures, which compared
with 3.69m unemployed in December, were dramatic.
According to the Federal Labour Office, the combined unadjusted unemployment
total in east and west Germany was 4.03m, comprising 2.74m in the west and
1.29m in the former Communist east. It cited seasonal factors and cuts in
public spending on job creation schemes and short-time work for forcing more
people on to the labour market.
Mr Rexrodt, speaking at an economics conference, said: 'This unemployment
figure is of a dimension which is not acceptable. It is not a surprise, but
it is nonetheless dramatic.
'We must be aware that lasting high unemployment threatens not only our
economic order but also the foundations of our society. We must devote all
our efforts to averting this threat.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking at the same conference, said: 'We are not
dealing with a normal recession but with structural problems which have been
building up for too long. We need to rethink.'
The official east German unemployment rate is put at 17 per cent. But the
figures for the eastern states are not seasonally adjusted, unlike those in
west Germany.
Nor do official German figures include people on job creation schemes,
short-time work, or in early retirement. The unofficial unemployment rate in
the east is more than 35 per cent.
In west Germany, the unemployment rate, based on unadjusted figures, climbed
last month to 8.8 per cent compared with 8.1 per cent in December and 7.3
per cent in January 1993. This brings the total unadjusted figure to 2.74m,
a rise of 220,000 over the previous month, but a slight decrease compared
with the rise in January last year when 230,000 more people were added to
the register.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in west Germany rose last month to 2.52m, a
rise of 27,000 from the previous month, and a rise of 360,000 from January
1993. Economists said unemployment was expected to rise in coming months as
short-time working and job creation schemes expired.
In west Germany, short-time employment fell to 517,374 last month compared
with 556,192 in December. In east Germany, short-time employment fell to
115,900, compared with 125,449.
The figures confirmed repeated statements by government ministers that
unemployment would continue to rise, despite more optimistic forecasts that
the economy might grow by more than 1 per cent.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Finland attacks EU farm demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Finland sharply criticised the European Union yesterday for demanding an
immediate realignment of its farm producer prices as the entry ticket to the
EU.
A Finnish statement issued in Brussels said the demand would require the
country's farmers to halve their prices to match EU levels, creating
upheaval in the markets and putting at risk a Yes vote in a future
referendum on EU membership.
The Helsinki government's remarks jolted prevailing optimism at the end of a
two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. The meeting agreed on
an EU negotiating position on regional aid, Nordic agriculture, and special
assistance for farmers in Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway.
Diplomats said the EU's common position, though ambiguous, kept hopes alive
of an agreement with the applicant countries by the target date of March 1.
'It keeps the momentum going,' said one EU official, 'Now we are ready for
the endgame.'
Apart from the matter of how much each applicant pays into the EU budget,
the farm and regional aid issues are the trickiest in the accession talks.
Norway, however, faces a special problem in the fish negotiations and could
easily miss the March 1 deadline.
Finland's intervention was seen in some quarters as a tactical diversion
aimed at impressing its domestic audience. But Helsinki was also caught
flat-footed by the European Commission's insistence on a 'big bang' price
alignment supported by national aid, rather than a slow transition favoured
by the Brussels agriculture directorate.
It also expressed concern about a ministerial position on Nordic agriculture
which stated that the EU would consider 'national long-term aids' for
regions which suffered low temperatures and short growing seasons. The
ministers stressed, however, that this assistance should not be linked to
production or distort competition.
In the talks, Spain and Portugal blocked an offer of the most generous form
of regional aid - known as Objective One - to the applicant countries. Their
fear is that this could lead to competing claims to the biggest pot in the
structural fund budget.
Instead, ministers agreed on the principle of 'analogous treatment', leaving
the number of areas to be negotiated over the next three weeks. The
compromise provoked criticism from Sweden which pressed for special
treatment of its northern provinces, called Norbotten.
Austria also dug in its heels over its demand for special arrangements
covering Alpine transit traffic. It wants a nine-year exemption from the
common transport policy so as to protect against traffic pollution; but
Brussels is offering only a three-year transition until 1998.
Norway yesterday lodged a formal protest with the European Union over last
week's implementation of minimum prices on six species of white fish and
Atlantic salmon from non-EU countries and said talks on the move were
planned for Friday, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo.
It also expressed disapproval to Paris and Brussels about 'an effective
blockade' in France of fish from third party countries through rigid customs
and veterinary practices. These, it argued, were in violation of the
European economic agreement linking the EU and the European Free Trade
Association.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Scandal set to take the politics out of Italian banks: New
corruption inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a week the heads of two of Italy's most important banks, the
Treasury-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Milan-based Cariplo, have been
obliged to offer their temporary resignations because of judicial inquiries
into alleged corruption.
The resignations are in line with Bank of Italy rules introduced last
August, when bankers first came under the judicial spotlight.
Whatever the outcome of these investigations, the impact on the future of
Italian banking will be profound.
Mr Roberto Mazzotta, a Christian Democrat appointee, stood down last Friday
from the chairmanship of Cariplo and since Monday has been in a Milan jail
on charges of corruption. He is due to be questioned today about alleged
phoney property deals conducted by Cariplo's pension fund to benefit the
Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. Four other Cariplo executives have
been issued with arrest warrants.
At BNL, Mr Giampiero Cantoni, the chairman, announced on Monday he was
stepping down after news that he was being investigated for alleged payments
to local Socialist politicians to facilitate property development in a Milan
suburb. Mr Cantoni, a Socialist appointee, was brought in to clean up BNL in
1989 after the scandal of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in unauthorised loans
made to Iraq by its Atlanta branch.
A separate, routine Bank of Italy inspection is understood to have raised
questions about BNL's lending to Mandelli, a high-tech engineering group
recently placed in liquidation. With more than L100bn (Pounds 39m) of loans
outstanding, BNL is the group's largest creditor.
Both Cariplo and BNL have insisted the functioning of their institutions is
not affected. However, 14 executives who either hold or have held high
office in 11 large banks and savings banks are under investigation on
corruption charges throughout Italy.
These events will accelerate the process of change brought about by a
combination of the collapse of the post-war political system and
privatisation. Until now the state has controlled two-thirds of Italy's
banking and financial institutions. The latter were simply divided into
spheres of influence by the main parties, leaving managements with the often
impossible task of fending off political interference.
The opportunity for abuse was ample since there was insufficient
accountability. The Bank of Italy had only limited powers - for instance Mr
Mazzotta was appointed by the Christian Democrat-led government against the
central bank's objections. BNL was regarded as a 'Socialist preserve'.
Now the old political masters are fast vanishing, and privatisation further
limits the scope for interference. Management will be answerable to
shareholders - including foreign institutional investors  - instead of the
politicians.
The question is whether the latest arrests, and the possibility of other
embarrassing revelations as the judicial spotlight is increasingly turned on
the banks, will upset the gradual modernisation and improvement of standards
in the antiquated banking sector.
In the medium term, the stigma of corruption investigations into Italian
banking, once wrongly thought to be free of political influence thanks to
close Bank of Italy supervision, will be an obstacle to privatisation. Many
big municipal savings banks are being transformed into joint stock companies
 -the first step towards a possible flotation. Investors may think twice
about buying shares if they fear skeletons in the cupboard.
Further ahead, however, the latest wave of investigations and arrests will
accelerate calls for fresh blood in the banks. The two-year-old political
corruption scandal has already put a virtual end to the time-honoured
practice of lottizzazione, whereby political parties inserted their people
into key public-sector posts.
Revelations of corruption in bank boardrooms would speed up the move toward
greater transparency and accountability, instigated by privatisation.
Already, Credito Italiano, the first big bank on the privatisation list,
which was sold off last December, has altered its articles of association to
allow outsiders into its top management ranks. Others are bound to follow.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Court foils Fiat plans for lay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat's hopes of being able to push through a 5 per cent reduction in its
automotive workforce and lay off a further 10 per cent for two years have
received a setback from the courts.
A Milan court has ruled invalid a decision by Fiat to lay off for two years
some 2,000 workers and 239 white collar staff at the Arese plant of Alfa
Romeo near Milan. Fiat will therefore be obliged to bring these people back
on to the full payroll .
Unless the company can find a way round the ruling it could undermine the
Turin-based car group's plans to cut labour costs and return car-making
operations to profit.
The ruling followed legal action by the most militant trade union grouping,
Cobas, challenging the move which was put into effect three weeks ago. Arese
employed 9,000 people before the restructuring plan began to be implemented
and faces closure by 1996. The plant accounts for a quarter of the Fiat
group's total planned lay-offs and job cuts.
The court upheld Cobas's claim that the lay-offs broke an agreement between
management and unions made last June. This accepted the principle that
future lay-offs would not be for indeterminate periods and that laid-off
workers would be able to alternate with periods of work.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Key Chernomyrdin adviser quits: Illarionov warns 'old guard'
now in power has Yeltsin in its sights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the last remaining radical reformers in the Russian government quit
yesterday, warning that President Boris Yeltsin was next on the wanted list
for the 'old guard' of bureaucrats and industrial lobbyists now in power.
Mr Andrei Illarionov said he had resigned as chief economist to Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, prime minister, because he had 'joined the government to
conduct economic reforms, not to bury them'.
He said that since President Yeltsin launched radical reforms in January
1992 Russia had been in the throes of 'a hidden civil war' and that the old
guard, resentful of its loss of power, 'did everything' to squeeze out
reformers like Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister.
'1994 is the year during which they will try to overthrow Yeltsin,' he said.
However, Mr Illarionov reserved his sharpest criticism for Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, whom he accused of a long list of
'crimes' - top of which was last summer's highly unpopular monetary reform -
designed to discredit and eventually overthrow Mr Yeltsin. He said Mr
Chernomyrdin had saved Mr Gerashchenko 'four times' in the past six months.
The new government, he claimed, wanted to pursue 'a different vision of the
future of Russia', which basically involved restoring a Soviet-style
military and industrial power with 'some changes'.
Meanwhile, Mr Fyodorov, yesterday elected head of parliament's sub-committee
on central banking reform, vowed to investigate 'an excessive number of
unanswered questions' about the central bank's activity under Mr
Gerashchenko's stewardship.
Mr Illarionov's decision to quit virtually completes a wholesale shift of
radical reformers into opposition to the government. The exception is Mr
Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, who has stayed on
to complete his mass privatisation programme.
Tomorrow, the Russian parliament, which is also dominated by critics of
radical reforms, is due to discuss two new programmes that have been put
forward as alternatives to the government's existing blueprint, but which
offer little by way of new policies.
These programmes lend credence to Mr Illarionov's charge that the the
government 'has knelt to the blackmail of sectoral and regional lobbyists',
a claim which a group of veteran economists also made earlier this week.
'The lobbying will be stronger than ever before,' said Prof Stanislav
Shatalin, author of the ill-fated 500-day programme. Dr Leonid Abalkin,
former deputy prime minister under President Mikhail Gorbachev, said: 'This
government will opt for the worst of all options, cobbling together bits of
different programmes so that reforms don't happen at all.'

FT  09 FEB 94 / Doubts persist on Bosnia air strikes: Growing pressure for
action in the republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The massacre of 68 shoppers in a Sarajevo market last weekend has
concentrated world attention as never before on the need for effective
action in Bosnia.
Even those, like Britain, who have always had deep reservations about the
usefulness of military intervention, are talking about more 'muscular'
action. And even that paragon of caution, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign
secretary, has said that the Sarajevo atrocity 'brings us near a decision,
in one way or another, to use force'.
Yet for all the huffing and puffing and the widespread feeling that 'enough
is enough', a big question-mark hangs over the use of air power  - the only
type of military action any of the western powers is prepared to
contemplate. The statement issued by the European Union's foreign ministers
at their meeting in Brussels on Monday that Nato and the United Nations
should try to lift the siege of Sarajevo 'using all means necessary,
including the use of air power', certainly marks a political change of
direction.
Only last spring the Europeans rejected a US proposal which included the use
of air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions, as well as the
selective lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems.
In practice, however, a decision to go ahead with air strikes now lies in
the hands of Nato, which has been asked by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, to authorise such bombing raids, if these are considered
feasible and once the responsibility for the Sarajevo massacre is deemed to
have been clearly established.
The advice of senior Nato and UN commanders will be crucial in any final
decision to launch air strikes and it is no secret that most military
experts are extremely sceptical about their effectiveness in Bosnia's wooded
and mountainous terrain.
After a two-hour meeting of President Bill Clinton's senior national
security advisers on Monday, Mr William Perry, defence secretary, indicated
that he and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, had expressed their doubts about such a course of action. 'We take
very seriously the limitations of air strikes against, first of all,
artillery type targets, and secondly, any targets that are embedded in a
civilian population.'
Bosnian Serb artillery and tank positions, when they are not concealed in
forest, are reported to be highly mobile and easily relocated when under
attack. If they were deployed in populated areas, air strikes would risk
killing innocent civilians. Moreover, Serb and Moslem positions are
frequently so close to each other that bombing raids could kill combatants
from both sides.
Quite apart from the military limitations of air strikes - recognised by Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when he said a whole range of
other options were also being considered - there are many political and,
ultimately humanitarian drawbacks.
The launching of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, by triggering
retaliation against inadequate UN forces, could bring to an end the whole UN
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and greatly jeopardise, if not halt
altogether, the delivery of international aid.
Equally serious, air strikes, while satisfying the growing desire of western
public opinion and governments for punitive action, are unlikely to bring a
political solution any nearer. That is why Britain, as well as the US,
continue to insist that they be linked to clear objectives that would end
the conflict.
Both France and Britain have been doing their utmost, so far with little
success, to persuade the US to become more closely involved in the peace
negotiations. The US, which was responsible for sinking the original
Vance-Owen plan for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10
semi-autonomous provinces, has been equally unenthusiastic about the
international mediators' subsequent project.
This would carve the country up into three ethnic mini-states - Serb, Moslem
and Croat - but has proved unacceptable to the Moslems, who argue that the
territory allocated to them does not amount to a viable country. Washington
has all along refused to support a solution which is not approved by the
Moslems, thus making sure that the stalemate at the Geneva peace conference,
which has been further exacerbated by Croat-Moslem fighting and territorial
disputes, will not be broken.
One possible way out of that stalemate is agreement by the three warring
parties to the mediators' proposal that, as a first step, a separate
agreement should be reached on Sarajevo, which would demilitarise the city
and place it under UN administration. Such a partial solution, which would
cover an area of some 1,500 sq km around Sarajevo, would relieve the siege
of the city by putting it out of range of Serb guns.
Lord Owen, the EU's representative, has indicated that Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, would be willing to negotiate such an agreement,
though the latter is notorious for failing to keep his word. A rapid
separate agreement on Sarajevo, on which talks are due to be held in Geneva
tomorrow, could be the best way of avoiding a military escalation in Bosnia,
with unforeseeable consequences. It could also be the first step towards an
overall peace settlement, which remains the only way to end the conflict.

FT  09 FEB 94 / IG Metall steps back from confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, the 3.25m-strong German engineering workers' union, yesterday
backed away from instant confrontation in its annual wage negotiations,
accepting an employers' invitation to talks on Friday.
However, Mr Klaus Zwickel, its leader, set a one-week deadline for new
proposals from Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, before the union
begins the process leading to a ballot on full strike action.
He warned that both sides remained far apart in their regional negotiations
across the country in which the union is seeking firm job guarantees in
exchange for radical cost cuts sought by the employers.
'IG Metall will not bow to any diktat from the employers,' the union
leadership said. 'We do not want a conflict, but we are not going to avoid
it at any price.' The union will decide on February 21 whether to hold a
strike ballot, the essential preliminary to an all-out strike.
Mr Zwickel's acceptance of the invitation to meet Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol,
Gesamtmetall's president, was welcomed by the employers as a 'last chance'
to reach a solution. 'We know this is the last stage before open conflict,'
Mr Werner Rieck, the Gesamtmetall spokesman, said last night. 'Both sides
must sound out their final compromises.'
The union leader gave some indication of a readiness to compromise, but
within clear limits. He is now merely calling for 'nominal' pay rises,
implying that an increase below the forecast 3 per cent inflation rate would
be acceptable, rather than the 5.5-6 per cent in the formal pay demand.
As far as any changes in working hours are concerned, the union is not
prepared to see any open-ended deal to increase the present 36-hour week, as
the employers want, but is happy to negotiate a cut in working time.
The industry is due to move to a 35-hour week from October, 1995, and Mr
Zwickel wants that date brought forward by 18 months, as a measure to stem
the rise in unemployment.
He also wants a temporary two-year deal allowing individual companies to cut
working hours to as little as 30 per week, without full compensation of
earnings, in order to reduce their excess capacity during the current
recession. In exchange, the union wants plant-level guarantees of no
redundancy.
Mr Zwickel also suggested a marginal flexibility in terms of longer working
hours: instead of averaging a 36-hour week over six months, with individual
working weeks of up to 40 hours, the union is ready to see the period
extended to 12 months. The employers say that is not the absolute change in
the volume of working hours they want.
'Our common goal is to save jobs,' Mr Rieck said. 'It is not possible to do
that without cost cuts. There must be flexibility in working hours upwards
as well as downwards.'
IG Metall fears that the employers are using their arguments for flexibility
as a way of undermining the entire concept of a national wage agreement,
leading to plant-level bargaining.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Boutros Ghali calls on Nato to step in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following is the text of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali's letter sent to Mr
Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, on Sunday and to members of the UN
Security Council:
I have the honour to refer to resolution 836 adopted by the United Nations
Security Council on 4 June 1993.
In paragraph 9 of that resolution the Security Council authorised the United
Nations protection force (Unprofor), in carrying out the mandate conferred
on it by paragraph 5 of that resolution '. . . . acting in self-defence, to
take the necessary measures, including the use of force, in reply to
bombardments against the safe areas by any of the parties. . . . ' The safe
areas had been declared by the Security Council in its resolution 824 of 6
May 1993. They included Sarajevo.
In paragraph 10 of resolution 836, the Security Council further decided that
'. . . . member states, acting nationally or through regional organisations
or arrange-ments, may take, under the authority of the Security Council and
subject to close co-ordination with the secretary-general and Unprofor, all
necessary measures, through the use of air power, in and around the safe
areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to support Unprofor in the performance of its
mandate set out in paragraphs 5 and 9 above.'
In the declaration of the heads of state and government participating in the
meeting of the North Atlantic Council held at Nato headquarters, Brussels,
on 10-11 January 1994, the heads of state and government inter alia
reaffirmed their 'readiness under the authority of the United Nations
Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9
August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation
of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
You subsequently informed me that, whereas the North Atlantic Council had
already authorised close air support, a further decision would be required
for it to authorise air strikes. I supported this position to the Security
Council in my letter of 28 January 1994 addressed to its president.
The mortar attacks last week against civilian targets in Sarajevo, at least
one of which has been established by Unprofor to be the work of Bosnian Serb
forces, make it necessary to prepare urgently for the use of air strikes to
deter further such attacks.
I should be grateful, therefore, if you could take action to obtain, at the
earliest possible date, a decision by the North Atlantic Council to
authorise the commander-in-chief of Nato's southern command to launch air
strikes, at the request of the United Nations, against artillery or mortar
positions in or around Sarajevo which are determined by Unprofor to be
responsible for attacks against civilian targets in that city.
The arrangements for the co-ordination of such air strikes would be
elaborated through direct contacts between Unprofor headquarters and Nato's
southern command, as has already been done in the case of close air support
for the self-defence of United Nations personnel in Bosnia and Hercegovina.
I am today informing the members of the Security Council that I have
addressed the above request to you.

FT  09 FEB 94 / UN row over Bosnian air strikes: Russia and China lead
opposition to action against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council
yesterday came out against air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, with
Russia claiming that the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, had
exceeded his authority in instructing Nato to prepare for such action.
China said it wanted to see only peaceful means used to settle the conflict
in Bosnia, instead of 'actions which might intensify the confrontation and
further complicate the situation there'. With Nato ambassadors due to
consider the feasibility of air strikes at a meeting in Brussels today, the
Russian foreign ministry yesterday issued a statement saying that 'Mr
Boutros Ghali's letter (to Nato) deals with actions which go beyond UN
resolutions on Bosnia'.
In the letter - delivered to Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general,
on Sunday - Mr Boutros Ghali said he was empowered under UN resolution 836
to authorise the use of force in Bosnia.
However, Mr Mikhail Demurin, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr
Boutros Ghali's request to Nato should have been made only after
consultations with the international community. 'Nato's readiness for
strikes is one thing, while making a political decision to launch them is
quite another,' he said.
Ukraine and Canada, which both have peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia,
yesterday spoke out against military intervention as well, fearing it might
endanger their troops.
The US also appeared to be retreating from the idea of air strikes. White
House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the US was still focusing on diplomatic
remedies to the situation and would present 'ideas to reinvigorate the peace
process' at today's Nato meeting. On Monday, President Bill Clinton said he
supported Mr Boutros Ghali's request for Nato to prepare for air strikes.
However, the UK seemed to be softening its opposition to air strikes, in the
belief that there was likely to be overwhelming support for an ultimatum to
the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, renewed calls for urgent action as Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, returned to London from Bosnia for
an emergency cabinet meeting on the matter. Mr Major emphasised that UN
forces must apply 'immediate and strong pressure' to halt attacks on
Sarajevo. He said UN commanders should set clear and specific conditions for
relief of the city.
Mr Major insisted, however, that the UK would continue to block any
suggestion of generalised air attacks, amid considerable doubts about the
likely effectiveness of such action.
Mr Mate Boban, the hardline nationalist leader of the Bosnian Croats,
resigned yesterday, an apparent casualty of growing international pressure
on his political backers in Croatia.

A German collector paid a world record Pounds 188,500 for a porcelain doll
at London auctioneer Sotheby's. The doll (left), made in 1909 by the German
company Kammer and Reinhardt, is thought to have been cast from an
experimental mould which was later destroyed and never used in production.
The collector has all other dolls in the series made from the mould.
Sotheby's sold a similar Kammer and Reinhardt doll in 1989 for Pounds

FT  09 FEB 94 / Nato nears ultimatum to Serbs over siege of Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato is expected today to agree on an ultimatum demanding that Bosnian Serb
forces withdraw from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of the city or face
western air strikes.
After intensive contacts yesterday which brought the 16 Nato allies close to
agreement, ambassadors of the alliance were expected at a meeting in
Brussels to approve formally a plan to give the besieging Serb forces a
limited time to withdraw.
The allies are responding to a request from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, to prepare for air strikes against any artillery shelling
Sarajevo, following last week's marketplace mortar attack which killed 68
people.
The carnage pushed the west towards doing what it has threatened to do since
last August when Nato announced it was preparing air strikes against the
Bosnian Serbs if they continued their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo.
The French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, said last night he believed
Nato ambassadors would endorse the ultimatum plan. 'I think we shall be able
to present a joint, especially French-US, position demanding the lifting of
the siege, that is to say the pull-back of besieging forces,' he told French
television. He warned that France might pull its peacekeepers out of Bosnia
if Nato backed down. 'France will not associate itself with a non-decision,'
he said.
However, the US placed new emphasis on the search for a diplomatic solution,
without ruling out the use of force. A White House official said a strategy
approved by President Bill Clinton would entail increased US representation
in the peace talks, but not to the point of putting 'undue pressure' on the
Bosnian government.
Mr Juppe said that under the proposal the Bosnian Serbs would be requested
to pull back 20-30km from the Bosnian capital and place all heavy weapons
within that area under UN control.
In London, an emergency meeting of senior UK ministers chaired by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, agreed to support an ultimatum. British officials
refused to discuss the details of such a warning ahead of today's Brussels
meeting.
Earlier Mr Major had indicated that Britain had softened its previous
opposition to air strikes when he told the House of Commons that the UN
forces must apply 'immediate and strong pressure' to halt attacks on
Sarajevo.
Any final Nato agreement on an ultimatum is likely to anger Russia. Moscow
opposes air strikes on the grounds that they would make the conflict worse,
but also has strong traditional links with the Serbs. The Russians have
accused Mr Boutros Ghali of exceeding his powers.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said last night that any
aircraft attacking Serb forces would be shot down.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Japan agrees Pounds 95bn deal to aid economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday announced a record Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) package of tax
cuts, government spending and loans, designed to pull the economy out of its
deepest recession since the second world war.
The stimulus package, to be implemented over the next year or so, consists
of Y5,850bn in income tax cuts and Y9,400bn in public works spending and
loans and grants for business and housing.
The compromise was made possible by prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's
decision to freeze his plans for a new 7 per cent sales tax in three years'
time. It had been opposed by the Social Democratic party, the largest member
of the unstable seven-party coalition.
The size of the package and Mr Hosokawa's suspension of the sales tax bodes
well for his meeting with President Bill Clinton on Friday to discuss trade
relations. US officials had opposed an early increase in indirect taxes, for
fear it would depress consumer demand and hamper efforts to curb Japan's
record current account surplus.
However, Mr Hosokawa has had to scale back his plan, announced last week,
for a Y6,000bn annual income tax reduction, to win support from the fiscal
conservatives in his coalition. They follow the finance ministry's line that
tax cuts should be funded by indirect tax increases.
Instead, the government will make a one-off Y5,850bn income tax cut - to be
paid as an across-the-board 20 per cent tax rebate to all income tax payers
 -while it attempts to agree on the permanent tax changes by the end of the
year that Mr Hosokawa wanted. The rebate, to be paid in June and October
this year, is worth Y106,000 to the average family of four, on a Y7m annual
salary, the finance ministry estimated.
The tax cut, the largest in postwar years, will be funded by the issue of
deficit bonds, requiring special legislation. The powerful finance ministry
has fought hard against deficit financing, but compromised on the
understanding that the government will secure an agreement this year to
increase indirect taxes.
This is seen as essential to compensate for the loss of income tax revenue
already expected as Japan's population of retired people rises sharply in
the next few decades. The spending side of the package will be funded from a
mixture of existing revenue and construction bonds, which the government
issues to finance public spending on the infrastructure, and from postal
savings.
Business groups and economists welcomed the package yesterday. Private
sector forecasters predicted that it would boost gross national product from
around zero to around 1.3 per cent this year, while the government's
economic planning agency said it would add as much as 2.2 per cent to
growth.
Yesterday's pump-priming package is the fourth announced by the government
since August 1992. Most of the Y30,200bn made available in the past three
stimulus packages has already been spent.
The latest plan includes Y7,200bn of public spending on infrastructure, and
loans for house buyers, small businesses and job creation. The package also
contains plans to help banks dispose of bad loans faster, to avert fears of
a credit shortage.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Bank base rates cut to 5.25%: Upbeat view on inflation
prompts 1/4-point move - Bonds fall slightly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England signalled a surprise quarter of a percentage point cut
in UK base rates to 5.25 per cent yesterday, as it published a generally
positive report on the inflation outlook for the UK economy.
Although some analysts were taken aback by the timing of the cut, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, said that 'inflation has been lower than expected.
Looking ahead inflationary pressures appear subdued. I have concluded that
interest rates can be reduced modestly without putting at risk the inflation
target'.
Banks were quick to lower their base rates after the Bank of England
announced a new minimum lending rate, but the quarter point cut, the
smallest since 1985, will not be passed on to most homeowners. Leading
lenders such as the Halifax, Abbey National and Nationwide said they would
leave their mortgage rates, currently 7.64-7.74 per cent, unchanged.
UK companies with loans linked to base rates should see some benefit. Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the change, if
passed on in full, would be worth Pounds 250m a year to British business. Mr
Richard Brown, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce,
said: 'This step will help to settle confidence and is a move in the right
direction.'
Shares and government bonds - gilts - initially responded positively to the
news. The FT-SE 100 index rose 52.6 points to 3,440.2 by mid-morning, almost
eliminating Monday's losses, while long gilt prices rose by a point. But the
market fell back as UK traders felt the government had acted unnecessarily
and was using up its rate-cutting ammunition too quickly. The FT-SE 100
closed only 21.1 points higher at 3,440.2 and long gilts ended slightly down
on the day.
Sterling was hit by the change, falling 1 1/2 pfennigs in London from DM2.61
to DM2.595 and easing in New York to DM2.587. It fell a cent against the US
dollar to Dollars 1.47 and closed slightly lower in New York at 1.467.
The decision to cut rates was taken at the monthly monetary meeting on
February 2 between the Bank governor, Mr Eddie George, and Mr Clarke. The
timing was left to the Bank of England, which decided late last week that
the rate change should coincide with the publication of the quarterly
inflation report.
The planned April tax increases played a part in the rate cut decision. The
main factor, however, was the subdued inflationary outlook.
The Bank said its core measure of inflation, known as RPIY, which excludes
the effect of mortgage rates and indirect and local authority taxes, had
fallen to 2.3 per cent in December.
The Bank projects that RPIY will stay low - just above 2 per cent - for the
next two years, although headline inflation will rise over the next few
months as early 1993 mortgage rate cuts drop out of the index. The
government's target measure of underlying inflation, called RPIX, which
includes indirect taxes but excludes mortgage rates, will rise to reflect
Budget tax changes and is projected at just over 3 per cent by end 1995.
However the Bank says the risks to the low inflation view are 'asymmetric -
a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a fall'. In the
circumstances, a quarter point cut was seen as a prudent balance.
Analysts were divided about the merits of the change. Mr Kit Juckes,
economist at S G Warburg Securities, said there was 'precious little
economic justification for a rate cut'.
Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy
said he 'wouldn't be surprised if we see a series of cuts in Europe'.

FT  09 FEB 94 / GKN makes hostile Pounds 496m offer for Westland group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, launched a hostile
Pounds 496m takeover bid yesterday for Westland, the helicopter manufacturer
at the centre of a cabinet crisis over its ownership eight years ago.
The bid was announced after GKN said it had agreed to acquire the 18.7 per
cent stake in Westland held by United Technologies (UTC), the US parent
company of Sikorsky helicopters.
The takeover would transform GKN - which already manufactures light armoured
vehicles - from a group dominated by automotive components and industrial
services into a company led by military sales.
Sir Leslie Fletcher, Westland chairman, was informed of the move in a dawn
telephone call yesterday from Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart. Combined
with GKN's existing 28.3 per cent stake, the extra holding would give GKN 47
per cent of Westland on a fully converted basis.
Westland responded coolly, calling GKN's overture an 'unwelcome offer'. It
advised shareholders to take no action until it discussed the offer with
Schroders, its financial advisers.
The bid comes after the 1986 cabinet row which prompted the resignations of
Mr Michael Heseltine and Sir Leon Brittan, then defence and industry
secretaries.
GKN has offered Westland shareholders 290p per ordinary and preferred share,
354.8p for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all
payable in cash with a partial share alternative.
It also reassured Westland shareholders they would receive a share of any
damages won in its lengthy legal action against the Arab Organisation for
Industrialisation over an alleged breach of contract in 1980.
GKN said the bid would be funded by a one-for-five rights issue of
non-interest bearing convertible loan stock at 490p each in two equal
instalments, the second conditional on 75 per cent acceptance of the bid.
The rights would raise a net Pounds 248m, while the balance of Pounds 118m
would be financed from its own resources. GKN shares closed up 2p at 582p.
Although the 290p price represented a discount on Westland's 307p closing
price yesterday, Sir David said: 'The offer is a fair one', representing a 7
per cent premium on the average share price in January.
UTC, which has opted to take Pounds 75m in cash for its stake, said existing
licensing agreements to build Sikorsky Black Hawk and Sea King helicopters
at Yeovil would be unaffected by the deal.
Sir David warned that GKN's pre-tax profits were expected to decline by more
than 20 per cent to Pounds 97m in the year ended last December 31. It would
pay an unchanged dividend.

FT  09 FEB 94 / Tory party denies new turmoil after MP's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, JIMMY BURNS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern about the political consequences of the bizarre death of a
Conservative MP was growing among Tory backbenchers yesterday, in spite of
plans by Mr John Major to launch yet another attempt to shore up his
government's authority.
Party leaders sought to distance the government from the death on Monday of
Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, which was still being investigated by
police last night.
'I think the public will take the view that this kind of tragedy could take
place in any party, in any organisation, and will view it in that way,' said
Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party.
The circumstances of Mr Milligan's death, which were leaked by junior police
officers, prompted a flood of rumours about other MPs. MMr Milligan was
found on the floor of his west London house, bound and gagged and wearing
women's underwear.
The cause of Mr Milligan's death was unclear. A post mortem was
'inconclusive'. Scotland Yard refused to rule out murder.
Shocked Tory MPs drew comfort from the reluctance of the Labour party and
the Liberal Democrats to exploit the affair, which is being regarded by the
opposition parties as a personal matter.
Party officials hope the opposition silence will ensure that the political
impact is less damaging than other recent scandals such as the admission by
Mr Tim Yeo, a junior minister, that he had fathered a child outside
marriage.
But some Conservatives said the response to Mr Milligan's death demonstrated
the danger of the prime minister's determination to stand by his back to
basics campaign for a return to traditional values.
'The back to basics campaign is too inward looking,' said Ms Emma Nicholson,
Tory MP for Devon West. 'It has become a self-destructive slogan. I think we
should drop it.'
Downing Street said Mr Major would use a visit to Leicester to tell party
workers and regionalnewspaper editors that he is'supremely confident' about
the government's prospects.
A senior official said the prime minister 'does not share' the growing view
at Westminster that the government's authority is ebbing in the turmoil of
events. 'Turmoil? What can you be speaking of?' the official said.
Mr Major told Tory backbenchers during a series of meetings at the Commons
that the back to basics campaign would would be steered away from
personalities in future.
The government dismissed suggestions that Mr Milligan's death might have
security implications. He was parliamentary private secretary to Mr Jonathan
Aitken, the defence minister.
The defence department said Mr Milligan, who was not vetted by the security
services, had no access to classified documents.
The government is expected to announce the Eastleigh by-election will be
held on May 5 to coincide with local elections in metropolitan areas.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp faces fight over
Royal Doulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, the media, film and publishing group controlled by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, faces a legal battle with holders of its exchangeable
preference shares. This follows the announcement yesterday that they were
not entitled to Pounds 15m worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china
manufacturer which last year was demerged from Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times.
The decision contradicted a notice from News Corp, published in the
Financial Times on December 13, that holders of its preference shares,
exchangeable for shares which News Corp held in Pearson, would also get
Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right.
Yesterday, News Corp backed up its claim to the 5 1/2 m Royal Doulton shares
by saying that the Royal Doulton transaction had not caused a change in the
composition of the exchange property.
'The Royal Doulton shares would have constituted a capital distribution for
the purposes of the articles of association of the companies if certain
specified financial thresholds had been exceeded, but such financial
thresholds have not been exceeded and, accordingly, no capital distribution
has occurred,' News Corp said. It declined to comment further.
Stockbrokers in London and Hamburg said they and their clients were seeking
legal advice on whether they could make a counter-claim to the Royal Doulton
shares. They also intended to press for compensation from News Corp for any
financial losses incurred as a result of News Corp's actions since December
13.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Roussel-Uclaf beats forecast
with 33% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceuticals company which was last year taken
over by Hoechst of Germany, yesterday announced an unexpectedly strong 33
per cent increase in net income before exceptional items to FFr976.6m
(Dollars 164.41m) in 1993 from FFr734.8m in 1992.
The company had forecast a more modest increase, but fared particularly well
during December when it benefited from strong sales of antibiotics such as
Rulid and Orelox.
Roussel-Uclaf, which became a subsidiary of Hoechst last summer when it
bought a minority stake from Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals concern,
mustered sales growth of 7.3 per cent during 1993 to FFr15.89bn from
FFr14.81bn in 1992.
However, the company suffered a slight fall in overall net profits of 3.8
per cent to FFr987m from FFr1.03bn due to a reduction in capital gains.
Roussel-Uclaf made just FFr271m from capital gains during 1993, compared
with FFr676m in the previous year.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Danish bank returns to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unidanmark, the second-largest Danish banking group, reported a return to
profit in 1993 after three consecutive years in the red. Net profit was
DKr885m (Dollars 132m), compared with a loss in 1992 of DKr4.66bn and losses
in 1990 and 1991 of DKr1.09bn and DKr1.65bn respectively.
The group omitted a dividend for the second year, but announced a DKr550m
new share issue at market price and without preferential rights for existing
shareholders which should raise about DKr1.3bn.
A cut in bad loss provisions to DKr3.88bn last year from DKr6.28bn and
income from securities and foreign exchange of DKr2.56bn, compared with a
loss of DKr273m in 1992, helped the turnround.
The increase in profits from securities and foreign exchange reflected the
sharp rise in bond and share prices last year. Mr Thorleif Krarup, group
chief executive, said about DKr1.5bn of the DKr2.5bn profit under this
heading were trading profits and the rest a gain in the value of securities.
Mr Krarup was brought into the bank in the autumn of 1992 after repeated
forecasts of an improved performance were falsified. He supervised a
reduction in costs last year by 7 per cent to DKr5.99bn, including a cut in
the workforce to 10,108 people from 11,877 at the end of 1992.
The new share issue, to be marketed in Europe and the US, will increase the
bank's core capital from 7.2 per cent to 8.0 per cent and its total capital
adequacy ratio to over 12 per cent from 11.8 per cent at the end of last
year, the bank said.
The group's total assets increased to DKr242bn from DKr219bn in 1992. For
the first time for many years the group's deposits, which increased to
DKr127.4bn from DKr114.9bn in 1992, exceeded advances, which declined to
DKr125.5bn from DKr132.5bn in 1992 and a peak of DKr158bn in 1990.
Increasing competition and reduced volatility in the securities and foreign
exchange markets will have an adverse effect on profits in 1994, the bank
said, but it made no earnings forecast.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Venice, Mestre stay united
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a weekend referendum, almost 56 per cent of voters rejected a proposal to
separate the industrial town of Mestre from the Venice administration,
writes Robert Graham. It was the third abortive attempt since 1979 to force
a divorce.
The outcome means that Mestre's problems of industrial pollution and urban
regeneration can be treated as a coherent whole with those of Venice.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Car sales show slight recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales rose by 6.3 per cent to 1.029m in January
compared with the same month in 1993, according to provisional figures from
the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, writes Kevin Done.
The increase ends 12 successive monthly declines, but the scale of recovery
remains modest, as sales in January 1993 were very depressed, having fallen
23 per cent from the previous year.
New car sales fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent in the whole of 1993 to
11.45m, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period. Most industry
forecasts suggest a marginal 1-2 per cent recovery this year.
The increase in January was led by a significant rise in the UK, where new
car registrations jumped by 20 per cent year-on-year, and by rises of 15 per
cent in France and an estimated 28 per cent in Spain.
By contrast, sales declined further by 10 per cent in Italy and were
estimated to have risen by only 2 per cent in Germany, the single largest
market in Europe.

FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC hints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence and electronics giant GEC resisted the market slide for most of the
session after weekend reports that it may form a strategic link with British
Aerospace to create a powerful single UK defence contracting group.
The shares held out for much of the day before mildly succumbing to the
market trend and relinquishing 2 at 348p, after heavy trading of 10m. The
stock had been left behind and some analysts attributed the day's resilient
performance to bargain hunting.
Overall, market watchers said such a deal would be particularly good for
GEC, giving it critical mass and rationalisation benefits. There was a
suggestion that it was unlikely that GEC would put up much cash to bring
about such an alliance.
Trading in BAe was also heavy, with volume reaching 10m by the close. The
shares gave up 9 1/2 at 565 1/2 p, with the market nervous about reports
that the group is backing plans to set up a large-scale leasing operation at
Airbus Industrie to help it increase sales. BAe is a 20 per cent stakeholder
in the Airbus consortium.
The row brewing over the payment to the departing chairman was said to have
dampened sentiment.
Leading blue chip companies which are reporting their figures this week saw
their share prices hold respectably in spite of the internationally inspired
market slide.
Reuters Holdings, expected to produce profits today of about Pounds 535m,
outperformed the market with a fall of 24 to 1911p. British Petroleum, which
reports on Thursday and is forecast to produce after-tax profits of around
Pounds 290m, also outperformed with a decline limited to 3 1/2 at 378p.
Likewise, BT held up relatively well, losing only 1 per cent, against a fall
in the FT-SE 100 Index of 1.6 per cent: its results are due Thursday. The
shares closed 4 1/2 down at 463 1/2 p.
Insurer and financial services group Lloyds Abbey Life held to a fall of 2
at 444p ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures. However, cautious analysts
predict that profits could be hit by large provisions for mis-selling of
pensions.
Most analysts forecast a 12.5 per cent rise in 1993 profits to Pounds 335m,
from Pounds 297.6m previously. But Natwest Securities, which predicts only
Pounds 311m, has included a Pounds 10m provision in its estimate and an
unchanged dividend of 17.3p because of uncertainty over pension
compensation.
Lloyds Bank, which owns 62 per cent of the insurer, and is due to publish
its own figures on Friday, dipped 10 to 615p.
Abbey National rose 3 to 502p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to be a heavy
buyer.
Glaxo Holdings recovered early heavy losses on news that the US Food and
Drug Administration had granted permission for the group to sell its
Serevent asthma inhalation aerosol in the US. The shares, down 17 at one
stage, recovered to close only 2 off at 664p.
Water and electricity utilities buckled as profit-takers exacerbated the
weak market trend. Among the Recs, Midlands declined 14 to 742p. In the
water sector, Wessex weakened 16 to 724p and Yorkshire 13 to 602p.
Television stocks were firm as pressure on Granada to increase its hostile
bid for LWT kept alive prospects of further bids within the sector. Although
Granada fell 16 to 570p, LWT held at 702p, Scottish TV eased a penny to 539p
and Carlton was steady at 1013p.
Brewers fell back with the market, although volumes were equally weak.
Dealers blamed continuing worries over margins in the retail trade and the
threat of a price war. Among the worst hit, Morland slid 20 to 523p.
Turnover in Forte hit 8.4m as a block of 5m shares went through at 257p. The
stock retreated 7 to 255p.
Food manufacturers saw some punchy performances against the market trend.
Dull but worthy results from Dalgety saw the shares slip 3 to 487p. The
company said a firm showing from food ingredients and distribution and
recent acquisitions helped it report a slight rise in first-half profits to
Pounds 56.4m. Dollar considerations helped Tate &amp; Lyle climb 7 to 455p.
Bargain hunters lifted Unigate 6 1/2 to 414p after recent underperformance.
But margin worries and continuing cash call concern hit Cadbury Schweppes,
which shed 8 to 506p.
It was a similar story among stores groups, with some resilient displays
evident. Marks and Spencer rallied from an initial sharp fall to close 2
down at 419p. BZW was recommending investors to switch into the stock and
out of Kingfisher, off 5 at 637p. Pentos slipped 3 to 32p on weekend press
reports that it had requested rent reviews for some of its shops.
Dealers reported some buying among construction groups, buoyant in recent
sessions on the back of interest rate cut hopes. Among those in positive
territory yesterday, Bryant Group gained 5 at 191p after reporting
first-half profits at Pounds 14.6m, nearly double the previous period's
Pounds 7.5m. The company also made a confident trading statement.
There were also some good performances among building material groups.
Breedon added 4 at 117p.
International trading group Lonrho gave up 7 1/2 to 160p after Panmure
Gordon was said to have urged investors to sell the stock.
The slide in Far Eastern markets, where Inchcape has a large part of its
markets, weakened sentiment in the stock, which fell 15 to 572p.
The market debut of Slimma, the women's outsize clothing group, proved a
success, the shares coming to the market at 120p and closing at 141p.

FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Far East sell-off hits HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The near 10 per cent slide in the Hong Kong stock market sent related shares
in London tumbling on very high volumes as cash flooded out of the Far
Eastern markets and into the US to take advantage of higher interest rates.
The Hang Seng Index fell more then 6 per cent in official trading and 3 per
cent during London trading hours. In the UK, HSBC was the biggest casualty
in the FT-SE 100, losing 83 to 1016p in the London registered with turnover
hitting 15m, and 80 to 1037p in the Hong Kong registered on volume of 4.6m.
Meanwhile, Standard Chartered plummeted 51 to 1380p.
Caution increased as traders discovered that Nomura, the Japanese brokerage,
had cut its recommended weighting of Hong Kong stocks in its global equity
portfolio to zero from 3 per cent.

FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector saw one of its busiest days in recent sessions, with
large turnover in both the Footsie futures and traded options as a firm Wall
Street opening brought a turnround in the market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The much feared early morning crash failed to materialise and the March
futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at a reasonably controlled 3,403,
just a five-point discount to cash. Strong selling across the board, led by
the big institutions, saw March fall further, but this settled into two-way
business in late morning trading.
The anticipation, and later confirmation, of a strong performance in New
York early yesterday helped March move firmly ahead and it finished at
3,413, a five-point discount to cash, following very heavy volume of 32,573
lots by the official close.
A hectic session in the traded options brought hefty turnover of 66,805
contracts, of which 31,597 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 8,716 in
the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Hanson led the league table among the stock options with a total of 2,556
lots dealt and was followed by HSBC at 2,264 trades.
The new OMLX exchange dealing in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index futures and traded
options had a poor day. . Having opened at 4,080, the March futures closed
20 ahead at 4,100 with volume a mere 272 contracts by its 6pm close.

FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie picks up after initial
96-point setback - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that last Friday's near 2.5 per cent slide on Wall Street could have
triggered an October 1987-style slump in the London stock market were
quickly shrugged aside yesterday. A pre-emptive mark-down of share prices by
marketmakers headed off any big selling.
Nevertheless, London could not ignore the influence of Wall Street's big
fall and the FT-SE 100 Index ended a tense trading session a net 56.3, or
1.6 per cent, off at 3,419.1, well above the day's lowest levels. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index proved equally resilient, recovering strongly to settle 69.3,
or 1.7 per cent, down at 4,077.1.
The market's resilience came from a noted absence of selling pressure from
the big UK institutions and a better than expected opening by Wall Street
yesterday afternoon. Although a fresh downturn in US bonds caused a certain
amount of consternation in the market towards the close of business. UK
gilts remained under pressure, always a sign that there could be more
problems ahead for the market in the short term.
The Federal Reserve's move to lift its Fed Funds rate by  1/4 percentage
point late on Friday wrought havoc on Wall Street, which posted its biggest
one-day drop for two years and produced hefty falls throughout the Far
Eastern and European markets.
After their initial move to chop prices, the traditional response of London
marketmakers to bad news, dealers encountered very little selling from the
big institutions who, if anything, moved to buy what they considered 'cheap'
stock in many areas of the market.
After a setback of about 100 points in early unofficial trading, the FT-SE
100 officially opened almost 70 points off, the rally coming in the wake of
a mixture of 'cheap' buying and bear closing.
Mid-morning brought a period of extreme uncertainty and nervous trading as
dealers began to worry about the potential for another bout of weakness on
Wall Street when that market opened. The FT-SE 100 was trading around 87
points off but Wall Street came in steady to a shade firmer and London
subsequently gained ground in tandem with the US market, which was around 25
points better shortly after the official London close.
Second-line stocks, if anything, out-rallied the leaders, the Mid Cap
picking up from an early 120-point drop.
Equity market strategists were generally impressed by the market's
resilience. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said the market had taken
events 'in its stride', while Mr Rob Buckland at NatWest Securities
described the fall as an 'opportunity to buy cheap stock'. Mr Richard
Kersley at BZW said sector stories will now become more interesting, and
took the view that financial stocks, especially the banks, may begin to
emulate their US counterparts and start to underperform the market.
There were raised eyebrows at the level of turnover in equities, which
reached 894.1m shares, surprisingly low given the swings and big falls in
the market and reports of exceptionally heavy basket trading by one of the
big European securities houses. Non-Footsie stocks comprised 516.6m, or 58
per cent of the total.
Possibly the day's most impressive individual performance came from Slimma,
the clothing group, whose market debut could hardly have come on a more
difficult day. Nevertheless, the shares rode out the storm and ended at a
substantial 17.5 per cent premium.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as buyers return
at lower levels

Wall Street
US blue chip stocks rallied yesterday amid relief that investors had failed
to follow through on Friday's big sell-off, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.90 ahead at 3,906.32, aided by
bargain hunting and a wave of program trading. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.95 better at 471.76, even though declining
issues outnumbered advances by 1,176 to 1,021. The Nasdaq composite, after
spending most of the day in negative territory, struggled back to 779.21 for
a gain of 1.93. New York SE volume, at 348m shares, remained very heavy.
The market began the day on a defensive note after Friday's 96-point rout.
Overseas activity brought a measure of encouragement, suggesting that the
equity downturn, triggered by the first tightening of US monetary policy in
five years, was not picking up momentum.
The direction of the US Treasury market was unfavourable, however. Prices
across the maturity range declined as traders prepared for an influx of new
supply later this week and the possibility of more bad inflation news on
Friday, when the Commerce Department unveils the producer price index for
January.
Amid these crosscurrents, early activity was choppy, with the Dow bellwether
index swinging from as many as 10 points down to 12 points ahead. Near
midday, however, relief over the Dow's resilience began to dominate
sentiment. Bargain hunters were soon piling into some pivotal stocks,
including IBM, which gained Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 54 1/4 , and Walt
Disney, Dollars 1 5/8 better at Dollars 46 5/8 .
Many of the cyclical issues contributing to the market's recent rally
regained their stride. Alcoa added Dollars 2 at Dollars 78 1/8 , General
Electric Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 108 and Union Carbide Dollars 1 1/2 at
Dollars 25 5/8 . Automobile issues showed improvement, General Motors
advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 63 and Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 68
5/8 .
Financial and banking stocks, which were among the hardest hit by the
Federal Reserve's move, opened weaker but firmed as the session progressed.
JP Morgan ended Dollars  7/8 up at Dollars 69 3/8 and Bankers Trust Dollars
 1/2 ahead at Dollars 82 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq, the afternoon rally was led by Apple Computer, up Dollars 3
1/8 at Dollars 36 1/4 .
Canada
Afternoon selling whittled away a substantial morning gain in Toronto,
leaving the TSE 300 index a net 1.5 up at 4,448.7. It was more than 20
points ahead in the early afternoon, but retreated as gold shares lost 3.7
per cent on a fall in the bullion price of USDollars 6.30 an ounce. Declines
led rises by 484 to 332 after volume of 75.6m shares. Canadian Pacific rose
CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 23 5/8 on fourth-quarter results.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Signals point in opposite directions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's announcement from Mr Alan Greenspan that the Federal Reserve was
tightening US monetary policy came at the end of a week which had seen sharp
rises in world equity markets.
South Africa led the way as the political outlook improved and foreign
investors began to return. In Asia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan put in
impressive performances, as did Finland and Italy in Europe.
Developments in Washington during last week had left strategists in little
doubt that US rates were about to rise. But there were striking differences
in their views on the likely consequences and on the game plans that
investors should adopt.
On Thursday, Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson wrote: 'In the US, Alan
Greenspan could not have been clearer. He regards 3 per cent as an
excessively low interest rate which has served its purpose to eliminate the
banking crisis and alleviate the credit crunch. The Fed does not care what
headline inflation is, rates are heading higher soon.' Mr Edwards' response
was to repeat the message he has been sending since November 4: 'Hold cash.'
But at Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani thought it unlikely that the global
bull run would end when US rates began to rise: 'Evidence suggests that
individual investors are slow to react to changes in interest rates. Looking
at the last three troughs in rates, individual ownership of equities
continued to rise even after interest rates had started to rise . . .
Historically, individuals typically will only have made 10 per cent of the
total eventual adjustment to a given change in interest rates after six
months.'
Mr Wadhwani argued that individual investors had still not fully adjusted
their portfolios to the decline in interest rates that had already occurred.
Consequently, even if rates began to rise, it was likely that ownership of
equities would continue to increase over the next year.
He added that even if individual investors did not sell equities when
interest rates began to rise, share prices might, nevertheless, fall because
other investors mistakenly believed that individuals were about to sell. 'We
would view such price weakness as a buying opportunity,' he wrote, a view he
was reiterating yesterday.

<TEXT>
Share prices in Buenos Aires closed 3.6 per cent down yesterday, wiping out
nearly all the gains made last week, writes John Barham. The Merval index
finished at 680.71. Investors were unnerved by Wall Street's fall on Friday
and the government's weekend announcement that it intends to remove tax
privileges for the financial sector. This would make income on shares, bonds
and bank deposits liable to a 0.5 per cent tax. Shares have not suffered a
similar reverse since February 1993, when prices fell 6 per cent.

Johannesburg finished near to the day's lows, although selling was limited
and some late bargain hunting was seen. Golds shed 71 to 1,944, industrials
83 to 5,739 and the overall index 88 to 4,933. De Beers dropped R4.25 to
R109.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Falls in region vary as
Japan worries about tax plans
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese investors concentrated on the lack of agreement within the
coalition government, yet again, on how to finance the planned income tax
cut which is the centrepiece of its economic stimulus package, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 287.03, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,014.40 as the Topix
index of all first section stocks fell 13.36 to 1,601.44.
Traders acknowledged that Friday's fall on Wall Street due to the rise in
the Fed Funds rate was also discouraging some investors since foreigners,
especially US fund managers, were among active buyers of Japanese stocks
during the past few weeks.
The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 20,254.93 and fell on arbitrage led
selling, hitting a low of 20,012.20 in the early afternoon. Traders were
cheered by support at the 20,000 level, but some of them feared that it
could be breached if the government further delays its economic support
package.
Volume came to 300m shares, against 377m. Activity dropped sharply in the
afternoon session as investors retreated to the sidelines due to the
political situation. Declines outscored advances by 746 to 293, with 130
issues unchanged. In London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved by
3.26 to 1,328.33.
Some high-technology issues were firmer on the multimedia theme. Sony and
Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10 apiece at Y6,290 and Y1,680
respectively.
However, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10 to Y1,050 on
profit-taking and TDK shed Y140 to Y4,260.
Continued profit-taking in banks by corporate investors depressed Industrial
Bank of Japan by Y30 to Y3,100 and Sakura Bank by Y30 to Y1,490. Brokers
were also lower, with Nomura Securities ending Y10 off at Y2,260.
Issues newly introduced into the Nikkei 300 index rose ahead of the launch
of the Nikkei 300 futures contract on the Osaka stock exchange next Monday.
FamilyMart, the convenience store chain, put on Y30 at Y6,800 and Orix, the
non-banking financial institution, firmed Y10 to Y3,570.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 81.44 to 21,700.92 in volume of 57m
shares. Roundup
The region's markets reacted by widely varying amounts to the rise in US
interest rates, with those more heavily exposed to the dollar showing the
steepest declines.
Activity this week will also be influenced by closure for the Chinese new
year on Thursday. Taiwan was already closed. However, India went its own
way, upwards.
HONG KONG's domestic investors joined overseas institutions in selling which
took the Hang Seng index down by 743.30 to 11,414.27.
Turnover was HKDollars 9.67bn. The Fed Funds rate rise, said brokers, had
triggered an inevitable correction after a 60 per cent market gain in the
fourth quarter of 1993, although selling intensified in the afternoon as
Nomura, the Japanese broker, cut its weighting of Hong Kong stocks from 3
per cent to zero.
Property shares were hard hit on the thought that local mortgage interest
rates were now likely to rise. HSBC Holdings, the most active counter and
strong last week, retreated HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 124.
BANGKOK dropped 99, or 6.9 per cent, to 1,344.81, the worst fall in the
region. Turnover rose from Bt9.5bn to Bt10.9bn.
The big three banks, Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers and Krung Thai, were among
the top 10 losers, with falls of Bt9 to Bt188, Bt8 to Bt108 and Bt3.50 to
Bt57.50 respectively.
BOMBAY went against the trend as the BSE index soared 224.24 to 4,141.81,
helped, said Mr Nigel Spence of Lehman Brothers, by a flood of both foreign
and domestic money and expectations of further economic liberalisation
measures in the budget, due later this month.
SEOUL was affected by the introduction of government measures to cool the
market's recent rally, and the composite index slipped 27.72 to 914.88.
The three most heavily capitalised stocks, Samsung Electronics, steel
manufacturer Posco and Hyundai Motor, went the day's limit down at the
opening, but recovered a little later. Samsung and Posco ended Won2,000 off
at Won65,000 and Won58,500 respectively and Hyundai shed Won1,600 to
Won39,200.
MANILA was unsettled by a general strike called for tomorrow to protest at
the recent increase in prices of oil, electricity and transport fares.
The composite index declined 74.44 to 2,890.94 in turnover of 990.4m pesos,
down from Friday's 2.5bn pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which lost 12.50 cents to Dollars 75.50
in New York trading on Friday, fell 40 pesos to 2,105 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR registered its largest one-day fall since January 12, the
composite index losing 53.30 at 1,094.02.
AUSTRALIA saw an early drop reduced by bargain hunting, leaving the All
Ordinaries index down a net 51.7 at 2,281.1. Turnover was ADollars 600.2m.
BHP shed 34 cents at ADollars 18.92 and News Corp 32 cents at ADollars
10.08.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses follow the
transatlantic trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses found it difficult to detach from Wall Street after an
initial fall on Friday's transatlantic losses. Their task was made no easier
by conflicting advice from investment strategists, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT followed the Dow, the Dax index closing the session 58.85, or 2.75
per cent lower at 2,079.4, dropping another 10 points after hours and
closing the post bourse with a partial recovery and the Ibis-indicated Dax
at 2,095.11.
Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM10.8bn. Financials lost out on interest
rates, Dresdner Bank falling DM19.80, or 4.7 per cent to DM405.20; but
Deutsche Bank recovered from DM792.50, down DM26.50 at the close to DM806 at
the conclusion of the post-bourse. BMW, still supported by the Rover deal,
actually managed a token rise of DM3.50 to DM770 at the end of the day.
PARIS dipped sharply at the opening but found its feet later on with brokers
reporting that the selling was led by retail investors, as institutions
remained largely absent.
The CAC-40 index finished down 42.11 at 2,287.06, off the low of 2,258.60.
Traders remained unperturbed by the rise in US interest rates, and noted
that the Dow's resilience at yesterday's opening provided a support to
trading in the afternoon.
Promodes, the retailing group, stood out with a gain of FFr17 to FFr1,135,
almost alone among CAC-40 stocks in showing a rise. James Capel put out a
hold note yesterday, following the company's recent turnover data which
showed a rise of some 7 per cent, and ahead of the 1993 profit figures due
early next month. Capel expects the latter to show an increase of 26 per
cent, leading to an eps of FFr40.30.
ZURICH saw heavy selling by traders and speculators while institutional
investors were largely inactive. The SMI index shed 76.8 to 3,089.8 as the
day's events prompted some speculation that the market, which has risen
steadily in recent months, could at last be facing a short-term correction
of 5 per cent or more.
Among banks UBS lost SFr24 to SFr1,489, SBC shed SFr11 to SFr514 and CS
Holding dipped SFr21 to SFr739.
AMSTERDAM lost ground but closed off the session low as some bargain hunting
emerged. The AEX index finished off 5.30 at 205.60.
KLM featured with a less than average 50 cents fall to Fl 51.50. Investors
have become more positive about the group recently while Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its buy recommendation at the end of last week.
MILAN's loss was limited to 1 per cent after some short covering towards the
end of the day and the Comit index fell 6.82 to 664.88.
BCI, due to be privatised later this month, rose another L51 to L5,291.
Falck, the steelmaker, climbed L514 or 10 per cent to L5,633, after Friday's
announcement that a shareholders syndicate, formed in December 1991, would
not continue after June.
Alitalia soared L223 or 18.6 per cent to L1,419 on recent management change
and on talks with other airlines.
MADRID saw heavy selling and the general index closed 7.30 lower at 349.17
in turnover up from Pta43.8bn to Pta59bn.
In a weak construction sector, Huarte lost Pta145, or 6.1 per cent at
Pta2,215. In banks, Santander, which said over the weekend that it was
considering a bid for the troubled Banesto, fell Pta130 to Pta7,190. Banesto
itself ended Pta 54, or 6.75 per cent down at Pta750.
BRUSSELS dropped by just under 3 per cent at worst, but a mere 15 basis
points cut in base rate stopped the slide in its tracks. After a flurry of
Bel-20 basket buying near the close the index recovered to end only 1.64
down at 1,527.11.
VIENNA picked up from the day's lows, limiting the sesion's loss to 1.1 per
cent in low turnover as investors awaited the outcome of last night's Wall
Street performance. The ATX index finished 13.43 lower at 1,192.64.
HELSINKI suffered in the banking and forestry sectors, down 2 per cent and 1
per cent respectively, as the Hex index lost 72.6 to 1,899.3. COPENHAGEN
eased in good turnover, while Unidanmark slipped DKr10 to DKr229 in spite of
reporting its first profit since its formation in 1990. The KFX index lost
1.31 to 115.00.
WARSAW bounced 8.5 per cent higher as local investors, with few other
investment opportunities, returned to the market after the sharp losses of
the previous three sessions. The WIG index added 1,266 to 16,137.5.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Little dollar movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was a day of consolidation in foreign exchange markets following
Friday's excitement when a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal
Reserve caused a sharp rise in the dollar, writes Philip Gawith.
Expectations of further dollar gains against the D-Mark were not realised
and the US currency ended trading in London at levels similar to those
reached in after-hours' activity on Friday evening. Against the yen it
weakened slightly from late Friday levels. As one observer noted: 'With all
of the market looking in one direction - expecting the dollar to rise - not
much happened.'
The market was uncertain about the pace and extent of future rate movements
in the US. Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has a reputation as a gradualist
and thus most observers expect further small increases, with the Federal
Funds rate ending the year at 3.75 per cent or 4 per cent.
Explaining the dollar's fairly sedate performance after some profit-taking
during Asian trading, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of
America, commented: 'The trend has changed, but the gradient of change looks
like it is still going to be very shallow. So it is positive for the dollar,
but not positive enough to give the dollar much of a kick, so long as German
rates remain unchanged.'
The US currency ended in London at DM1.7630 - the level at which it was
trading late on Friday evening, but higher than the close of DM1.736. It
finished against the yen at Y108.7050 after trading in a narrow range all
day. In New York last night it closed at DM1.7586 and Y108.60.
The D-Mark was under pressure yesterday, finishing lower against most other
European currencies.
Attention today will be focused on the repo announcement from the
Bundesbank. If the central bank allows a variable rate tender, following a
period of fixed rate tenders at 6 per cent, this will be taken as a signal
that it is happy to sanction a softening of interest rates. Given the
chance, the market would certainly try to drive rates lower. But any fall in
the repo rate will be small, as the repo rate, at 6 per cent, is only 25
basis points above the discount rate, which acts as a floor for official
German rates. However, the symbolic message that rates were on their way
down would be a powerful one.
Although the weak state of the German economy favours a cut in rates, the
Bundesbank might not want to ease policy against the background of a weak
currency.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, comments:
'There is a belief now in the market that the Bundesbank has got itself into
a bit of a hole. It had various opportunities to cut rates which it passed
up, and now it is going to be more difficult.'
Mr Austin said it was not clear that keeping rates high now would help the
currency. The recent history of the ERM suggests high rates have been
ineffective in supporting a currency perceived by the market as weak. Most
analysts argue that the market is more interested in measures aimed at
stimulating growth.
Few, however, are confident that the Bundesbank shares this view. Indeed, Mr
Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank chief economist, said in Washington yesterday
that the Bundesbank might hold off lowering interest rates at least until
regional elections in mid-March, and could even raise rates temporarily if
the D-Mark were to weaken too much. 'I would not fully exclude the
possibility that the Bundesbank will increase short-term rates,' said Mr
Walter.
Yesterday, Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, speaking in his capacity
as the G10 central bank governors' chairman, said G10 central bankers were
not troubled by developments on foreign exchange markets following the US
Fed's tightening of policy on Friday.
'Until now there is not much concern about the situation (on forex
markets),' Mr Tietmeyer told reporters after the monthly meeting of G10
central bank governors in Basle.
The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.62 to the D-Mark, down three centimes over
the day, after the Belgian central bank trimmed interest rates. The Belgian
National Bank cut its key central rate by 15 basis points to 6.70 per cent.
The central rate is now at its lowest since July 2, when it was set at 6.70
per cent: the central bank later had to raise interest rates because of the
ERM currency crisis in late July. Belgium's central rate was last reduced a
week ago. Observers said yesterday's move was further evidence of EMS
currencies decoupling interest rate policy from the Bundesbank when
conditions allowed.
Sterling had a fairly quiet day, trading around the DM2.61 level against a
generally weak German currency. It closed at Dollars 1.4811 against the
dollar, having moved in a fairly narrow range all day. Consumer credit news
showing net lending up to Pounds 433m, against a Pounds 290m forecast, lent
support to the view that the UK economic recovery is proceeding apace and
hence that no rate cut is imminent.
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 650m of
assistance yesterday. This was in line with its revised forecast of the
liquidity shortage, adjusted upwards from its early estimate of a Pounds
500m shortfall.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold seen struggling to top
Dollars 400 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold's price would find it very difficult to move above Dollars 400 a troy
ounce, Mr Peter Munk, chairman of American Barrick Resources, one of North
America's biggest gold producers, said yesterday.
But neither did he expect the price to drop below Dollars 200. Gold would
trade in 'a steady, stable, profitable range like most commodities,' he told
analysts and institutional investors in London.
Earlier Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's president, reported that the group's hedging
policy ensured it would receive more than Dollars 400 an ounce for its
output for the next two years while retaining the flexibility to take some
of the gains should the price go above that level. The London gold price
closed last night at Dollars 384.70 an ounce.
Barrick produced 1.632m ounces of gold last year and had set targets of 1.8m
for 1994 and 2m for 1995, said Mr Smith during the company's annual European
'road show'.
Mr Munk recalled that Barrick was set up only 10 years ago to become a
'pure' gold company operating solely in North America. Today it was North
America's most profitable gold producer and owner of the continent's biggest
gold reserves.
Now Barrick intended to use its 'balance sheet, track record, credibility'
and its North American know-how and technology to expand internationally
while continuing to focus only on gold. 'We will become as dominant
internationally as we have become in North America,' Mr Munk promised.
Mr Smith said that the international drive was gaining momentum with
activities in Mexico, Chile, Peru and China. American Barrick was looking
for opportunities elsewhere in the world and was willing to make strategic
investments in two or three exploration companies that had assembled land
positions in areas of interest to the company but where it had no
exploration teams of its own.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian output cut bolsters
aluminium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Reports of the first output cut by a Russian aluminium smelter and that a
second Australian smelter was to reduce production immediately helped the
metal's price move up again yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.
Sentiment was also helped by Mr Vladimir Kalchenko, first deputy director of
Concern Aluminiy, the producers' association, who told the Reuter news
agency in Moscow that the Russian government had ways of forcing reluctant
smelters to make cuts. Some analysts and at least one Russian industry
official have cast doubt on the republic's ability to live up to its
undertaking to help restore the aluminium market to balance by reducing its
annual aluminium production by 500,000 tonnes.
He also said that the 200,000-tonne Novokunznetsk smelter in Siberia had
closed some operations for modernisation and this would trim its annual
output by 20,000 tonnes.
Reuter also reported that, elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, Tajikistan's aluminium smelter said it would shut down completely
last night unless it received essential raw materials held up at the border
with Uzbekistan, another CIS republic, which claimed that it was owed money
for earlier shipments. The Tajik smelter is one of the biggest in the world
with an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes. But analysts believe it produced
only 280,000 tonnes last year.
Laurie Morse in Chicago writes: Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium
producer, announced yesterday that it would reduce its primary aluminium
output in the US by 100,000 tonnes a year.
The cuts follow last week's international trade agreement in Brussels that
aims to reduce world aluminium output by at least 1.5m tonnes by year-end in
an effort to bolster historically low prices. In June Alcoa slashed US
production by 25 per cent, or 268,000 tonnes.
The latest cuts, which the company said would be take effect immediately,
bring Alcoa's total reductions over the past year to 308,000 tonnes.
The reductions will be at Alcoa's Rockdale, Texas, facility, where it has
already closed an aluminium rod plant, and at its operations in Wenatchee,
Washington, where electric power prices have been increasing.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minerals sector needs to woo
foreign capital - Most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HUMPHREYS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opening the school of mines in St Petersburg in 1719, Peter the Great
proclaimed: 'Our Russian state, in comparison with many other foreign
countries, is blessed with all necessary metals and minerals'. This
perception of Russia as a treasure house of minerals persisted until
recently. It was encouraged both by a communist regime that saw
self-sufficiency in raw materials as an important element in the nation's
capacity for self-determination and by conservative hawks in the West who
used the notion to dramatise the dangers of Soviet infiltration in other
mineral-rich parts of the world, notably southern Africa.
Since the opening up of Russia to the West the existence of substantial
economic deposits of oil and gas has been confirmed. For metals, however,
the evidence is far less clear. Moreover, some of the resources that do
exist are in remote eastern regions that lack the infrastructure to permit
the establishment of viable mining activities.
What is clear is that most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful
state. Grades at copper, lead and zinc mines are well below those in the
West; the mineral from which aluminium is produced is of a quality that
would not be used elsewhere; and the alluvial gold deposits of the far
eastern region, long the mainstay of Soviet production, are largely worked
out. Nickel alone appears to be mined from a deposit of genuine world class,
that at Norilsk, in the far north.
Throughout the industry under-investment has left operations with inadequate
equipment, very low productivity and primitive environment protection
practices.
These problems are being added to daily by increases in energy and transport
costs and by a breakdown in the payments system. In consequence, between
1989 and 1993 the country's production of copper fell by about 22 per cent,
of zinc by 27 per cent and of nickel by 48 per cent.
One option available to Russia is to focus its reconstruction efforts on
downstream manufacturing activities. But this would be unwise for three
reasons: first, bad as the condition of of the mining industry is, the sad
fact is that this is one of the healthier industrial sectors; second, metals
are important export items (second only to oil and gas) and for the
foreseeable future Russia will have precious little else to sell.
And finally, attempts to compete in manufacturing will pitch Russia into
direct competition with the low-wage economies of the Far East and the more
strategically located countries of Europe.
To develop Russia's mining industry will require capital, and capital is one
thing Russia does not have. One answer is to turn to foreign investors. But
although in their public statements the Russian authorities appear
favourable to foreign investment, in practice they are more ambivalent.
There remains a deep-rooted suspicion of the motives of foreigners and a
fear of under-selling the country's mineral wealth. To the extent that a
role is seen for foreign companies, it is frequently in the development of
deposits of too low a grade of too complex for local companies. The
successes of the nationalists in the December parliamentary elections can
only reinforce these tendencies.
No country is obliged to accept foreign investors on its soil, but if Russia
really is interested in involving foreign capital in major mining
development there are issues that it needs to address:
Greater openness is needed. Before all else, western companies have to be
convinced that there is something worth investing in. At present, however,
they are only able to visit selected sites by invitation or work from lists
containing limited detail.
Clarification is required on how jurisdiction over mineral resources is to
be divided between the centre and the regions. While Moscow was preoccupied
with the battle between President Yeltsin and the parliament, many regions
took the opportunity to assert sovereignty over resources within their
borders. The new constitution appears to reverse this tendency, but the need
for clarification remains.
Finally, greater realism needs to be displayed in the legal and fiscal
conditions for foreign investment. Western mining companies will need to be
able to assure their shareholders that they will see a return on their
money. Much Russian legislation on resources has been framed with oil and
gas in mind and is inappropriate for hard minerals. For instance, the
typical demand for a 20 per cent royalty on revenue from gold mining in
addition to a 35 per cent tax on profits, could easily translate into and
effective tax rate of over 100 per cent of profits.
Russia has been edging towards a new role in a competitive world economy. In
this economy, countries wanting inward investment have to compete for it,
just as companies have to compete for good investment opportunities.
Unfortunately, years of isolation have left Russia without an adequate basis
for international comparison and have permitted the perpetuation of myths
about its mineral wealth.
Russia is not a special case. It may have extensive mineral deposits, but
these are of little value without the capital to get them out.
In the world that Russia is joining, capital does not come without
capitalists.
David Humphreys is deputy chief economist at the RTZ Corporation. His
monograph 'Mining and Metals in the CIS': Between Autarky and Integration'
is published today by the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and nickel remain in
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net imports from the former eastern bloc countries helped to keep the
western lead and nickel markets in supply surpluses last year, though at
reduced levels.
Imports of eastern-bloc nickel reached a record 135,000 tonnes, representing
more than 20 per cent of western consumption, according to statistics from
the International Nickel Study Group. That reversed 1992's deline from
128,000 tonnes to 121,000.
In spite of the resurgence of exports from the former eastern block the
nickel market's supply surplus fell from 70,000 to 39,000 tonnes, the study
group estimates. This was because consumption in the west rose by nearly 4
per cent, from 627,000 to 652,000 tonnes, while western producers cut back
output by 3.5 per cent, from 576,000 to 556,000 tonnes.
Western nickel mine output last year was down 4 per cent, from 613,700 to
588,700 tonnes, the study group reports.
Meanwhile, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group estimates that lead
mine output in the western world dropped in 1993 to its lowest level in 30
years.
Canada bore the brunt of the cuts and the suspension of production at
Curragh Resources' Yukon mines contributed to a drop of 47 per cent in that
country's lead mine output.
Western lead mine production totalled 2.034m tonnes last year, a fall of
265,000 tonnes or 11.5 per cent from 1992. The study group says the fall in
mine output caused absorption of some of the very large surplus stocks of
lead concentrate (an intermediate material) that accumulated in 1990 and
1991. This is expected to influence trade patterns with eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union this year, reducing the flow of concentrate for toll
smelting in those regions.
Last year net imports of refined lead from the former eastern bloc countries
slipped from 169,000 to 135,000 tonnes, helping to cut the west's supply
surplus from 154,000 tonnes to 84,000 tonnes.
The western lead industry compensated for eastern imports by cutting back
refined metal output, by 1 per cent to 4.397m tonnes. Meanwhile, consumption
moved up by 0.6 per cent to 4.483m tonnes. Stocks rose by 61,000 tonnes to
653,000 tonnes by the year-end, equivalent to 7.6 weeks' consumption.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, would not change its
production plans to compensate for Dollars 207m losses on futures trading,
said Mr Alejandro Noemi, who resigned as president at the weekend.
The plans aimed to give it maximum output without damaging its long-term
viability and this would not be put at risk by a boost in output for two or
three months, he added.
An interim report into the losses concluded that failure to implement
controls had allowed Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the chief futures trader, to
mount more than 5,000 operations in the four months from September 1993 that
caused losses of Dollars 164m on copper futures, Dollars 30.6m on silver and
Dollars 12.1m on gold.
Codelco confirmed that Mr Davila put details of transactions into his
computer incorrectly last September. Failure of controls had allowed him to
start a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: US rate hike takes the 'froth' off
European bond markets

US and European bond markets fell sharply in the wake of Friday's quarter
point hike in US interest rates.
However, dealers in Europe said activity was concentrated in the futures
market, and selling in the cash market was controlled. By the end of the
day, prices had steadied, and most markets appeared to have consolidated at
lower levels.
'European markets had been rallying strongly so far this year, and traders
took advantage of the US move to take some of the froth out of the market,'
one trader said.
UK gilts opened sharply lower, and lost further ground when the US market
opened weaker. But by the end of trading, prices had recovered to Monday's
opening levels.
The March long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 116 17/32 , down  3/4
point on Friday's close, but little changed on the day. Although the UK is
generally seen as lagging the US economic cycle by six months, it is ahead
of the rest of Europe, so the advent of higher rates in the US reinforced
expectations that the UK interest rate cycle will turn later this year.
'Over the medium term interest rates are going up - and that makes playing
the yield curve much more dangerous,' said Mr John Kendall, an economist at
Baring Brothers.
The market showed little reaction to the release of stronger consumer credit
data for December, which underlined the fact that economic recovery is
gaining ground. A modest upturn in the level of pay settlements according to
the latest survey by Incomes Data Services, the information and research
organisation, also pointed to potential inflation problems.
However, next week's inflation data is expected to show inflation under
control.
It was a bad day across the Continent for government bond markets yesterday,
but continuing hopes of interest rate cuts in Europe helped many to end
above the day's worst levels.
In Germany, the long end suffered more than the short end, with yields on
eight-year paper rising 12 basis points to 5.92 per cent and yields on
10-year bunds rising seven basis points to 5.84 per cent. Yields on two-year
paper rose seven basis points to 5.24 per cent.
'There has been a general shift up the curve due to the weakness in US
Treasuries and supply concerns,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist
at Kleinwort Benson.
He added, however, that the market had found some comfort in comments by Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank and the Group of 10
central bank governors' chairman, that G-10 central bankers were not very
concerned about the situation on foreign exchange markets following the
Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments pushed up the March three-month Euro D-Mark contract
from an opening level of 94.26 to 94.32 by the late afternoon.
There were also glimmers of hope that the Bundesbank would announce a return
to variable rate pacts this week which would enable the market to nudge the
repo rate lower. However, some dealers believed that the Bundesbank would
put off any cuts in official rates until early March.
By the late afternoon, the March bund future on Liffe stood at 99.11 after a
heavy day's trading, down 0.39 point on the day but off the day's low of
98.82.
News that the Belgian National Bank cut its central rate to 6.70 per cent
from 6.85 per cent helped French government bonds to make a late recovery on
hopes that the newly independent Bank of France would cut its interest rates
at its council meeting this week. A firm French franc also underpinned the
market.
Analysts said the weakness of the French economy and the fall in money
supply growth justified an interest rate cut from 'la Bubette', as the
French central bank is now affectionately known in the market.
Italian government bonds rebounded from the day's lows as investors were
attracted by their high yields. After hitting a low of 117.20, the March
contract on Liffe recovered to 118.19 in late trading, up 0.09 point on the
day.
The Japanese government bond market was the only sizeable market able to
remain immune from the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike. The market
ended the day little changed.
In Japan, machinations over the fiscal package continued to dominate
traders' attention. The latest expectations are for an agreement to be
reached today and a new budget plan to be drawn up on Wednesday. However,
expectations have been disappointed before, and the market remains
sceptical.
Dealers said that another reason for the ability of the Japanese market to
decouple itself from outside forces is that, unlike other markets, it has
lost substantial ground in recent weeks, due to concerns about supply.
Consequently, traders were not looking for an excuse to take profits, said
one economist.
The US Treasury market yesterday failed to bounce back from a big sell-off
on Friday, when a sharp decline was triggered by the Federal Reserve's
decision to tighten monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  11/32 lower
at 98 7/32 , with the yield rising about 4 basis points to 6.38 per cent. At
the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/32 , to yield 4.40
per cent.
In early trading, selling pressure was most intense in longer-dated
securities, which sank only about a half a point in the wake of the Fed's
surprise announcement last week that its policy-making arm had voted to lift
short-term interest rates.
But prices stablised by midday, and climbed off their session lows in the
afternoon.
This week's influx of new supply was contributing to the market's continued
weakness. The Treasury is scheduled to auction Dollars 17bn in three-year
notes today and Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes tomorrow.
But it was the Dollars 11bn sale of 30-year bonds on Thursday that was
generating the most concern yesterday. The auction will come a day ahead of
the release of January's producer price index, the next milestone in
charting inflationary pressures which could undermine the long bond's value
and influence the timing of a further tightening by the Fed.
The PPI outlook is bearish, with forecasts centred on a 0.4 per cent jump in
the overall index, and a 0.3 per cent gain after excluding energy and food
prices, which tend to be most volatile.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Bonds: UK building society issues Pounds 500m
FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Halifax Building Society dominated new issue activity in the
international bond market with the launch of its Pounds 500m five-year
floating-rate note yesterday, against considerable uncertainty regarding
interest rate movements in the US and Europe.
Dealers said the US Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in short-term
interest rates on Friday had unsettled the Eurobond and government bond
markets, putting a temporary halt on new issue activity and leading to a
decline in bond prices in the secondary market (although spreads over the
government bond markets were little changed overall).
However, with the financial markets in such a volatile condition, some
syndicate officials regarded the decision by the Halifax to launch a FRN as
a shrewd move. The Pounds 500m, five-year bonds carry a coupon of
three-month Libor (currently at 5.5 per cent) and yielded an additional 6.5
basis points at the re-offer price of 99.72.
Halifax yesterday called in its existing Pounds 150m FRN which was due to
mature in 1996 and which had a minimum coupon of 5 per cent. In recent weeks
it has called in two other FRN issues, taking the total amount called in to
Pounds 500m. Yesterday's new FRN issue was intended to replace those three
bond issues without the 5 per cent minimum coupon, syndicate officials said.
Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg, joint lead managers, pointed out that the new
deal would provide FRN investors with a large liquid issue, given that
Halifax and Denmark now have the two largest FRN issues in the market.
However, other FRN experts said the large size and difficult market
conditions meant that the bonds were taking quite a while to place, and some
of the less enthusiastic syndicate members were seen offering the bonds at
below the reissue price to offload them.
Even so, most market participants thought the bonds were priced fairly,
given the Halifax's AA1/AA credit rating. 'The pricing is right, but the
size means it could take a while to place and we're sceptical as to whether
there is enough demand to do Pounds 500m. However, FRNs do best when people
are beginning to think that interest rates will go back up,' said one
veteran of the sterling sector.
Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in south-east Asia, yesterday launched a
Dollars 400m, 10-year convertible bond issue due to be priced next week.
Morgan Stanley, lead manager for the issue, has indicated a coupon of 3-3
1/4 per cent and a conversion premium of 23-26 per cent. Although there has
been a slew of new convertible bond issues in recent months, market
participants said that Bangkok Bank stands out as a relatively strong name.
Moody's Investors Service may cut Venezuela's Ba-1 long-term ratings and
Ba-2 rating for its par and discount bonds and floating rate notes, Reuter
reports. Moody's said the action reflects the deterioration of Venezuela's
economic fundamentals, a worsening of its public finances, the crisis in the
country's financial sector and the increasing political instability and
uncertainty.

investing in Asia

<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, the US investor and speculator, yesterday joined Peregrine
Investments, a Hong Kong-based merchant bank, in the launch of a Dollars 1bn
fund to invest in Asian infrastructure projects.
This is the second fund in less than two weeks with which Mr Soros, who
helped force sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992,
has been associated.
At the end of January he partnered GE Capital, the financial services arm of
America's General Electric, in arranging a Dollars 2.5bn fund to invest in
power projects in the developing world.
The Asian Infrastructure Fund will invest in power generation, transport
projects and telecommunications systems in Asia and the Indian
sub-continent. Peregrine said the fund had already identified potential
investments worth Dollars 300m in China, India, Indonesia and three other
countries.
Mr Soros' partnership with Peregrine is a compliment to Mr Philip Tose,
Peregrine's founder and chairman, who has built the brokerage into one of
the most powerful forces in Hong Kong's and China's financial community.
In addition to Mr Soros, who manages the Quantum Group of funds, the
International Finance Corporation, the private finance arm of the World
Bank, the Asia Development Bank, the Manila-based multilateral bank, and
Frank Russell Company, a financial adviser, will contribute to the Dollars
400m to be raised for the fund.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Del Monte Royal Foods beats
first-year forecast with R208m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Del Monte Royal Foods, established in October 1992 with the acquisition by
Anglo American and the Imerman family of Del Monte Foods International
(DMFI), has beaten maiden profit forecasts in reporting distributable profit
of R208.5m (Dollars 60.9m) equivalent to 61 cents a share, and declaring a
21 cents a share total dividend.
At the time of the acquisition, the group estimated first-year earnings of
60.1 cents a share and a total payout of 20 cents. Previous year figures are
not comparable as they pre-date the transaction, but the group - owner of
the Del Monte brand in Africa, the Middle East and Europe - bettered its
forecasts only through unexpected reductions in its interest bill and tax
liability.
Mr Vivian Imerman, chairman, said a South African Reserve Bank ruling
prevented disclosure of company details in the past year, but he hoped the
release of new information would bolster the group's stock market rating in
London and Johannesburg. He said the key to future earnings growth would be
the development of new Del Monte and private label products, licensing
agreements, and new market penetration in Europe and Asia.
Adverse currency movements, particularly the devaluation of the Italian
lira, and tough trading conditions associated with recession in Europe,
responsible for 80 per cent of sales, depressed turnover which at R1.28bn
compared with a forecast R1.82bn. Mr Enrico Sola, chief executive officer,
said consumer spending was on the slide in most of the group's main markets.
However, Mr Sola said Del Monte had maintained its share of the premium
brand market, without cutting prices, as the proliferation of cheap brands
and private label lines affected rival products. Pre-tax profit stood at
R233.3m, well below the forecast R331.5m.
Net interest payments of R32.2m were half the group's forecast reflecting
lower interest rates in Europe and South Africa as well as a windfall gain
from the strengthening of the financial rand through which DMFI was
acquired, against sterling. The exchange rate gain cut the payment price by
R192m to improve the debt-to-equity ratio and lower finance charges.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Samancor sharply up at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samancor, the Gencor-owned South African ferro-alloys producer, has
surprised the market by reporting unexpectedly good results in the half-year
to end-December. Pre-tax profit before abnormal items jumped 58 per cent to
R175m (Dollars 51m) against R111m a year earlier.
A 25 cents interim dividend is declared, up from 20 cents last year. The
group's shares have doubled in value since February 1993, climbing 400 cents
in the past month to R34 at yesterday's market close.
Mr Mike Salamon, managing director, said the performance contrasted with
'miserable' demand in real terms for the group's products in most of its
markets. He was confident Samancor would match first-half earnings in the
second six months although he was no more than 'vaguely warm' about
commodity prices improving from late-1994.
The rand's weakness against the dollar and improved manganese alloy sales
volumes bolstered turnover to R971.2m from R930.9m, although prices for the
group's output fell across the board. Mr Salamon said ore and alloy markets
were still blighted by a flood of cheap material from the former Soviet
Union and China, added to poor demand in re-cession-hit Europe and Japan.
A turnround at the chrome division, which suffered large job cuts in
1992-93, was the main contributor to the group's improved operating
performance, with extra benefit derived from the conversion of idle
ferrochrome furnaces to silicomanganese and ferromanganese production.
Abnormal receipts stemming from an export allowance settlement and asset
sales lifted overall pre-tax profit to R214.4m from R71.4m.
A return to a tax-paying position and reduced income from associates curbed
the rise in distributable profit to R164.2m from R110.8m.

project

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peabody Resources, part of the British Hanson group, yesterday announced
that it has raised its stake in the Warkworth coal joint venture in New
South Wales, from 28.75 per cent to 43.75 per cent.
The original Warkworth interest was acquired by Peabody when it purchased
the Australian coal mining interests of Costain, the British construction
group, last year for about USDollars 200m.
The joint venture controls around 234m tonnes of recoverable opencast coal
reserves and sizeable underground reserves in New South Wales. It produces
2.8m tonnes a year of metallurgical and steaming coal, mainly for export to
Pacific Rim customers.
Peabody, which is the manager of the Warkworth operation, bought its
additional stake from the Westpac staff superannuation plan, and both sides
declined to disclose the price. Other partners in the joint venture include
Mitsubishi Development, Mitsubishi Materials, Minproc Energy and Nippon
Steel.
The increased interest comes hard on the heels of an unfavourable outcome
for the coal industry in its annual negotiations with the Japanese steel
mills.
Under competitive pressure from other suppliers and faced with lower demand
from Japan, Australian producers accepted larger-than-expected price cuts
and reduced tonnages. A series of 24-hour mine stoppages, called by the
United Mine Workers' union in protest at the outcome of the negotiations, is
due to start tonight.

Daishowa Paper, the debt-laden Japanese paper company, has replaced Mr
Kiminori Saito with Mr Shogo Nakano as president, bringing to an end the
company's 56-year rule by the Saito family.
The move follows pressure from the company's main creditor banks, which have
been reluctant to accept Daishowa's restructuring plan until it removed the
family's influence. Daishowa's investments grew rapidly during the 1980s
under Mr Ryoei Saito, the controversial honorary chairman.
Daishowa has been trying to work out a rehabilitation plan acceptable to its

Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment
company Citic, is to pay HKDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 440m) for a 50 per cent
stake in Discovery Bay, a self-contained community on one of Hong Kong's
outlying islands which is home to some 9,500 of the colony's local and
expatriate citizens.
The deal, which sees Citic buying up 50 per cent of Hong Kong Resort Company
 -the group which owns and manages Discovery Bay, on the north-eastern coast
of Lantau Island - from parent HKR International, gives further substance to
Citic's already impressive portfolio. Other acquisitions include 12 per cent
of Hongkong Telecom and 12 per cent of Cathay Pacific.
An additional payment of up to HKDollars 150m will be paid by Citic to
acquire the balance of assets in the holding company, after agreed assets
have been stripped out.
HKR International, which retains 50 per cent of Discovery Bay, will continue
to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the development.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P warns Japanese banks over
bad loan write-offs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Until Japanese banks come to terms with their asset quality problems, the
country's stock markets will not show a sustainable recovery, warned
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, in a report
released yesterday on the banks' approach on writing off bad loans.
Compared with their US and Australian counterparts, Japanese banks have been
slow in writing off problem loans due to a lack of tax incentives. Although
the agency says the acceleration of write-offs would not affect ratings, it
warned that the difficulty in assessing the ultimate loss of the gradual
write-off procedure would affect investor confidence.
The mounting speculation about the actual size of the bad debt burden of
Japanese banks has added to the scepticism, which has weighed down on the
banks' share prices. They will find themselves in a vicious circle since a
weak stock market limits their ability to rely on hidden reserves to help
absorb losses stemming from clearing their balance sheets of problem loans.
But an acceleration of the write-off process by banks will be welcomed by
stock market investors, supporting share prices and lifting the operating
flexibility of the banks. This will in turn improve the overall business
climate while allowing banks to spend less management time on resolving past
mistakes.
Hyogo Bank, which is based in western Japan, announced a 10-year rescue plan
for its troubled 10 affiliated non-bank financial companies.
Hyogo, itself undergoing financial restructuring, will waive interest
payments by the affiliates, increasing its burden by Y7.2bn to Y11.7bn
(Dollars 108m). By raising its own commitment, the bank wants to persuade
other creditors of the 10 financial affiliates, including life assurers and
banks, to cut interest rates on loans to 2 per cent, relieving the
affiliates' interest payments by Y37bn.

<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Board of India is seeking additional powers to
regulate the country's fast-growing capital markets.
Mr SS Nadkarni, the board's new chairman, said yesterday that amendments to
legislation were proposed 'to give more teeth' to the market watchdog.
The board, which has gained considerable authority in recent years, remains
worried about malpractice. There has been a flood of allegations of insider
trading by corporate managements seeking to rig share prices before
flotations.
Proposals for strengthening the board's market surveillance will be welcomed
by foreign investors, who have stepped up purchases of Indian shares.
Foreign institutions invested Dollars 275m in January, lifting the total to
Dollars l2bn since the government opened the doors a year ago.
Mr Nadkarni distanced himself from his predecessor, Mr GV Ramakrishna, on
the issue of abolishing badla - the carry-forward facility for shares. 'We
want a transparent system,' he said. The board will reconsider its plan to
ban badla if there is total segregation of transactions for carry forward
and delivery of shares.
Anticipating the change in the board's stance, traders on the Bombay Stock
Exchange drove up share prices by 227 points or 5.8 per cent to a two-year
peak of 4,144 yesterday.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chile groups trek the ADR path -
Companies are queueing to make foreign issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirteen Chilean companies, including energy, telecommunications and wine
groups, are planning to issue American depositary receipts on the New York
stock exchange.
This year, the 13 are likely to raise at least Dollars 700m in this way  -
some of which will be invested in other liberalising economies, such as
Argentina and Peru.
Bottling company Cristaleris recently became the eighth Chilean group to
gain a foreign listing. Its offering of 3.65m ADRs - each representing three
shares - was priced at Dollars 23 7/8 each, valuing the issue at more than
Dollars 87m. If the underwriters take up their over-allotment rights, this
figure will go up to Dollars 95m.
Other companies queueing to make foreign issues are Chilquinta, a regional
utility, Concha y Toro, the winemaker, and Banco O'Higgins, the first
Chilean financial institution to seek a listing abroad.
Under strict laws laid down by Chile's central bank, each company will be
required to place at least Dollars 50m of new stock. Last year, of the
Dollars 2.7bn invested in Chile, Dollars 826m came via the purchase of
Chilean stock abroad.
The ADR ball was set rolling in 1990 when CTC, the telecommunications group,
placed Dollars 93m - 12 per cent of its stock - on the US market.
Today, 25 per cent of CTC's shares trade in New York with a value of about
Dollars 1.25bn. Soquimich, an iodine and fertiliser producer, and Masisa, a
particle board maker, have more than 20 per cent of their stock traded in
New York.
In addition to raising a company's international profile and securing cash
for expansion, foreign demand for Chilean paper has tended to push up the
share price on the Santiago stock exchange. 'The minimum position of big US
pension funds is often Dollars 5m,' says Mr Matthew Hickman of Bear Stearns.
'That's a huge demand by Chilean standards, so the price goes up.'
So far have ADR prices been inflated that some analysts are advising taking
profits on some better-performing ADRs. Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns,
for example, says Chilean ADRs 'have been pushed up to significant premiums
in relation to most stocks in the region'.
In 1993, shares in Madeco, the copper manufacturing company, rose in nominal
terms by 138 per cent in Santiago, while those in Masisa leapt by 207 per
cent. Both issued ADRs last year. On the day after Cristaleris closed its
deal, its share price shot up by 19.5 per cent in Santiago.
The seven international ADRs trading last year accounted for 44.1 per cent
of the selective IPSA index, which rose 50.5 per cent in US dollar terms
last year. If this year's ADR calendar is completed, ADRs will account for
nearly three-quarters of the IPSA index.
'The increased buying and selling activity of foreign institutional
investors is having a greater and more direct effect on the domestic
market,' says Mr James Walker of Baring Securities.
Some foreign institutions like the fact that a slice of of the funds raised
by Chilean companies is invested in other high-growth regional economies.
Chilean companies, exposed to domestic economic restructuring before most
other Latin American economies, have proved adept at applying hard-won
lessons to difficult foreign markets.
'People like the quality of Chilean management,' says Mr Hickman. 'Investors
like the idea of buying a Chilean vehicle. What many of them are actually
doing is taking a stake in Argentina or Peru.'
Some Chilean companies are bypassing their domestic exchange. CCU, the
beverage group which placed ADRs in 1992, is so little traded in Santiago
that last month it dropped off the IPSA index altogether.
Many family-run businesses, wary of losing board control and dubious of the
financial advantage of trading on the often-illiquid Santiago bolsa, prefer
to take their chances abroad. Foreign institutions have large sums at their
disposal yet are unlikely to be seeking boardroom control.
'Why should companies bother to list on the Chilean stock exchange?' says Mr
Hickman. 'The size of the market here (in New York) is so much larger that
it becomes a more feasible financial source without the political risk.'
However, he admits there are dangers involved in ADR euphoria. 'First,
prices shouldn't really be determined by foreign investors who don't
understand the market as well as a local does. Second, the size of the US
funds means that you just need a swift change of sentiment by a few people
to have a big effect in Chile.'
Some analysts fear what might happen if international interest rates rise
and institutions cash in their Chilean profits. Others are more sanguine,
believing the rising cost of Chilean stock reflects the premium being paid
for a combination of stability and growth potential.

Lockheed, the US aerospace group, has increased fourth-quarter income to
Dollars 135m, or Dollars 2.13 a share, from Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.95, a
year ago, on revenues of Dollars 3.74bn against Dollars 2.92bn, Reuter
reports from Calabasas.
For the full-year, the group reports a net profit of Dollars 422m, or
Dollars 6.70 a share. This compares with a loss of Dollars 283m, or Dollars
4.58, for 1992 after a one-time accounting charge. Excluding the charge,
there would have been a net profit of Dollars 348m, or Dollars 5.65 a share,
for 1992.
Revenues for the full year totalled Dollars 13.07bn, up from Dollars 10.1bn
in 1992.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Maclean Hunter to mount
offensive against Rogers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and cable-TV group, signalled
yesterday it was planning a strong counter-offensive to a proposed takeover
bid by Rogers Communications.
MH also defused uncertainty over the status of the largest single block of
shares in the company, apparently in the hope of prodding Rogers to show its
hand.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable-TV group, last week proposed a
'strategic merger' with MH to create a multimedia company able to stand up
to other European and North American conglomerates and Canada's powerful
telephone companies.
But analysts predicted yesterday that MH might try to thwart Rogers'
ambitions by presenting itself, rather than Rogers, as the best vehicle for
the creation of an enlarged Canadian multimedia conglomerate.
MH has a far less onerous debt burden than Rogers. Its coffers would be
swollen by up to CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.5bn) from the expected sale of
its US cable-TV businesses.
Rogers has yet to put forward a firm offer. It said last Friday it would
first ask the Ontario Securities Commission to rule whether the block of MH
shares held by a company known as Maclean Hunter Holdings would have to be
included in a bid.
MH responded yesterday that MH Holdings, which is controlled by two MH
subsidiaries and holds about 17 per cent of MH's shares, will not vote its
shares either for or against any bid which conforms to a 1989 shareholder
rights plan. The clarification means that an OSC ruling is no longer
necessary.
'It is not the intention of either board (of MH or MH Holdings) to frustrate
or prevent any reasonable and appropriate offer . . . made by Rogers or any
other party,' MH said.
Rogers late yesterday described MH's statement as 'inadequate' as it applies
only to offers approved by the MH board. MH added it was 'exploring
strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value'. These include a
recapitalisation, the spin-off of all or part of its Canadian cable-TV
assets, and the formation of 'one or more alliances'.
MH also said discussions were under way with prospective buyers of the
valuable US cable-TV interests in Michigan, New Jersey and Florida.
At its current share price of CDollars 17.25, MH is valued at CDollars
3.6bn. But analysts predict a bidder with any hope of success will need to
offer considerably more than that.

CP, which also benefited from an improvement in shipping and trucks,
recorded positive operating results and is forecasting further gains for

Fourth-quarter net profit from continuing operations was CDollars 107m

CDollars 1.6bn.
For the full year, overall net profit from continuing operations was
CDollars 267m, compared with CDollars 140m, but after special items the loss
was CDollars 191m, or 60 cents, against a deficit of CDollars 478m, or
CDollars 1.50.
Revenues of CDollars 6.6bn compared with CDollars 7.2bn, mostly due to the

The 1993 special items included a CDollars 203m share of write-downs by

Telecom, the New Zealand utility controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech,
reported record third-quarter earnings of NZDollars 134.6m (USDollars 77m),
an 8.9 per cent lift on the NZDollars 123.6m achieved in the same period
last year.
The improvement pushed Telecom's net earnings for the nine months to
December 31 up to NZDollars 386m, a 15.3 per cent increase on the NZDollars
224.7m earned in the same period of last year.
Mr Jeff White, chief financial officer, said the company was well on the way
to achieving another record profit for the full year. Mr Roderick Deane,
chief executive, told a news conference: 'It was a very satisfactory
quarter, reflecting growth in the business, systems advances and market
retention.' Per-share earnings for the third quarter rose to NZDollars 5.7
cents from 5.2 cents, and earnings per share for the nine months rose to
16.3 cents from 14.2 cents.
Third-quarter operating revenue rose by 1.6 per cent to NZDollars 634.6m.
Telecom executives said this reflected strong growth in core markets as well
as a continued rise in revenues from cellular services, directories and new
network services.
Volumes in the national call market climbed 10.1 per cent while growth in
international calls was up 15.7 per cent.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese move on European bonds
 -Investment interest is strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High yields and the potential for currency appreciation are proving strong
incentives for Japanese investors to switch into the European government
bond markets, given that yields on Japanese government debt and US Treasury
bonds are pitifully low.
Japanese investment in overseas markets reached Dollars 35bn in the final
quarter of 1993, the highest quarterly figure since the last three months of
1989, according to DKB International, the Japanese bank. Some Dollars 26.4bn
of that was invested in overseas bonds, notably European markets.
'Japanese investors have been moving into Europe in the last few months and
have been strong supporters of the gilt market, as well as buying French and
German bonds,' points out Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg
Securities. He expects to see further investment by Japanese investors in
European bonds, given that the yields are significantly higher than those on
Japanese paper.
Dealers in London note that Japanese buying interest in the European
government bond markets - particularly France, Germany and the Netherlands -
has been strong since the start of the year, although there has some
profit-taking in the UK and European markets to cover losses in the Japanese
domestic markets.
Many Japanese investors expect to see a further rally in European bond
markets this year, especially if the Bundesbank lowers interest rates and
other European central banks follow suit.
Mr Mikio Kashiwagi, head of overseas pension portfolio management at IBJ NW
Asset Management, says: 'Europe is definitely interesting at the moment.'
During the past few months, he has gradually shifted funds out of the US
government bond market into Europe where interest rates are high and there
is scope for yield curves to 'normalise' by adopting a positive slope as
short-term interest rates decline.
Mr Kashiwagi is placing 40 per cent of his funds in bonds and 60 per cent in
stocks: half of the fixed income allocation will be in European bonds, while
26 per cent will be in US paper and 16 per cent in Japanese debt.
Mr Junya Nakamura, manager of Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance's international
investment department, currently puts 40 per cent of his bond investments
into Europe and 60 per cent in the US. But while the total amount allocated
to overseas investments has remained stable, he has shifted funds out of the
US into Europe, reducing exposure in US bonds from 80 per cent last year to
the current level.
'We've started to get cautious about the UK, but we think countries on the
continent still have room to cut rates,' says Mr Nakamura.
'We've been overweight in Europe since the start of last year,' says a fund
manager at a leading Japanese life assurer. However, he believes that
European bond markets are in the last stages of a rally, and would not
increase weightings further.
Some Japanese investors are wary of overseas investments because of the risk
of currency fluctuations, and are sticking to domestic bonds in the hope of
a further fall in long-term yields. (The yield on the benchmark No 157
10-year bond is trading at around 3.55 per cent.)
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management,
who expects the Japanese currency to remain at around Y110 to the dollar
this year, is keeping away from overseas investments. He believes there is
potential for gains on Japanese government bonds and is about 10 per cent
overweight.
However, fears of heavy new supply in the Japanese government bond market
have dampened enthusiasm recently. The economic stimulus package could mean
extra supply for the bond market, and the Ministry of Finance has already
announced that it would issue bonds outright to finance the spending part of
the package. According to an outline announced by the Ministry of Finance
last week, the proposed tax cuts - worth Y6,000bn a year - would be financed
by deficit-covering bonds in the first three years.
In terms of the currency outlook, Japanese investors appear divided. In many
cases, positions in European bonds held by Japanese investors have been
fully hedged, keeping worries over currency movements at a minimum, although
this can be costly and reduces the overall return.
Mr Nakamura believes that the yen will remain relatively firm against
European currencies. However, other Japanese investors see scope for making
gains from the appreciation of the European currencies against the yen. A
dealer at one US bond house notes that 'even the Japanese are rather bearish
on the yen, and feel they could get currency appreciation from their
European assets'.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Transgas plans stake in Algerian
pipeline

<TEXT>
Transgas, the company responsible for an Es450bn (Dollars 2.6bn) project to
pipe natural gas into Portugal, plans to take an Es16bn stake in
Europe-Maghreb Pipeline, the US-dominated construction consortium building a
gas line between Algeria and Spain.
Portugal, the only European Union country without a natural gas supply
system, plans to lift 2.5bn cubic metres of natural gas a year from 1996
through a link with the pipeline that will run from Hassi R'Mel in Algeria
through Morocco to Seville in Spain.
Transgas, wholly owned by Portuguese public sector companies, is holding
talks with at least 12 foreign enterprises interested in acquiring a stake
in the company, a Lisbon government official said yesterday.
He said the government planned to reduce the state-controlled holding in
Transgas to a maximum of 30 per cent and would permit foreign ownership of
up to 49 per cent of the company.
The potential foreign partners in Transgas include Sonatrach, the Algerian
state energy company, that will supply natural gas to Morocco, Spain and
Portugal through the pipeline. Construction work is due to begin this year.
Gaz de France is also negotiating a possible participation in Transgas. The
French company led an international consortium that planned to introduce
natural gas into Portugal through importing liquefied natural gas from
Algeria by ship. But talks with the Portuguese government collapsed in March
1993 after a failure to agree on prices and risk-sharing.
Mr Luis Felipe Pereira, Portugal's secretary of state for energy, said the
pipeline option would provide gas at a lower price. It was also more secure
because Portugal would be able to import gas from other suppliers through
the Spanish network if supplies from Algeria were cut off.

Revenues of CDollars 6.6bn compared with CDollars 7.2bn, mostly due to the
de-consolidation of two units.
The 1993 special items included a CDollars 203m share of write-downs by
Unitel, the telecommunications unit, the share of Laidlaw writedowns, and a
special charge by the property unit.
CP also included a CDollars 163m loss from its 61 per cent stake in Canadian
Pacific Forest Products, sold late last year.
In 1992 special charges totalled CDollars 441m, mainly as a result of
rationalisation.
The rail system almost doubled operating income in 1993, with strong gains
in traffic.
Higher oil and gas output and increased gas prices helped Pan Canadian
Petroleum, while Fording Coal swung back positively from a 1992 strike.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, warned that Unitel would continue to lose
money until it achieved sufficient long-distance market share. But with
moderate economic growth, 'CP sees continued overall improvement in
operating performance in 1994'.

Demand for sheet steel from the surging North American car industry brought
further recovery at Dofasco, Canada's second biggest steelmaker, in the
fourth quarter.
Net profit from operations was CDollars 15.2m (USDollars 11.6m) up from
CDollars 13.3m in the third quarter and a loss in the year earlier.
After special gains, Dofasco reported fourth-quarter net profit of CDollars
75.7m, or 95 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 115.5m, or CDollars
1.46, on sales up at CDollars 535m, against CDollars 475m.
For all of 1993, final net profit was CDollars 111.9m, or CDollars 1.41,
compared with a loss of CDollars 234m, or CDollars 2.96, in 1992.
Sales were CDollars 2.1bn, up from CDollars 1.95bn. Total steel shipments
were 3.35m tonnes, against 3.4 tonnes.
Dofasco is completing its restructuring to concentrate on flat rolled
products. It has sold its remaining interest in Algoma Steel and plans to
sell its tubular products unit.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft board 'not at
fault'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft was not at fault in failing to
prevent the events which led to the near collapse of the German mining,
metals and industrial group last month, a senior banker said yesterday.
Ms Ellen Schneider-Lenne, a member of the Deutsche Bank management board,
said this would become obvious at Metallgesellschaft's extraordinary meeting
on February 24.
At this meeting Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman and a
colleague of Ms Schneider-Lenne on the board of the Deutsche Bank, will
break his silence about events leading up to the dismissal of Mr Heinz
Schimmelbusch, former chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, and other
directors in December.
Ms Schneider-Lenne refused to give details about what Mr Schmitz would
reveal but maintained that the Metallgesellschaft affair 'was not a question
of the supervisory board going wrong'.
She said she expected the Metallgesellschaft affair to act as a catalyst to
a debate on corporate governance within Germany similar to that in the UK in
the wake of a number of corporate crashes in the late 1980s.
Ms Schneider-Lenne, who is a non-executive director of ICI, the UK-based
chemicals group, said German companies could learn from best practice in the
Anglo-Saxon world. Whereas German supervisory boards normally meet no more
than four times a year, UK boards - including non-executive directors - tend
to meet 10 times a year.
Members of supervisory boards should devote more time to these mandates and
should sit on fewer boards than they do at present, Ms Schneider-Lenne
argued. Germans are allowed to hold a legal maximum of 10 such directorships
but Ms Schneider-Lenne said she had refused to take on more than four.
Supervisory board members should be aggressive in requiring managing board
members to provide information when this was not forthcoming. There was a
case for establishing the formal institution of the audit committee in
Germany as in the UK.
The near failure of Germany's fourteenth-largest industrial group has led to
criticism of Mr Schmitz and colleagues on the supervisory board who voted
unanimously to extend Mr Schimmelbusch's contract for five years shortly
before he was ousted.
It has led to criticism of the German corporate governance system which
divides responsibility for a company between the management, which takes
operating decisions, and the supervisory board which is responsible for
overseeing management performance.

<TEXT>
Unidanmark, the second-largest Danish banking group, reported a return to
profit in 1993 after three consecutive years in the red. Net profit was
DKr885m (Dollars 132m), compared with a loss in 1992 of DKr4.66bn and losses
in 1990 and 1991 of DKr1.09bn and DKr1.65bn respectively.
The group omitted a dividend for the second year, but announced a DKr550m
new share issue at market price and without preferential rights for existing
shareholders which should raise about DKr1.3bn.
A cut in bad loss provisions to DKr3.88bn last year from DKr6.28bn and
income from securities and foreign exchange of DKr2.56bn, compared with a
loss of DKr273m in 1992, helped the turnround.
The increase in profits from securities and foreign exchange reflected the
sharp rise in bond and share prices on the Copenhagen stock exchange last
year. Mr Thorleif Krarup, group chief executive, said about DKr1.5bn of the
DKr2.5bn profit under this heading were trading profits and the rest a gain
in the value of securities.
Mr Krarup was brought into the bank in the autumn of 1992 after repeated
forecasts of an improved performance were falsified.

Mr W. Arthur Benson, the MG Refining and Marketing executive who was sacked
last Friday, says Metallgesellschaft, the troubled metals and mining group,
was fully aware of his division's trading strategies and made him the
scapegoat for losses they created, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
Trading losses from MG's oil and gas operations are widely believed to have
generated the recent financial crisis at the German parent.
In a written statement, Mr Benson said Metallgesellschaft was fully informed
of MG Refining and Marketing's trading strategy but chose to ignore it.
'They have acted purposefully as if they sought to create losses. There is
more here than at first meets the eye,' he said. Mr Benson also said that if
the strategy had been allowed to run its course, it would have reaped
substantial profits.
Metallgesellschaft had no response to Mr Benson.
Mr Benson would not elaborate beyond his written statement, saying he was
prohibited by his contract with his former employer. He had been president
of MG Refining and Marketing.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Groupe GAN sees further gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, should report a
recovery in net profits to FFr700m (Dollars 119m) for 1993 from FFr402m in
1992 according to Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman.
Mr Heilbronner said that GAN's net profits during the second half of 1993
had been 'of the same order' as the FFr372m it made in the first half,
thereby contributing to a 'significant increase' for the full financial
year.
GAN, scheduled for privatisation, is the smallest of France's big three
state-controlled insurers and has been the most vulnerable of the trio
during the recession. The group has been badly affected by the competitive
state of the insurance industry and from the problems of the property
sector.
However GAN, like the rest of the industry, did manage to stabilise
activities last year. Mr Heilbronner said the group was on course for
recovery in insurance, although further action was required at CIC, its
troubled banking network.
He forecast the recovery would continue in 1994 and gather momentum next
year. Mr Heilbronner's objective is for GAN to make net profits of FFr2bn in
1995.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Olivetti rules out rights issue
for this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, has 'absolutely no
reason' for a rights issue this year, even if it wins the licence to run a
second national cellular communications network, according to Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, chairman.
Mr De Benedetti said mobile communications was 'not a diversification or
opportunistic for Olivetti. It's at the heart of our business'. However,
company officials have admitted winning the licence would have a negative
impact on cash flow during the project's early years, when heavy investments
would be required.
According to company forecasts, a successful bid by the Omnitel consortium,
headed by Olivetti, would cost the latter between L1,500bn and L2,000bn
(Dollars 887m-Dollars 1.2bn) in the 18 months from winning the licence. The
project would create 2,000 jobs.
Omnitel, which includes Swedish Telecom, Bell Atlantic, Cellular
Communications and Lehman Brothers, is one of three contenders to run the
new GSM-standard network. A government decision is expected by the end of
April.
Olivetti has stressed the importance of winning the mandate.
However, winning it is expected to have a modest negative impact on earnings
for up to four years because of heavy investment spending.
Olivetti would seek to limit costs by using existing financial resources and
avoiding additional debt. However, officials implied it might need to turn
to shareholders eventually to fund the additional spending.
Olivetti, which last year pushed through a L902bn rights issue, will seek
shareholder approval to issue up to L2,000bn in new shares and bonds over
the next five years. However, a senior executive said the proposal, to be
put to shareholders in April, had been misunderstood, and did not
necessarily mean extra cash would be raised.
Winning the licence could affect Olivetti's results just as it is poised to
emerge from sustained losses. Bolstered by a shift into more profitable
service-based activities, Mr De Benedetti said breaking even was a reachable
objective this year.

call

<TEXT>
Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, is
launching a SFr400m (Dollars 266m) rights issue to help finance its SFr610m
takeover of Lawson Mardon, the Canadian packaging group.
Alusuisse, which has been restructuring vigorously to reduce its dependence
on the volatile aluminium business, revealed that consolidated 1993 net
income and sales slid as earlier predicted. According to preliminary
figures, net income was down 15 per cent to SFr80m on sales off 6 per cent
to SFr6.2bn.
However, the directors are forecasting 'a significant improvement in group
income in the current year' and are proposing the dividend be maintained at
SFr12.50 per share. In September, the chairman had warned of a possible cut.
Mr Georges Schorderet, finance director, said the 1993 results were hit by
SFr300m in extraordinary restructuring costs. At the beginning of the year,
Alusuisse shut down its only remaining aluminium smelter in Switzerland. It
has closed a silicon carbide plant in southern Germany and yesterday
announced the anticipated closure of an aluminium smelter at Essen.
Mr Schorderet said the restructuring charges were offset by proceeds from
disposals of non-core businesses and property. Net debt fell during the year
by SFr700m to SFr1.3bn and Mr Schorderet said equity has risen to roughly
SFr1.9bn, due to the proceeds from disposals and a rights issue last May.
When Alusuisse announced its agreed bid for Lawson Mardon last November, it
said an increase in its equity was possible in the longer term.
The group's registered shares fell SFr24 to SFr610 yesterday following the
announcement in a declining market. Mr Schorderet said the timing of the
rights issue advanced in part because the public offer for Lawson shares had
been so successful.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Claims against Rey amount to
SFr3.02bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers of Mr Werner K. Rey, the fugitive Swiss financier, have received
claims against him of SFr3.02bn (Dollars 2.1bn). But nearly three years
after the collapse of Mr Rey's Omni Holdings, only a tiny fraction of this
amount has been recovered.
In its latest letter to creditors, Atag Ernst &amp; Young said it had accepted
only SFr842m of the claims. Another SFr519m had been rejected while claims
worth SFr1.66bn were being held pending further investigation.
Omni, an aggressive conglomerate, collapsed in April, 1991 with more than
SFr2bn in debts, making it Switzerland's largest corporate collapse.
Mr Rey went to the Bahamas and has refused to return. He has been charged
with fraud and theft and Swiss authorities are preparing a request for his
extradition.
Atag said it sold Mr Rey's Rolls-Royce Corniche car last year for SFr26,000
and a property for SFr14m, but the net proceeds available to creditors from
these two transactions would amount to only between SFr2.8m and SFr5.7m.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Time Warner net income falls to
Dollars 7m in fourth term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported fourth-quarter
net income of Dollars 7m, down from Dollars 68m in the same period of last
year, although the group's operating results were modestly better.
The results translated into earnings per share of 1 cent, compared with a
loss of 25 cents in the same period of last year.
Time Warner's results are complicated by two factors. First, the merger
between Time and Warner Brothers which created the company in 1989 involved
the assumption of a very high level of debt.
As with many highly leveraged businesses, Time Warner encourages Wall Street
to focus on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (Ebitda) as a measure of its underlying performance.
Second, the company has reported its entertainment operations - which
include its film and cable interests - on a deconsolidated basis since
September, when US West, the telephone group, took a large stake in this
business.
Time Warner said yesterday that in the fourth quarter combined Ebitda of the
entertainment group and its other businesses totalled Dollars 760m, up 3 per
cent from the Dollars 740m reported in the same period of last year, while
revenues rose to Dollars 4.12bn from Dollars 3.76bn.
The group's publishing interests saw earnings up to Dollars 146m from
Dollars 132m, while its music operations made Dollars 215m, up from Dollars
196m a year ago.
Within the entertainment group, earnings from films dipped to Dollars 96m
from Dollars 101m, although the Warner Brothers studio posted a record
quarter.
The HBO cable channel saw earnings rise to Dollars 61m from Dollars 56m.
However, the group's cable service business, the second largest in the US,
saw earnings drop to Dollars 242m from Dollars 255m. The group blamed this
on cable rate regulation instituted by Congress last year.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said: 'While our cable business will continue to
be under pressure in 1994 from this regulation, we remain optimistic about
its future growth and that of our copyright businesses.'
For the full year, Time Warner reported a net loss of Dollars 221m, after
taking a Dollars 70m special tax charge, against a profit of Dollars 86m in
1992.
On a combined Ebitda basis, revenues rose to Dollars 14.54bn from Dollars
13.56bn, while earnings rose to Dollars 2.83bn from Dollars 2.62bn.

FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suez confirms modest profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, the French industrial and financial
holding company, has confirmed that it came back into the black with a
'modest' profit last year after making its first loss in 1992.
Suez, surrounded by speculation about the possible disposal of Victoire, its
insurance subsidiary, fell into the red with a net deficit of FFr1.87bn
(Dollars 317m) in 1992 due to the economic recession and its heavy debts.
Mr Worms said Suez's 1993 results would be 'positive, but modest'. The
group, which was badly affected in 1992 by the downturn in the French
property market, had attempted last year to alleviate the pressure on its
finances by raising capital from asset sales.
However, the continued problems of the property market in 1993 wiped out the
profits from its large disposals. This included the sale last year of
Victoire's controlling interest in Colonia, the German insurer, to Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group.
Mr Worms said 1994 should mark 'a new stage in Suez's return to
profitability' but predicted the group would not return to 'a satisfactory
level of profitability' until 1995.
He said that Suez was nearing the end of its asset sale programme, but
declined to comment on recent reports that it was close to concluding a deal
to sell Victoire.
BAT, the London-based conglomerate, has been mooted as a possible purchaser
for Victoire: as have Allianz, the German insurance group, and Italy's
Generali.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A life of champagne or Valium - The thrills
and dangers of large share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share traders say the most nerve-wracking moment of a 'bought deal' is the
five minutes before the first bite from buyers.
After weeks of research and negotiations, the brokerage house has bought a
multi-million pound block of a company's shares from one investor and then
has to find other investors to take them off its books. For the short time
between making offers to institutions and the buy orders flooding in,
dealers cannot be sure whether they will be cracking open champagne or
Valium.
Bought deals are one of the bigger adrenalin rushes of the stock market.
They place reputations of senior salesmen and heads of marketmaking under
intense pressure as they put the capital of their companies at risk.
Last week, Smith New Court, the securities house with one of the most
aggressive trading reputations in the UK, paid Pounds 162m for 46m shares in
Prudential, the UK's biggest insurance company.
It is the second time in two weeks that the securities house has taken on
risky share sales. Three weeks earlier it traded 13m shares in Great
Universal Stores.
If the market had fallen heavily between the time Smith agreed the
Prudential deal and the time it started to offer shares for sale there would
have been ways of protecting against huge losses.
The broker could have hedged against any falls using the derivatives market,
for example by buying call options which give the right to sell stock at a
pre-set price and time.
However, once word leaked into the market that Smith had a large amount of
stock for sale the result depended purely on the appetite of the stock
market and the broker's ability to place the shares quickly.
Smith has analysts dedicated to identifying potential clients interested in
buying or selling large stakes. The Prudential deal began weeks ago when
Smith approached an investment fund, believed to be Baring Securities, which
appeared willing to sell its Pru stake.
Mr Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, and Mr David Marks (no relation),
head of its UK marketmaking, discussed the deal with half a dozen senior
colleagues. They met in the 'goldfish bowl', the glass office above the
trading room where significant decisions are made, and agreed they would be
interested in taking on the stake, representing almost 2.5 per cent of
Prudential's equity.
Subsequently, senior sales traders from the securities house rang financial
institutions to gauge what level of discount they would need to persuade
them to buy large blocks of shares.
Early last week, the stock market was hitting new highs and Prudential
shares were available at about 370p. Smith found that fund managers were
prepared to pay 354p and decided they could pick up the stake at 350p.
With that 'turn' Smith stood to make a profit of Pounds 1.8m. However, it is
more likely that the broker would have reckoned on about half the shares
being sold at that price and the rest being offloaded on a sliding scale.
That would probably still leave Smith Pounds 1m to the good, according to
rival analysts' estimates.
The traders had 'pre-placed' many of the shares by getting orders from their
best clients.
Smith did not buy the shares until shortly before the sales desk had to face
the test of the market last Thursday afternoon. If the discount was not
sufficiently generous rival marketmakers would have cut the price at which
they were offering Prudential shares forcing Smith to slash its potential
profits in order to get the shares away.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Peter Black advances 22% to top Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing demand from Marks and Spencer last year fuelled a 22 per cent
rise in interim profits at Peter Black, the supplier of footwear, cosmetics
and accessories to the UK's most profitable retailer.
Reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.01m (Pounds 5.73m) for the six months
to December 4, the West Yorkshire-based company said the improvement would
create significant opportunities for organic growth.
Those opportunities have persuaded the group, which relies on M&amp;S for 65 per
cent of its turnover, to commit Pounds 10m to a new plant making personal
care products in south Derbyshire. Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the
development was justified by a 12 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds
68.6m (Pounds 61.1m).
'The strong cash generating capability of the business has enabled the group
to maintain its programme of investment in product development, plant and
information technology while at the same time eliminating gearing,' he
added.
Borrowing was down by almost Pounds 4.5m against the second half figure and
Mr Black, whose family controls 30 per cent of the equity, said expansion in
its three divisions could be financed from reserves.
Of those divisions, personal care products accounted for the largest slice
of profits, up 23 per cent to Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 2.65m). Improved turnover
of Pounds 24m (Pounds 21m) was due partly to buoyant demand for natural
health products, including vitamins and herbal remedies sold under its
English Grains label.
Growing imports of handbags and Italian shoes helped the footwear and
accessories division increase pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 2.81m
(Pounds 2.23m) on turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 37.2m.
The distribution, leisure and retail sector - including factory outlets and
the Hornsea Freeport shopping centre - contributed Pounds 948,000 (Pounds
845,000) to profits despite flat turnover of Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 7m).
Earnings per share rose to 8.59p (7.05p) and the interim dividend goes up to
1.12p (0.93p).
COMMENT
Should sales collapse, Peter Black executives claim they could make a profit
running courses for would-be M&amp;S suppliers. Certainly making products for
the St Michael label has paid rich dividends. Yet the company has reduced
potential risks by also signing supply deals with Sainsbury, Tesco and
Safeway. That strategy, coupled to a flourishing distribution network
serving 30 companies, has boosted full year profit forecasts to Pounds
11.5m, giving a p/e of 19. While expensive for investors seeking a quick
gain, the shares look a safe bet for long-term growth.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Consortium buys Delco Chassis arm from GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of European investors led by Mr Dennis Keech, the founder of
Camford Engineering, has taken over the automotive electrical products
operations of the Delco Chassis division of General Motors in the UK.
The operation, based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, has a workforce of 850 and
an annual turnover of around Pounds 53m.
The main products of the new company, to be called Automotive Components
Dunstable, are windscreen wiper motor assemblies.
Its main customer is GM Europe (Opel/Vauxhall), which accounts for around 56
per cent of its turnover, but it also supplies Rover, Toyota, Nissan and
Honda car plants in the UK as well as several truck producers in Europe.
GM has disposed of the operations as part of the restructuring of its
Automotive Components Group Worldwide. Delco Chassis is concentrating its
activities on suspension and brake systems.
Mr Keech founded the Camford Engineering automotive components group in
1964.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety held back by fall in Pot Noodles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling sales of Pot Noodles and low pig prices held back interim results at
Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group. Pre-tax profits were slightly
ahead at Pounds 56.4m, against Pounds 56.2m, in the six months to December
31.
Mr Richard Clothier, the new chief executive, said he expected improvement
in many areas in the second half. This was underlined by an increase in the
interim dividend from 7.85p to 8p, in spite of a 7 per cent fall in earnings
per share to 17.2p (18.5p). The shares fell 3p to 487p, holding up against
the market.
The consumer foods division was affected by the supermarket price war but
not severely, according to Mr Clothier, as only half the division's business
was with the UK multiple retailers. The division's trading profits fell 10
per cent to Pounds 27.5m, with acquisitions contributing Pounds 200,000. A
cut in crisp prices at Golden Wonder had been largely recouped through
higher volumes and market share.
Food ingredients profits rose 21 per cent to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.0m),
with Pounds 1.1m of the gain from acquisitions.
Food distribution profits were 16 per cent up at Pounds 8.1m, helped by
exchange rates, and agribusiness profits were 3 per cent ahead at Pounds
15m, thanks to a Pounds 1.4m contribution from acquisitions.
In total, acquisitions added Pounds 1.8m after associated finance costs of
Pounds 1m - which offset a Pounds 900,000 reduction from lower interest
rates. Together with Pounds 1.1m from the fall in sterling against the
dollar and a saving of Pounds 600,000 from the sale of Federal Bakeries, the
gains slightly exceeded a Pounds 4.2m reduction in trading profits on a
comparable basis. Of this reduction about Pounds 2m was due to Pot snacks -
whose figures compared with a strong period when new product launches had
boosted volumes - and about Pounds 1m to low pig prices.
Mr John Martyn, finance director, said Pounds 80m spent on acquisitions,
higher working capital and investment led to a Pounds 99m rise in net debt
to Pounds 208m. With a Pounds 50m goodwill write-off, this lifted gearing to
54 per cent. Mr Martyn said this should fall to around 36-38 per cent by the
year-end. The tax charge rose from 25 to 30 per cent as the group's surplus
ACT was dwindling and profits rose in the higher tax rate areas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Total premium income at AXA Equity &amp; Law, the life assurance and pensions
arm of the AXA group, exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time in 1993.
Total funds under management in its unit trust subsidiary also exceeded
Pounds 1bn for the first time.
Total new business rose by 20 per cent, from Pounds 675m to Pounds 807m.
Within the UK, the results reflected the emphasis throughout the life
industry on single premium rather than regular premium products.
Total UK insurance single premiums rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 520m,
helped by the doubling of unit-linked life single premiums to Pounds 159m.
Pensions single premiums were, however, 7 per cent lower at Pounds 155m.
There was a 1 per cent rise in new annual premiums in the UK, to Pounds 59m,
with a particular rise in mortgage-related business.
Individual pensions annual premiums fell by 4 per cent to just over Pounds
24m.
Total new business at AXA Equity &amp; Law International, the group's offshore
company, rose by 39 per cent to Pounds 60m.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer P&amp;P ahead sharply at Pounds 4.1m -
Withdrawal from low margin computer distribution business behind advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services group which
has pulled out of the low margin, high volume computer distribution business
over the past 12 months, yesterday reported sharply higher full-year pre-tax
profits.
Profits of Pounds 4.1m in the 12 months to November 30 compared with a
pre-FRS 3 outcome of Pounds 2m last time. The adoption of new accounting
rules resulted in a restatement of the prior year results to show a Pounds
7.87m pre-tax loss after Pounds 9.88m of exceptional charges.
Turnover remained relatively stable at Pounds 217.3m (Pounds 222.8m) despite
the con-tinued downward movement in unit product prices throughout the year
and the dis-posal of the high volume dis-tribution businesses in the UK and
Belgium, which contributed Pounds 32.6m to total turnover.
However, the flat turnover masked a substantial change in the business mix
as the group withdrew from the lower margin distribution business to focus
on higher margin computing services and higher value computer product sales.
Overall gross margins, including the discontinued operations, improved to
19.1 per cent from 18.3 per cent, while the gross margin on continuing
operations was 20.7 per cent.
At the operating level profits grew to Pounds 4.53m (Pounds 3.14m)
in-cluding Pounds 174,000 from the discontinued businesses. Mr David
Southworth, group managing director, said P&amp;P was targeting a 5 per cent net
margin.
He said 1993 had been a transition year for the group. 'These results are
very pleasing and reflect the substantial progress we have made during the
year against the background of a difficult market, and the refocusing of our
activities.'
The pre-tax profits were struck after Pounds 4.63m of losses on the disposal
of discontinued operations, offset by a Pounds 4.74m utilisation of 1992
provisions, and Pounds 535,000 (Pounds 1.13m) of net interest costs. The
group ended the year with Pounds 7.5m of net cash, up from Pounds 3m a year
earlier.
Earnings per share of 4.3p compare with fully diluted earnings of 1.9p
before the FRS 3 restatement and a 14p a share losses after restatement. The
final dividend is increased by 71 per cent to 1.2p, making a total for the
year of 2p (1.4p).
COMMENT
P&amp;P's management has successfully disengaged the group from the high vol-ume
distribution busi-ness where gross margins were a paltry 10 per cent to
concentrate on higher margin services and pro-ducts - including the desk-top
communications market. Meanwhile costs have been brought under control, and
in future the group will be targeting profit rather than turnover. Pre-tax
pro-fits should reach Pounds 5.2m this year, producing earnings of about
5.6p. The shares, which shed 1p to close at 82p yesterday, are trading on a
prospective p/e multiple of 14.6 and, despite a recent run-up, still have
recovery potential.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Possible bid for IFM if SE quote is kept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at International Food Machinery, the second-hand catering equipment
supplier, were told yesterday it would continue to trade despite being
placed in receivership.
Arthur Andersen, appointed as receiver last Friday, said the workforce would
be kept on while it considered bids for the Grimsby-based business.
The company, which was floated only 14 months ago, called in Andersen
following a meeting with its bankers.
'We have had contact with two parties interested in the group,' the
receivers said.
One of those bidders said yesterday that it had put together an offer worth
at least Pounds 1m, although that depended on IFM retaining its Stock
Exchange listing.
Mr David Lassen-Diesen, the property investment entrepreneur, said the
receivers had contacted his group asking whether their offer, first proposed
last December, was still on the table. 'We are keen to proceed but only if
it keeps the quote, allowing us to get funding from institutions,' he said.
The other interested group is thought to involve IFM board members and Mr
Sandy Saunders, the former Sunleigh director.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Details of Mr Francis Lee's takeover at Manchester City Football Club
emerged yesterday as the premier league club confirmed that it intended to
apply for a Stock Exchange listing. The shares are currently traded under
Rule 535.2.
Mr Lee, the club's former player and England international, has been
appointed as chairman and Mr John Dunkerley and Mr Colin Barlow have been
appointed directors. Former chairman Mr Peter Swales, has resigned as a
director but has accepted an invitation as life president.
Mr Lee has acquired 112,337 ordinary shares in the club from Mr Swales and
Mr Stephen Boler at Pounds 13.35 per share. Together with concert parties,
he now holds 224,998 shares, or 29.99 per cent of the voting share capital.
Although Mr Lee will not make an offer for the entire share capital at this
stage, he has undertaken to meet any obligation to make a general offer
which might arise under the Takeover Code, as a result of any future share
purchases or loan stock conversions.
An extraordinary meeting will be asked to approve the issue of up to Pounds
4m of convertible unsecured loan stock at par. Mr Lee has agreed to
subscribe for at least Pounds 3m of loan stock, which on conversion would
result in the issue of up to 300,000 ordinary shares (28.6 per cent of
enlarged voting capital).
The funds will be used to meet working capital requirements and for player
acquisitions and ground development.
Mr Lee received a rapturous reception at the weekend from the club's Maine
Road fans when the team, currently struggling near the bottom of the
premiership, achieved only their second league win in four months, against
Ipswich Town.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead wins BT contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising agency, has landed what it claims is
the 'largest single new business win in the history of British advertising',
with a contract from British Telecommunications worth Pounds 50m in annual
billings.
The agency's shares rose 27p to close at 660p.
BT said the agency's brief was to increase the personal use of telephones.
Domestic use is 25-30 per cent lower in the UK than in the US and the
network is a 'very under-utilised fixed asset,' said BT. The aim was to
encourage people to make more calls and stay on the phone for longer.
There has been concern within BT that since the days of the 'Beattie'
campaign, which was devised by J Walter Thompson, part of the WPP group, the
organisation's advertising had become too fragmented.
Recent campaigns had been divided between agencies Simons Palmer Denton
Clemmow and Johnson, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
The latest move to AMV will consolidate all personal telephone advertising
under one roof.
Simons Palmer and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, as well as BMP DDB Needham, pitched
against AMV for the latest campaign.
AMV has done work for BT before: it devised its Yellow Pages advertising and
is also working on raising awareness of code changes planned for next year.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C aims to raise at least Pounds 30m -
Issue News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures is to launch two parallel venture capital funds,
the Private Equity investment trust and a limited partnership with the same
investment objectives. The combined funds aim to raise at least Pounds 30m.
They will invest in small to medium-sized unquoted companies, mainly
management buy-outs and companies seeking to expand or make acquisitions,
rather than start-up companies. The two will have initially identical
portfolios, in proportion to the amount of money raised by each.
After the initial investment period, the proceeds of realisations from the
limited partnership will be returned to investors, whereas the investment
trust will reinvest all proceeds. Both funds will have an initial life of 10
years, but the investment trust can be extended by shareholders' vote after
six years.
Shares will be issued partly paid, with 50 per cent payable immediately, and
50 per cent in November 1995. There will be no public offer, and the minimum
subscription in the placing will be Pounds 20,000.
Mr James Nelson, managing director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, said
there was evidence of demand for both types of investment structure, but the
choice for investors preferring a quoted fund was limited.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Radstone for market via placing - Issue
News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radstone Technology, a specialist electronics group which designs and
manufactures advanced computer subsystems for industrial and military use,
is coming to market through a share placing which is likely to value the
Towcester-based company at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m.
The group is the independent market leader in the production of
off-the-shelf computer boards for use in severe environments such as
factories or weapons systems.
Because its subsystems comply with the Versa Module Europe open systems
standards it has benefited from the switch away from proprietary systems and
from budgetary pressure on defence spending.
The group, which also owns Foundation Technology, a specialist surface mount
technology board assembler, reported profits before exceptionals of Pounds
985,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.9m in the year to end-March 1993. Pre-tax
profits were Pounds 1.87m. Turnover has grown at a compound rate of 14 per
cent a year over the past four years and the group currently has a Pounds
21m forward order book.
Radstone's sophisticated electronic products are used in applications
ranging from US submarine and Patriot anti-missile missile systems to
medical nuclear magnetic resonance scanners, motorway toll collection
equipment and North Sea oil rig safety systems.
The group has about 500 customers worldwide with its 45 largest customers
accounting for 75 per cent of sales. Last year its main customers included
Marconi, Lockheed, Siemens, IBM, Thomson and GE. About 70 per cent of its
sales are military and a similar proportion of group turnover comes from
exports.
The placing, sponsored by Beeson Gregory, will raise about Pounds 7m in new
funds for the group, of which Pounds 4m will be used to repay convertible
stock, leaving the group with a strong balance sheet and no gearing.
The prospectus is expected to be launched later this month with trading in
the new shares due to start at the beginning of March.

<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers is hoping to raise more than Pounds 75m with the
launch of a new investment trust specialising in Latin America, writes
Bethan Hutton.
The Edinburgh Inca Trust will invest 70 per cent in medium and larger
companies, and 30 per cent in smaller companies, initially in Mexico,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia and Peru.
The institutional placing will start this week, and the public offer is
expected to open on March 11 and close after two weeks. Shares will be
issued at 50p with one warrant attached to every five shares.
EFM launched a Latin American unit trust in 1992, which is the third best
performing unit trust in the international equity growth sector over the
year to February 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Logic that led to ICI's disposal - BASF
steps in to take over chemical group's non-core polypropylene operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polypropylene, a material made in large quantities by Imperial Chemical
Industries until yesterday, is a hard plastic used for car bumpers,
kitchenware, packaging and a range of other products.
However, having sales of almost Pounds 2bn a year and customers in many
industries has not prevented a chronic fall in prices in recent years which
has triggered a series of mergers and takeovers.
Polypropylene is part of petrochemicals. In common with related materials
such as polyethylene and polystyrene, production and prices rose strongly
during the 1980s. But the 1990s saw demand fall and overcapacity exposed.
The average annual price of polypropylene, for example, has fallen every
year for the past five years, according to industry consultancy Trichem.
The consequences have been strenuous attempts across petrochemicals to cut
output voluntarily. So far this has met with little success, although there
have been a handful of plant closures such as that announced last month by
BP Chemicals of its ethylene plant at Baglan Bay in Wales.
Manufacturers of polypropylene have been able to use mergers to cut costs
because the sector is particularly fragmented. There are no less than 17
companies operating in Europe that have market shares of more than 2.5 per
cent. Only two companies have more than 10 per cent of capacity.
Some of the industry's biggest producers have therefore grasped the
opportunity to merge their businesses. Three such deals are either complete
or awaiting only regulatory approval before completion:
The plastics businesses of Royal Dutch/Shell and Himont, part of Montedison,
the industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire.
Neste of Finland and Statoil of Norway, a merger which will create a group
called Borealis with annual sales of about DM4bn (Pounds 1.5bn). About 13
per cent comes from polypropylene manufacture.
ICI's sale to BASF, which will make the latter the second biggest producer
in Europe.
In the new-look European polypropylene industry, these three dominate with
more than half of total capacity. BASF moves from seventh to second biggest
company, pushing German rival Hoechst into fourth place.
BASF also points out that polypropylene sales are growing more quickly than
those of other plastics. And prices may soon recover too: although last year
saw polypropylene prices on average lower than in 1992, some individual
months saw price increases imposed by manufacturers sticking. One result was
that the business it is buying from ICI halved its losses last year to about
Pounds 10m compared with the previous year.
For ICI, the picture appears to be more mixed. It was only the eighth
biggest polypropylene producer in Europe. The business did not fit with its
strategy of concentrating on a handful of core businesses in which it is a
world leader and a disposal was logical.
However, the sale of polypropylene was intended to be just one half of a
deal which would further this strategy by strengthening the core business of
acrylics. The deal was originally constructed as a swap for BASF's acrylics
operation. That part of the plan collapsed in November when the two sides
could not agree on a value of the business, leaving ICI frustrated in its
ambitions to tighten its grip on the world acrylics manufacturing industry.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wins US approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products
of the 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent.
The US Food and Drug Administration had been expected to approve the drug in
December and Glaxo shares fell when this did not happen.
After Serevent's approval yesterday, the shares rose 15p to end the day with
a net fall of 2p at 664p.
The drug is important to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the
long standing big seller in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments
are second in importance only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic
portfolio, accounting for almost one quarter of total sales.
The older drug has now lost much of its patent protection and the company is
relying on Serevent to underpin its position in the market.
The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually reach sales of
Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In the last full
year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were worth Pounds 484m.
The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian government
healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a list of
drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the
ruling.

profits warning
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking
group, tumbled 30p to 128p yesterday following a profits warning from the
company as a result of restructuring costs in the UK and Ireland amounting
to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.4m).
The company reported a 6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to IPounds 16.4m
in the first half of 1993, and said pre-tax profits for the second half, and
before the new exceptional item, 'will be broadly in line' with that.
Woodchester said the provisions were 'deemed to be fully adequate and are of
a one-off nature.' They are necessary to reduce 'an unacceptably high cost
base' and to eliminate a number of 'peripheral product lines which are
unprofitable.' The restructuring would result in a 'significant improvement'
in the company's long-term profitability.
Credit Lyonnais, Woodchester's majority shareholder, 'has fully endorsed the
restructuring plan . . . and has formally reaffirmed its full commitment to
the continued development of the group.'
At end-1993 NCB stockbrokers in Dublin forecast full-year pre-tax profits of
IPounds 37.5m.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild biotech trust launch - Issue
News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first investment trust to specialise in biotechnology shares is about to
be launched by Rothschild Asset Management.
Due to be announced in the next two weeks, the fund, which hopes to raise
more than Pounds 100m, will seek to tap the upsurge in interest in the
sector fuelled by a stream of flotations.
Other fund management companies are hoping to launch similar trusts and will
be watching the response keenly.
The trust will be managed by the same team which runs Biotechnology
Investments, a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) Guernsey-registered fund launched
by Rothschild 12 years ago. Headed by Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, the team can
claim to be the one of the most experienced in the sector outside the US.
The fund, which Rothschild has been working on for two years, is expected to
invest in both quoted and unquoted biotechnology companies.
In Britain it will have a rapidly growing group of quoted companies from
which to choose. Relaxation of listing rules for research-based businesses
has led to a flood of new issues during the last 18 months with many more in
the pipeline for this year.
There has also been renewed investor interest in the US where biotechnology
shares have started to recover after a two-year slump.
US experience shows that, while a few biotechnology companies have been
spectacularly successful, most disappoint. The promoters of biotechnology
trusts will argue a broadly-based portfolio should provide investors with a
better chance of picking the winners.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bryant pleases City with surge to Pounds
14.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Bryant Group, the Midlands-based housebuilder, jumped 95 per cent
to Pounds 14.6m pre-tax during the six months to end-November.
The better than expected return prompted a 5p rise in the share price to
191p on a day when most other share prices were falling.
Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the improvement was due mainly to
a strong performance from housebuilding which increased operating profits by
55 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 8.7m).
The interim figures were also helped by a Pounds 300,000 return to profits
from associated residential and commercial property operations. In the
corresponding half year these had incurred a Pounds 1.9m deficit.
Interest payments declined from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 400,000.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p from earnings per share of 3.6p
(1.9p).
Group turnover increased from Pounds 138.4m to Pounds 178.2m. The number of
homes sold increased from 1,290 to 1,480. Average prices rose from Pounds
81,000 to Pounds 94,000 as the group reduced production of one and two
bedroom homes to concentrate on higher margin large homes.
The mainspring of the profits improvement came in southern England where the
group built some 600 homes and moved from a loss of about Pounds 2m to an
operating profit of about the same amount.
Mr MacKenzie said the group had used up most of the zero and low margin land
it had acquired expensively in southern England during the late 1980s.
The Midlands market, where the group also built about 600 homes, remained
good, producing operating margins in excess of 15 per cent. The north of
England generated reasonable profits after initial start-up costs.
Bryant expects to sell more than 3,000 homes in the current year, compared
with 2,815 in 1992-93.
It anticipated that it would be building more than 4,000 homes a year by
1996.
Construction profits improved from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.1m, helped by the
timing of payments on successful claims rather than any general improvement
in contracting.
Commercial property activities fared less well with operating losses
increasing from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.9m after provisions of Pounds 2m
against some commercial properties.
COMMENT
The market was rightly pleased with Bryant's first half performance. The
switch to higher margin properties should continue to benefit while the
geographical expansion is paying dividends. The high cost of the land bank -
at an average Pounds 25,000 a plot (land acquired since the year end has
cost Pounds 33,000 a plot) - may cause some eyebrows to rise but is
justified, says Bryant, compared with an average selling price in 1994
expected to be at least Pounds 100,000 a home. Gearing currently is about 25
per cent, compared with 3 per cent at the half year, but the balance sheet
can afford it. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m would put the company on a
prospective p/e of more than 20. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 42m in 1994-95
would still leave the group on a multiple in the late teens. This rating may
be justified but seems unlikely to rise much further with most of the good
news already in the share price.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 5% rise to Pounds 151m
at WMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management International, the aggressive UK-quoted arm of the US group
WMX Technologies, yesterday signalled its intention to rein in the
acquisition programme which has underpinned its growth in a difficult
market.
Mr Nigel Wilson, finance director, said the company intended to focus on
organic growth in east Asia, rather than on expansion through acquisition in
Latin America or a more difficult Europe.
'The opportunities there are coming much more quickly than expected,' Mr
Wilson said. Between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m had been set aside for
acquisitions, against Pounds 170m last year.
Total capital investment was also being sharply curtailed, from Pounds 400m
to Pounds 275m.
The purchase of 48 companies was largely responsible for the group's 5 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 150.9m for the year to
end-December. Sales rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 941.4m.
On a like-for-like basis, however, sales were 6 per cent lower.
The UK had returned the strongest performance, partly due to the joint
venture with Wessex Water and the cost benefits from acquis-itions.
WMI suffered a downturn in sales in Italy, where political problems were
holding up approvals for landfill sites.
Mr Wilson said he was confident that WMI would see some organic growth in
Europe this year, in spite of the current economic difficulties. Legislation
was creating new opportunities in France and Germany, he added.
In the fourth quarter, WMI reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
40.9m to Pounds 40.5m, due to a turnround in interest. WMI paid Pounds 1.9m,
against a gain of Pounds 6.9m. Sales were 12 per cent up at Pounds 250.6m.
In line with previous policy, there is no dividend. Annual earnings per
share increased from 23.3p to 26.5p.
COMMENT
WMI is taking the logical step of pulling itself away from a stagnant
continental Europe. Yet while east Asia holds great promise, it is not
expected to have a significant impact in the short term. Forecasts are for
Pounds 166m this year, leaving a prospective p/e of 23.2. This looks more
than up with events at the moment, although further out the focus on east
Asia may prove more attractive. Perhaps the board will even reward
shareholders with a dividend payment next year.

FT  08 FEB 94 / John Sculley quits Spectrum and starts legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Sculley, who last year was ousted from Apple Computer, yesterday
resigned as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information
Technologies, the small wireless data communications technology company he
joined in October.
'Certain aspects of Spectrum's business are not what they were represented
to be when I joined the company,' Mr Sculley said yesterday. In a Dollars
10m (Pounds 6.6m) lawsuit filed against Mr Peter Caserta, president of
Spectrum, Mr Sculley charged that he was induced to join the company by
'fraudulent misrepresentation and omissions regarding Spectrum's financial
affairs, legal and regulatory prob lems and its technical and human
resources'.
Mr Sculley's move to Spectrum, four days after he resigned as Apple's
chairman, shocked observers. He had sought the top post at IBM earlier last
year and was a potential candidate for chairman of Eastman Kodak. Instead,
he chose Spectrum, a Dollars 100m little-known New York state company that
has not reported a profit in its 10-year life and has a history of disputes
with investors and competitors. Spectrum's stock price soared 46 per cent on
Mr Sculley's appointment to Dollars 11.50. According to Mr Sculley's
lawsuit, Mr Caserta and other Spectrum officials then made huge profits on
their stock options. Mr Sculley, granted extensive stock options when he
joined Spectrum, stood to make a paper profit of Dollars 73m. Mr Sculley
said he had not exercised any of his stock options, and had surrendered all
options to acquire Spectrum stock. Yesterday Spectrum's stock plummeted to
Dollars before closing at Dollars 2 1/4 , down from Friday's close of
Dollars 5 9/16 .
Mr Sculley charges he was not informed by Mr Caserta that the company was
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and he was
deliberately misinformed about the company's accounting practices.
But Spectrum claims that 'prior to and during his term at Spectrum, Mr
Sculley was fully aware of the circumstances he now cites as his reasons for
departing'.
Spectrum further alleges that Mr Sculley's resignation 'is clearly in
violation of his employment agreement. . . and disregards his
responsibilities to its (Spectrum) shareholders'.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Granada-LWT talks break down over bid price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks aimed at agreeing an improved offer by Granada Group for London
Weekend Television broke down last night, with sources close to Granada
accusing LWT of being 'totally unrealistic about price'.
This will prompt speculation in the London market that Granada will have to
raise its hostile bid - a six-for-five share offer, now worth about Pounds
700m, with a 528p-a-share cash alternative.
The talks were the first since Granada launched its hostile takeover bid two
months ago.
The sides had always seemed far apart, with some LWT executives suggesting
privately that a 200p a share increase could be needed.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the rental, television and
leisure group, had sought the exploratory discussions with Sir Christopher
Bland, the LWT chairman. He was seeking clues on what it would take to reach
an agreement.
Granada first approached LWT over the weekend, but Sir Christopher did not
want to meet until after his final circular to shareholders went out on
Sunday. The talks were expected to explore whether there was any possibility
of persuading the LWT management, which owns 10 per cent of the company, to
recommend a Granada takeover.
Mr Robinson has until Sunday to improve the bid or declare it final.
Yesterday LWT's share price held up better than Granada's, which fell 16p to
570p. LWT was unchanged at 705p.
The issue has to be resolved by February 27 following the clearance of the
Granada bid by the Department of Trade and Industry. The main condition is
that combined advertising sales should account for no more than 25 per cent
of total television advertising.

FT  08 FEB 94 / ICI agrees Pounds 60m sale to BASF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASF has agreed to pay about Pounds 60m for ICI's polypropylene
manufacturing operations, more than a year after the sale was proposed.
The deal marks the UK chemicals company's exit from European polypropylene
manufacture and the German group's elevation from seventh to second biggest
producer in Europe.
The businesses, scheduled to be transferred on March 1, include plants at
Rozenburg, Netherlands, and Wilton, in Teesside in the UK. Some 460 workers
will be transferred.
For ICI, the sale is part of a strategy to concentrate on businesses in
which it has a strong global presence. As only the eighth biggest producer
in Europe, with annual losses of about Pounds 20m, polypropylene was ripe
for disposal.
Nevertheless, the conclusion of the sale is only a partial success. ICI had
wanted to swap the operations for BASF's acrylics business. That foundered
in November when the two sides could not agree a price.
Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, the dominant union at ICI's Teesside plants, welcomed the
sale. 'Transition to BASF is the best possible move,' he said.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Martin quits GrandMet for KKR-backed venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist, is to
provide the financial backing for a new London-based investment firm set up
by Mr Ian Martin, who resigned yesterday as deputy chairman of Grand
Metropolitan, the food and drinks group.
Glenisla, a privately owned investment vehicle led by Mr Martin with Mr
Henry Kravis and Mr George Roberts of KKR on its board, plans to seek
undervalued businesses ripe for reorganisation in the UK and elsewhere in
western Europe.
Mr Martin, whose resignation as a GrandMet director had been expected since
September when he lost the contest for the chief executive's job, said these
could be in a wide range of industries - though not in food and drinks
because he remains a consultant to GrandMet with a non-competition clause.
Explaining the arrangement with KKR, Mr Martin said: 'KKR brings the
financial muscle and I bring the transformation management skills.'
KKR has about Dollars 2bn available for investment, only a small percentage
of which will find its way into Glenisla. But the investment will give the
firm its first toehold in the European market.
KKR has a portfolio of 18 investments in US companies with an estimated
market value of Dollars 13bn. Most of these were built up during the 1980s,
when the firm became famous for a series of big leveraged buy-outs,
culminating in the blockbusting hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco, the US
tobacco and food group, for Dollars 26bn in 1989.
But with the end of the 1980s buy-out boom, KKR has had to change direction.
Buy-outs are still at the core of its strategy, but they tend to be much
smaller and much less highly leveraged.
One element in KKR's new strategy is the so-called 'build-up' approach,
where local managers are backed to make a series of acquisitions which
create a presence in an otherwise fragmented industry. In the last few years
KKR has backed a number of 'build-up' ventures including K-III
Communications, which has made more than 20 small acquisitions in the US
publishing business.
Glenisla's activities could be modelled on these. Mr Martin plans to recruit
a small team of between four and six people to help him identify targets. He
said Glenisla would probably focus on acquisitions 'of Pounds 300m and
upwards'.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Investors hold breath at signs of a turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although there was no sign of Black Monday panic on world financial markets
yesterday, the Federal Reserve's decision to increase US interest rates may
have marked a turning point.
'The Fed's move has had quite a significant psychological impact,' according
to Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S G Warburg
Securities. 'It might take time for investors to get their confidence back.'
The long rally in equity and bond markets has been fuelled by low interest
rates. Investors, dissatisfied with the returns from cash, have moved into
other financial assets. In 1993, US investors poured money into overseas
equities, in particular emerging markets.
Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy,
said the rise in US short-term rates was not sufficient to cause investors
to move money out of US equities and into cash. But 'it does mark the end of
the emerging market bubble. Those markets which are dollar-linked, such as
Hong Kong, have taken a lot of loose hot money.' The Hong Kong stock market
fell 6.1 per cent yesterday and later indicative trading in London pointed
to a further 3 per cent decline.
If US investors are tempted to take profits, Mr Hughes believes, it is
likely to be from emerging markets, but they may only divert money to
Europe.
However, it is too early to tell whether US private investors, who have been
pouring money into mutual funds, will take fright at the shift in investment
conditions and attempt to redeem their holdings. That could trigger a sharp
sell-off in equities.
Another key question is whether the Fed's move will influence the
Bundesbank. The dollar rose sharply against the D-Mark on Friday and some
analysts argue that fear of a weakening D-Mark will prevent the Bundesbank
from cutting rates. Indeed, Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche
Bank, was quoted as saying in Washington that the German authorities might
even raise rates if the D-Mark weakened substantially. Such a move would be
a threat to European bond and equity markets, which have been anticipating
lower rates.
However, in a research note, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief international economist
at Goldman Sachs, said that domestic fundamentals, in particular declining
inflation pressures, were still likely to dominate in Europe. It was
possible for interest rates to fall in Europe while rising in the US - as in
1983-84.
Mr Hughes believes that the Bundesbank pays more attention to the real
(inflation-adjusted) rather than the nominal exchange rate. On a real basis,
the D-Mark may have become overvalued during the 1992-93 exchange rate
mechanism crises and thus the Bundesbank may be happy to see a decline in
the nominal rate.
The threatened market meltdown did not take place yesterday, but investors
and analysts are being forced to reconsider their views.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Rise in consumer borrowing but retail sales show decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upward trend in consumer borrowing was boosted further in December,
suggesting that the tax increases set out in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first
Budget had little early impact on demand.
Lending to consumers by finance houses, through unsecured loans from
building societies and through bank credit cards under the Visa and
Mastercard systems rose by a net seasonally adjusted Pounds 443m in the
month, up from Pounds 290m in November.
The Central Statistical Office said that, apart from a high September
figure, December's rise was the strongest since January 1990. New credit
advanced to consumers in December was Pounds 4.98bn, just Pounds 4m more
than in November, but a record monthly high. Finance houses boosted their
net lending to Pounds 398m in December, the highest figure for five years,
as spending on vehicles and consumer durables grew. There were small
increases in net lending by building societies and on bank credit cards.
Analysts were surprised by the strength of consumer borrowing. The City
expected a net lending figure nearer Pounds 290m. The rise was in the face
of a disappointing drop in retail sales of 0.2 per cent in December, but
most analysts believe the trend is still upwards.
Other figures published yesterday added to the picture of continued economic
growth. Housing starts rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.7 per cent in the
three months to December over the previous three months. A survey by the
accountancy firm Touche Ross showed that business failures in January were
at their lowest level since December 1989.
The Treasury said the credit figures were consistent with the upward trend
in consumer spending over the past year and a half. Officials said net
lending in the three months to December was at levels last seen before the
recession. In the three months to December, net lending rose to Pounds
1.05bn from Pounds 919m in the previous three months.
However, more comprehensive net lending figures, which include bank
overdrafts and personal loans, showed a drop in the fourth quarter of 1993
to Pounds 634m from Pounds 714m previously.

FT  08 FEB 94 / US seeks Dollars 58bn cut in deficit: Clinton presents
budget calling for sharp reductions in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton yesterday presented a budget proposing sharp
spending cuts and a reduction in next year's deficit from Dollars 234.8bn
(Pounds 156bn) to Dollars 176.1bn.
More than 300 individual programmes will see funding cut below 1994 levels,
including more than 115 which will be cancelled outright, if Congress agrees
with Mr Clinton's proposals.
While the overall federal budget will rise by 2.3 per cent to Dollars
1,520bn, the increase comes entirely in mandatory programmes such as
Medicare and social security, which now make up almost half the federal
budget, and in interest payments on the national debt, which will eat up
Dollars 213bn.
Discretionary spending, which the administration and the Congress must
assign in budget laws each year, will decline from Dollars 550.1bn this year
to Dollars 542.4bn in the 1995 fiscal year, which starts on October 1.
The administration said that, if Mr Clinton's healthcare reform bill was
enacted, the 1995 deficit would be even lower, at Dollars 165.1bn.
The political battle is unlikely to be as fierce as last year, when Mr
Clinton needed the casting vote of vice-president Al Gore to pass his first
budget, particularly as the only tax increase proposed is a rise in the
cigarette tax from 24 cents to 99 cents a packet, already announced to
contribute to the cost of healthcare reform.
But the administration still faces tough fights in Congress before the
budget becomes law in the shape of a framework budget resolution - which
theoretically should pass by April 15 - and 13 separate appropriation bills
defining spending in 13 categories, which must pass before the end of the
1994 fiscal year on September 30.
The budget drew immediate criticism from Republicans such as Senator Pete
Domenici, who complained that the money saved from spending cuts would go to
increased spending on other programmes rather than to reducing the deficit,
and Senator John McCain, who was worried about the depth of the reduction in
military spending.
The fiercest resistance, however, may come from Mr Clinton's own Democratic
party, where many are anxious about cuts in some low-income housing and
welfare programmes.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said the administration had had to
find Dollars 24bn of cuts to keep within the budget caps imposed by last
year's budget law, which froze discretionary spending for the next five
years at 1993's level.
Of that total, Dollars 8bn was to cover the cost of higher spending on Mr
Clinton's investment priorities, such as pre-school education and job
training, crime prevention, scientific research and road construction.

FT  08 FEB 94 / EU to probe Ryanair claim of unfair pricing by Aer Lingus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union officials are investigating claims of unfair pricing against
Aer Lingus, the Irish state-run airline, after a dawn raid on the company on
Friday in which documents were seized and staff interviewed.
Officials from the competition directorate in Brussels arrived at the
airline's Dublin head office shortly after it opened. They photocopied
several hundred pages of documents and spoke to managers and staff dealing
with fares and marketing policy
The raid follows complaints about Aer Lingus's fares structure by Ryanair,
one of the state airline's main competitors on the Ireland-UK routes.
Ryanair's principal claim is that Aer Lingus which recently completed a
painful and controversial restructuring, has sharply cut fares on its
Dublin-Birmingham route since Ryanair introduced a new service on the route
last October. Ryanair has lodged a series of complaints with the EU since
the end of last year.
Ryanair, which has been a pioneer of cheap 'no-frills' fares in the busy
Irish-UK market, says Aer Lingus is selling below cost. Ryanair itself
announced plans last week to expand its Ireland-UK route network.
The EU investigation comes just over a month after Aer Lingus received its
first tranche of IPounds 75m (Pounds 72m) of IPounds 175m in new equity from
the Irish government, to finance its restructuring. EU approval for the plan
was given last December, but conditions were imposed, aimed at preventing
Aer Lingus from using the government assistance to weaken its competitors.
Aer Lingus has recently introduced two new lower fares on its UK routes that
have eaten into Ryanair's share of the economy end of the market. It
confirmed that fares on the Birmingham route had been reduced, but as part
of a 'standardisation' of fares on all UK provincial services last month.
The airline said its restructuring at the end of last year, which has cut
IPounds 50m out of annual operating costs, 'has given us opportunities to
introduce new fare structures'. The company insists that the equity
injection is being used solely for the restructuring and that its fare
policy 'fully complies with the EC treaty provisions on competition'.
Aer Lingus was fined IPounds 575,000 by the European Commission in February
last year for refusing to accept British Midland tickets on its flights, in
breach of an agreement between the two airlines set up when British Midland
opened a Dublin-London service in 1989.

food business suffered during the the first half, and not just because of a
shortfall in sales of Pot Noodles. Market share in crisps has been bought
only at the expense of margin, and there has clearly been some anxious
squawking in the Homepride hen house following Unilever's aggressive launch
of Chicken Tonight. Even if the new range of Pot Noodles proves successful,
such pressure seems bound to continue.
That leaves Dalgety stuck with a reputation of limited scope for growth,
which is reflected in its yield of over 5 per cent. Nor does it help that
acquisitions will leave gearing close to 40 per cent at the end of the year.
Dalgety's latest purchases have pushed it more towards specialisation in the
farm business and in the European pet food market.
The latter, in particular, may hold out growth prospects if continental
owners can be persuaded to stop feeding their animals scraps and dish up
some real pet food instead. There may also be attractive opportunities in
the ingredients sector which would help shift the emphasis away from
consumer foods. Dalgety has a history of abstinence where rights issues are
concerned, but it might consider financing some future acquisitions by sales
from its consumer foods portfolio, even if that does involve throwing a few
succulent noodles into the pot.

FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock market turbulence adds another twist of uncertainty to Granada's bid
for LWT. But by itself it is unlikely to alter the outcome, despite the 3
per cent fall in Granada's shares. LWT lost the argument about being big
enough to stand on its own the moment it started lobbying the government for
a change in the franchise rules so that the industry could consolidate. A
stand-alone LWT would look particularly exposed now that Carlton and MAI
have grown so much bigger.
With all possible white knights having seemingly fallen off their chargers,
the battle boils down to a question of price. The market suggests Granada
will have to raise its offer. The 10 per cent rise in LWT's January
advertising revenue supports that view. Granada will surely try to squeeze a
recommendation from LWT's board, but Granada's greater generosity still
seems likely to fall short of LWT's evaluation of its own worth. Arguably,
LWT's case has been bolstered by MAI's readiness to pay a price equivalent
to 27 times Anglia's 1993 television earnings. But Anglia is a highly
attractive television region with a growing and increasingly wealthy band of
viewers. Its low franchise bid also ensures it retains a higher proportion
of advertising revenue. Granada will find it hard to justify matching that
multiple, especially given that LWT is so far removed from Granada's borders
and only broadcasts two and a half days a week. A more modest 10 per cent
increase in its offer may be sufficient to satisfy the market whether LWT
approves or not.

FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The week before a large auction of new Treasury bonds is a strange time for
the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates. On the other hand, bond
traders are doubtless grateful that the Fed did not choose to move a week
later. If dealers had been stuck with the Dollars 11bn of 30-year debt due
to be auctioned on Thursday, the fat bonuses paid at Christmas might have
had to be handed back. And with large slugs of three- and 10-year paper also
being sold this week, the one-point fall in bond prices since the Fed
announcement is probably not sufficient to discount the risks, particularly
since the US output gap has all but closed, and inflationary pressures will
be harder to absorb this year.
Against that, bond yields have risen from 6.25 per cent before the Fed
chairman's comments to Congress a week ago to over 6.40 now. The are also
well above their low point of 5.75 per cent reached last October. Unless the
January inflation statistics produce a nasty surprise, bonds may gather
strength around 6.5 per cent.
There is also little reason to suppose that the torrent of money flooding
into US mutual funds will slow much because of a tiny rise in short rates.
Early Fed action to curb inflation may also keep long yields down. Still,
now the interest rate cycle has finally turned, bonds will find it harder
than equities to make as much forward progress.

FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: After the storm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity markets weathered the initial storm rather well. By yesterday
afternoon Wall Street was on its way back up again. The UK pared initial
losses to close with the FT-SE 100 down only 56 points, which still leaves
it almost exactly level with where it ended 1993. Since the dollar was also
consolidating around DM1.76, it looks as though the worst fears of what
might happen when the Federal Reserve started to tighten were overdone.
There was no sign yesterday of a wholesale retreat by private investors or a
reversal of the flows of US money that have been fuelling international
markets.
Whether that means world equities can continue on a carefree upward path is
another matter. The Fed's action must make some difference, particularly for
more over-heated markets such as Hong Kong. Financial markets had generally
assumed the Fed would tighten during 1994. Now that the move has started,
attention must focus on the still unanswerable questions of how much more is
to come and how soon.
As they got over their initial shock, markets yesterday were tending to the
view that the Fed may have lessened the risk of much larger interest rate
rises later that would certainly curb the US recovery. By beginning a
gradual process of tightening now it may instead prolong growth. That
thought is comfort to equity markets, especially those in Europe which can
look forward to some further interest rate cuts. The UK, for example, need
not abandon hope of seeing an index level of 3,500 again this year. But much
does depend on earnings living up to expectations. And markets everywhere
will scrutinise each monthly US inflation more nervously than before.

Ofwat wants the companies to apply tests for something called
'heteroscedasticity', using models of the 'stochastic cost frontier'.
Boffins are stumped and even Ofwat hints that these are deep waters. Its
letter adds: 'The bottom line is that the estimated decompositions of the
error variance for the models. . . are very different and hence not too much
reliance should be placed on them.' Sure thing.

One big problem faces Finland's new president, Martti Ahtisaari - will he be
able to use the recently built library in the new official presidential
residence in Helsinki?
The library's architect obviously subscribes to the myth that all Finns are
slimline, thanks to their predilection for winter sports. The spiral
stairway to the library's top floor is correspondingly narrow.
But the amply proportioned Ahtisaari admits that the only form of sport he
enjoys is taking a sauna. Will he be able to squeeze his way up the stairs?
Ahtisaari thinks he will - so as long as he takes a deep breath.
But which state president has time for reading anyway?

Funny how the enthusiasms of Tory MPs wax and wane. A few months back they
were up in arms about over-regulation of seaside hotels and boarding houses.
Socialist local authorities, they said, were tangling them up in
bureaucracy.
But now Michael Heseltine has agreed to add many of the rules to his planned
red-tape bonfire, the same MPs have come up with another problem. Too many
small hoteliers in Bournemouth and Bridlington are allegedly lowering the
tone of the resorts by letting out their rooms to social welfare claimants.
But there is a solution, oh yes; tougher regulation by local authorities.

<TEXT>
The odd thing about Ian Martin's decision to get into bed with Wall Street
deal-makers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is that he's not making a clean break
with Grand Metropolitan, where he has been chief wheeler-dealer for nearly a
decade.
Ever since he lost out to George Bull in the race to succeed Sir Allen
Sheppard as chief executive, Martin has looked underemployed. He turned down
the chairmanship of one Footsie company because it was not enough to keep
'his adrenalin running' and is now hoping to make a lot of money doing what
he does best - sorting out underperforming businesses with the help of KKR's
wealthy backers.
However, he seems to have ruled out any involvement in the food and drink
industry he knows so well because he remains a GrandMet employee. Martin is
reluctant to be drawn on how long he will remain on the payroll, but hints
it will be as long as Sir Allen Sheppard remains chairman. Surely Sir Allen
cannot be worried that Martin might make a nuisance of himself by bidding
for some of GrandMet's less flattering parts?

Who will succeed Niels Ersboll, the suave Dane who since 1980 has served as

Front-runner is thought to be Philippe de Schoutheete, Belgium's ambassador

Belgian presidency. But Juergen Trumpf, formerly German ambassador to the EU
and now a top Bonn bureaucrat, has also thrown his hat into the ring.
The Germans feel they get a raw deal when it comes to the highest levels of

maybe they only have themselves to blame?

A university campus is an unlikely place to decide the future of a big
multinational. But Canada's McCain brothers, controllers of the potato-chip
and frozen-food company which bears their name, have hired the University of
New Brunswick's conference centre to sort out a dispute over who should
succeed them as chief executive.
The McCains and their lawyers have booked the entire centre, which includes
11 meeting rooms and a 166-seat auditorium. The arbitration - being heard by
a New Brunswick judge - has already been under way for a month and is likely
to continue for at least another week or two. Whoever loses is expected to
appeal.
Proceedings are secret. But it's understood that among the parade of
business-star witnesses will be that well known Mr Fix-it, Sir Graham Day,
ex-chairman of British Aerospace, Rover, Cadbury Schweppes, PowerGen,
British Shipbuilders etc, etc. . .
Day, who has 'retired' to an office in a local Halifax law firm, declines to
say whose side he takes, though he knows both Harrison and Wallace well. But
since Wallace is said to have closed his case last week, it looks like Day
will be speaking up for Harrison who is trying to fight off his younger
brother's efforts either to split McCain's in two or buy the rest of the
family's shares. Either way, someone's going to get frozen out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shift from fixed to floating rate lending in the British financial
system was one of the more profound institutional changes to emerge from the
inflationary experience of the 1970s and 1980s. There are now signs of a
move in the opposite direction, notably in the mortgage market, where fixed
interest lending is gradually lengthening in maturity. What are the
implications for financial stability and the workings of monetary policy?
The widespread use of floating rate debt contracts was a natural response by
creditors to unanticipated inflation. In effect, it protected the banking
system from the risk inherent in borrowing short and lending long because
worries about uncertainty over the future price level were passed to the
borrower. The instinctive assumption about the implications for the UK,
where the ratio of household debt stands at nearly 60 per cent of GNP, might
be that demand would respond more rapidly to changes in interest rates in a
floating rate environment.
That, indeed, is the argument advanced in a paper on changes in the UK debt
structure in the forthcoming Bank of England Bulletin. And it puts the case
for an equal and opposite effect if there is a significant increase in the
private sector's use of fixed rate debt, arguing that interest rates could
be increased quickly, but at lower cost to the private sector. Yet past
experience suggests that the monetary transmission mechanism can be more
complex.
Certainly in the US in the first half of the 1980s, the shift to floating
rates appeared, if anything, to make the monetary system less responsive to
central bank discipline than under fixed rates. A combination of
deregulation and the growth of the swaps market inevitably meant that a
bigger change in interest rates was required to bring about a given shift in
demand. In the UK, where floating rate mortgage borrowing plays a more
important part in the monetary transmission mechanism, swaps are unavailable
to the personal sector. But the impact of deregulation on the housing market
meant that it took an exceptionally big rise in base rates from 7.5 per cent
in May 1988 to 15 per cent in October 1989 to knock house prices on the head
in the early 1990s. While the Bank's paper claims to be impressed by the
speed of the market response, it felt remarkably slow both then and now,
because the inflationary psychology took so long to adjust.
How far the maturity of fixed rate lending will continue to extend is a moot
point. The Bank's paper hints, very plausibly, that the personal sector may
not yet have developed an appetite for long-term fixed rate assets, after
the inflationary losses of the past. Nor are the banks and building
societies likely to be anxious to abandon the competitive advantage they
derive from floating rate retail deposits - although their ability to hedge
against mismatched maturities is enhanced by the growth of hedging
instruments. But if the process does continue, there is a clear message for
the tradeable goods sector: it will bear more of the brunt of any future
effort to control inflation because monetary policy will work increasingly
through the exchange rate.

Mr Martti Ahtisaari was elected president of Finland on Sunday. His
experience as a senior UN diplomat should come in useful at a turning-point
in Finnish foreign policy.
If all goes well, Finland will be a member of the EU next year. Like two of
the other three candidate countries (Austria and Sweden), it has a tradition
of neutrality; and like the third (Norway), which belongs to Nato, it has a
direct border with Russia. Enlargement will thus have important implications
for the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP). All four countries
are under pressure to commit themselves to joining the Western European
Union (WEU), which is the EU's defence arm but also the 'European pillar' of
Nato.
They are keeping their options open. Finland has said it will take a
decision only after holding a referendum on EU membership. Given the
popularity of the neutral tradition in the three countries that have it, and
the deep suspicion of all things supranational in Norway, it would not be
surprising if they opt, at least to begin with, for observer status in WEU -
as Denmark and Ireland have done among existing EU members. But Mr Dick
Spring, the Irish foreign minister, has already warned his compatriots this
may not be a tenable long-term option. Ireland, he pointed out in a speech
before Christmas, will have to preside over the conference to revise the
Maastricht treaty in the second half of 1996, which will see a big effort to
adopt a common defence policy, linked explicitly to the Atlantic alliance.
That would be a big change for former neutrals to adjust to, and it will be
understandable if not all of them are prepared to make it at once. Ideally
the whole of the enlarged EU should eventually be linked to Nato. Until that
is possible, at least the link between Nato and WEU should be carefully
preserved. Otherwise, states which belong to both organisations will be in
the awkward position of giving a guarantee to their fellow WEU members, with
which the US would not be associated. Those members or would-be members of
the EU that are not yet prepared to opt clearly for Nato membership should
content themselves with observer status in WEU.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Arms and the dam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The full story behind Britain's decision to give Pounds 234m in aid to help
build a controversial Malaysian dam has not been divulged. But there have
been sufficient revelations to raise concerns over the government's
enthusiastic promotion of the arms trade, the use of its aid budget and the
apparent willingness of ministers to override their own guidelines.
Ministers continue to deny a formal link between aid for the Pergau
hydro-electric dam and a contemporaneous Pounds 1bn arms deal with Malaysia
in the late 1980s. But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has been
forced to admit that the original protocol for the arms deal referred to
'aid in support of non-military aspects'. Though the Malaysians were later
told that aid could not be formally linked to military sales, the fact that
parallel talks continued on arms and the dam makes it hard to believe that
there was not an informal connection.
Linking aid to military sales might not be against British law. But it would
contravene government aid guidelines which ban such quid pro quos and
similar international guidelines drawn up by the Organisation of Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Moreover, quite apart from the apparent link between the Pergau project and
the arms deal, it is already clear that the aid guidelines have been
breached. This is because grants under the UK's Aid and Trade Provision are
supposed to be used only for economically sound projects. Ministers were
warned by Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, that the Pergau dam was uneconomic and would
lead to Malaysian consumers paying more for their electricity.
Ministers have justified their behaviour on the grounds that they were
promoting Britain's interests. Mr Hurd has said he pressed ahead with Pergau
because a commitment had been given by Lady Thatcher, who negotiated the
arms deal when prime minister. To renege on the contract would have been
'very damaging to trade'.
Similarly, Lord Younger, defence secretary at the time, has said: 'Great
Britain plc has come out of all this very well.' Not only has Britain's
defence industry profited out of the Pounds 1bn arms deal. Other industries
have won contracts with Malaysia, following the country's reversal of its
decade-long 'Buy British Last' policy.
Two Commons committees are now investigating this affair. Part of their goal
will obviously be to dig out the facts. Was there a formal link between the
arms deal and aid for Pergau? Have ministers misled parliament? Is there any
connection between the Pergau affair and allegations that the government
suppressed evidence in a criminal case against a Malaysian banker to prevent
embarrassment to the Malaysian government? Why was the Malaysian government
so keen to press ahead with the Pergau project given that it was uneconomic?
Yet MPs should not stop here. They must also debate the issues of public
policy. How enthusiastically should Britain be promoting arms exports?
Should the aid budget be used to boost even non-military exports? Would it
be better to have a separate 'slush fund' explicitly devoted to promoting
exports or would even that be a waste of taxpayers' money? What, in fact, is
the purpose of the aid budget? If the Pergau dam affair leads to honest
debate of these questions, it will have served a useful purpose.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Jitters below a calm surface: The potential impact of the
Banesto affair on other Spanish banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A vast red banner bearing the figure eight and a percentage sign covers one
side of Banco Santander's office tower in the Madrid financial district. It
advertises the latest shot in the mortgage 'wars' among Spanish banks over
the past year. 'The largest trading screen in Spain,' says one banker,
gesturing at the banner from his office window.
The intense competition for retail banking business is one problem facing
players in what has been one of the world's most stable and profitable
banking markets. A second, potentially larger problem emerged a month ago
when the Bank of Spain dismissed the old management of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto). The central bank has now put together a rescue plan to
cover a Pta605bn (Pounds 2.9bn) 'hole' in Banesto's balance sheet.
The plight of Banesto has raised questions about other banks - particularly
those such as Banco Central Hispano, which, like Banesto, holds substantial
equity stakes in industrial companies. 'Until there is a full explanation of
what happened at Banesto, it is logical to ask which other bank will be
next,' says Mr Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of IBCA, the
London-based bank ratings agency.
Banesto's problems emerged when Bank of Spain inspectors discovered its
Dollars 61bn of assets had been over-valued. The provisions made by the bank
against loan losses were insufficient and its equity holdings were not worth
as much as it claimed. This was despite regular inspections by the Bank of
Spain, and monitoring by Banesto's adviser, the US bank J P Morgan.
Some observers, however, argue that Banesto was a special case. It was run
by Mr Mario Conde, a colourful industrialist whose methods were distrusted
by other banks; it expanded its loan book very fast between 1988 and 1991;
it was heavily exposed to Spain's recession; and it cut margins between its
deposits and loans as it fought to increase its market share.
'Banesto was an exceptional bank, and its problems should not have a big
knock-on effect on others,' says Mr Julian Hollis, an analyst at S G
Warburg, the London-based investment bank. Others point to steady profits
reported by other banks for 1993. 'The high-quality Spanish banks achieved
quite a creditable performance last year,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, of
securities house Lehman Brothers.
Not surprisingly, directors of other Spanish banks agree that the sector is
in a good state. Santander last week reported a 17.8 per cent rise in
after-tax profits to Pta77.9bn. Mr Juan Inciarte, chief executive, says the
fact that banks have maintained profits in the midst of recession indicates
their strength. 'The basic profitability of Spanish banks is without
question,' he says.
The strength of Spanish banks has enabled them to survive the first shocks
created by Banesto's problems. But, in spite of the optimism of many
observers, the longer-term impact could still be damaging.
The plan to clean up and re-capitalise Banesto (see accompanying article)
could affect other banks in three ways.
First, they will have to increase contributions to the deposit guarantee
fund - the state-run scheme which uses contributions from the country's
banks to insure deposits - to compensate for the Pta285bn the fund will
spend on acquiring Banesto assets. The drag the fund has on banks' earnings
had been easing since the last banking crisis; now it will grow.
The second effect is that banks have been asked by the Bank of Spain to
contribute to a Pta180bn rights issue, buying shares which eventually they
will try to sell. The banks could gain from this investment, but if
Banesto's difficulties are not solved by the latest recapitalisation, it may
have to be rescued again through a takeover. Each of the large banks faces
the risk of being prodded into saving Banesto by the central bank.
The third effect is less direct. One reason why estimates of Banesto's
difficulties have varied markedly is that it is impossible to determine an
exact market value of any bank's smaller loans and assets. Banks gradually
adjust the value of their assets over economic cycles by making - and
sometimes reducing - provisions against bad debt.
Because Banesto's assets were so suddenly devalued, some observers believe
other banks may be galvanised into taking a more conservative view of their
own loans. 'When one bank is declared sick, then others start to re-examine
their assets, and some are liquidated,' says Mr Carlos Martinez de Campos,
Barclays Bank's director of European retail banking.
The effects would have to be very large to weaken the other private banks
significantly. Through their large branch networks, Spanish banks have
gathered cheap deposits from unsophisticated rural customers. They use these
funds to make personal and small business loans at relatively high interest
rates.
Until Santander broke an informal cartel in 1989 by offering
interest-bearing deposit accounts, this ensured one of the highest net
interest margins (the profit margin on lending and deposit taking) of any
banking market. The banks were also forced by the Bank of Spain to maintain
high capital ratios, and make conservative provisions against loan losses.
The combination led to high returns on strong capital.
But the Banesto incident comes at an awkward time for Spanish banks. The
sector has been suffering the consequences of one of the country's deepest
post-war recessions. This has pushed the ratio of problem loans to its
highest point since the banking crisis of the late 1970s, during which 50
banks had to be bought and refloated by Spain's deposit guarantee fund.
There are other uncertainties facing Spanish banks:
Competition has increased both for loans and for deposits. Santander's
latest mortgage campaign follows similar deposit 'wars'. This has eroded the
net interest margin of the top Spanish banks from 4.6 per cent in 1988 to
3.2 per cent in 1992. The fact that the margin in France and Germany is
below 2 per cent indicates the potential for a continuing squeeze.
Mr Hollis of S G Warburg says that banks face pressure on margins as
customers shop around more. The banks may in turn grow better at protecting
their margins by using financial derivatives, such as options, but it is
likely to be a losing battle. 'The thing you can guarantee is that margins
will erode as customers get more sophisticated,' says Mr Hollis.
The Bank of Spain's effectiveness as a supervisor has been put under
scrutiny for the first time since the 1970s banking crisis, when it was
widely perceived to have been lax and ineffective in monitoring banks. Since
then, it has generally been assumed to be so rigorous that investors could
trust Spanish banks' assessments of their asset value.
Following the 1970s banking crisis, the central bank has built up a team of
160 inspectors. Spain has not signed accords drawn up by the Basle-based
committee of international bank supervisors because it prefers its own
rules. 'International standards are not high enough. They are too
imprecise,' says one official. This iconoclastic approach will come under
greater scrutiny from investors.
The pressure on bank's revenues is not confined to their traditional lending
and deposit business; trading income is also under pressure. Banks
maintained their earnings last year because they were able to gain revenue
from other sources - for instance by increasing earnings from foreign
exchange and capital markets operations. Reductions in short-term interest
rates also increased the value of their bond portfolios.
But such earnings will not recur this year. Mr Jose Garay, director of the
Chemical Bank in Spain, says that banks gained enormously from the four
percentage point fall in short-term interest rates in 1993. This year, they
will be forced to depend on traditional banking operations. 'I think this is
going to be a very hard year for some banks,' he says.
Banks in other countries have responded to such pressures by cutting costs
through reductions in branches and staff. But the potential for cuts is
limited. Although Spanish banks have large branch networks, they typically
employ relatively few staff in each branch. Furthermore, strict labour laws
make it difficult for banks to dismiss staff compulsorily.
These factors have made Spanish banks look forward to the end of recession
with eagerness. Investors' confidence in the sector has survived the Banesto
upset, but it could be sapped by a further squeeze on revenues and the value
of assets. For the moment, banks have avoided being tarred with the same
brush as Banesto; their grace period may not be indefinite.

FT  08 FEB 94 / A question of value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past week, Mr Alfredo Saenz has been engaged in a bizarre argument.
The acting chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) has been trying to
convince shareholders that the bank is worth less than they think.
Mr Saenz's effort seems odd to an outsider, given that most company chairmen
try to do the opposite. Yet squabbles over the true worth of Banesto have
become a daily occurrence in Madrid since the Bank of Spain intervened on
December 28 to dismiss its management and install Mr Saenz's team.
The differences in views between the new management and shareholders became
apparent last week when Banesto's shares were refloated after being
suspended at Pta1,995 (Pounds 9.47p) each at the time of the intervention.
Mr Saenz's plan to restore the bank to health, and absorb an estimated
Pta605bn overvaluation of assets, includes a write-down of the nominal value
of shares - their value in the bank's balance sheet - from Pta700 to Pta400.
But Banesto shares yesterday closed at Pta760, placing the market
capitalisation at well over Mr Saenz's estimate. This demand indicates that
either investors think Banesto was not in as bad a shape as the authorities
claimed - or they believe the rescue plan makes it a good investment.
Either way, the differing valuations could spark a more serious dispute
between participants in the proposed rescue. These include Banesto itself,
the other Spanish banks being asked to contribute, and existing
shareholders, who face a big dilution of their shares.
The most significant investor is the Corsair Fund, the Dollars 1.1bn fund
managed by the US bank J P Morgan, which advised Banesto's former
management. Corsair invested Dollars 175m in a placing of shares at Pta1,900
each last summer. This stake would lose value significantly in the rescue
plan.
If Banesto's shareholders approve, the bank will be recapitalised via a
Pta180bn issue, with new shares priced at the new nominal value of Pta400.
The deposit guarantee fund, which uses contributions from the country's
banks to insure deposits, will acquire close to 80 per cent of Banesto's
equity, and that held by existing shareholders will be diluted.
The deal is structured to encourage the banks to take part in a crucial
aspect of the plan. The banks will help remove poor loans with a
written-down value of Pta285bn from Banesto's balance sheet. They and the
Bank of Spain will each provide half that amount.
But the existing shareholders may object to the part of the plan involving a
dilution of their stakes. Because the capital increase will come via a share
placing with the deposit guarantee fund rather than a rights issue, existing
shareholders will be unable to take part.
Some are thought to be taking legal advice on how they might challenge the
plan. They could question the deposit guarantee fund's right to underwrite a
capital increase by itself or its right to issue new shares at a nominal
value well below current trading levels.
Under the terms of the rescue plan, the fund will publicly auction its
Banesto stake this year, and will keep a tranche of this sale for a
'strategic buyer'. This is likely to be a large bank, which could end up
controlling between 20 and 30 per cent of Banesto.
Banesto's existing shareholders will, in theory, be able to exercise their
rights to buy shares in this auction. But it is unclear what price they will
be asked to pay for keeping the size of their stakes. Nor has it been
decided whether the 'strategic buyer' will get preferential terms.
Another point of contention could be how Banesto assets are to be sold to
the banks and the Bank of Spain. Because the poor loans may turn out to be
worth more than Banesto estimates, shareholders may try to ensure the banks
do not benefit excessively.
These tensions will come to a head by the time of Banesto's shareholders'
meeting on March 26. Unless Mr Saenz has by then succeeded in talking down
the value of shares, there will be substantial potential for conflict
between Banesto, its existing shareholders and Spain's other large banks.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Many into one will go: Partnerships to spur UK economic
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past two months the telephones have been ringing almost non-stop at
Kent County Council. Inquiries are pouring in about a radical plan to
transform the way publicly funded support for business is delivered within
the county.
In the first proposal of its kind, the council would merge its Pounds
3.5m-a-year economic development unit - which provides support for business
 -with Kent Training and Enterprise Council, one of 82 private sector-led
bodies in England and Wales established by the government to improve the
nation's skills. This trail-blazing plan would mean the public sector
handing over its roles as a promoter of inward investment and physical
regeneration to the private sector.
The merger, promoted by Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and
chairman of the Tec, is not yet assured, though agreement has been reached
in principle and a new chief executive chosen. Tough negotiations on a host
of prickly issues remain - such as the extent of elected councillors'
influence in setting future economic priorities.
While the boldness of Kent's approach has sparked intense interest, it has
also highlighted the less vigorous attitude towards partnership between the
public and private sectors displayed by many county councils and Tecs. A
recent report by Professor Robert Bennett, of the London School of
Economics, said Tecs appeared generally to be 'floundering in the field of
economic development'.
When the government set up the Tecs and 22 Local Enterprise Companies, their
Scottish equivalents, in 1991, the aim was to bring greater cohesion in
delivering aid to local business. The Tecs, which also administer government
training programmes, would establish partnerships with public sector and
other local bodies to spearhead a grassroots industrial strategy.
So far the achievements are modest, though some Tecs have devised
imaginative schemes. Devon and Cornwall, for instance, has set up a West
Country Development Corporation, a public-private partnership designed to
produce an overview of economic needs.
This example is the exception rather than the norm. So what is to be done?
'Some incremental changes are required, learning from the lessons of the
first three years,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, which has presented its own shopping list
of reforms. Two problems identified by the CBI were:
Inflexible and bureaucratic budgets. The government earmarks most of the
Tecs' Pounds 2.8bn a year of funding for set programmes involving training
the unemployed, stimulating in-company training and fostering economic
development. Tecs are unable to tap certain funds if they do not meet the
precise terms and conditions of the contract.
The budget issue could be addressed over the next few months. Tecs are set
to go into battle with the government over funding - and some say they could
sustain budget cuts if they had more flexibility. Confusion about the Tecs'
mission and role. Several government departments work with Tecs and there
have been confused and conflicting messages over priorities. The government
has said Tecs should pay more attention to their enterprise role - but such
activities only command a small part of their funding.
The government may be going some way to addressing this problem. From April,
two institutional changes could have a significant impact on Tecs and their
role in local economic regeneration.
First, 10 Integrated Regional Offices (IROs) are to be created, combining
the local departments of environment, transport, employment and trade and
industry. The intention is to bring coherence to government programmes at
regional level.
Second, as part of this change, 20 existing programmes for regeneration and
economic development will have their funding pooled within the so-called
single regeneration budget, to be administered locally by the 10 IROs.
According to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary and the Tecs' main
paymaster: 'The old patchwork quilt of initiatives will become, as it were,
a seamless duvet at the local level.'
For the first time, bodies that traditionally bid for regeneration funds,
such as local authorities, will be obliged to involve the private sector -
in other words, the Tecs. Mr Hunt said last week: 'We need to see effective
local partnerships coming forward to take full advantage of the potential
these new developments have for local regeneration. These partnerships will
only succeed in winning funding for their initiatives if the private sector
is fully involved.'
How effective the changes will be in co-ordinating local economic plans
remains a moot point. But big opportunities are being offered to those Tecs
most able to define their contribution - for instance, how many young people
they can retrain to work on a construction project.
Demonstrable progress will be slow, however. For while the government
trumpets that the total amount of the single regeneration budget in 1994-95
will be Pounds 1.4bn, only Pounds 100m has not yet been allocated.
Mr Hunt announced a second big shift by the government, which last week gave
the green light to Tecs which want to merge with chambers of commerce.
Mergers between the two organisations was one of the main recommendations of
Prof Bennett's report. Not only could they result in fewer turf wars over
the provision of services, they would also provide Tecs with broader access
to the business community.
Counties such as Kent could point the third way forward at a time when local
government reorganisation is prompting a rethink of many council services.
'The Tec can provide stability at a time of change,' said Sir Alastair
Morton. 'Together we can develop quite a formidable development agency.'
But are such changes enough to strengthen local economic planning? Mr Amin
Rajan, an employment consultant who recently completed a study of Tecs,
said: 'The government probably thinks it has done enough to create a climate
in which better partnerships can be made. But, there are still question
marks over whether that will be sufficient. There is a lot of ground to be
covered before all the local players reach agreement on who does what.'
The proposed Kent merger, and the fact that Tecs may start to merge with
chambers of commerce, indicates a willingness for public and private sector
to work more closely together. But the relationships will take time to
formulate, and the integration of local economic planning could be
frustrated unless the inflexible conditions attached to Tecs' funding are
loosened and they acquire more freedom to act where and how they see fit.

<TEXT>
Sir, While we should applaud Lucy Kellaway's tirade against the murky
bathwater of management jargon ('Time to walk the talk', February 4) please
mind the baby. She is wrong to sneer at companies which have partners rather
than suppliers: partners is a plain word, and companies which turn ordinary
suppliers into partners enjoy a cost and quality-effective business
relationship.
A workforce which 'buys into' a new initiative does much more than accept
it. The commitment which comes from the involvement of the workforce makes
that initiative work, whereas mere acceptance does not. By all means find a
more felicitous phrase, but do not lose the sentiment.

Ukraine's links with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HENRY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Europe's next flashpoint' (February 3), you suggest
the relationship between Germany and Austria as a model for the future
relationship between Russia and Ukraine. The analogy escapes me. These two
countries are totally independent from each other, linked now only by the
schilling being tied to the D-Mark. We should be able to do better than
that.
A better analogy for future Russian-Ukrainian relations is the
Austrian-Slovenian relationship. For most of its history, Slovenia was a
small and prosperous part of Austria. Now it is independent, and the two
peoples can cross back and forth across their border without a passport -
feeling perfectly at home in either land. Slovenia is a democratic,
prosperous and progressive country. Its economy is thriving. The two
countries are closely linked, on a basis of mutual respect.
If Ukraine can evolve in the same direction vis a vis Russia, it will be
doing very well indeed.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Romantic view of cloning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr SIMON L. GOODMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Robert Edwards accepts (Private View, January 29) that
molecular biology cannot address problems such as 'brain' and 'intelligence'
 -but objects to 'cloning' of existing or dead people. But human clones have
always been with us. Identical twins are clones. At the two-cell stage of
embryogenesis the embryo splits and the two cells implant individually.
Yet no one is suggesting that identical twins are sinful or ethically
unsound. So cloning is OK, as long as it is natural. New-age romanticism
raises its head again.
People love to protect their individuality, but the sad biological truth is
that we are to all intents and purposes identical. Even something as odd as
a gorilla or chimpanzee is better than 99 per cent identical to us at the
molecular level. We are simply tuned to re-cognising very small differences.
Presuming we could artificially clone people, a genetically identical group
of humans would not be identical people. No more would Einstein's
monozygotic brother Ben (had he had one) have simultaneously discovered the
theory of relativity with Einstein himself.
To pick the classic example, a re-cloned Hitler would not, in the absence of
outside influences, be likely to paint houses and hate Jews, Slavs and
gypsies.
The environment makes the person. The genes simply make the structures which
respond to the environment.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reward only demonstrated talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN BURNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Executive remuneration has been put firmly back in the public eye. At
the heart of this subject lies the need to understand what executives are
there for. As Edward Lawler suggested (Management: 'New logic is here to
stay', January 28), the value that people add justifies their pay.
Executives need to add to shareholder value - hence Reuters' scheme
('Pioneering package from Reuters', February 1). Unless executives' rewards
are tied to the quality of their decisions in satisfying this need, we
should not be surprised that they can earn more money while company
performance stagnates or declines.
PA Consulting Group's recent survey on executive rewards found that chief
executives who actively subscribe to the notion that executive pay should be
closely aligned to shareholder interests are from companies with a market to
book ratio 50 per cent higher than those where shareholder interest is not a
significant determinant of executive pay. Other results from the survey
indicate the simplistic orthodoxy of 'paying the market rate' goes hand in
hand with significant under-performance.
Shareholders should only pay for demonstrated talent, not the hope or
illusion of talent. Such talent makes the best choices in the allocation of
the company's financial, human and technological resources. The tragedy is
that good executives have inadequate incentive to utilise their talents to
the full.
Executive remuneration will remain a hot potato until it is firmly based on
demonstrated added value. Something-for-nothing share options and other
paraphernalia of the current orthodoxy do not satisfy this criterion.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste is the price we have to pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor RH JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman came close to summarising the current state of the public
services in the UK ('Tidal wave of dirty water', February 5) but was
diverted from the crucial point.
Everyone involved in implementing the radical changes of recent years knows
that, by their nature, they have increased the opportunities for waste,
extravagance and fraud. Everyone involved also knows that the changes have,
by contemporary criteria, improved the management of some parts of the
public services.
What no one yet knows is whether the improvements will be enough to
compensate for the increased fraud. It is this ignorance that has created so
much resentment. In the absence of any evidence that the changes would be
beneficial, we had no choice but to have blind faith in zealots.
Talk of stemming the flow of dirty water, by briefing managers better, is
double-talk. The only ingenuous response to the tidal wave is for the
policy-makers, Canute-like, to demonstrate openly that nothing can be done.
This hardly seems likely. But it does not alter the fact that waste,
extravagance and fraud are part of the price we will necessarily continue to
pay.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover, the cultural cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELSA DUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As someone involved in Anglo-Japanese cross-cultural training, I am appalled
by the lack of sensitivity of Britain's captains of industry, politicians
and the media with regard to the Japanese position in the disastrous affair
of the BMW acquisition of Rover.
The differences in business and cultural practices between Japan and the
west are significant, and our training centre is evidence of the Japanese
commitment to trying to understand the way in which we operate. This
sensible business strategy is obviously unmatched by the British, who
continue to operate with typical British arrogance and short-termism.
From a Japanese perspective it is inconceivable that a 15-year relationship
of mutual help and successful outcome, coupled with an 'in principle' or
'gentleman's' agreement, would be ignored. From British Aerospace's
perspective, the Japanese negotiation and discussion making process, so
different from ours, may have been misunderstood for lack of urgency and
interest.
The government, caught between the EU and a desire for Japanese inward
investment, did nothing, despite having spent years showing off about
British success in attracting Japanese funds. Lord Young chose instead to
tell us we should be proud of being used as cheap labour by the Germans.
Nobody is seriously discussing the appalling economic, political and
diplomatic implications of what is probably a result of culture clash but
will become an unforgettable cautionary tale in Japan.

FT  08 FEB 94 / An island swathed in fog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's relationship with both Europe and the US should be rethought. It
is inchoate, un-structured and in danger of becoming ineffective. These
strictures do not apply to Bosnia alone, although our record there, right up
to yesterday's belated consideration of air strikes, is to say the least
inglorious.
The problem lies much deeper than in the tragic rubble of former Yugoslavia.
There is a need to reconsider UK foreign policy as a whole. For the
foundations upon which it has rested for the past half-century have begun to
crumble. We have no empire, no European identity and no special
relationship. The Commonwealth has become a quaint memento of times past. We
are neither securely at the heart of Europe nor reliably in the hearts of
Americans. Fog has once again begun to obscure the view across the Channel.
Worse, it has lately begun to cover the Atlantic.
Look east first. The government will fight this summer's elections to the
European parliament on a platform constructed with the single purpose of
preserving the unity of the Conservatives. Never mind the precise
phraseology; what will be conveyed to the voters is that the formerly proud
party of Europe is, for the time being, the party of doubts about Europe.
This is not in itself wicked. There is a respectable case to be made for
reducing the power of the Brussels Commission, promoting the devolution of
as many functions as possible to the nation states, and facilitating
enlargement of the union until not only the Scandinavians and Austria but
also the former colonies of the former Soviet empire are included.
In negotiating and subsequently ratifying the Maastricht treaty, Mr John
Major skilfully rehearsed arguments in favour of all these propositions. The
prime minister did so well that the manifesto of the Liberal Democrats, to
be published this morning, talks of a 'democratic, decentralised and diverse
Europe' with heavy emphasis on the transfer of powers from Brussels to
national, regional or local authorities. Mr Major did not quite take up the
latter point. In the Tory mind, subsidiarity stops at Whitehall. To the two
opposition parties, if devolution is good for Brussels, it is even better
for London. There is also a difference of language. The Lib Dems are quite
happy to describe their proposed structure as 'federal'. With luck, this
will infuriate Conservative na-tionalists and Euro-sceptics. They fear this
quintessentially European word.
There is of course another, possibly larger, Conservative faction. Tory
Christian Democrats favour active participation in whatever is happening on
the continent. The most articulate member of this grouping is the trade and
industry secretary, the chap some are beginning to tip for another run at
the office of prime minister. In The Challenge of Europe, published in 1989,
Mr Michael Heseltine observed that 'there are those who fear that in moving
closer to Europe, Britain will lose her identity. On the contrary, I believe
that within Europe she will find a much greater one.' We must, he concluded,
'persuade ourselves that Britain's national interest will be served only by
the determined building up of a stronger, closer Community'. Will Mr
Heseltine campaign on such a basis now?
Somebody has to. Mr Peter Lilley, a usually intelligent cabinet minister,
has derided selected European nationals as social security scroungers. Mr
Michael Portillo, another, has said that all foreigners cheat in their
exams. He has made this absurd remark more often than his apology accounts
for. He should watch out. Single injudicious speeches killed the leadership
hopes of two previous Tory liberals of his stripe - the then Sir Keith
Joseph and the unfortunate Mr John Moore. A British government that aspires
to be influential on the continent should not allow such silliness to
continue. The question is whether Mr Major has the political strength to put
a stop to it. The omens are not good. Britain's present attitude to the
European Union is, shall we say, uncertain. Are all Europeans corrupt,
centralising bureaucrats, scroungers and cheats?
Now look west. The recent outbursts of xenophobia will diminish Mr Major's
administration in American eyes. This is of greater significance than last
week's diplomatic flurry over the admission of Mr Gerry Adams to the US. To
be sure, it appears that there is no love lost between President Bill
Clinton's gung-ho young entourage and the Tories, but that is not of
historic significance. The important point is that Britain's objections to
the Adams visit were well understood, and found to be of less weight than
immediate domestic politics. This may have been an example of either
turpitude or ineptness in the White House, but it is nevertheless telling.
The US is becoming more concerned with Pacific than European affairs. When
it does focus on the old continent, it looks for strength and finds it in
Germany and France. It seeks allies with an aspiration towards European
union, which it does not discern in London.
During most of the 20th century Britain has been adept at juggling
alliances, making friends and influencing events - in foreign office
language, 'punching above its weight'. It is something English diplomats
traditionally do very well. The consequent remnants of the glory years are
often recounted. Britain remains a nuclear power, although to what
diplomatic advantage is unclear. It still has its seat on the Security
Council, although few prudent punters would bet on it retaining this for
another decade. It is in Nato, although what that organisation is for is
unclear. It remains in the Group of Seven, several many-alphabeted European
bodies and, until 1997, Hong Kong. None of this counts on its own. Britain's
ability to influence events depends upon its skill at making bilateral
alliances, here with the US, there with the French, there again with the
Germans.
Since the end of the cold war most politicians in most countries have been
confused about foreign policy. The disorientation of Britain's perception of
its global purpose is doubtless reflected in equivalent debates in
Washington, Bonn and, would the French but admit it, even Paris. But the
others have intellectual anchors. The US has the obligations of a
superpower; continental Europeans their grand design. Britain has only
uncertainty. It must think again.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Betrayed by the system - When it comes to teaching
students how to draw we have been led astray by Tom, Dick and Harry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of taking life drawing into secondary schools would seem as
unexceptionable and high-minded as could be; and where better to celebrate
it than in the Fine Rooms of the Royal Academy of Arts, bastion of the
disciplined and objective study of the model? Since 1989, the Outreach
Programme of the Academy's Education Department has been sending graduates
of the Academy Schools into secondary schools around the country, to conduct
day-long workshops (modern teach-speak) in life drawing.
There is no doubting the sincerity of all those involved in the programme,
nor that, at the most basic level of interest and engagement, some good has
come of it. The children range, as the schools themselves decide, from A
Level and art school aspirants to those who might never consider the art
class to be anything but a good skive, and all are worked extremely hard.
Once the initial shock at being confronted by the nude figure has worn off,
that too proves salutary - for we all have our bodies to live in, and to
look out at the model, unsentimentally and unsalaciously, is only to look at
ourselves.
So far so good, and on first sight the drawings now at the Academy seem full
of expressive life and energy. But when we look again, what else is there to
see but expressive life and energy? The truth begins to dawn that what we
confront is not the fruit of study at all, but of therapy made up to pass as
study. A great deal may well have been felt - of sympathy, excitement and
release - in the making of these drawings, but what has been learnt? And if
learnt, what remembered? Where is information that is actually retrievable,
usable?
What is so saddening is that here we might have had a programme that began
at last to address the heresy that has betrayed art education at all levels
these past 30 years. Instead we have its whole-hearted embrace. Do your own
thing. Express yourself. Be an artist. Have fun - but if it requires any
technical discipline or detached and objective critical consideration, above
all if it is difficult, don't bother.
The game is given away at the start in an introductory display which offers
a glib travesty of the argument. A few dim and tired examples of the
Victorian academic life school are set up, stump and smudge, to show the
bad, dull old ways. There is nothing of Augustus John, or Sickert or Tonks,
in the great Slade tradition of life drawing. Instead, in straight
comparison, oh brave new world, sit those heroes of reform, Victor Pasmore,
Tom Hudson, Harry Thubron and Richard Hamilton, whose example and polemic
led directly to the reformation of the art schools in the 1960s.
Chapter and verse are given in the catalogue. Right up until 1964, the last
year of the old public examination for the National Diploma in Design, the
study of the figure was the central discipline of the art school. 'The nude
and costumed figure is studied in a variety of poses,' runs a Ministry
report of 1950. 'These usually last a full day, but frequently short poses,
action poses, or . . . poses sustained during two or three days are
substituted, so that the student becomes familiar with the figure under a
variety of conditions. By these methods allied to a thorough study of
anatomy it is hoped to equip the student with a sound working knowledge of
the human figure and a technique adequate to its expression.' So it did.
'This limited interpretation of drawing survived until the 1950s', the
catalogue goes on. But then our Tom, Dick, Harry and Victor, all intelligent
men but manifestly indifferent draughtsmen, knew better. 'They engaged the
student in processes of drawing which were exploratory and analytical, as
well as expressive. The figure was no longer viewed as a static object to be
pinned down and delineated. It was a living, complex form which could only
be approached in an 'open' and 'questioning' manner. Drawing became . . . a
dynamic sequence of mark-making which . . . proposed certain ideas about
form . . . The eye searched intently . . . the mind explored . . . There
were no prescribed 'answers'. . . ' Ah. There we have it. No answers.
Drawing at last as exploration and analysis, open and questioning - but no
answers.
When I look back on my own unreformed days and weeks in the life room,
confronted by that fellow human being in living space, whose form in all its
subtle articulation had somehow to be rendered credibly and intelligibly
onto the flat surface of the board, I remember no simple descriptive
exercise, no 'pinning down and delineating'. There were relationships to
measured, shifts, balances and tensions sympathetically to be felt and
understood, and a hand to be disciplined into making the marks that eye and
brain required. Analysis, exploration, discovery, expression? Of course. And
discipline, and technique?
And here are these eager children on their hands and knees, paper on the
floor, model on the move and nothing in fixed relation to anything else, to
be analysed or explored, let alone expressed. But who is there now to teach
them, show them how, and make them do it? They deserve more than this.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Schumann and friends - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidently somebody at BMW has a sense of humour. In the week that the
company surprised many observers in the car industry by revealing itself as
the buyer of Rover, it was also playing a game of hidden identities with
London concert-goers at the Barbican.
The English Chamber Orchestra is giving seven concerts in its spring season
at the hall, each of which includes a mystery item. The audience is invited
to guess what the pieces are and the overall winner gets a prize to the tune
of Pounds 1,000, sponsored by BMW (GB) Ltd. Of recent marketing ploys, this
is undeniably the most novel, though if its aim is to win audience loyalty
for the series, attendances were not encouraging.
The 'Schumann and friends' series incorporated four orchestral concerts.
Each included one of the four Schumann symphonies, paired with some shorter
pieces by his contemporaries. This was an interesting period, when some
composers still felt an allegiance to the musical language and forms of the
classical period, while others were taking flight into the boundless skies
of romanticism.
Of all Schumann's 'friends' Berlioz was the most fully liberated. On Friday
Ann Murray sang his 'Nuits d'ete' with delightful poise, shaping long and
liquid phrases where most singers need to stop for breath. These seemed to
be carefree summer nights, warm but not sultry, cooled by a light breeze.
The most imaginative performances venture beyond that.
The striking orchestral sonorities that Berlioz imagined were largely
smoothed over by the conductor Raymond Leppard, which was to prove his style
throughout the series. Any music that gained from lightness, fluency,
dancing rhythms fared well; where a score asked to be probed more deeply,
its demands were likely to be passed over. Mendelssohn's concert aria
'Infelice', well sung by Murray, kept its drama strictly within bounds.
As an archetypal early 19th-century composer, Schumann himself looks both
backwards and forwards. The fourth movement of the 'Rhenish' Symphony,
inspired by a visit to Cologne Cathedral, harks back to the solid, Teutonic
counterpoint of Bach and Buxtehude. A freer work like the Fantasie in C for
violin and orchestra opens its arms to embrace romanticism. At Saturday's
concert Leonidas Kavakos played the Fantasie with sweet tone and threw in
some spectacular technical feats in Paganini's 'Le streghe' variations for
good measure.
The Schumann symphonies (Nos 2 and 3 at these concerts) went according to
form. After performances by full-scale symphony orchestras which inevitably
sound heavy, Leppard's springy, light-on-its-feet style was welcome, even
while one was wishing that he would dig into the music more. The ensemble
was not spotless, but the ECO can still field first-class soloists. Neil
Black and Thea King, oboe and clarinet, made the Second Symphony's Adagio
unadulterated pleasure.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Bedlam and bravery in Spring Collection - Clement
Crisp finds dancers lurking around car bonnets and cranes, wheelchairs, and
Indian tradition in transition at The Place and the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
La danse, it says on the programme cover, c'est une declaration d'amour. It
is ninny-ish aphorisms like this which make me want to see heads on spikes
outside The Place and the concrete hell of the South Bank. These were the
weekend locations for an introductory tasting of 'British independent dance'
being offered to audiences that included delegates from hither and European
yon, in what I take to be a marketing exercise.
And what, I wonder, did they make of 'Independent dance' that involved
Bharata Natyam in transition, wheelchair performers, inept feminism, Hare
Krishna posings, and messages about social identity? I saw three of seven
performances on offer - La danse is also a declaration of stamina - and my
comments are a first report on a burst of activity which occupies The Place
for the next twelve weeks. (One item will be concerned with 'guilt; three
men and a five metre steel crane'. The crane, I trust, has passed the age of
consent).
Friday night's opening seemed a fair enough sample of the problems -
aesthetic and technical - that face our dance adventurers. Both Ben Craft
and Gary Lambert are strong dancers. Their jointly-made Cold Ground Drifting
 -titles are obscurantist, and so is much of the dancing, in these affairs -
finds four dancers lurking around structures made of car-bonnets. Nothing
much happens, though there is an air of menace to the piece, and the
technical skills on view are fine. About Yael Flexer's Dot . . dot . . dot
it needs just to be said that a small but stalwart girl dancer badgered a
tall male violinist. The parent company is called 'Bedlam'. Enough]
Two other pieces touched on ethnic identity. Jacob Marley tells us in
British Jungle Dances that his parents were white and he was black, and he
feared that he might be sent back to the jungle. The surprising result,
given this statement, is a suite for Union Dance which is elegant, supple -
movement curves in and out of gesture and pose - and very attractive as it
responds to sophisticated African songs.
Shobana Jeyasingh's Romance, with Footnotes was, by contrast, worthy, dull.
Indian dance is in transition here - an inevitable development as women's
identities change in society - and I longed for more of the bravura
stampings and transcendent rhythms of Bharata Natyam, and something less
compromised by cliches of modern dance.
Saturday afternoon at the Purcell Room began in fine style with Mark
Balwin's realisation of Poulenc's Soirees de Nazelles. Baldwin appeared as a
guiding participant, with two excellent colleagues - Sara Matthews and Lee
Boggess. His manner is oblique, and the score becomes an excuse for dances
that touch slyly on the game of flirtation. Underneath the mocking there is
sincerity, and though I found Baldwin's own stage persona somewhat petulant
and limp-limbed, the piece is neat, off-beat, welcome.
The rest of the afternoon was a vexation to the spirit. About Emilyn Claid's
Virginia Minx at play I note simply that Miss Claid's performance was
laboured in mime and stratospherically winsome, and that it was too soon
after lunch to sit through such behaviour. (Frankly, it was too soon after
the Big Bang).
She was aided and abetted by Heather Joyce, who played the saxophone and
keened. There was a sound-track by Sylvia Hallett hideously right for the
event.
The closing Corpus Antagonus was made by the admirable Russell Maliphant for
Ricochet Dance. Two men, three women, with apricot outfits and sub-Hindu
manners, looked like five characters in search of an Ashram. There were slow
curvings and coilings, the ringing of tiny bells and jolly drummings, and
the suspicion that someone somewhere was looking for a Swami. As the piece
reached its climax, the bodies collapsed and curved onwards in thrilling
fashion, but the sum effect was oddly dated - something lost on the
hash-route to Katmandu and enlightenment in the 1960s.
The day closed with Candoco, a company which unites wheelchair performers
and able-bodied dancers, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. I admired the troupe
last year, and hoped that they might expand their activities with new
choreographies. The first part of their programme showed this in a trio for
Celeste Dandeker, chair bound, Adam Benjamin and Kuldip Singh-Barmi, made by
its players, which spoke of love, reliance, pain, in vivid movement terms,
not least in Dandeker's potent gestures.
Equally good was a duet by Jodi Falk for David Toole who, without legs, is
yet a vital performer, and Singh-Barmi. The dance explores mobility,
response in partnering, perspectives on the world. I thought it brave,
uncompromising. So, too, a study by Siobhan Davies to a Gavin Bryars' string
quartet. Davies has seized on the possibilities of wheelchair movement -
gliding speed - and the emotional interplay possible between physical
freedom and constraint.
The result is a subtly compelling view of what Candoco can do as artists.
Yet everything that these three works established about the company -
dignity, handicaps rejected, art born of difficulty - was destroyed by the
final offering, Emilyn Claid's Back to Front, staged in collaboration with
the cast, and set to a raucous accompaniment by Andrew Deakin.
Vulgarity, cheap jokes, gimcrack sexuality and gratuitous violence, made the
performers look what they certainly are not - objects for prurient gaze, and
for the inane laughter the audience gave them. It is wholly unworthy.

Yet again the evening's main offers are current affairs programmes largely
concerned with man's inhumanity to man. Assignment reports on Benazir Bhutto
in Pakistan who faces political and sexual prejudice (7.45 BBC2). In
Undercover Britain two Aids sufferers use hidden cameras to expose con-men
preying on the terminally ill (9.00 C4). 40 Minutes illustrates the
difficulties faced by four former soldiers in finding jobs. Network First
tells of racial segregation in the US Air Force during World War 2 (10.40
ITV).
Where to go for relief? How Do They Do That? on BBC1 is a new 'infotainment'
programme presented by Desmond Lynam which is intended to elicit 'Well would
you believe it' responses (8.00). Food And Drink is usually good for a
giggle, if only for Jilly Goolden's frocks which are as refreshing as her
wine taster's adjectives (8.30 BBC2). And Quantum Leap is one of those
fantasy series which, contrary to popular mythology (Americans are only good
at knock-down drag-out action drama) are better done in the US than in the
UK (9.00 BBC2).

FT  08 FEB 94 / Technology: Delays cut at the stroke of a pen - How
computing with a stylus could shorten trial periods for pharmaceutical
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is money for the international pharmaceutical companies. Delays in
getting a blockbuster compound to market give rivals time to launch
price-cutting imitations. Each day's hold-up can cost a drug company Dollars
1m (Pounds 600,000) in lost revenues.
As a result, the race is on to bring in the latest computer technology to
cut approval times. Clinical trials in particular have been targeted by the
big pharmaceutical companies.
While many big drug companies are investing in personal computers or
facsimile machines, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in the US has gone one step further.
It is conducting trials with pen computers - electronic tablets reminiscent
of a Victorian school slate, with a stylus or 'pen' used for writing on the
screen. The software is usually displayed as forms, with boxes that can be
ticked or filled in.
Eventually, pen-based machines could obviate the mountains of paperwork
associated with drug trials. These case record forms, completed in
triplicate, can be up to 2cm thick for just one patient. A typical trial
would involve three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, part of Rhone-Poulenc of France, is using pen computers
in a trial of antibiotics, which began last December. Of the 30 to 40 sites
involved, eight will be using the pen computers to duplicate the paper
system. The aim, says Greg Fromell, associate director of clinical research
in the US, is to assess how much quicker the electronic system could be.
Fromell sees two big areas of time saving. First, data entry - transferring
the paper-based test results on to the computer - is always a 'bottleneck.'
Data often have to be typed two or three times, introducing errors and
delays. With the pen computer, information is entered on the screen and can
be transferred directly to the main database.
Second, researchers lose months correcting basic errors in paper data. The
software selected by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, from the German company Padcom,
helps eliminate these.
If a number is required in response to a specific question, the software
will not allow the doctor to enter a letter or a tick. The software can
check the birth date of the patient to ensure that he or she is of the
appropriate age to take part in the study, or query information which
appears to be outside the likely boundaries - unlike a paper questionnaire.
Although Fromell believes that the breakthrough has been in the creation of
computers that take handwritten information, from companies such as Grid,
NCR, Tandy and IBM of the US and NEC and Toshiba in Japan, he argues that it
is not the hardware that will provide the competitive edge in drug trials,
but the software.
At Casella, the Hoechst subsidiary in Frankfurt, clinical project manager
Dieter R. Dannhorn believes it is critical to have software which can guide
doctors, many of whom will be inexperienced in the use of computers, through
the 'form': 'I need doctors who are happy with the system, otherwise I am
not going to get any patients for the trials.'
Casella has already conducted a short clinical trial with pen computers on
16 patients and is now planning clinical trials of an anti-fungal product
involving 240 patients in 10 centres with each patient questioned three
times.
Each doctor involved will receive a diskette to be completed on each patient
visit. For the Rhone-Poulenc Rorer trial, diskettes will also be used to
record patient information. They will be posted to the central office where
the data will be entered on the database. In future the data could be sent
automatically over a phone line.
While drugs companies believe it is too early to predict potential savings,
Padcom's director of marketing, Peter Munzel, calculates that for a typical
Phase II trial, where the drug is tested for efficacy for the first time,
the savings could be more than 40 per cent. If 10 centres and 200 patients
were involved over a 12-month period, with each patient visiting the doctor
six times, Munzel calculates a saving of more than Dollars 205,000 out of a
total study cost of Dollars 511,440, in reducing the number of queries and
the need for retyping.
He argues that if pen computers were used throughout the drugs approval
procedure, they could cut a month off each study. With an average of 30
studies per drug, that could cut months - or even years - off the eight to
12 years it usually takes to get a drug approved, giving companies an extra
two or three years of sales of a compound before competitors flooded the
market.
Not everyone is so optimistic. 'The challenge is to make major improvements
in a whole host of areas,' says Mark Delfino, a manager specialising in
information technology with the Boston Consulting Group, in Chicago. 'A
pen-based system per se is only a more friendly interface and an easier way
of getting data. Once the data comes in, you still need a set of processes
to handle it quickly.'
Although pen computers save time in data entry, Dannhorn calculates that
unfamiliarity with writing case study books for pen PCs means that it takes
him up to five times as long to write one for a pen computer as it does for
a paper-based trial.
Drugs companies could be drawn into writing much of their own software, with
the need to set up expensive centres of technical expertise, adds Delfino.
In addition, the cost of the hardware is 'not inconsequential'. He reckons
it costs between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 20,000 per site to equip trial
sites with machines.
Today's pen computers are often relatively heavy and have a short battery
life. So far there is no de facto operating system - some companies favour
that developed by the Silicon Valley start-up Go; others prefer Microsoft's
Windows for Pen Computing.
While some pharmaceutical companies have been quick to adopt pen computing,
others have strong reservations. One concern is that handwriting recognition
technology is still relatively primitive. 'One of the biggest problems is
legibility: doctors have notoriously bad handwriting,' says Stephen Hill, UK
medical director for Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company. He fears that
data could be inaccurately recorded - particularly in international trials
conducted in English where English is not the first language of the doctors
involved.
'One of the biggest problems is to make sure that the information we collect
matches the information on the patient's records,' continues Hill. If the
data are entered directly by PC from the doctor's surgery to the company's
main database - without intermediary checking - mistakes could slip through.
Regulatory issues are also hampering the widespread take-up of such systems.
At Pfizer's UK operation in Sandwich, Kent, for example, researchers are
still waiting for a pronouncement from the US Food and Drug Administration
about the use of electronic signatures. With paper trials, the investigating
doctor has to sign all the trial results to validate them, but there are no
guidelines about electronic signatures.
In Germany, the system is even more restrictive. Although the information
from the Casella trial will be recorded on screen, German law requires that
the results of the trials be printed out and signed by the doctor if the
trial is to be valid.
At Glaxo in the UK, researchers are experimenting with pen-based computers
but believe it will be another two to three years before they can rely on
them utterly. By then, says a spokesman for Glaxo, voice recognition
technology - where doctors simply talk to their machines - could have made
similar advances and might become the dominant technology.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Technology: Orphan quickly finds a home - Why a Japanese
drug company chose a tiny market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical companies have, in recent years, been concentrating on
developing compounds for large markets. The cost of developing a drug with a
potential market of Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) is not much less than a
Dollars 1bn one. As a result, most research and development directors have
decided to concentrate on the big therapeutic categories where the rewards
are likely to be greatest.
The drawback is that the large categories tend to be highly competitive and
most require huge clinical trials. This takes time - an important
consideration given that the patent-life is limited - and money.
Fujisawa, Japan's fifth-largest drugs group, adopted an unusual approach for
its latest compound, Prograf. It deliberately developed the drug, the first
new immuno-suppressant launched in 10 years, for use in liver transplants
only - a relatively tiny area. There are only about 20 liver transplants a
year in Japan.
The move appears strange because Prograf is crucial to Fujisawa's future.
Eventually, however, the potential market for the drug is huge. The main
competitor is Sandimmun, a drug marketed by Sandoz of Switzerland with
annual sales of about SFr1.3bn (Pounds 600m).
Hitoshi Oyashu, managing director of Fujisawa's R&amp;D division, says the main
reason for starting with a limited indication was to obtain 'orphan' status.
A recent Japanese law gives priority for orphan drugs treating diseases
affecting no more than 50,000 people.
In theory, orphan drugs are given:
Priority during the ministry of health's review of the drug's safety and
efficacy.
Exclusive marketing rights for 10 years against six years for other drugs.
Government R&amp;D subsidies.
Tax exemptions on development costs.
Even in the US, the review procedure was markedly accelerated by choosing
such a limited indication. The compound was filed for use in liver
transplants during September last year and declared approvable by an FDA
advisory committee within two months. The company expects final approval
this month - an astonishingly quick process. There are about 3,000 liver
transplants in the US each year, according to James Capel, UK stockbrokers,
in Japan.
The second great advantage of such a narrow indication according to Oyashu
was that Prograf was granted a substantial price premium to existing
therapies.
In May 1992, the Japanese ministry of health and welfare created a system of
fixing new drug prices. The only drugs allowed significant premiums to
existing therapies would be those based on a new concept, showing advantages
in safety and usefulness, and making a 'striking' contribution compared with
conventional treatments. Prograf is the only drug to have fulfilled those
criteria since the rules were introduced.
In the meantime, the company is using the wedge of the liver transplant
indication to gain approval for kidney transplants, and eventually other
auto-immune diseases such as eye disorders, Paget's disease and arthritis.
The company hopes to have approval for kidney transplants in Japan during
the second quarter of this year. In the US, it hopes the drug is approved by
the fourth quarter of 1996.
Industry consultants say the market for Prograf is already much larger than
might be imagined. Once a drug is approved, doctors prescribe it for other
indications even though it might not be strictly licensed for them. That
helps with later marketing. Another advantage is that once the drug is in
use, regulatory authorities become less concerned about safety, leaving the
company free to prove efficacy. This speeds up subsequent approvals.
However, the R&amp;D director of one of Japan's big groups says the advantage of
high pricing only lasts when the indication is narrow.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banks begin to face the
facts - In the second of a series on exporting, Richard Gourlay and Ian
Hamilton Fazey consider the role of lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardly a day goes by when UK industry is not encouraged to export; with
equal regularity there is a chorus of protest from exporters saying that
banks do not understand their needs. According to Ian Campbell,
director-general of the Institute of Exports, the biggest challenge
exporters face is in dealing with their lenders. Finding flexible forms of
finance comes before arranging insurance or even planning a marketing
strategy.
'Banks' understanding is very limited at the local level, although there are
good people at the head office,' says Campbell.
A 1993 study by the institute showed that banks were the first call for
advice on exporting for 80 per cent of smaller companies but 72 per cent of
them said the advice they received was of no use.
One of the most common complaints from exporters was that banks lack
adequate understanding of their customers' foreign markets. 'When exporting
you need to be far more flexible if you are going to gain contracts,' says
Roger Walker, managing director of Long Products, a manufacturer of
anti-corrosion and water proofing materials based in Rye, East Sussex. The
company exports about 85 per cent of its Pounds 3m annual sales.
Ideally exporters should be in a position to offer a financing package when
they go into negotiations with customers. But many complain that their
commercial position is undermined by their banks not matching the flexible
finance offered by overseas competitors.
Exporters cannot, however, be exonerated from all blame. Often they turn to
their banks far too late in the day. According to Stuart Natus, head of
international trade services at Barclays Bank, it is common for customers to
say: 'I have something which is being shipped tomorrow, how do I finance
it?' or, 'what can I do, the letter of credit has not arrived?'
Alternatively, companies may simply be talking to the wrong people in their
banks. It is unrealistic to expect most branch managers to be conversant
with collection methods in Italy, for example.
While a number of banks are setting up business centres with a resident
international trade specialist, exporters need a far more professional
approach to ensure their export finance is properly lined up.
'Companies should look at export finance quite separately from their
ordinary retail banking needs,' says Walker. 'It is up to individuals to
assess the quality of the banks and the people in the bank they are dealing
with.'
Walker's knowledge of shopping around is the result of bitter experience.
Four years ago Long Products had to turn away orders that cost the company
Pounds 400,000 of profits over two years. With no warning, his bank started
withdrawing its export financing facility from the market, giving him no
time to make alternative arrangements. The bank told Walker that head office
was trying to reduce its capital lending ratios.
After much research and an expensive two-year transition, Walker now does
his foreign business with Barclays in London and his domestic banking with
the Royal Bank of Scotland. 'When we unscrambled our banking arrangement, we
got our sales and profitability back up because we could go into the export
market with renewed confidence,' he says.
Whistling a tune composed in head office is not uncommon for local branch
managers. Elaine Thomson, managing director of Frederick Thomson in Crewe,
faced a similar situation with NatWest.
Having won a Pounds 260,000 order to make specialist baking machinery from
Fazer of Finland, Thomson says she was assured by her branch manager that he
would provide a guarantee to return a deposit if the equipment was not
shipped. Then, on the instruction of the regional office in Liverpool,
NatWest said it would not issue the guarantee and Frederick Thomson lost the
order.
Thomson rescued the order when an insurance company agreed to provide the
guarantee, but only with the help of the Bank Relationship Consultancy, a
group that advises companies how to get more from their banks. NatWest says
Thomson, which had been losing money, had unusual trading patterns and that
the bank had tried to be as supportive as possible.
Another significant problem is that UK banks, when judging how much security
a debtor book can support, will usually ascribe no value to foreign debt
receivables, however large the customer, unless they are backed by credit
insurance. 'When the banks take a charge over the assets, they may allow 60
per cent against domestic debtors but nothing against overseas debts,' says
Mark Runiewicz of the Bank Relationship Consultancy.
Barclays' Natus says the bank is currently considering changing its policy
to take a 'more educated view' of the risk of foreign debtors.
If the attitude is relaxed, exporters would immediately be able to tap a new
source of security against which to raise finance. But as long as the policy
remains, companies will continue hiding their export receivables in their
debtor book, undermining the trust on which relations with banks is best
built.
Elsewhere there are signs that the banks may be responding to exporters'
needs. After a gap of some years, NatWest has reintroduced an export finance
scheme aimed at the smaller exporter whose overdraft is insufficient to
support its foreign trade. What is more, there is growing recognition among
banks that the service they offer exporters could be improved. Andy Nemes,
of NatWest's international trade and banking services division, admits that
the barrage of complaints at last year's exporter forums chaired by the
Financial Times was an 'eye-opener'.
A former deputy head of the bank's staff training college, Nemes says
NatWest is going to modify its training programmes as a result of what he
and his colleagues learned.
And the institute is working with NatWest to devise a course for bank staff
on exporting.

From next week, companies that join the Independent Business League*, formed
last year to represent smaller company interests, can expect cuts in charges
on payments received by credit card.
Members with average transactions of Pounds 150 or more will qualify for a
1.55 per cent rate. Those with smaller transaction sizes will pay between
1.7-3.0 per cent. The deal was negotiated with Barclays Merchant Services,
the processor of about 40 per cent of plastic card purchases.
*Details from the Independent Business League. Tel 0800 387085.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Equip us for
competitiveness - What some smaller engineering companies told their
Treasury guests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Lawson fingers a part the size of a napkin ring which his
subcontracting company produces on two machine tools - it starts in one,
moves across his cramped little factory to the other, and ends up back on
the first to be finished.
'With the right sort of equipment I could make this cheaper on one machine,'
says Lawson, owner of Canmore Engineering, based in High Wycombe,
Buckinghamshire. 'I'm competing with companies in Germany and Italy which
have better equipment.'
Canmore was one of 11 engineering companies in the home counties and the
West Midlands which took part last week in a two-day event designed to show
officials from the Treasury why investment in new technology by small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is vital to UK competitiveness as the
country's recession ends.
The event was a coup for the organisers, the Machine Tool Technologies
Association, which for the first time managed to lure five senior Treasury
officials from their desks to visit a crucial part of the UK industrial
base.
The businesses they visited were not 'poor companies bleating for
hand-outs,' says the association's Mark Swift, 'but good companies that
could do even better if it was easier for them to invest'.
The tour followed a meeting late last year between the Treasury and the
MTTA. 'We said: 'Let us take you to see the SMEs which are critical of the
banks and the government,' so that officials could see what it is these
businesses need to invest in new technology,' says Michael Legg, managing
director of Japanese-owned Hitachi Seiki UK.
A related aim, he says, was to show the Treasury how machine tools have
changed over the past decade.
The issue of competitiveness - and the disadvantages many SMEs believe they
face when trying to win work against rivals in Europe and the Far East -
dominated the tour.
The clearing banks attracted considerable criticism - one defence supplier
complained that its overdraft had been cut by one-third with no warning.
The government came under attack too, with SMEs calling for the fine words
about manufacturing over the past year or so to be matched by more action.
The SMEs suggested a number of solutions ranging from a system of grants
like the now discontinued Sefis (Small Engineering Firms' Investment
Scheme), more generous capital allowances, or a government- sponsored scheme
to channel stable, relatively low-cost finance to SMEs. Above all, the SMEs
were looking for something from the government that would increase their
confidence in making investments.
Alan Addis, managing director of Southall-based Verdict Precision
Engineering, says machine tool purchases by his French counterparts are
heavily subsidised by their government, which then insists that large
contractors use these suppliers.
As for growing the company, Addis says: 'We've got some super plans and want
to do so much. I need Pounds 1m to make Verdict really grow but where am I
going to get it from?'
Addis is particularly keen on seeing a revival for Sefis grants to encourage
equipment purchases, although he says interest rates cannot be ignored
either. Lawson, meanwhile, says that buying the latest high-tech equipment
brings access to higher-margin work. Also, with aerospace customers likely
to give big orders at short notice, 'you've got to have the equipment to
make it on. There's no point in having 15-year-old machine tools'.
And the reaction from the Treasury visitors? Bill Guy, head of its supply
side unit, said the tour would not lead to an overnight change in policy,
and seemed doubtful about some of the SMEs' proposals. But the trip would
add to the 'quality of decision-making' at the Treasury.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new man at the top of Schroder Venture Advisers - one of the largest
UK-based international venture capital groups - has a strong technology
background.
Peter Smitham, 51, took over as managing partner of the Schroders affiliate
last week in the wake of the surprise resignation of Jon Moulton.
Smitham, who joined Schroder Venture Advisers in 1985, spent his early
career with ITT Europe, moved to Barclay Securities where he was involved in
creating a pharmaceutical group from six acquisitions in two years, and
later took over responsibility for Lex Service's European electronics
business.
This last job came about as a result of being a founder shareholder in a
start-up electronics business called Jermyn Holdings, sold to Lex in 1983.
Since moving into venture capital he has led 20 of SVA's 105 investments,
including most of those involving electronics and information technology
companies.
One of his most successful deals was the management buy-out from Cambridge
Electronics Industries of Roxboro Group, which went public in 1983.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leslie Warman, 47, a former senior executive with Lloyds Merchant Bank, has
taken over as chairman of Wakebourne, the computer services and support
group which has emerged from the shambles of the collapsed Maddox group.
Warman, a non-executive director of John Tams and LBS Financial Software,
made his name among institutional investors by standing up to Philip Green,
the controversial boss of Amber Day Holdings. His resignation in June 1992,
after just under a year on the board, signalled that all was not well and
within a matter of months Green had been forced to quit after a collapse in
Amber Day's profits.
Wakebourne, which changed its name from Maddox Group, has had a
controversial history under its previous chairman Hugo Biermann, a colourful
South African entrepreneur. He resigned last November after the company
announced massive losses and City institutions were forced to come to its
rescue.
Although the company has been overshadowed by unfortunate publicity, its
computer services operation is well regarded and has been run by the same
management team for the past 10 years.

FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Loudon quits M&amp;G board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Loudon, the former Midland Montagu chief executive who lost his job
when HSBC Holdings acquired the Midland Group, is stepping down as a
non-executive director of Britain's largest independent unit trust company
M&amp;G after just under a year.
'M&amp;G is a terribly conservative place and maybe that is not apparent to an
outsider,' says group managing director Paddy Linaker. 'We are a bit of a
tortoise rather than a hare. Loudon is a high-powered financial type used to
doing mega-deals on a regular basis.'
M&amp;G has recently been surprised by the degree of controversy sparked by the
renewal of its executive share option scheme, which was in fact approved by
a majority of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting last week.
But Linaker is firm that Loudon's departure is quite unconnected with that
episode. 'He was totally behind the company's stance,' he says.
Dutch-born Loudon, whose varied international experience had included spells
with Amro Bank in Amsterdam, Lazard Freres in Paris and the Ford Foundation
in New York and Jakarta, may have been disappointed that M&amp;G's plans to
expand into continental Europe have not taken shape faster, according to
Linaker. But it was not one sole issue, rather a general difference of
philosophy, that prompted the cooling which was already apparent last
September, the M&amp;G boss continues.
Two other non-executive directors are stepping down from the board; Lord
Rees-Mogg after seven years' service and Alan McLintock after 14, while
Barry Sherlock, chairman of the life insurance and unit trust
self-regulatory organisation Lautro, comes on in a non-executive capacity,
but Linaker says there is 'no tremendous hurry' to make further
appointments.

FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Haden MacLellan appoints MD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of senior management changes at Haden MacLellan Holdings, the big
engineering group, was concluded yesterday with the appointment from March 1
of Richard Taylor as group managing director. The changes over the past 18
months began with the departure in September 1992 of the flamboyant chairman
Philip Ling. His successor, the conservative Harold Cottam, was charged with
improving the group's image in the City as well as examining its management
structure.
This led to the departure early last year of chief executive Mel Hawley,
only a year after his promotion to the post. His duties were taken on by
Cottam and by the mds of the two main divisions, Taylor at process
engineering and services and Clive Northmead at manufacturing and
distribution. A group finance director, Nigel Reed, was appointed at the end
of last year.
The appointment of Taylor, 48, is a reward for his efforts since joining the
group as managing director of the UK process engineering and materials
division in 1984. In particular, a management and operational reorganisation
led by him reinvigorated the group's formerly loss-making US businesses,
which were brought under his operational control in 1992.
In his new role Taylor will remain in overall charge of the process
engineering division, for which he also announced a streamlined reporting
structure yesterday. The division accounts for more than two-thirds of HMH's
Pounds 300m group turnover.
HMH said yesterday that it was 'possible and appropriate' for Taylor to give
full attention to his additional responsibilities and bring added focus to
the group's total operations and strategic direction.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: A question of ownership - Robert Rice
asks whether financial documents attract copyright protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Richemont, the Swiss tobacco to luxury goods group, reshuffled its
assets last autumn to produce two separately focused businesses, Rothmans
International and Vendome Luxury Group, copyright notices appeared on the
inside cover pages of the listing particulars in the name of Compagnie
Financiere Richemont AG.
Mr Frederick Mostert, Richemont's intellectual property counsel, believes
this is the first time that a company has openly claimed copyright
protection for one of its financial documents.
Richemont's move raises a question increasingly of concern to the financial
community on both sides of the Atlantic. Can copyright subsist in financial
documents such as prospectuses, offering circulars, listing particulars and
other financial documents required for public disclosure purposes or for
filing with a stock exchange?
The issue has become controversial, as companies that have spent
considerable time and money on developing new financial products
increasingly look for ways of protecting their investment in intellectual
property.
Certainly copyright protection exists for intellectual products in other
areas of professional services, such as architects' plans, barristers'
opinions, cartographers' maps, scientists' laboratory test sheets, trade
catalogues and listings. So why not for financial documents?
The matter has never come before the English courts, but in the US there has
been a limited amount of litigation for infringement of copyright in
financial products.
In 1982, in a case brought by Dow Jones, a court ruled that a list of stocks
in an index was protected by copyright. In 1985 Merritt Forbes, a securities
underwriter and marketer, which had registered a copyright for its
reoffering circulars and supplements for tax-exempt municipal bonds,
successfully sued Newman Investment Securities and others for infringing the
copyright by using substantially copied documents in an offering. And last
year a number of actions for infringement of copyrighted insurance forms was
heard in US courts.
The increasing use of trademarks and service marks for new financial
products such as Lyons (Liquid Yield Option Notes), which is a trademark of
Merrill Lynch, and ABC Securities, which is a registered service mark of
Kidder Peabody, also points to the increasing desire of companies to protect
their intellectual creations. But in spite such developments, the extent to
which copyright can subsist in financial documents remains largely untested.
Copyright can subsist in financial documents to the extent that they
constitute original works of authorship, according to an article in the
European Intellectual Property Review by Mr Christopher Morcom QC, one of
the UK's leading intellectual property lawyers, Mr Roger Zissu, president of
the US Copyright Society and a partner of New York law firm Weiss Dawid
Fross Zelnick &amp; Lehrman, and Mr Mostert. But there are limits to the
material used in financial documents which can benefit from protection.
They add that, while under both English and US law financial documents
generally qualify for protection as original 'literary works', the idea
behind a financial product cannot be copyrighted. Protection extends only to
the way that idea is expressed.
As a result, to the extent that financial documents incorporate accounting
methods, financial systems or legal concepts, they can be freely used by
others, provided they are not slavishly copied.
Facts also cannot benefit from protection, so financial data contained in
balance sheets or income statements can be used freely. And there is no
protection for standard wording or boiler-plate provisions in common use in
the financial industry.
But in all other respects, provided a financial document constitutes the
expression of an original work, it will attract copyright protection whether
or not it is compiled from public sources and whether or not it includes a
number of standard provisions, say the authors.
Infringement of copyright in financial documents will depend on the facts of
each case. If there has been slavish copying of substantial parts of a
document, the issue should be clear. Where the language and order of an
original document have been changed, the issue may be less obvious. If the
copyright owner can prove the alleged infringer has made use of the original
work and, despite changing the language, has taken 'the heart or essence' of
a copyrighted work, it might be possible to establish an infringement.
If, on the other hand, an alleged infringer has produced a document through
original work using other public material and not by copying, there will be
no infringement, even if the contents are similar in some respects.
According to Mr Zissu, in cases that are too close to call, the outcome is
likely to be influenced by the court's sense of where the balance of
fairness lies between the parties. He points out, however, that although
judges may be influenced in their decision by a sense of fair play none is
likely to admit to it.
One of the most controversial areas of this debate is the question of
ownership of the copyright in the documents and the right to use copyrighted
material in subsequent documents, says Mr Mostert.
As a general rule, copyright vests in the author. But what is the position
when a group of companies produces a document setting out ideas for a
financial reconstruction, and sends it to a merchant bank or law firm for
advice and revision?
The production of a derivative document should not affect the copyright in
the original. The lawyer or banker would not be free to copy the original
document or use its contents to prepare derivative works for other clients.
But what if the derivative document is sufficiently original to merit its
own copyright, or the contributions of the original compiler and the lawyer
who revises the original document cannot be separated, so that the revised
document becomes a work of joint authorship?
Under English law, says Mr Morcom, when the work is prepared by a lawyer or
a banker the usual position is that the author retains any copyright in the
work, subject to an implied licence for the person for whom it was prepared
to use it for the purpose for which he or she requested it.
However, where the work is derived from copyright material prepared and
supplied by the client and the law firm or bank is being paid for preparing
it, it may be an implied term of the contract of engagement that copyright
in the derivative work is assigned to the client. The position is broadly
similar in the US.
The authors stress, however, that each case will turn on its facts. It is
this uncertainty that is beginning to concern lawyers, bankers and their
corporate clients.
There is no doubt that copyright in financial documents is more on people's
minds, says Mr Morcom. The ease with which documents can be stored on
databases and reproduced has made them consider the issue more carefully.
'In a recession where everyone is looking to cut costs, there must be a
temptation to save time by taking shortcuts,' he says.
So will litigation follow? 'The issue is very controversial in the financial
community,' says Mr Zissu. 'Someone's going to sue for breach of copyright
in financial documents in the next year or two.'

FT  08 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: 'Clinique' name can be used - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National marketing regulations are still subject to Rome treaty rules on
free movement of goods, even if applied indistinctly to imports and domestic
products, the European Court of Justice ruled last week.
In a decision which clarifies its recent ruling in the Keck case, the Court
said national marketing rules would only be lawful when they could be
justified on a public interest ground which took precedence over the free
movement of goods principle.
In the Keck case, the Court said the Rome treaty ban on import restrictions
did not apply to national marketing rules which merely concerned domestic
'selling arrangements' applicable to all goods.
The ECJ said treaty rules on free movement of goods and the 1976 directive
harmonising national laws on cosmetics precluded the application to those
Estee Lauder cosmetics sold under the trademark 'Clinique' of German laws
prohibiting the sale of goods with a name that could mislead consumers as to
their properties.
The Court ruling was a response to a question referred by the Berlin
Landgericht about the interpretation of the free movement of goods rules in
the context of proceedings brought against Estee Lauder for using the name
'Clinique' on its products marketed in Germany. The company had originally
used the name 'Linique' in Germany but had changed to 'Clinique', the name
used in all other member states, to cut packaging and advertising costs.
A German business association brought proceedings to stop the use of the
name 'Clinique', relying on German laws prohibiting misleading advertising
and the marketing of cosmetics under names likely to mislead consumers as to
their effects. The name 'Clinique' was said to mislead consumers into
thinking the products had a therapeutic effect.
The ECJ pointed out that it was entitled to consider relevant Community law
provisions which had not been referred to it by the national court. In
particular, it said, the 1976 directive harmonising national laws on
cosmetics provided for full harmonisation.
However, as contended by the Commission, the directive, like all secondary
legislation derived from the treaty, had to be interpreted in the light of
the treaty, including the free movement of goods rules.
The directive covered marketing rules for cosmetics. It required member
countries to prevent the use of a name or information which was misleading
about the properties of the goods. The aims of the directive included
protecting consumers, preventing unfair competition and protecting health.
Hence, said the Court, it was necessary to check whether German laws which
implemented the directive in this respect complied with treaty rules on free
movement of goods and, in particular, whether the prohibition of the name
'Clinique' was proportionate to the original objective.
Following previous case law, the Court said that the German prohibition of
marketing cosmetics under the name used in all other member countries was in
principle an obstacle to interstate trade, because it forced the company to
adopt a different name in only one member country and so incur additional
advertising and packaging expense.
The ECJ also said prohibition of the name 'Clinique' in Germany was not
necessary to satisfy the objectives of consumer and health protection. It
said the German court found Estee Lauder only marketed its products in
Germany through perfume shops and in the cosmetic sections of department
stores, not pharmacies. The products were presented as cosmetics and not
medicaments. Moreover, the products were sold in this way under the name
'Clinique' in other countries without causing confusion for consumers.

February 2 1994.
Belgian work rules discriminate
Belgian legislation providing exceptions to the ban on night working which
differ between men and women infringes the 1976 equal treatment directive on

FT  08 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Clients not told costs in advance,
survey shows - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Solicitors are still failing to inform clients in advance of the cost of
legal advice and representation, in spite of clear guidance from the Law
Society, the profession's governing body. According to the National Consumer
Council, 25 per cent of firms also fail to provide an internal complaints
procedure as required by the society's practice rules.
In an NCC survey of solicitors in England and Wales, 80 per cent said they
told clients at the outset of the likely costs of their case. But only 60
per cent of clients said they were told of the likely cost. One in four said
they had no idea how much their case would cost until they received the
bill.
Most solicitors also claimed that legal aid clients required to contribute
to the costs of their case were told the likely level of contribution at the
outset. But less than half of clients said they were told of their legal aid
contribution at the start.
Lady Wilcox, NCC chairman, said the survey showed solicitors were not as
good at communicating information as they thought, but this was not
surprising given only 10 per cent of firms actively sought feedback from
clients.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Lloyd's claims settled below value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing numbers of syndicates at Lloyd's of London are striking deals
with policyholders settling probable future claims at less than their full
potential value.
Some observers suspect this practice, known as commutation, could harm the
reputation of a market that has traditionally boasted of its principle of
meeting all claims in full.
But commutation is becoming increasingly common in other areas of the
international insurance marketplace and it could help Lloyd's to manage
potentially overwhelming liabilities stemming from US asbestosis and
pollution cases.
'We are talking to more and more people about doing deals on casualty
claims,' said Mr Richard Keeling, deputy chairman of Lloyd's. 'It is a more
sensible way of doing business.'
Lloyd's, traditionally an important insurer of US liability risks, has been
badly hit by a massive escalation of legal awards, especially from
asbestos-related diseases and pollution. Lloyd's holds more than Pounds 4bn
in reserves to meet future claims, though according to some estimates more
money will be needed if the market is to fully protect itself.
Detailed figures showing the scale of commutation are not available. But
some underwriters specialising in 'long tail' liability business - in which
claims may arise many years after the inception of the policy - are settling
up to 5 per cent of notified claims in this fashion.
Payments vary depending on the potential strength of the claim. Recently
some syndicates have paid policyholders in US pollution cases only 5 cents
per dollar of claim.
In exchange for cash now, syndicates can sharply reduce their liabilities.
Both insurer and policyholder can avoid paying potentially crippling legal
costs. Legal costs in some US liability cases can amount to a third or more
of a total claim.
The difficulties of the Lloyd's market in the past two to three years and
policyholders' perceptions of financial weakness has made them much more
willing to consider commutation.
'Until three years ago the climate was not favourable for Lloyd's to talk
about commutation,' explained Mr Peter Matthews, of Matthews Consultants, an
actuarial firm. But he said: 'Lloyd's is becoming more commercially aware
like the rest of the insurance market.'
Mr Alan Pollard, chief executive of Syndicate Underwriting Management, which
handles claims on behalf of more than 80 syndicates which are no longer in
business, said: 'There is no doubt that the opportunity for reducing
old-year liabilities through commutation is really quite enormous.'
The number of commuted claims is likely to increase if Lloyd's succeeds in
its project to establish NewCo, a reinsurance company, which will be owned
initially by the Lloyd's Corporation.
'Now is the time to get certainty,' said Mr Keeling, who is expected to
chair the new company. 'Uncertainty costs money. Certainty is bankable.'

FT  08 FEB 94 / Health oil hits troubled waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter row over safety and efficacy has split the evening primrose oil
business, the fastest-growing sector of the UK nutritional supplements
industry.
Efamol, the company that pioneered evening primrose oil as a health product,
issued a wide-ranging attack on its rivals in a statement headed: 'Women
duped by many evening primrose oil manufacturers'.
Its competitors replied with statements denying its charges and making some
of their own.
Seven Seas, a Hanson subsidiary which is the UK market leader, called Efamol
'an over-priced product with declining sales'.
It said: 'We are sorry that a once-respected name should resort to
scaremongering to prop up flagging sales.'
Roche Consumer Health, part of the giant Swiss pharmaceutical group, said:
'We are dismayed that Efamol has issued such misleading, disparaging and
inaccurate data which will serve only to confuse the consumer.'
Evening primrose sales in the UK are estimated to have leapt from Pounds 17m
in 1991 to Pounds 32m in 1992 and Pounds 36m last year. The worldwide market
is worth about Pounds 200m a year.
Efamol - part of the Scotia pharmaceutical company floated on the London
Stock Exchange last autumn - said its products were the only ones on the
market 'put through rigorous human testing to clinical standards'.
Two hundred clinical trials have shown their benefits in a wide range of
conditions, from skin problems to premenstrual tension.
Rival products did not have the technology to extract gamma-linolenic acid
(GLA) - the active ingredient in primrose oils - so cleanly from the plant's
seeds and preserve it in good condition in the capsules without harmful
oxidation, according to Efamol.
It also claims that some other producers boost the GLA content of their
capsules with oil from the borage plant.
Efamol quoted three university studies which allegedly show borage oil to be
ineffective in its biological effects compared with primrose oil and
indicating that it may actually be dangerous.
Roche and Seven Seas, however, categorically denied that any such
conclusions could be drawn from the studies.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Merseyside reports static demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand in domestic and export markets was at best flat in the fourth quarter
of last year, says the latest economic survey by Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. Trends earlier in 1993 had been strongly upwards.
The survey covered 307 companies employing nearly 68,000 people in
Merseyside, north Wales and western parts of Lancashire and Cheshire.
Domestic deliveries weakened only slightly, but orders fell to their lowest
level of improvement for 1993. The balance figure of companies reporting
increases over decreases dropped to 10 percentage points, compared with 24
percentage points in the third quarter.
Export deliveries showed a similar decline to domestic orders. Export orders
fell to a positive balance of only 2 percentage points, the lowest since the
third quarter of 1992. Only 23 per cent of companies said orders from abroad
were up.
Improvements in the job market also appear to be faltering. A strong upward
trend last year saw 34 per cent take on workers in the fourth quarter
compared with 22 per cent cutting jobs. However, only 15 per cent plan to
recruit this quarter, while 34 per cent expect to employ fewer people.
Trends in cashflow remained strongly positive, with continuing optimism
about turnover and profits. There was also a marked increase in plant
utilisation in the fourth quarter, with 39 per cent operating at more than
80 per cent capacity.
Interest rates remained the biggest worry. But concern about prices of
supplies increased strongly, with 18 per cent of respondents worried about
them, compared with 9 per cent in the corresponding period of 1992.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Tractors draw David Brown back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The David Brown engineering group has gone back into the tractor business
after an absence of more than 15 years.
The company is making transaxles - combined axles and transmissions - in a
high-technology centre in South Yorkshire.
The first phase of the centre, which will officially open next week at
Penistone, near Barnsley, is making transaxles for the US, German and
Italian tractor markets.
David Brown has invested Pounds 6m refurbishing and equipping a derelict
factory. Mr Roger Bailey, manufacturing director of David Brown vehicle
products, said a Pounds 5m expansion of the site was planned, with up to 160
new jobs in the next two years.
The company has started making transaxles for Agco, the US tractor
manufacturer. David Brown's design has enabled Agco to increase its
tractors' performance from 195hp to 215hp by using high-precision bevelled
gears.
Mr Bailey said coal-mine closures in the region had ensured a supply of
skilled workers who could be retrained for high-precision engineering. The
65 employees have agreed a single-union deal with flexibility to allow
unfettered use of the latest production management systems.
David Brown, which is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was originally
a private family business famous for its ownership of Aston Martin cars. The
company was floated last April.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Farms 'fit for heroes' under threat: Council smallholdings
may fall victim to a budget squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Duncalfe began farming five years ago on a modest 60 acres near
Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. Today he runs a thriving business growing soft
fruit for Marks and Spencer and Tesco.
He is about to double his acreage to 240, providing summer jobs for 120
fruit-pickers and putting Pounds 130,000 into the depressed local economy.
Mr Duncalfe, a former farm manager, was only able to start his own business
thanks to a little-known institution - the county council small-holding.
He could not afford the price of land and was unable to find a long-term
tenancy in the private sector because fears about security of tenure have
stopped landowners letting for more than a few years.
Now the 5,700 public-sector farms in England and Wales are under threat from
local government reorganisation and the squeeze on council budgets.
Many in the industry are worried that the farms, promoted by Lloyd George to
provide 'land fit for heroes' returning from the first world war, will be
split up and sold off.
The pressure on councils to realise short-term capital gains is mounting. Mr
Desmond Hampton of land agents Cluttons told a recent conference organised
by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: 'If I was advising county
councils, I would be suggesting they should retain their estate until they
can secure vacant possession of any holding, but at that point sell it to
the best advantage in the open market.'
The case was strengthened by 'the small and frequently uneconomic size of
the county council farming unit'.
Mr Greg Birdseye of the Audit Commission said county councils had to ask
'whether there might be better things to do with the money' given
agricultural over-production and the squeeze on other services such as
education.
Advocates of the county farm system believe such arguments are misplaced.
Mr Charles Coats, head of Gloucestershire Estates Consultancy, which runs
9,000 acres of farms, says the farms bring jobs, new ideas and environmental
benefits such as public access and maintained hedgerows.
The Gloucestershire estate employs 480 people directly and indirectly -
which suggests more than 18,000 jobs on the 340,000 acres of council farms
nationally.
Demand for tenancies is strong. Gloucestershire receives 20 to 30
applications for each of the four or five vacancies that arise every year.
Competition has been intensified by a logjam. County farms were designed to
give young entrants a first step on the farming ladder.
But many tenants have failed to move on because there are no long-term
private-sector tenancies - a problem which should be eased by pending
de-regulation.
Tenants also had life tenure until retirement at 65 was introduced in 1984.
Farmers pay commercial rents but they benefit from 'pump-priming' in the
form of loans for repairs or new buildings and machinery which they pay back
through rent increases.
The county councils also bear the extra costs of managing a large number of
small farms of 100 acres or less which private landowners would generally
amalgamate.
But council farms are 'not a drain on the taxpayer', insists Mr Coats.
He says most estates produce surpluses on both revenue and capital through
careful management and sales of unwanted land and buildings for development.
And he believes that the break-up of county councils into unitary
authorities could reverse those gains.
The local government commissioners have recommended keeping the status quo
in Gloucestershire, but neighbouring counties such as Somerset face big
reorganisation.
'Our concern is that if there's a split into smaller authorities . . . one
could lose the economies of scale and of managing on a county-wide basis,'
says Mr Coats.
Some farmers' leaders are suggesting keeping estates intact by having them
transferred into trusts.
They might be managed under contract by existing teams acting as
private-sector consultants - an option Mr Duncalfe would favour if, as seems
likely, Cambridgeshire County Council is split up.
Success stories like Mr Duncalfe's are being used by proponents of the
county farms to press for their preservation.
'If we don't provide this service, there aren't the opportunities for the
able, entrepreneurial and innovative to start in farming,' said Mr Coats.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Carlton considers digital channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Television is considering broadcasting an experimental digital
television service in London later this year.
The intention would be to demonstrate as many as three extra channels
offering more local services and wide-screen television. A number of public
places throughout the region, such as department stores, could be used for
the experiment.
Discussions are still at an early stage but any experimental service would
be a collab-oration with National Transcommunications (NTL), the privatised
engineering and transmitter arm of the former Independent Broadcasting
Authority.
NTL has been conducting experiments for the Independent Television
Commission in the west of England. Using conventional transmitters and
mainly broadcasting test cards, the experiments have proved that the
technology works.
The Carlton proposal has interested the Department of Trade and Industry.
The cost of manufacturing the first batch of up to 20 digital receivers
would be considerable.
If the project were to go ahead, programmes would be broadcast from the
London Television Centre on the south bank of the Thames and transmitted
from Carlton's standby transmitter at Croydon.
Turning the television signal into digital form allows it to be compressed,
enabling several channels to be transmitted in the capacity now occupied by
a single channel.
Simultaneous broadcasting of existing channels would continue for many years
alongside new channels because of the special receivers needed for digital
broadcasts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture to build up to 400,000 sq ft of offices in central Leeds was
announced yesterday by the quoted property company British Land and Leeds
City Development Company, a developer part-owned by Leeds City Council.
The development is on a three-acre site adjacent to Leeds City railway
station. The site was a former tram maintenance shed and is now being used
as a car park. The Leeds City Development Company bought the bulk of the
land from the council in 1989.
The development is intended to expand the central business core southwards
to link up with new development alongside the River Aire.
Work on the first phase of the development is expected to begin once the
scheme has been granted detailed planning consent.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Development bank planned for inner-city area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search has started for a chief executive to run a development trust
which is intended to become the UK's first community development bank. It is
to operate in the deprived Birmingham inner-city area of Aston.
He or she will be a 'a laterally thinking banker', according to Mr Pat
Conaty, development director of Birmingham Settlement, the charity which has
been studying the possibility of a community bank for five years and is
behind the Aston project.
Birmingham Settlement is seeking to raise from public and private-sector
sources Pounds 3.5m in initial capital for what will be called Aston
Reinvestment Trust.
Mr Conaty said yesterday that operations would start in April 1995 and there
would be an application three years later for a banking licence that would
enable the organisation to accept deposits.
The chairman of the trust will be Sir Adrian Cadbury, former chairman of
Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks manufacturer, and a director of the
Bank of England since 1970. His deputy will be Sir Richard Knowles, the
recently retired Labour leader of Birmingham City Council.
The attempt to establish a new local bank runs against general banking
trends. The banking system has become increasingly centralised and based on
the four largest clearers.
Since the recession, lending has been more closely controlled from head
offices as the discretion of local managers has been reduced.
Mr Conaty said that Birmingham Settlement was holding talks with both
National Westminster Bank and Co-operative Bank about leveraging the trust's
capital, once it had been raised. Lloyds Bank had previously taken some
interest in the project, he added.
Aston Reinvestment Trust will seek to move into a void opened by the
departure of the clearing banks from Aston.
'It will concentrate its investment in a specific area to try and get market
forces working again,' Mr Conaty said.
Aston's unemployment rate is 36.9 per cent, the second highest of
Birmingham's wards.
Male unemployment is running at 49.9 per cent and female at 17.8 per cent.
According to its recently completed business plan, the trust will work
through two investment companies running in parallel and with overlapping
board membership.
It is expected to handle 144 investments in the first five years.
The first company, essentially commercial in its nature, is to be the
Investment Fund which will lend to business and housing projects and be
expected to make a profit.
The second one, social in emphasis, will be the Development Fund which will
finance packages that contribute to local regeneration, such as training
schemes.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Eastern Electricity to rebate Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity, the Ipswich-based power distributor, is to rebate
Pounds 50m to its 3m customers.
The company said yesterday that standard customers would have Pounds 10
credited against their next quarterly bill, and customers on Economy 7 would
get Pounds 16. Customers on prepayment, token or card meters would get an
extra Pounds 4. The amounts are related to the standing charges that
customers pay.
The move follows claims in a number of consumer reports that electricity
companies have increased their charges faster than inflation since they were
privatised in 1989. Last week the National Consumer Council and the
Consumers' Association accused the electricity industry of imposing Pounds
650m of unjustified price increases on domestic users.
Eastern denied that its rebate was a response to these accusations. The plan
was put for board approval last month. Eastern also pointed out that its
customers had already had their bills frozen at April 1992 prices, and had
received two Pounds 5 efficiency bonuses.
Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said: 'Our customers are continuing to
benefit to the full from our ability to manage our business costs
effectively.'
The company said its average domestic bills had gone up by 14.2 per cent
since privatisation - but if the credits and rebates were taken into account
this amounted to only 6.1 per cent. This compared with inflation of 15.4 per
cent over the period.
Other electricity companies are expected to announce similar rebates in the
weeks ahead.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Home starts at highest since 1989
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Builders started work last year on the largest number of new homes since
1989, figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show.
The statistics confirm that the faltering recovery which began at the start
of last year has been sustained, with building activity rising sharply
during the final three months of last year.
Sir George Young, housing minister, said that the strong increase in
private-sector starts 'looked set to continue into 1994'.
The environment department said builders started work on 186,400 homes in
1993, a rise of 19.1 per cent on the previous year. It was the highest
number of starts since 1989's 201,100. By 1992 this figure had slipped to
156,500.
Starts during the final three months of last year after allowing for
seasonal adjustments were 7.7 per cent higher than during the previous three
months, and 29.5 per cent higher than during the corresponding period in
1992.
The figures received a cautious welcome from the building industry, which
remained concerned that tax increases due to take effect in April might
inhibit potential home buyers.
Mr Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of Bryant Group, the Midlands-based
housebuilder which yesterday announced a 95 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 14.6m for the six months to the end of November, said the company
had made an encouraging start to this year. Net reservations in January were
about 15 per cent higher than during the corresponding month last year.
Housing starts are regarded as one of the best guides to sales by the
industry, which takes about 12 weeks on average to construct a home.
According to the environment department, private-sector starts rose by 19.1
per cent last year and 39.6 per cent compared with the final three months of
1992. Housing association starts on the same basis rose by 22.2 per cent and
11.7 per cent respectively.
Sir George said: 'Market conditions remain favourable, with mortgage
interest rates at their lowest for 25 years, unemployment falling and houses
more affordable than they have been for many years.'

FT  08 FEB 94 / Business failures 'at four-year low'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures reached their lowest level last month since December 1989,
a survey said yesterday.
There were 163 appointments of receivers or administrators to troubled
companies in January, 56 per cent down on the number reported in the same
month last year, said accountants Touche Ross.
Touche Ross said the January data showed that business failures were
continuing to fall at a significant rate.
From a peak of 5,734 appointments in 1991, the figure fell to 3,226 in 1993
and was expected to be as low as 2,000 this year.
The firm said: 'This would seem to confirm (our) previously stated opinion
that not only is the recession over but that companies are recovering
steadily and cautiously and not being persuaded to overtrade.'
The reduction in receivership appointments meant more attention could be
given to the underlying financial and structural deficiencies of firms, it
added.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Cathedrals share Pounds 4m for repairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English Heritage yesterday announced grants totalling more than Pounds 4m
for 43 cathedrals to help pay for urgent repair and conservation work. The
two largest grants, each of Pounds 500,000, go to Salisbury cathedral and
the Roman Catholic cathedral in Liverpool.
In Salisbury the cash will be used for conservation of the west front and on
the stonework, lead roof and windows. In Liverpool it will form part of
Pounds 1.5m to be spent over the next three years on roof repairs and
waterproofing.
Ely, Lincoln and Gloucester cathedrals are to receive Pounds 250,000, Pounds
225,000 and Pounds 224,000 respectively.
English Heritage has been supporting cathedrals for three years and has
given grants totalling Pounds 15m to 54 of England's 61 cathedrals. Three
cathedrals are offered grants for the first time. These are Newcastle
(Pounds 25,000), Southwark (Pounds 20,000) and Sheffield's Roman Catholic
cathedral (Pounds 70,000).
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, has made the Liverpool
Roman Catholic cathedral a Grade II listed building. He described the
tent-shaped structure as 'an imaginative work of 1960s architecture'.
The cathedral - affectionately known in Liverpool as 'Paddy's Wigwam' - was
designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd and built between 1962 and 1967. Mr Brooke
said its 'striking shape and elegant lantern tower have come to be
recognised as an entirely successful addition to the Liverpool skyline'.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Tory minister defends quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The claim that the creation of quangos represented centralisation in
government was 'preposterous' and the idea that they were unaccountable was
'absurd', Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
He said quangos were an effective way of devolving responsibility for
achieving policy objectives. They were not 'poodles in the lap of the
secretary of state'.
Mr Lang's speech in Edinburgh, on the theme of 'reinventing government',
followed a Labour onslaught on quangos, or quasi autonomous non-governmental
organisations. At the weekend Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said they
were an abuse of democratic rights.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife, said in the Commons yesterday: 'We see
a situation where the public interest is playing second fiddle to private
and vested interests. The promotion of the culture of closet Toryism is well
to the fore. Nearly 5,000 people . . . are spending nearly Pounds 7bn of
public money.'
These bodies had 'very tenuous' lines of accountability to the Scottish
Office, parliament, the press, MPs and the public, he said.
Mr Lang said quangos such as school boards and health trusts in Scotland
were examples of the 'exact opposite of centralisation' and were designed to
carry the devolutionary process to the grass roots. They had many
representatives of other political parties and 'still more of none,' he
said.
Quangos were accountable to parliament through their sponsoring secretary of
state, with chief executives responsible to the accounting officer in the
relevant government department. Mr Lang said quangos had a vested interest
in securing policy success in a way that 'could not, perhaps, be expected of
officials working in seemingly amorphous government departments'.
The Conservatives had cut the number of quangos in Scotland by almost half
since a 1980 report identified 84 executive public bodies, many of them
created by Labour.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary, said that the
government's planned reform of local government would reduce the number of
elected councillors compared with non-elected quango members.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Public work totalling Pounds 1.1bn put out to tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has put more than Pounds 1.1bn of civil service work out to
tender in the first round of its market-testing programme, Mr William
Waldegrave, public service minister, said yesterday.
The total represents almost three-quarters of the Pounds 1.5bn target set
for the first round which was due to have been completed in September. The
programme was delayed by uncertainties over the employment rights of staff
whose jobs are contracted out to the private sector.
Speaking at a Financial Times conference in London on resource management in
the public sector, Mr Waldegrave said about a third of the reviews had led
to improvements in quality of service. Quality had at least been maintained
in the others.
The programme was on course to produce savings of about 25 per cent of
running costs, he added.
Mr Waldegrave welcomed what he described as a growing partnership between
the public and private sectors in providing public services. He said more
than Pounds 2bn had been saved since 1979 as a result of efficiency drives.
He stressed, however, the importance of maintaining standards of probity and
care with public money. A recent report from the Commons public accounts
committee warned that such standards appeared to be slipping as a result of
management reforms in the public services.
'What we are aiming to do is to combine high standards of public conduct
with higher standards of service efficiency,' he said.
Mr Tony Baldry, the local government minister, said he was prepared to see
local authorities tendering for contracts in neighbouring authorities.
He said that rules against such tendering had been devised when local
government had been hostile to compulsory competitive tendering. The rules
might be relaxed as local authorities showed themselves less resistant. 'I
don't have a closed mind about new unitary authorities contracting to supply
services to each other,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to six weeks longer is to be allowed for the first stages of most of the
review of local government in the English counties, the Local Government
Commission for England said yesterday.
The decision follows the government's announcement that it would not appeal
against the recent High Court ruling that Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of
county and district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional'
circumstances.
The government said some councils had asked the commission for more time to
consider their positions because they felt the change of guidance might
alter the nature of the submissions they were planning to send to the
commission.

He said teachers must ensure that all pupils, including the brightest, are

Schools must have a clear and coherent policy, set out in the school

A report published by the Department for Education was being sent to schools

Hopes ended yesterday for reviving two closed collieries, Bentley in

received no tenders from private operators to run them, Michael Smith
writes.
However, tenders have been received for Wearmouth, in the north-east of
England, and Calverton, Nottinghamshire.
Deadlines for tenders closed yesterday. Tenders for a further batch of four
pits, the last which will be offered on a lease and licence basis, must be
in by the end of the month.
Five collieries where closure was announced by British Coal last week are
likely to be offered for sale when the industry is privatised this year and
next.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to commission new work examining the feasibility of
handing parts of the work of the Insolvency Service to the private sector,
Richard Lapper writes.
The announcement follows the completion late last year of a study by Stoy
Hayward, the accountants. It concluded that the private sector could handle
most of the mechanical processing of bankruptcy and compulsory liquidations
work, leaving the official receivers to concentrate on their investigative
role.
In answer to a parliamentary question, Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for
corporate affairs, said that Stoy Hayward's findings 'provide a sufficient
basis for further, more detailed work'. If the work reveals 'likely
value-for-money gains' the government will consider the possibility of 'live
trials in one or more regions'.
It is expected that the government will appoint consultants to carry out the
new work before the end of the month.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Scottish 'vested interests' attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of quangos in Scotland was attacked fiercely yesterday by the
Labour party.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife, said: 'We see a situation where the
public interest is playing second fiddle to private and vested interests.
The promotion of the culture of closet Toryism is well to the fore. Nearly
5,000 people behind closed doors are spending nearly Pounds 7bn of public
money.'
These bodies had 'very tenuous' lines of accountability to the Scottish
Office, parliament, the press, MPs and the public, he said.
Mr McLeish went on to accuse the government of 'vote rigging' and
'gerrymandering' in Scotland, which he claimed had become the 'most
centralised state in the developed world'.
Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for Tayside North, dismissed any suggestion
that Scotland suffered a 'democratic deficit' compared with England. He said
that what Labour MPs was really saying was: 'We, the Labour party, can't get
our hands on the levers of power.'
Mr Raymond Robertson, Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, aimed his attack
at the Scottish National party. 'Scotland has had her best days since 1707
in culture, commerce and in influence,' he said. 'The union has endured and
it will endure.'
But Mr John McAllion, Labour MP for Dundee East, protested that ministers'
refusal to accede to demands for a Scottish assembly made 'a mockery' of
their claim to be democratic. He said there should be a referendum for
Scottish people on how they were governed. 'If Scotland doesn't have
self-government, and it doesn't, it can't be described as a democracy - and
it isn't a democracy.'
At the last general election the Scottish people voted by three to one to
assert their own sovereignty and set up their own parliament, he added.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Howard abolishes committal court hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magistrates' court committal hearings at which prosecution evidence is
reviewed to see if a case is strong enough to go to trial at the Crown
Court, are to be abolished, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced
yesterday.
The hearings, most of which are a formality, are to be replaced by an
administrative procedure which would save money, reduce stress on victims
and witnesses and cut delays in bringing cases to trial, he said.
A clause inserted into the Criminal Justice and Public Order bill will still
allow for the defence to argue there is no case to answer.
This argument will be put to magistrates in writing. The defence will also
be able to apply for an oral hearing, but not to call witnesses.
The change will affect about 9,000 full committal hearings a year at which
witnesses give evidence, and a further 120,000 'paper' committals at which
magistrates commit defendants for trial solely on the basis of written
statements.
Responding to a parliamentary question from Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of
the home affairs select committee, Mr Howard said: 'These changes will
reduce the pressure on vulnerable witnesses by ensuring they will no longer
be at risk of having to give evidence twice.
'They will also produce significant savings in court time and costs.'
The proposal, which follows procedural changes in fraud cases and hearings
involving evidence from children, will apply to all charges to be tried at
the Crown Court. The change was recommended by the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice which reported last July.
The commission concluded that the present system served no useful purpose.
Defendants should still be able to make a submission of no case to answer,
the commission said, but witnesses should not be called and thereby made to
give their evidence twice over.

The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday moved to make some of the
banking accounting requirements of the Companies Act 1985 more flexible.
The move, part of the government's de-regulation drive, will remove the
definition of 'banking activities' and 'banking transactions' in one of the
schedules to the act.
The definitions were originally inserted at the request of the banks in an
attempt to clarify the European bank accounts directive. The banks have
since concluded that the definitions are unduly restrictive.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Heads 'lose out' on pay awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many school governing bodies are too embarrassed to give discretionary
awards to head teachers and their deputies, according to a report by the
Institute of Manpower Studies.
The report, based on a survey of 1,600 heads and deputies, estimates that
senior staff in almost two-thirds of schools in England and Wales went for
more than a year without a formal salary review.
Discretionary additions to national awards can be made for a number of
reasons, including overall performance and levels of responsibility.
Mr John Stock, co-author of the report, said: 'It seems that many governing
bodies find discussing the pay of their head embarrassing and demeaning -
which means that many heads and deputies lose out.'
Some respondents said governors had no understanding of what was involved in
the job and no experience of pay determination.
Mr Stock said the recommendation of annual review by a standing committee of
governors, made last week by the school teachers review body, should help
clarify the process.
Specialists charged with slimming down the national curriculum have not cut
enough, the government Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority said
yesterday.
Sir Ron Dearing, its chairman, announced last month that substantial cuts
were to be made in the prescribed curriculum for schools in England and
Wales, so that 20 per cent of classroom time could be left to teachers'
discretion.
But Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the authority, said plans
submitted by subject working groups had not been sufficiently ruthless.
Separate working groups have returned the draft proposals to subject
specialists for further cuts.

FT  08 FEB 94 / New tax to fund NHS proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financing the National Health Service through an earmarked tax rather than
general taxation could prove popular and clarify the debate on NHS
expenditure, the British Medical Association says in a discussion document
published yesterday.
The BMA paper argues that a 'hypothecated', or dedicated, tax would
encourage public discussion about investment in the NHS, and could under
some circumstances lead to greater funding. It recognises, however, that the
Treasury would probably oppose a specific health tax, although 'its
objections are likely to be based more on political than economic
judgments'.
Yesterday's paper is the first in a series of research and discussion
documents that the BMA plans to publish to encourage debate on health policy
issues. Other subjects will include the democratic accountability of NHS
purchasing authorities, equality of access to health services and community
care.
The BMA has consistently argued that the NHS is underfunded and one of the
potential attractions of financing the service through a dedicated tax is
health's relative popularity with the public as a spending priority.
But the document acknowledges the difficulties that would be involved in
introducing such a system. An independent body would, it says, be needed to
oversee funds raised by the health tax and determine the expenditure and tax
rates required.
There would be likely to be political opposition to setting up a body with
power to recommend changes in taxation that could have a considerable impact
on the management of the economy.
A specific health tax could, suggests the BMA document, take one of several
forms. The widest coverage of potential taxpayers would be achieved by a
flat rate or graduated health tax. But, by representing proportionately more
of the income of lower earners, it could run into the same problems as the
community charge.
The Labour party is to publish a consultative document on its future health
policy shortly. This may allow scope for debate on the possibility of a
hypothecated health tax.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Cupid takes aim at the financial heart: Rachel Johnson finds
that on Valentine's day, money might buy you love
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If money can't buy you love, love can make you money.
Next Monday the Royal Mail, greetings card manufacturers, the travel trade
and restaurateurs will be among those raking in the profits of the feast of
St Valentine, a multi-million pound industry that is set to beat all records
this year.
Royal Mail is predicting a 10 per cent rise this year in the volume of cards
sent first-class to 8.92m, and extra revenues of Pounds 2.25m.
Ms Yvette Turner, head of personal mail, said it was not just timing - last
year February 14 fell on a Sunday - that explained the increase. 'The range
of cards available from humorous to romantic is now so vast, and the greater
availability of stamps makes it easier to send a card.'
Hallmark, the privately- owned card group, refuses to disclose its share of
the frilly hearts and pink card bonanza, which is expected to have its best
year since the custom was revived in the 1920s.
As a guide, the Valentine's day card market was worth Pounds 26.5m in the UK
last year, with romantics spending an average of Pounds 1.31 on 20.2m cards.
According to Royal Mail research, the most dedicated senders are
Midlands-based women - females send 50 per cent more cards than males - in
the 25-34 or 45-54 age brackets. The least romantic are male readers of The
Times from the West Country.
For the travel and restaurant trades, timing is all. With the day falling on
Monday, lovers will take longer breaks. Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said
bookings were up 20 per cent rise on last year for the weekend - and the
most popular destinations are, inevitably, romantic-sounding cities such as
Paris and Venice.
Newspapers make money from hotels advertising their Valentine breaks - a
typical specimen this year offers a two-night break plus dinner in a
'candlelit restaurant, complimentary champagne and red roses' for under
Pounds 100.
The other money-spinner is classified advertisements. The Independent hopes
to match the Pounds 26,000 it earned last year from two full pages of 1,000
advertisements. But Mr Giles Johnson of the classified section realises that
falling circulation and a 50p rise in the price of an eight-word message
might deter all but the most ardent.
For regional restaurants, the prospect of a full house on the slowest night
of the week - when many do not bother to open their doors - are enticing
them to do so for the first time in months.
Miss Brenda Blacklaws, who manages the Peat Inn in Fife, predicts that
business will be brisk enough to outweigh the disadvantages of serving
couples at tables for four.
Not all restaurants are so accommodating towards the 'gruesome twosomes' -
they often start the evening with high expectations and end it in tears. Ms
Sally Clarke, owner of Clarke's in Kensington, west London, said she 'hates
Valentine's day more than anything'. She tries to discourage canoodling
couples by offering starters such as 'skewered ducks' hearts' on the night.
At least Ms Clarke does not have to endure the American approach to
Valentine's day. Not only are 1bn cards, 55m roses and Dollars 655m (Pounds
436.60m) worth of sweets due to be bought, but there is to be a charity ball
in Kissimmee, Florida - for couples only.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Tougher tobacco advertising rules rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected proposals for firmer legal controls on
tobacco advertising and said it would not impose tax penalties on
manufacturers which advertise.
The news was welcomed by the Advertising Association, the umbrella group for
clients and practitioners in the industry, but greeted with dismay by health
groups and Ash, the anti-smoking group.
Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, said he would press ahead with
a private member's bill banning tobacco advertising which will have its
second reading debate in the Commons on Friday.
Mr Barron said he was confident that a majority of MPs from all parties will
support the bill. The government is expected to concede a free vote,
allowing Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, and other health
ministers to abstain.
Mrs Bottomley, who failed to persuade cabinet colleagues to accept a package
of compromise proposals, is expected to try to change the bill during its
committee stage.
However, Mr Barron said he would resist pressure to water down the bill. 'If
the committee reflects the vote on the floor of the house, as it should do,
I am sure that there will be no need to change it at all,' he said.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said there was 'little to support the
argument that a statutory ban would have a dramatic effect on further
reducing smoking, especially in comparison with the impact of other measures
such as price or parental influence'.
The government plans to start talks with the tobacco industry on increasing
some voluntary controls, particularly in relation to children. The rules
relating to poster advertising near schools and playgrounds, for example,
could be tightened.
A health education campaign, which will cost Pounds 12m over the next three
years, is also planned.
Ash said experience in Canada and Norway showed that advertising bans could
lead to a drop in consumption of 4 per cent to 9 per cent - equivalent to
saving between 4,400 and 10,000 lives a year in the UK.
It added: 'Their plan to renegotiate the voluntary agreement is worth
nothing. It plays into the hands of the tobacco industry, allowing it to
retreat into prepared positions from which to carry on its war against the
nation's health.'
The Royal College of Nursing said good intentions without a statutory ban on
tobacco advertising were not enough. 'Instead of tackling what the RCN
believes is the root cause in tempting first-time smokers, the government
have played safe,' it said.
Dr Mawhinney refused to comment on reports of a cabinet split on tobacco
advertising. He said the real issue was 'whether it is appropriate to
legally ban the advertising of a substance which it is perfectly legal for
people to use and enjoy'.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Pollution burden on shipping grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of pollution is becoming a financial burden for shipowners,
according to a study by the UK Protection &amp; Indemnity Club, which covers
liabilities for the owners and charterers of 8,000 ships, about 25 per cent
of the world's ocean-going fleet.
Pollution claims have amounted to Dollars 132m (Pounds 88m) since 1987, with
more than 114 claims costing Dollars 1.2m on average. During 1992, the last
year for which figures are available, the number of pollution claims
reported to the club increased to 35, compared with 79 over the previous
five years.
'Pollution tends to be an all-or-nothing claim,' said Mr Peter Donnellan, a
director of Thomas Miller P &amp; I, which manages the club.
'It is increasingly expensive for all shipowners. We have to make the
mariner aware that even the smallest spillages of fuel oil can be very
damaging for the environment,' he added.
Tankers are involved in 45 per cent of pollution claims, according to the
club's latest analysis of claims. But about one-third resulted from spills
of fuel oil, many of which were the result of human error.
Overall between 1987 and 1992 the club's managers paid Dollars 989m in
meeting 1,971 separate claims, according to the analysis. In the course of
1982 527 claims were reported costing members Dollars 205m.
Cargo and personal injury claims accounted for about three-quarters of total
claims. The steady increase in claims has led to a tripling in premium rates
since 1987.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Industry says half of waste should be recycled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK should aim to recycle half of its waste packaging by the end of the
century, leading industrialists said last night.
Meeting that target would add only 1p to every Pounds 10 food shopping bill
'and will therefore have little inflationary effect', they said, in a report
presented yesterday to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The UK should
also incinerate nearly a tenth of its waste packaging in schemes to extract
energy, the report said. Last year the UK produced 7.3m tonnes of waste
packaging, half household and half commercial, but recycled less than a
third. The waste total is forecast to rise to 8m tonnes by the year 2000.
The group of 28 leading retailers and manufacturers has been working on the
plans since last autumn, when Mr Gummer challenged them to find ways of
recycling between half and three-quarters of the UK's waste packaging. Mr Ed
Falkman, chief executive of Waste Management International, the
environmental services group, said yesterday that the industry plans 'are
probably achievable if the government really gets serious'.
He added that the delay in bringing in tougher rules on landfills - licensed
rubbish dumps - had kept landfill prices low, undermining the incentive to
recycle. Publication of the industry's targets comes against a background of
crisis in the German scheme for recycling packaging, which has left mounds
of unwanted rubbish at sites across Germany and in neighbouring countries.
The 28 companies - called the Producer Responsibility Group - say that
ill-designed schemes, such as the German example, could add 1 per cent to
the UK cost of living.
Under a new European packaging waste directive to be presented soon to the
European Parliament, countries must recycle between 25 per cent and 45 per
cent of packaging waste within five years of the directive coming into
force. In total, between 50 per cent and 65 per cent of packaging must be
recovered.
Mr James Devereux of Incpen, the packaging industry trade association, said
there were concerns about how the scheme would be financed. Industry
estimates suggest the proposals could cost Pounds 100m to implement.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Whips lobby Tory MPs to back de-regulation move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's business managers have been lobbying Tory backbenchers to
support its de-regulation initiative which seeks to give parliament sweeping
new powers.
On the eve of the bill's second reading a Tory whip said the government
could have a difficult time overturning any Lords amendment watering down
the bill, which would give ministers the power to amend or repeal laws
without primary legislation.
The whip said: 'Any attempt to amend this bill would destroy the initiative.
There cannot be any U-turn.'
Mrs Angela Rumbold MP, a strong supporter of the bill, conceded that a
number of Tory backbenchers would need reassurances.
She said: 'This bill does not go far enough quickly enough but it is a very
important start.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked the bill for
trying to repeal primary legislation without going through the 'proper
procedures'.
The Institute of Directors called on MPs to reject any amendments to bills
limiting the order-making powers proposed for ministers.
Ms Ann Robinson, the institute's head of policy, said: 'It is ridiculous to
argue about constitutional concerns. The fact is the constitutional balance
as it stands is tipped in favour of regulation.'
Ministers argue that the key to the bill is the powers it gives government
to repeal regulation 'on an ongoing basis'.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday moved to make some of the
banking accounting requirements of the Companies Act 1985 more flexible. The
move, part of the de-regulation drive, will remove the definition of
'banking activities' and 'banking transactions' in one of the schedules to
the act.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Gummer hits at rise of hypermarket 'sprawl'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sprawl of new hypermarkets across the countryside was attacked last
night by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary.
He urged local authorities to discourage huge shopping centres built on
greenfield sites outside towns. Instead, they should improve shops in town
centres where 'competing businesses are near enough for shoppers to compare
prices and benefit from competition'.
Speaking in a Commons debate on the policies needed to meet the 'green'
targets set at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992, he said that town centres
'will be attractive to residents, shoppers and visitors, because they have
restaurants and cafes, culture and entertainment'.
Mr Gummer's attack on urban sprawl comes against a background of mounting
concern in some of the Conservative heartlands in southern England that new
roads and construction are eroding the countryside.
MPs believe these could be central issues in some regions ahead of local
government elections in May and European parliament elections in June.
Last month Mr John Major, the prime minister, launched four reports on the
UK's 'sustainable development' strategy, the subject of last night's debate.
He said that there was no need for improvements in environmental protection
to slow down economic growth.
But last night Mr Gummer stressed that industry should not be saddled with
crippling financial burdens or 'impossible demands'.
He gave a guarded welcome to the industry-led initiative announced earlier
in the day for recycling and recovering more than half of the UK's waste
packaging by the end of the century.
Mr Gummer said that 'businesses must decide whether to join it or face the
prospect of a much more bureaucratic scheme' imposed by a European Union
directive.
Mr Gummer accused Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs of dishonesty and
hypocrisy in opposing the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel
without proposing other ways of meeting the Rio targets. He said that
parties committed to ending nuclear power would have to tax fuel 'more
heavily' than the government in order to meet the targets.
However, last night Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, attacked
ministers for claiming that the imposition of VAT on fuel was 'some sort of
a green measure', he said. 'In reality, it is to raise money for the
exchequer.'
Mr Smith said that VAT on gas and electricity bills would not change the
behaviour of the overwhelming majority, who would carry on using the same
amount of energy as before.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein faces renewed pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday mounted a fresh show of unity to
step up pressure on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to accept the
Downing Street peace declaration.
Both governments are refusing to impose deadlines for a response from Sinn
Fein, but it was suggested last night that a decision would be expected one
way or the other by the time Sinn Fein holds its annual conference in Dublin
at the end of the month.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, are to meet later this month to assess developments since the
December declaration. Although they accept that the visit to the US of Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, handed the party a valuable propaganda
coup, they remain determined to drive home the message that the prospects
for peace lie in the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA.
In Londonderry, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he
believed people had become 'very impatient' and enough time had passed for a
response to the declaration. He warned he might be prepared to go ahead with
inter-party talks not only without Sinn Fein, but also without the Rev Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, which remains opposed to the Downing
Street declaration.
Mr Reynolds, speaking in Dublin, urged Sinn Fein to respond positively and,
in a departure from earlier statements which was intended to maximise the
chances of Sinn Fein acceptance, stressed that the declaration was
'essentially an Irish peace initiative'. There could be no renegotiation of
the document 'though it may eventually be transcended'.
In a reference to London's determination to press on with internal talks, Mr
Reynolds stressed that the declaration emphasised 'peace first, negotiations
afterwards'. The opposite approach had been tried among the constitutional
parties 'with little sign of success so far'.
He was non-committal, however, over a timetable for constitutional talks.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Thorp go-ahead attacked in court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to give the go-ahead for the Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant was legally flawed by an irrational failure of Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary, to hold a public inquiry, the High Court was
told yesterday.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, for environmental group Greenpeace, told Mr Justice
Potts: 'This is the most important radioactive discharge concern which there
ever has been or is ever likely to be - at least in the foreseeable future.'
Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council have launched a joint application
for judicial review over the authorisation for the Pounds 2.8bn plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria.
Mr Collins urged the judge to declare unlawful the consultation process
which led to British Nuclear Fuels being given approval for the plant. If
Thorp went ahead, radioactive discharges into the air and the Irish Sea
would occur as uranium and plutonium were separated from spent fuel.
Greenpeace and Lancashire argue that without a public inquiry no authorising
authority could properly agree to the proposed 'dramatic increases' in
radioactive emissions, which could lead to many deaths.
BNF rejects the allegations and insists that Thorp will operate within
acceptable safety limits.
Mr Collins said Greenpeace had been asking for a public inquiry ever since
consultations on the plant were first announced in November 1992, but the
request had consistently been turned down.
One of BNF's grounds for not having an inquiry now was the cost - the
company was losing more than Pounds 1m a week and would do so until the new
plant became operational. Mr Collins said that if the government had acted
as it should have done and held an inquiry at the appropriate time it would
have been over by now.
The hearing, which is expected to last five days, continues tomorrow.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Talks on paper's future to be held
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing which owns The
Independent newspaper, will hold talks in the next few days with all those
involved in the loss-making company's future.
Mr Hay Davison, accompanied by Sir Kit McMahon, a fellow non-executive
director, will meet the main parties in turn to try to gauge their
intentions.
Those involved include the founders' group, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
which controls 10 per cent of the company; the two continental European
newspaper groups El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy which together
own 37 per cent; and Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of
Ireland, who bought a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing on
Friday.
The two non-executive directors will also meet Mr David Montgomery, chief
executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, which would have taken a 40 per cent
stake in Newspaper Publishing if a Pounds 55m bid for the company had
succeeded.
The consortium which groups MGN, El Pas, La Repubblica and the founders is
now considering the possibility of an increased offer for the company
although it is believed that no final decision has yet been taken.
Meanwhile, it is believed that contacts have continued between Mr Hay
Davison and Lord Hollick's MAI group which recently made an agreed takeover
bid for Anglia Television. Mr Hay Davison believes that persuading a
television company to become a minority shareholder would help protect the
group's independence.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Check-off system lifts union rolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of Britain's trade unions are reporting an increase in the
size of their memberships as a result of a campaign to secure agreement from
workers that their subscriptions can be paid directly from their pay packets
by their employer.
Initially it was widely thought that the legal requirement for worker
acceptance of the so-called check-off system in the government's latest
labour legislation would seriously cut union strength as a result of
resistance or apathy.
There are signs, however, that the opposite might be happening. Yesterday Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that it had
received encouraging reports from its regional offices pointing to increased
membership. 'This is happening across both regions and sectors with
increases of 2 to 3 per cent,' he added.
Similar growth is also apparent in early returns from the GMB general union,
where increases of 4 per cent have been reported while in the AEEU
engineering union there are no signs of any drop in members.
The AEEU budgeted for a 10 per cent membership loss but Mr Gavin Laird, its
general secretary, said yesterday this had been 'over-pessimistic'. Last
month saw a slight growth.
'So far, so good,' said Mr Ron Edwards, the official co-ordinating the
check-off campaign at the TUC yesterday. 'The members are responding.' Mr
Edwards said the unions had found 'neither hostility nor apathy'.
The approval of union members for check-off has to be achieved by August 29
under the law.
'We have no evidence that employers have withdrawn check-off facilities,'
said Mr Edwards. 'I am much more optimistic about the check-off campaign
than I used to be.'
The TGWU yesterday launched a postal ballot of its members to win their
approval for continuing to have a political fund.
Last year the union allocated Pounds 2.4m of the Pounds 3m raised from
members for the political fund to be used by the Labour party in affiliation
fees at Pounds 3.12 per member.

FT  08 FEB 94 / N Sea pipeline deal elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK and Norway signalled yesterday that they are still some way from
ratifying an agreement to extend use of the Frigg pipeline to transport
additional North Sea gas to the UK.
Mr Tim Eggar, UK energy minister, and Mr Jens Stoltenberg, his Norwegian
counterpart, were unable to complete the negotiations, which have lasted for
nearly two years.
The Norwegians want to extend use of the pipeline, which already pipes gas
from the Frigg field to Scotland, to cover other Norwegian fields. The UK
wants the new agreement to cover wider issues of trade in oil and gas
between the two countries.
A number of major gas deals depend on successful completion of the
negotiations, the largest involving National Power, the electricity
generator, buying 2.2bn cu m of gas from GFU, Norway's gas negotiating
committee. The deal would run over 15 years, starting in the mid-1990s.
The two ministers said yesterday that they were committed to exploring
further ways of reaching an agreement. But they warned that no conclusion of
the talks was expected in the near future.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Review of counties' future extended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More time is to be allowed for the first stages of most of the review of
local government in the English counties, the Local Government Commission
for England decided yesterday.
The decision follows the the government's announcement that it would not
appeal against the recent High Court ruling that Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier
structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but
'exceptional' circumstances.
The government said some councils had asked the commission for more time to
consider their positions because they felt the change of guidance might
alter the nature of the submissions they were planning to send to the
commission.
The commission is to allow those scheduled to submit proposals at the end of
February and at the end of March more time - an extra six weeks and an extra
five weeks respectively. But because those due to make their proposals at
the end of April and the end of May will have enough time to consider their
position, it does not propose to alter these dates.
Mr Gummer has already approved the commission's final recommendations for
the creation of a unitary council on the Isle of Wight and of four unitary
councils for Cleveland. He has asked it to review Derbyshire and County
Durham again.
The commission said draft recommendations would be produced for consultation
in the late spring or summer.
It believes all reviews are still likely to be completed by the original
deadline of December 31.

FT  08 FEB 94 / London and Dublin step up pressure on Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, TIM COONE and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, DUBLIN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday mounted a fresh show of unity to
step up pressure on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to accept the
Downing Street peace declaration.
Both governments are refusing to impose deadlines for a response from Sinn
Fein, but it was suggested last night that a decision would be expected one
way or the other by the time Sinn Fen holds its annual conference in Dublin
at the end of the month.
In spite of some irritation in Dublin over the British government's
announced intention to press on with talks aimed at finding a political
settlement in Ulster, both sides renewed criticism of Sinn Fein and urged it
to make up its mind.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, are due to meet later this month to assess developments since
the December declaration. Though they both accept that the visit to the US
of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, handed the party a valuable
propaganda coup, they remain determined to drive home the message that the
prospects for peace now lie in the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA.
In Londonderry, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said that he
believed people had become 'very impatient' and that enough time had passed
for a response to the declaration. He warned he might be prepared to go
ahead with inter-party talks not only without Sinn Fein, but also without
the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which remains opposed to
the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Reynolds, speaking in Dublin, urged Sinn Fein to respond positively and,
in a departure from earlier statements which was intended to maximise the
chances of Sinn Fein acceptance, stressed that the declaration was
'essentially an Irish peace initiative'. There could be no renegotiation of
the document 'though it may eventually be transcended'.
In a reference to London's determination to press on with internal talks, Mr
Reynolds stressed that the declaration emphasised 'peace first, negotiations
afterwards'.
He said the opposite approach had been tried among the constitutional
parties 'with little sign of success so far'. He was non-committal however
over a timetable for the resumption of constitutional talks.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said in Brussels that the Dublin
government was looking for a clear sign to emerge from Sinn Fein's annual
conference.
'It is make up your mind time,' he added.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Barter proves best for business, Burma
style - Conducting trade with one of the world's most closed economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few business activities are as challenging as trading with Burma. The
country is short of foreign exchange, is burdened with foreign debt payment
arrears of about Dollars 1bn, and has an official exchange rate that values
the local currency, the kyat, at 20 times its black market rate.
As if this were not enough, the military junta is regarded with such
distaste by western governments because of its dismal human rights record
that Burma - one of the world's poorest countries - has largely been denied
foreign aid. Corruption is widespread.
The Burmese economy, however, has grown by about 5 or 6 per cent a year for
the past couple of years; the generals have cautiously liberalised the
economy, encouraged border trade with China, welcomed more tourists and
courted foreign investors from Thailand, Singapore and further afield.
Barter, or countertrade, is playing an important role in this economic
revival. Swapping products allows traders to bypass problems caused by the
overvalued official kyat, and many Burmese and foreign import-export
companies have found themselves reluctantly involved in barter deals.
While some government ministries have access to foreign exchange, most
private Burmese companies are allowed to pay for imports only with money
earned from their exports.
Furthermore, private traders must spend a quarter of their export earnings
on imports deemed to be essential - such as palm oil - or convert a fifth of
their dollars into kyat at the official rate, akin to throwing money down
the drain.
'The trading side of things is not in accordance with normal business
principles,' said one Burmese partner in a Rangoon trading company. 'There
is no way you could make any money out of exporting anything from Burma
officially. And the person exporting to Burma has to be prepared to receive
strange products and sell them.'
One of the most prominent barter arrangements in Burma is the deal between
the ministry of forestry and Turnkey Contracts and Consultancy, a Singapore
company, for construction of the recently opened International Business
Centre, Rangoon's first modern office block.
Diplomats in Rangoon say the multi-million dollar prestige project, in which
companies such as Sumitomo and Texaco have already provisionally booked
space, was paid for in Burmese logs.
Asked whether he was paid in cash or trees, Mr Bernard Kwek, managing
director of the Singapore company, said 'a bit of each' and described the
deal as 'pretty complicated'.
But most barter trade involves Burma's 5,000 or so small import-export
companies. Many of them have not been established long enough to amass
foreign exchange reserves that would allow them to use a letter of credit to
pay for imports.
In a typical deal a foreign company - often owned by one of the importer's
Sino-Burmese relatives living in Hong Kong, Singapore or Bangkok - will send
electronic goods, cement, machinery or pharmaceuticals to Burma on a
'consignment' basis - in other words, on credit.
The importer then sells the goods for kyat on the free market, uses the kyat
to buy local products - rice, beans, pulses, teak or fish - and then exports
these commodities, either directly to the foreign party or elsewhere to
raise dollars to pay for the original imports.
Intense competition to buy limited quantities of Burmese commodities for
export has pushed the prices of some Burmese products above their value on
the international market. This problem (another way of looking at it is to
say that the free-market kyat is undervalued) threatens the profits of both
parties to a barter deal.
Another complication is that different imports to Burma command different
effective exchange rates because some products are more scarce than others.
A dollar's worth of palm oil, for instance, sells for about 90 kyat, whereas
a dollar's worth of medical drugs can earn 180 kyat.
Traders have to know which products are being smuggled in from China and
which imports are being bought by government enterprises with kyat at the
official rate; in both cases the cost of the goods would undercut imports
brought in legally by private companies for barter deals.
Burmese businessmen complain that barter trade allows foreigners to make
money on both ends of a deal. A Taiwanese company, say, can sell trucks at a
profit to Burma, receive payment in logs, and then sell the logs for an
additional profit in Taiwan. 'They are smarter businessmen,' complained one
Burmese trader.
But foreigners can lose money as well. Mr Pat Ferguson, a Scottish trader
who has done business in Burma since the army crushed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, claimed he had not been paid for a shipment of milk powder
and palm oil sent to Burma on credit.
He has protested to the Burmese trade ministry and the British embassy in
Rangoon. 'I'm down Dollars 219,000,' he said.

completion, which is expected in 1996, the plant is expected to supply about
1m cubic metres of drinking water a day and provide about a quarter of the

The contract is the first significant commercial agreement for a French

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The administration of President Bill Clinton this week is expected to ask
Congress for a broad reauthorisation of its power to impose unilateral
controls on the export of technology, equipment and products applicable for
military purposes.
This move comes in spite of long-term pressure by US business lobbyists
against unilateral controls, which they say fail to stop 'rogue nations'
from acquiring technology and equipment commonly available from other
countries.
The Clinton administration has acted swiftly to decrease the level of
computer technology requiring export licences. However, according to a new
report by the influential private-sector Council on Competitiveness, 'a
lingering cold war mentality' still produces export controls which cost the
US economy billions of dollars a year.
'If past practices continue, some analysts predict that the US could lose
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) and 600,000 jobs a year by the mid 1990s,' the
council says.
The council report, Economic Security: the DollarsDollars and Sense of US
Foreign Policy, also raises concerns about the imminent demise of the
Paris-based Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls and the
failure by the US and its allies to create a successor agency.
'Despite industry's concerns, State Department negotiators have indicated a
great deal of uncertainty as to the ability of the US to achieve a new
multilateral export regime, creating the spectre of a new entity that would
actually leave the US with additional unilateral controls,' the report says.
After failing to write new export control legislation last year, the
administration is likely to ask Congress for a bill which gives the US State
and Defence Departments review authority in export licensing provisions.
Business groups have been urging Congress to concentrate authority in the
Commerce Department, to limit the number of technologies and products to be
controls, and to publish the countries for which controls are deemed
necessary.
The council analysed the results of eight foreign policy decisions resulting
in controls, which cost the US more than Dollars 6bn in exports and 120,000
jobs. In one case, the US became the only country to impose controls of
exports of on-highway tractors to Iran, thus costing US business the sale of
up to 10,000 tractors for each of the next five years.
'The export restrictions are having little impact on Iran, because US
commercial on-highway tractors are readily replaceable, and are being
replaced by European and Japanese tractors,' it says.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: World Bank urges Asian telecoms
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical liberalisation of national telecommunications regimes is essential
to meet Asia's demand for improved communications, according to a World Bank
discussion paper.
The paper calls for the break-up of existing monopolies and the licensing of
competing telecommunications providers as 'probably the best way' to meet
the region's growing demand for telecoms services.
The discussion paper, written by Mr Peter Smith, a senior telecoms
specialist at the World Bank, and Mr Gregory Staple, a consultant to the
Bank, comes at a critical juncture in the development of policies for
improving telecommunications in the Asia/Pacific region.
While the region's more advanced countries - notably Japan, Australia and
New Zealand - have liberalised telecommunications rapidly in the past
decade, the region's less developed countries have moved more cautiously.
Asia's low-income countries are estimated to have barely 25m phone lines for
2.8bn people. Programmes for expansion are a priority, with governments
increasingly prepared to look beyond their state monopoly operator.
Several countries - notably Thailand - have pioneered 'build, operate,
transfer' projects, under which private operators, including overseas
companies, are granted concessions to provide infrastrucure and services in
specific areas.
Privatisation is also under consideration, notably in India, which could
lead to one of the region's largest flotations in recent years.
Even China, which has until now resisted pressure from overseas operators
willing to build networks, is considering licensing new entrants in a bid to
meet its goal of providing 17.5m new lines by 2000.
The World Bank study describes pragmatic policies of that type as important
but 'at best a partial solution'. 'More important than this 'top down'
approach are likely to be various 'bottom up' approaches, funded by a mix of
public and private capital, involving new concessions to independent
telephone companies.'
It argues that radical liberalisation alone will enable low-income countries
in the region to generate the estimated Dollars 90bn-Dollars 120bn needed
for advanced switching and transmission facilities to underpin network
modernisation.
The study, which is not official World Bank policy, also calls for improved
regulatory regimes to allow inter-connection between new and existing
networks and competition between operators.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Costa Rican victor attacks free market
</HEADLINE>

   SAN JOSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The narrow victor in Costa Rica's presidential election said free market
policies had impoverished the country. He vowed to tackle poverty and
improve health and education services, writes David Scanlan in San Jose.
In one of the closest presidential elections in the country's history, Mr
Jose Mara Figueres, 39, of the left-of-centre National Liberation party,
defeated Mr Miguel Angel Rodrguez, 54, of the ruling Social Christian Unity
party on Sunday. The winner polled 49.7 per cent, just 2.2 percentage points
ahead of his rival, according to preliminary official results.
'We've had enough of the neo-liberal policies that have impoverished Costa
Rica,' Mr Figueres told thousands of jubilant supporters at party
headquarters in San Jose.
'We will govern for those who have had less and need more,' said Mr
Figueres, a former agriculture minister and graduate of Harvard University
and West Point military academy in the US. The president-elect will take
office on May 8.
Mr Figueres said during the campaign he wanted to renegotiate agreements
with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But political
analysts see little room for manoeuvre. A new round of economic reforms must
be approved by the legislative assembly and the government needs financial
support from the institutions.
'I think you'll see some cosmetic changes,' said Mr Carlos Sojo, a political
analyst with Flacso, a Costa Rican think-tank. 'But a part of (the
adjustment policies) is inevitable.' For example, Mr Figueres might halt
plans to sell the state-owned insurance and telecommunications services, but
still open the industries to private competition, Mr Sojo said.
Mr Figueres told a news conference yesterday that sale of the state
insurance institute would only go ahead if 'it was good for Costa Ricans'.
'I think you'll see Figueres continue with the structural adjustment
policies, but with a greater emphasis on social programmes to soften the
blow,' said Mr Victor Borge, a Costa Rican pollster.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton budget brings back rosy scenario -
It is fiscally responsible but the spending projections are implausibly
optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton delivered a fiscally responsible budget yesterday,
but the administration's projections of future spending trends look
implausibly optimistic.
In an attempt to create room for increased investment in areas critical for
American competitiveness, such as education and training, Mr Clinton is
proposing a 'hard freeze' on discretionary spending.
He envisages total discretionary spending rising from Dollars 550.1bn in
fiscal 1994 to Dollars 554.4bn (Pounds 369.6bn) in fiscal 1999, in cash
terms less than 1 per cent. And this is not to be achieved only through the
continuing shrinkage of the defence budget, which declines 13 per cent over
this period.
Mr Clinton plans a total increase in non-defence discretionary spending of
only 9.9 per cent in cash terms over five years - a substantial cut in real
terms given that inflation of 3.0-3.5 per cent a year is expected over this
period. Few industrial countries have achieved this kind of restraint on
domestic programmes. And there is little in US history to suggest it will be
feasible: between 1989 and 1994, such spending rose 45 per cent in cash
terms.
The proposed freeze is the only way Mr Clinton can achieve the deficit
reduction he promised while also modestly increasing public investment.
Spending on mandatory or entitlement programmes - such as healthcare and
public-sector pensions - will continue to rise rapidly, crowding out other
expenditure. Mandatory spending will rise 4.4 per cent in the coming year,
against less than 1 per cent for non-defence discretionary spending. Over
the next five years mandatory spending is projected to rise from Dollars
730.4bn to Dollars 1,020.5bn, or 40 per cent.
It is optimism on spending that permits Mr Clinton to project sharp declines
in federal borrowing. In spite of last year's tax increases on the wealthy,
total receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product are projected to
decline slightly over the next five years - from 18.8 per cent of GDP to
18.6 per cent. Spending, however, is expected to fall from 22.3 per cent of
GDP to 20.9 per cent.
The deficit is expected to decline from Dollars 234.5bn (3.5 per cent of
GDP) in fiscal 1994 to a trough of Dollars 173.1bn in fiscal 1996 (2.3 per
cent of GDP). It then begins to creep higher, exceeding Dollars 200bn by
fiscal 1999.
None of these figures allows for the impact of this year's main legislative
priority - reform of healthcare, a sector that accounts for 14 per cent of
GDP. Mr Clinton's plan would extend health cover to uninsured Americans (15
per cent of the population) and guarantee a generous package of benefits for
everyone.
According to White House estimates these additional costs would be largely
offset by parallel measures to reduce the rate of growth of spending - such
as the creation of large purchasing co-operatives and caps on growth in
private-sector insurance premiums.
The administration estimates that if Mr Clinton's health plan were
implemented, mandatory spending would grow by 45 per cent over five years, a
little faster than the 40 per cent projected without reform. With the plan,
mandatory spending would rise from 11 per cent of GDP today to 12 per cent
in fiscal 1999; without it, mandatory spending would rise to 11.7 per cent.
The White House figures again look optimistic. But any calculations are
hypothetical because it appears unlikely that Mr Clinton's health plan will
be enacted in its original form. Congress seems likely to favour less
ambitious reforms which scale back the level of guaranteed health benefits
but which also impose fewer direct controls on spending growth.
The stress on fiscal discipline in Mr Clinton's budget is ostensibly
balanced by a commitment to higher public investment as a means of boosting
growth and improving the prospects of disadvantaged groups. But both
elements of the equation are exaggerated. The proposed axing of more than
100 programmes sounds impressive, but it will save only about Dollars 3bn in
a Dollars 1,500bn budget. Congress, in any case, is unlikely to approve many
of the cuts.
The investment agenda includes planned increases in spending on 'workforce
security' (improved access to skill training and job search), education
(including an expansion of the pre-school Head Start programme), commercial
technology, physical infrastructure and the environment.
Few will argue with this shift of priorities, but the scale of the
investment effort falls far short of Mr Clinton's promises during the
presidential election campaign. The president is asking Congress to approve
an additional Dollars 13.7bn in spending this year on his main investment
proposals. That represents less than 1 per cent of the budget. It is a
change only at the margin.
Mr Clinton's claim to have dispensed with Republican 'smoke and mirrors' in
his economic forecast seems only partly justified. The White House is
projecting steady economic growth of 2.5-3.0 per cent for the rest of the
decade, reducing the jobless rate to 5.5 per cent, even though this would
represent one of the longest unbroken business upswings on record. It
assumes the Federal Reserve will allow consumer price inflation to creep
higher - from 2.8 per cent last year to nearly 3.5 per cent by 1997.
The greatest optimism is reserved for interest rates. The White House
expects three-month rates to remain 3.5 per cent or less throughout this
year and, more surprising still, to average less than 4.5 per cent every
year until 1999. The yield on 10-year bonds is assumed never to rise above 6
per cent. This is indeed a rosy scenario.

FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Talbott faces a grilling over his views on
Israel - The prospects for a foreign policy hopeful under the congressional
spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott may face tough questioning on his attitudes towards
Israel, as well as over his policy stance towards Russia, when he appears
before the Senate foreign relations committee today to be grilled about his
qualifications to be deputy secretary of state.
There is no suggestion yet that his nomination is any jeopardy, but Mr
Talbott felt the need last week to hold a special meeting with
representatives of leading Jewish organisations to assure them of his good
intentions.
Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, also addressed the question,
noting that, as a journalist with Time magazine, Mr Talbott was 'a
provocative and interesting commentator'. The spokesman added, however: 'He
now has a responsibility to fulfil policies that represent the policies of
this administration', affirming that Mr Talbott would not have been named
deputy to Mr Warren Christopher if this were not so.
So far only one obscure Republican congressman has called for him to be
rejected. Most of the criticism against him has come from conservative and
strongly Zionist groups. Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israeli deputy foreign
minister, said these views did not square with his government's.
Mr Talbott is not an expert on the Middle East but two columns, written nine
years apart, have excited criticism. In 1981, he wrote that Israel was 'well
on its way to becoming not just a dubious asset but a downright liability to
American security interests'. In 1990, he wrote that the Likud party's claim
to the occupied territories 'does indeed have something in common' with
Iraq's claim to Kuwait.
This kind of thing can dog anyone in a profession with a long paper trail.
The writings of two previous nominees for high office in the present US
administration, Ms Lani Guinier and Mr Morton Halperin, proposed for the
justice and defence departments respectively, offered their opponents
voluminous evidence, often deliberately misconstrued, of alleged extreme or
unpatriotic views.
Jewish sensitivities are also a constant in Washington. One reason offered,
without much substantiation, by Mr Bobby Ray Inman for not taking the
defence secretaryship was attacks on him by Mr William Safire, the New York
Times columnist, brought about, according to Mr Inman, because of Mr
Safire's suspicions he might be anti-Israeli.
It had appeared that Mr Talbott, serving as ambassador-at-large to the
former Soviet Union, was most vulnerable to criticism on the Russian front.
Having first urged maximum reform effort, he interpreted the Russian
elections in December as proving a need for 'less shock, more therapy', only
to recant this in the light of President Bill Clinton's commitment in Moscow
last month to 'more reform and more therapy'.
However, Mr Talbott clearly enjoys the confidence of Mr Clinton, whom he has
known since their Oxford days 25 years ago, and of Mr Christopher, who has
said it is time people of the president's generation rose to the top of
foreign policy-making.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration yesterday endorsed a bill to ban or restrict smoking
in virtually all commercial and public buildings because of the health
hazard to non-smokers, especially children, Reuter reports from Washington.
Ms Carol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the
agency 'firmly believes that the scientific evidence is sufficient to
warrant actions to protect non-smokers from involuntary exposure to
second-hand smoke.' She was testifying to a health sub-committee of the
House of Representatives.
Ms Browner emphasised her special concern over 'the very serious respiratory
effects on young children.'
The bill would ban smoking in all non-residential buildings used or visited
by at least 10 people a week, except in specially ventilated smoking areas.
In the case of buildings which lacked such areas, smokers would have to go
outside to light up.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Triple drive to create private sector jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's theme, which runs through its 1995 budget, was
written by President George Bush on his ill-fated mission to Japan in 1992:
'Jobs, jobs, jobs.'
Budget items which won increases were those believed most efficient in
creating private sector jobs. About half of the nearly 2m US jobs created
last year were in high-paying managerial and professional occupations.
To increase that rate, the administration has proposed a three-pronged
workforce investment strategy.
To help young job-seekers, it is requesting Dollars 300m (Pounds 202m) for
an expansion of a model school-to-work system, designed to provide students
with work experience integrated with classroom training.
The administration also proposes spending Dollars 1.2bn in 1995 on the jobs
corps, a comprehensive residential training and education programme for
impoverished youth. It has also requested Dollars 100.5m to launch six new
centres, increasing capacity to 62,500, and Dollars 30m to repair existing
centres.
A new Dollars 1.5bn jobs investment initiative would help the unemployed
retrain and find new work at a network of up-graded, one-stop career
centres, costing Dollars 250m. The current worker adjustment programmes are
'rigid and ineffective', the budget says. The administration will
consolidate, expand and improve these schemes in a Workforce Security
programme, projected to serve 1.3m unemployed people per year.
The administration stresses jobs related to exports, which earn an average
20 per cent more than other jobs - hence its emphasis on trade and trade
finance. The US Export-Import Bank will get Dollars 134m less next year for
direct loans, but its budget for new loan guarantees rises from Dollars
10.1bn to Dollars 12.25bn.
The Small Business Administration is expected to guarantee up to Dollars 7bn
in credits to compensate for cuts in lending by the commercial banks.
Despite recent criticism that the administration is creating an industrial
policy by subsidising research and development, the Commerce Department's
budget for advanced technology grants and manufacturing extension centres is
more than doubling to Dollars 451m. There is Dollars 3.2bn (a 6 per cent
increase) for science and engineering research, Dollars 67m for new
technology investment, Dollars 451m (a 4 per cent increase) for health
research, and Dollars 2.1bn for the redesigned space station.
Nine agencies this year propose to spend over Dollars 2bn for research and
development in manufacturing technologies, a Dollars 159m (9 per cent)
increase over last year. The High Performance Computing and Communications
project, which funds programmes for more powerful computers, networks and
software, will get Dollars 1.2bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US defence spending will rise by just 1.3 per cent to Dollars 252.2bn
(Pounds 170bn) next year, the 10th straight year in which the US military
budget has risen by less that the inflation rate.
The 1995 fiscal year budget is the first for which President Bill Clinton's
Defence Department team has done more than tinker with existing military
spending plans, and marks the implementation of the Bottom Up Review of
force structure conducted last year under Mr Les Aspin, who handed over the
defence secretary's job last week to Mr William Perry.
Mr Clinton's five-year plan now projects an absolute cut in defence spending
to Dollars 243.4bn in 1996 and Dollars 240.2bn in 1997. Nominal increases in
the next two years are to leave defence spending down to just 2.8 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1999.
'It hasn't been this small since before World War II, when people were
walking around training with broomsticks on their shoulders,' a senior
Pentagon official said.
Departmental budget planners have tried to walk a fine line between those on
their left, who complain that they are still wasting money on Cold War-style
defences, and those on their right, who fear the US military will be gutted
by spending cuts.
The 1995 budget provides for a 4.9 per cent increase in the money available
for operations and maintenance, as Pentagon officials are very eager to
preserve the readiness of the smaller forces they will have at their
disposal by allowing them to maintain high operating tempos. The increase in
readiness spending is particularly marked for the army, where the average
distance driven by each tank in a year, for example, will rise from 620 to
800 miles.
Military construction, down from Dollars 6.0bn to Dollars 5.0bn, and
procurement, down by Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 43.3bn, are to bear the brunt
of spending cuts.
The budget preserves money for the development of the next generation of
major weapon systems, such as the F-22 advanced tactical fighter to be
introduced in the late-1990s, the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance
helicopter and the navy's new attack submarine, for which the first order
will be placed in 1998.
But it cancels the navy's A/F-X fighter development programme, as well as
the remaining SH-60B, SH-60F and HH-60H helicopters it had planned to buy,
ends purchases of the air force's F-16 fighter and cancels the Landsat
satellite.
In all, the Department will buy just 127 aircraft in 1995, including 42
trainers and 60 utility helicopters, compared with 943 in 1985, the peak
year of the Reagan defence build-up. It will buy six ships, compared with
29, no tanks, compared with 720, and 18 strategic missiles, compared with
48.
'We can live with that because we are living off the inventories we built up
during the Cold War. At some point, we will have to start procuring again,'
a senior Pentagon official said.
By 1995, the Department expects to have moved to 13 active fighter wings and
11 active aircraft-carriers with one in reserve, as planned in the Bottom Up
Review, but it will have to cut another two army divisions to reach the
planned total of 10 and drop another 27 surface ships to reach the review's
target of 346. Total active military manpower is projected to fall to 1.52m
by the end of 1995, and to drop another 4.8 per cent to 1.45m at the end of
1999. Reserve strength will drop by 7.4 per cent over that period to
906,000, with the Pentagon's civilian workforce falling by 9 per cent to
794,000.
Research funding for the strategic defence initiative, now mainly shifted
from the strategic defences envisioned in the Reagan era to more limited
defences against theatre ballistic missiles, will rise again to a total of
Dollars 3.25bn in 1995, having fallen to Dollars 2.7bn in the current fiscal
year. Funding for the five years 1995-1999, however, has been trimmed to
Dollars 17bn.

FT  08 FEB 94 / LA quake 'set to cost insurers about Dollars 2.5bn'
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Los Angeles earthquake last month is set to cost the insurance industry
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.69bn), the third largest insured losses after
hurricanes Andrew and Hugo, according to an insurance trade association
estimate yesterday.
The estimate of losses, from Property Claims Services, is at the high end of
other, less well-informed estimates in recent days. These have put the cost
to insurers at anything from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 3bn.
The association's figures are compiled from information supplied by 30
insurance companies and an analysis of the association's database, which
carries details of the level of property insurance cover in the affected
area.
They are generally regarded in the insurance world as the most accurate
picture available of the final cost of the earthquake.
According to the association, about a third of home-owners in the area, and
a slightly higher proportion of businesses, have earthquake coverage.
The high cost of such insurance, and the large deductibles born by people
with cover, has discouraged many from buying insurance.
The industry is anticipating about 230,000 claims as a result of the
earthquake, many of them from causes other than direct shock damage,
including damage by fire, explosion and broken glass.
If the association's estimate proves accurate, and if Congress approves the
proposed Dollars 8.6bn federal relief plan for the area, then total outside
help for California will reach about Dollars 11bn.
The rest of the earthquake's cost will be born by property owners or
taxpayers in California.
California Governor Pete Wilson said last month that the total cost of the
quake could be anywhere between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 30bn.
Hurricane Andrew, in southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico in 1992, cost
insurers Dollars 15.5bn; Hugo cost Dollars 4.2bn.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Pledge to poorest nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has pledged Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) in its 1995 budget for the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, the International Monetary Fund's
subsidised loan account to help the poorest nations reform their economies.
If the pledge survives the budget's passage through Congress, it would leave
Germany as the only main industrialised country not to have contributed to
the new ESAF, which the IMF hopes to launch this spring in place of the
almost exhausted fund it launched in 1987.
The US contribution will be paid to the subsidy account which allows the IMF
to cut the interest rate it charges on ESAF loans to the minimal level of
0.5 per cent. The money will be paid up front, so it will be valued as a
contribution of more than SDR100m (Pounds 108m), roughly the level that
other countries had been asking for as a fair US share.
The overall US budget for international affairs will remain stagnant at
Dollars 20.9bn, with aid to the states of the former Soviet Union roughly
halved to Dollars 900m.
The administration's proposals to cut humanitarian assistance spending by
Dollars 77m to Dollars 1.63bn, including a Dollars 37m cut in refugee aid,
could run into criticism in Congress.
The aid budget proposes full payment of this year's Dollars 1.25bn slice of
the US pledge to the International Development Association, the World Bank
subsidised loan facility similar to the IMF's ESAF.
It also provides Dollars 87m to start clearing US arrears in payments to the
multilateral development banks, including Dollars 20m of arrears to the
African Development Fund.
The administration also proposes to restore the Dollars 70m US contribution
to the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which was struck out of last year's budget amid the furore over the bank's
lavish London headquarters.

Plans by foreign media groups to invest in India have run into political
controversy and legal argument. The Financial Times and Time magazine of the
US have submitted investment proposals to the Indian government, in the
belief economic liberalisation will soon extend to newspaper and magazine
publishing.
The FT plans to publish a business daily in partnership with the Ananda
Bazar Patrika Group, a Calcutta-based publishing house, and Time is
proposing printing an Indian edition in collaboration with Time and Living
Media, publisher of India Today, India's leading news magazine. Other
publications which have considered printing in India include the
International Herald Tribune.
Foreign publishers and their Indian partners believe the Indian market
offers big opportunities. But before they can invest, they must persuade the
government to lift a ban on foreign newspapers, magazines and news agencies
imposed in 1956 by Mr Jawarhalal Nehru, India's first premier, who believed
the country needed protecting from foreign influences.
With satellite TV beaming everything from BBC News to Madonna concerts into
millions of homes, many Indians say Mr Nehru's restrictions look
increasingly obsolete. Reuters, the UK news agency, has been given
permission to distribute a limited service. A recent survey by Business
India magazine showed 65 per cent of those polled supported entry of foreign
newspapers.
English-language newspapers account for only about 60 of India's 350
dailies, but dominate the reading of the country's political and business
elite. The foreign groups' plans have provoked sharp differences of opinion
in the newspaper industry. Last month, the All-India Newspaper Editors'
Conference warned the foreign press's 'invasion' would be an 'infringement
of the fundamental rights and constitutional guarantees provided to Indian
citizens'.
The Press Council, the industry's watchdog, stands by a demand it made in
1992 that government decisions on amending Mr Nehru's ban should be
postponed for 'three to five years'. But some editors have spoken out in
favour of foreign investment, including Mr HK Dua, editor of the Hindustan
Times daily, who told a media conference last week: 'We must pull ourselves
up instead of bemoaning the entry of others into the market.'
The overseas groups' plans have some strong supporters among politicians,
notably Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, who believes India will benefit
from greater access to overseas news. But others are more cautious. Mr Pran
Chopra, a former newspaper editor who favours the entry of foreign
publications, says: 'Many politicians fear that (by opening the market) they
might cause a political storm for little benefit.' Mr Chopra believes
Premier PV Narasimha Rao will take time to make up his mind, but the spread
of satellite TV will make the ban on printed publications meaningless.
Much of the controversy centres on the Financial Times. The FT would have a
50.1 per cent stake in the venture, but only two out of 500 staff would be
sent from the FT. Mr David Bell, chief executive of the FT, says: 'The paper
will be Indian-edited and Indian-managed.' Ananda Bazar, a family-owned
group run by Mr Aveek Sarkar, would merge into the venture its existing
business paper, Business Standard.
The new paper would compete with the Economic Times, the market leader,
controlled by the Delhi-based Jain family, whose flagship is the Times of
India, the premier English-language daily.
The FT and the Times of India group are involved in court battles over
rights to the Financial Times name. The FT registered the name with the
trade marks registrar in 1987. But the Times of India group registered the
same name two years later with the registrar of newspapers for India, a
separate official body. The Times of India then started publishing papers
sporadically with the name Financial Times.
The FT has challenged the Times of India's right to publish a pink paper
called the Financial Times. Individuals have filed cases in the high courts
of Delhi, Allahabad and Bangalore challenging the foreign papers' rights to
register their names in India. Lawyers for the FT have claimed in the Delhi
High Court that these individuals are 'a front' for the Times of India
group. Mr Bell and Mr Ashok Jain, head of the Times of India group, declined
to comment on the dispute. It will probably have to go to the Supreme Court.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Peace hopes raised by Arafat and Peres
</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, last night raised expectations they would complete a long delayed
security agreement on Palestinian self-rule as they began meeting in Cairo.
Both men said they had made progress in the first round of talks at the
Egyptian foreign ministry and that they hoped to reach and initial a final
agreement in Cairo. The two sides were to continue talking overnight and
this morning.
The completion of an agreement, after months of bitter argument between the
two sides, would pave the way for beginning of Israeli troop withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho and the transfer of power to
Palestinian hands.
But an agreement has proved elusive and even yesterday, hours before Mr
Peres was due to meet Mr Arafat, the Cairo talks were in doubt as Mr Peres
met senior Israeli army officers in Jerusalem to listen to their
reservations about security concessions to the PLO.
Mr Arafat had threatened not to attend unless he was sure Mr Peres had the
authority to conclude a draft agreement reached between the two men in
Davos, Switzerland, last week.
For the past week, Mr Arafat has reiterated he is ready to sign the Davos
draft agreement which largely resolved the outstanding obstacles between the
two sides on long-delayed implementation of Palestinian self-rule in
Gaza-Jericho, including the most sensitive issues of control over border
crossings and security for Jew ish settlers.
But since the Peres-Arafat meeting, objections have been raised by senior
officials of the Israeli army backed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister.
Mr Peres last night sought to reassure Palestinians. He said Israel saw the
agreement as 'a top priority and we should try and conclude it'. He had come
to Cairo with a mandate to conclude negotiations and Israel would stand by
the Davos agreement.
'I am not a private person and whatever we agreed in Davos will be respected
and kept to,' he said.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said the first round of
Peres-Arafat talks last night had been good and the two sides were not far
apart. It had confirmed both parties were working hard towards a final
agreement. Mr Moussa earlier said 90 per cent of the work had been completed
but the remaining gaps would not be easy.
Israeli officials cautioned that the talks might not produce a signed
agreement unless there was considerable flexibility on Mr Arafat's part to
meet the objections put for ward by the army, particularly over control on
border cross ings and roads between Israel and the settlements in Gaza.
Mr Rabin has recently insisted he will only formally sign a comprehensive
agree ment with Mr Arafat to begin Israeli withdrawal from Gaza- Jericho.
According to Mr Rabin, the comprehensive agreement must include all
outstanding issues between the two sides, including security, the
responsibility of the Pales tinian police force, and the future economic
relations between the two economies.
Officials said if things went well in Cairo, Mr Arafat and Mr Peres might
initial an agreement on security issues, but a formal Rabin-Arafat sign ing
would have to wait a fur ther two to three weeks for economic and other
issues to be finalised in Paris and Taba.
Israeli jets yesterday bombed south Lebanon twice in retaliation for attacks
by pro-Iranian guerrillas which left three Israeli soldiers dead and four
wounded. The attack on Israeli forces in Israel's self-declared security
zone is the bloodiest such raid in six months.

Japan's seven-party coalition failed to agree a compromise on how to fund
tax cuts to stimulate the economy yesterday, undermining prospects for a
successful outcome to the US-Japan summit at the end of this week.
Exhausted coalition members in Tokyo agreed to resume talks on economic
measures this morning after four rounds of discussion brought them little
closer on prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan for an immediate Y6,000bn
(Pounds 36bn) a year tax cut, to be funded by a controversial new 7 per cent
tax on goods and services from 1997.
Mr Hosokawa is under pressure from the US to show hard evidence of Japan's
plans to cut its fast growing current account surplus when he meets US
President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday. The surplus rose by 11.7 per
cent from Dollars 117.55bn in 1992 to a record Dollars 131.35bn last year,
the Finance Ministry said.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, called
on Mr Hosokawa to live up to his tax-cutting promise or hand over power.
The government 'cannot take a sweeping political decision without the
co-operation of the LDP', Mr Kono said, 'but we are reluctant to extend
support since the government is so indecisive.'
The powerful Finance Ministry is equally keen for a decision before Mr
Hosokawa leaves for the US, not least because it wants to avoid the risk
that he will unilaterally offer Mr Clinton an unfunded income tax cut, said
Mr Minoru Morita, a political commentator in Tokyo. Mr Hosokawa asked the
ministry yesterday to help prepare a compromise.
The proposed tax cuts are the centrepiece of a record Y15,100bn economic
stimulus, shelved since last week when Mr Hosokawa's announcement of a
so-called 'welfare tax' caused rebellion in coalition ranks.
The Finance Ministry supports Mr Hosokawa's insistence that any tax cut must
be combined with a plan to fund the loss of revenue, preferably not through
a permanent rise in government borrowing. Yet the Social Democratic party,
the coalition's largest partner, stuck to its demand for a tax cut now, to
be followed by a two-year grace period in which to discuss funding.
Figures announced yesterday show a reverse for the downward trend in the
current account surplus. The surplus fell in dollar terms for three months
running until November, when it reached Dollars 8.2bn for the month, only to
rise to Dollars 12.6bn in December, up 9.3 per cent on December 1992. The
trade surplus alone rose to Dollars 141.43bn for the whole of last year,
from Dollars 132.6bn in 1992.
In yen terms, however, the current account surplus fell by 2 per cent to
Y14,610bn in 1993, the first drop for three years.
The rise in December reflects increased demand for Japanese goods from the
pick-up in the US economy and a decline in the net outflow of capital, said
Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. When the
Japanese economy starts to follow the US recovery, Japan's surplus should
start to contract again, he said.
The gloomy outlook for a Japanese recovery was reinforced yesterday by the
first year-on-year drop in lending recorded by Japan's biggest 11 commercial
banks since their industry association started records 40 years ago.
Their outstanding loans fell by 0.7 per cent to Y222,160bn in January, from
the same month last year.
The Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, yesterday confirmed that
its next chairman would be Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the car group
Toyota.
Mr Toyoda, 68, who has spent nearly all his life in the family car company,
is a vigorous opponent of US demands for numerically-measured increases in
market shares of imported goods.
The car industry is one of the most sensitive parts of the present trade
talks between the US and Japan.
He will succeed the current chairman, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, at the
Keidanren's annual general meeting in late May.

Talks between the South African government, the African National Congress
and right-wing groups demanding constitutional change broke down last night,
increasing the threat of a violent boycott of April's all-race elections.
The negotiations, which have dragged on for months without success, appeared
to have reached a serious impasse, with no further talks scheduled to take
place before Saturday's deadline for political parties to register for the
elections.
The talks broke down over the issue of the autonomy of regions under South
Africa's interim constitution, with the right-wing Freedom Alliance
demanding that autonomy be protected when the constituent assembly elected
in April sits down to write a final constitution.
ANC negotiator Joe Slovo said unless there was 'serious movement on
fundamental questions on the part of the Freedom Alliance, I would say there
is no hope.'
Last night's talks took place against a background of sabotage attacks
against railways, power lines and ANC offices. Police said there had been
more than 40 such attacks in ultra-conservative areas of the Orange Free
State and western Transvaal since December.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of central Asian republics have been sending signals they are
serious about establishing a stable, friendly environment for economic
development. The International Monetary Fund has put its name behind two
republics, issuing credit to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is negotiating
with Uzbekistan.
An increasing number of investors have been bypassing Russia, Ukraine and
the Baltic states for central Asia, especially Kazakhstan. This has occurred
in tandem with Russia's demise as the economic crossroads and clearing house
for the 14 ex-Soviet republics.
Uzbekistan's recent and sudden conversion to free market policies has been
greeted with interest, and some scepticism, since President Islam Karimov
has watered down or failed to implement previous reforms.
But the Uzbek programme, announced on January 23 by presidential decree,
promises for the first time to auction off state enterprises publicly;
foreigners may bid.
The decree enacts a five-year tax holiday for manufacturers established
under more than 50 per cent foreign ownership, and phases out import duties
in July 1995. Uzbekistan is rich in gold and produces a huge cotton crop.
The Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, announced an economic reform
programme last week that goes even further then Uzbekistan's. It freed
prices on consumer goods on January 1, set a 1994 budget deficit target of 4
per cent of GNP, and froze state salaries, a risky step in the conservative
republic.
Kazakhstan is attracting attention primarily because of its tremendous
deposits of oil and natural gas. But Mr Nazarbayev has also embarked on what
ranks as among the ex-Soviet Union's most ambitious privatisation
programmes.
Last year, Philip Morris became the first private owner of a large
Kazakhstan enterprise, paying Dollars 313m (Pounds 208.6m) for a big
cigarette factory and tobacco farms in the capital, Alma-Ata. Now, the
government has issued a list of 38 more state-owned enterprises, some
employing up to 40,000 people, for auctioning to the foreign bidders.
In Kyrgyzstan, President Asghar Akayev, frustrated by parliamentary and
bureaucratic conservatives, recently obtained more authority to pursue his
reformist programme. Kyrgyz voters endorsed Mr Akayev with a 96 per cent
approval rating in a national referendum, and he has said he will push ahead
with structural reforms and privatisation.
Even if many of these reforms are only partially put into practice, they
reflect a greater acknowledgment in the region than at any time in the last
two years that the Soviet days are over.

Leaders of central Asian republics have been sending signals that they are
serious about establishing a stable, friendly environment for economic
development. The International Monetary Fund has put its name behind two of
the republics, issuing credit to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is
negotiating with Uzbekistan.
An increasing number of investors have been bypassing Russia, Ukraine and
the Baltic states for what they perceive to be better opportunities in
central Asia, especially in Kazakhstan. This shift has occurred in tandem
with Russia's demise as the economic crossroads and clearing house for the
14 ex-Soviet republics.
Uzbekistan's recent and sudden conversion to free market policies has been
greeted with interest, and some scepticism, since President Islam Karimov
has watered down or failed to implement previous reforms.
The Uzbek programme, announced on January 23 by presidential decree,
promises for the first time to auction off state enterprises publicly;
foreigners may bid. The decree also enacts a five-year tax holiday for
manufacturers established under more than 50 per cent foreign ownership, and
phases out import duties in July 1995.
Since the break-up of the Soviet Union two years ago, virtually no
western-style privatisation has taken place in Uzbekistan, which is rich in
gold and produces a huge cotton crop. Uzbekistan has taken the route of
'collectivisation', the transfer of enterprises to their employees in
fixed-price shares.
Analysts are taking this policy announcement more seriously because of the
trend in other central Asian republics. Mr Karimov is watching his regional
rival, Kazakhstan, outpacing Uzbekistan's economic progress, while his own
republic has been mired in chaos.
The Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, last week announced an
economic reform programme that goes even further then Uzbekistan's. It freed
prices on consumer goods on January 1, set a 1994 budget deficit target of 4
per cent of GNP, and froze state salaries, a risky step in the conservative
republic.
Kazakhstan is attracting attention primarily because of its tremendous
deposits of oil and natural gas. But Mr Nazarbayev has also embarked on what

Last year, Philip Morris became the first private owner of a large
Kazakhstan enterprise, paying Dollars 313m (Pounds 208.6m) for a big
cigarette factory and tobacco farms in the capital, Alma-Ata. Now, the
government has issued a list of 38 more state-owned enterprises, some
employing up to 40,000 people, for auctioning to the foreign bidders.
The list includes some long-shots, such as Alma-Ata's central market, but
for the first time it allows foreigners to buy metals facilities such as an
aluminium plant in the northern city of Pavlodar and a lead and zinc plant
in Taldy-Korgan. Later, the government says, it will auction about 7,500
state enterprises to Kazakh citizens under a coupon system.
The privatisation programme has impressed westerners who have witnessed the
frustration of trying to get started in Russia. 'If you are trying to
privatise an enterprise in Russia, a different ministry is passing a new law
every day saying you can't do it. In Kazakhstan, you know who to deal with,
and they are behind privatisation at the top,' said a western business
consultant in Alm-Ata. 'It's very centralised.'
In Kyrgyzstan, President Asghar Akayev, frustrated by parliamentary and
bureaucratic conservatives, recently obtained more authority to pursue his
reformist programme. Kyrgyz voters endorsed Mr Akayev with a 96 per cent
approval rating in a national referendum, and he has said he intends to use
the result to push ahead with structural reforms and privatisation.
Even if the reforms are only partially put into practice, they reflect a

Jordan has won slight relief on its external debts to Japan following
agreement between the two sides which will add Dollars 14.1m (Pounds 9.4m)
of principal and interest to Dollars 87.3m in debts to Japan which have
already been rescheduled, writes James Whittington in Amman.
This will not affect most of Jordan's Dollars 1.3bn mainly official debt to
Japan, for which repayment will be discussed in the next round talks with
the Paris Club of official creditors in late March.
The terms are the same as for the rescheduled Dollars 87.3m of interest and
principal agreed in June 1992. There is a grace period of nine years for
official loans and seven years for commercial loans backed by the Japanese
government.
Jordan's total external debt is around Dollars 6.8bn, or 140 per cent of
gross domestic product, after Dollars 673m of repayments on principal and
interest in 1993.

Japan's ministry of health and welfare has been afflicted by the global
epidemic of rising healthcare costs. The problem this makes for budgets is
particularly acute in Japan which has an ageing population and falling tax
receipts. Whereas in 1990 only 11.7 per cent of the population was over 65 -
the lowest proportion among the world's seven richest countries - by 2025
that figure will have more than doubled to nearly 24 per cent.
This ageing population and medical inflation running at about 7 per cent a
year would be less serious if the Japanese economy was growing. But the
exchequer is suffering from wilting tax receipts during the worst recession
since the second world war.
'We don't know exactly what the ministry is going to do,' says Ms Teruko
Onoda, drugs analyst at Merrill Lynch, says. 'But whatever it is will have
to be drastic.'
Japan's health and welfare ministry, like those elsewhere, has found the
drugs bill a tempting target for savings. Medicines represent a particularly
large target in Japan. Although pharmaceuticals account for 1.5 per cent of
gross national product, they represent about 30 per cent of healthcare
spending, far more than in western countries.
The ministry has adopted a two-prong strategy against the drugs bill,
attacking both prices and demand. The ministry's long-term aim is to reduce
spending on medicines from about 28 per cent of the Y24,340bn (Pounds 146bn)
health bill to only 20 per cent, according to the Japan Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association.
The ministry is continuing its policy of cutting prices every two years. But
this year it has added 'special' cuts for fast-growing products. Initial
fears that the price of some drugs could be cut by as much as 30 per cent
have not been realised, but these new cuts have nonetheless drawn an angry
response from the industry.
Mr Jacques Racloz, president of Sandoz Yakuhin, the subsidiary of the Swiss
group, said: 'The special price cuts were an emotional reaction, triggered
by politics. It's worrying because they're not based on the existing system
and appears arbitrary. There's also a danger they could represent a
precedent - each time a drug becomes successful, it could be hammered.'
Under the every-other-year price cutting scheme introduced two years ago,
drugs judged innovative would be allowed a premium over existing therapies
of up to 30 per cent, while less innovative but still novel compounds would
receive premiums of between 1.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent.
The industry was dismayed to discover the ministry's criteria were so strict
that over the last decade only four or five drugs would have qualified for
the full premium.
'We have to have more flexibility,' said Mr Bryan Wright, Japan
representative of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. 'There
needs to be something between 30 per cent and the lower band. Otherwise
there's little incentive to develop innovative products.'
While the price cuts and controls on new products are designed to have an
immediate impact, in the longer term, the ministry is trying to control
demand for medicines. So far, the main methods, which have not proved
particularly successful, are:
Separating the prescribing and dispensing of medicines. A substantial
proportion of hospitals' income comes through dispensing. Doctors negotiate
discounts from wholesalers, but are reimbursed by the government at the full
price. The more doctors prescribe, the higher their income. Between a third
and a quarter of doctors' earnings depend on prescribing.
Discounts ending up in doctors' pockets may account for an astonishing
Y1,000bn a year, according to one analyst. So far the ministry's efforts
have made little impression. Only 15 per cent of hospitals have separated
prescribing from dispensing of medicines and many of these are cheating by
setting up new pharmacies next door.
Fixed price contracts for chronic care of the elderly. Hospitals are paid a
fixed amount for treating certain conditions. The hospitals' margins
therefore depend on keeping down costs. Some analysts believe this could
lead to a large increase in the prescribing of cheap generic, non-patented,
drugs. However, only 5 per cent of hospitals have adopted this system.
Switching responsibility for negotiating discounts from the drugs
manufacturers to the wholesalers. The theory is that wholesalers will be
less inclined than pharmaceuticals companies to discount products. This
should reduce doctors' margins on prescribing and so reduce volumes. The
Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association estimates discounts narrowed
from 23 per cent to 18 per cent, but have now risen back to about 20 per
cent.
Even though the demand-side controls are yet to be fully effective, the
ministry's efforts appear to be bearing fruit. By the middle of last year,
data from IMS Japan, the market research group, showed growth of the drugs
market over a 12-month moving period was only 3 per cent.
Nevertheless, the ministry's continuing battle to control spending is likely
to intensify, slowing the growth of the Japanese drugs market further. For
manufacturers the consequent pain may be hard to bear. Most analysts are
predicting rationalisation.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Death of banker who helped shape West Germany: The career of
Hermann Josef Abs was one of the most brilliant of the century - but marred
by his close links to the Third Reich
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hermann Josef Abs, who died at the weekend aged 92, personified both the
triumphs and some of the problems of German business during the past 60
years.
During his post-war heyday as head of Deutsche Bank, the country's largest
bank, Mr Abs won renown as the quintessential German banker, using his
network of directorships and influence to play a significant role in
rebuilding the West German economy. A man whose mild appearance belied his
capacity for hard work and occasional ruthlessness, Mr Abs stood for many
years at the centre of corporate Germany.
Aged only 36, he became a member of the Deutsche Bank management board in
1938 - a position in which he stayed throughout the second world war. He
remained Deutsche Bank's honorary chairman up to his death. Not least
because of his war-time role, he ranked among the most controversial bankers
of the century - as well as one of the most outstanding.
Abs was the chairman of Deutsche Bank's management board between 1957 and
1967, and headed the supervisory board for a subsequent decade until 1976.
The influence of Deutsche Bank and the country's other big universal banks
on Germany's corporate and financial life has been modified since Abs ceased
to play an active role in Deutsche Bank's affairs. In an increasingly
integrated Europe, the banks' domination of the securities industry and
their strong corporate links now look less pronounced than in the immediate
post-war period.
Deutsche Bank none the less retains a pivotal position in the German economy
 -a tribute to the capacity of Abs and his contemporaries to rebuild the
country's big banks after the war along the lines of traditions laid down
when they were established in the 1870s.
One of Germany's post-war traditions is that Deutsche Bank has periodically
attracted praise and vilification in roughly equal measure. Abs, once termed
by David Rockefeller 'the world's leading banker', was also labelled a
'Richelieu': he was frequently exposed to criticism that he enjoyed too much
power for Germany's own good. Whatever may be said against the traditional
German system of universal banks - combining roles as lenders, traders of
securities and long-term share owners - it has achieved an accomplished
track record stretching back more than a century.
By allowing banks and industry to build up and extend long-term
relationships, the system that Abs helped restore after the war allowed West
Germany for a long time to overcome short-term economic vicissitudes with
greater success than most of its European trading partners. That system is
now being put to a crucial test as a result of the trials of German
unification.
Virtually throughout his career, Abs followed a steeply rising path. He was
born into a comfortably-off Catholic family in Bonn on October 15 1901.
After a false start on a quickly abandoned university law course, he turned
to banking. His apprenticeship took him to London, Paris, Amsterdam and the
Americas.
In 1935, at the age of 34, he became a partner in a well-known Berlin
private bank, Delbruck, Schickler &amp; Co. Within three years he joined
Deutsche Bank - at the time, a frontline institution, but not yet the
biggest in Germany.
His more senior German colleagues recognised early Abs' capacity and
judgment in international banking matters. One of his pre-war
accomplishments was to help represent Germany at negotiations to freeze the
banks' foreign debts. In view of his intelligence, sardonicism and Catholic
background, Abs was regarded with hostility by the more rabid members of the
Nazi party. He was never a party member. But throughout the war he remained
close to some of the technocrats running parts of the Nazi economy. As a
professional associate of Walter Funk, the Reichsbank president, he was a
member until 1945 of the Reichsbank's advisory council.
In spring 1945, as the war neared an end in Berlin, Abs left the German
capital bound for Hamburg in a Karstadt department store delivery lorry
crammed with Deutsche Bank files. After a short-lived appointment as an
adviser to the British military government, he was imprisoned by the
Americans for three months and was proposed in 1948 as the first head of the
Bank Deutscher Lander, the nascent federal bank and the forerunner of the
Bundesbank. He turned the job down - above all, it seems, because the US
occupation authorities had made clear they would not have him.
Abs' ambivalent war-time activities remained controversial to his death.
Unlike many Germans of his generation, Abs never claimed to have resisted
Hitler. A man who was not imprisoned or hanged or shot by the Nazis cannot
claim to have opposed Hitler, he once said. Deutsche Bank helped the Nazis
confiscate Jewish property and assets in the late 1930s and 1940s as part of
the Aryanisation laws. Abs had also been on the supervisory board of IG
Farben, the conglomerate with a stake in the chemicals company that
developed the Zyklon B gas used to kill millions of Jews in gas chambers.
After 1945, Abs helped some Jewish clients who had escaped the death camps
to recover compensation from the Bonn government. But he also had to
challenge in a German court assertions made in a 1970 book that he had
participated in forced sales and expropriation of Jewish property. The court
found none of the book's accusations valid.
In 1983, as a result of criticism of his pre-1945 activities, Abs suffered
the ignominy of being put on a US government watch-list of undesirable
aliens, and was officially barred from entering the US. However, this did
not, according to the Deutsche Bank, prevent him from making periodic US
trips.
Abs' real post-war career began in 1953 when, in a milestone marking West
Germany's reintegration into the community of nations, he negotiated the
London agreement restructuring Germany's foreign indebtedness.
In a step which freed Germany from the burden of reparations that had
blemished the survival chances of the Weimar Republic, Germany's debts were
written down and allowed to be repaid between 1953 and 1983 - an accord that
became a model for many subsequent rescheduling agreements. Abs was also
appointed head of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German reconstruction
bank that channelled assistance from the Marshall Plan to West Germany's
war-damaged economy.
Abs went on to head the southern German group of the three banks into which
the allies had split Deutsche Bank. There he engineered the reunification of
the three successors, becoming head of the reconstituted Deutsche Bank's
executive board in 1957. During this time, Abs build up his close
relationship with Konrad Adenauer, the first West German chancellor, in
office between 1949 and 1963 - a fellow Rhinelander, sharing Abs' mordant
wit and his taste for power. Abs was once asked whether the rumour was true
that the 'old man' had once asked him to become foreign minister. Abs'
oblique reply was: 'When Adenauer really wanted something, he didn't ask you
 -he told you.'
Abs' was fluent in three languages and had a working knowledge of three
more. He spoke the clipped, sometimes slightly archaic English of a country
squire - gentle in tone, acid in content. His capacity for work was
legendary. He claimed that, for weeks on end, he could work every day -
habitually at a stand-up desk - from 8am until midnight.
On top of this, he found time to collect French Impressionists and to head
committees running Beethoven's birthplace in Bonn and Goethe's in Frankfurt.
If Abs' voice was conservative, it was also that of a classic banking
paternalist. One of his recurring themes was that business must serve the
community. A much-repeated aphorism was that profits were no end in
themselves; to conduct business for profit alone would be like living only
to breathe. Society would tolerate private business only if it could prove
that profits for the enterprise created benefits for society.
That may be dismissed as German corporatism, yet Abs was no particular
friend of the German laws giving trade unions and workers' representatives a
voice in management. He thought management methods needed to change
periodically to give all employees an interest in their company.
As early as the 1950s he warned that currencies should not be kept strong
mainly by high interest rates. He tried - and failed - to use his influence
with the Bonn government in 1961 to 1969 to prevent the two 1960s D-Mark
revaluations - steps that he viewed as harmful to Germany's export-oriented
industry.
By 1970, mindful of the requirement for durable European monetary
arrangements, he was talking of the need for a European central bank.
His experience of the Third Reich explained part of Abs' caution over
expanding Deutsche Bank into foreign countries. He believed that
co-operation with foreign banks, rather than outright takeovers, marked the
most appropriate course.
As memories of war receded and a new generation took over the helm, Deutsche
Bank's policy became more adventurous.
The most dramatic international move came at the end of 1989 when Deutsche
Bank bought the UK's Morgan Grenfell for Pounds 950m, much increasing its
clout in areas such as international mergers and acquisitions. The bank
justified the move in the sort of under-stated terms much used by Abs:
Deutsche Bank could learn much about investment banking from its new London
subsidiary.
At the peak during the post-war period, Abs was a member of 24 supervisory
boards in Germany - so many that a law was passed in 1965 limiting bankers'
board appointments. The two-tier system of management and supervisory board
was and is the foundation upon which bank influence over industrial and
other concerns is based.
In the 1960s, Abs teamed up with Professor Karl Schiller, the Social
Democratic economics minister, to use his prestige and contacts to devise a
network of warranties which saved the Krupp concern from almost certain
bankruptcy. He also helped to engineer the transaction in the 1970s by which
Kuwait bought a stake in Daimler-Benz from the Flick family when it lost
interest in controlling the star performer of German industry. In the
post-Abs era even some Deutsche Bank directors have recognised that the
traditional system may be a bit too cosy, forecasting that, eventually, the
banks will run down their shareholdings in industry.
Deutsche Bank executives still, however, are thought to hold around 140
seats on supervisory boards around the country.
During his great days Abs was probably as popular as it is possible for any
banker to be. Towards the end of his life, he did not, however, hold either
politicians or the great majority of his compatriots in great regard. He
believed the exaggerated demand for social welfare in West Germany's
comfortable, consensus society was a severe hindrance to economic dynamism.
As West Germany approached the challenge of unification, Abs, in
crisply-delivered interviews at the end of the 1980s, liked to berate the
West Germans' 'inflexibility' and voice doubt about their capacity for hard
work. 'They want to work less and have more free time' was one of his
complaints.
In his latter years, as the world hummed around him, Abs plainly did not
enjoy having an inordinate amount of time on his hands. If he was faintly
disdainful of modern Germans, and sometimes appeared slightly too pleased
with himself, there was (to adapt a saying of Churchill) some excuse. He had
a considerable amount to be pleased about.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Berlusconi wields TV weapon: Coverage of party convention
infuriates opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's campaign to head Italy's
next government has provoked a long, simmering debate over the politicised
use of television.
The trigger for the debate was the blanket coverage given by Rete Quattro
(Network Four), one of Mr Berlusconi's three national commercial channels,
to the convention on Sunday of his newly formed political movement, Forza
Italia (Come On Italy]).
Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest controls more than 80 per cent of Italian
commercial television through a deal agreed by the main political parties in
the late 1980s. Ironically, until his political ambitions became fully
apparent last December, Mr Berlusconi's networks were considered freer of
political interference than the three run by the RAI state corporation.
But on Sunday, Rete Quattro cancelled its advertised programmes to broadcast
50 minutes of live coverage of Mr Berlusconi's speech - his first important
statement since announcing his entry into politics two weeks ago. This was
followed by a special programme on the Forza Italia convention lasting
almost 40 minutes. Later in the evening, a barely-edited version of the
Berlusconi speech was replayed on Rete Quattro.
Mr Berlusconi's other channels gave less coverage, but this was largely
because Mr Enrico Mentana, head of news at Network Five, has publicly
distanced himself from attempts to fill his news programmes with biased
coverage.
Supporters of Mr Berlusconi recognise the potential conflict of interest
between the terms of his television concession and his political ambitions.
However, they say that this is still outside the period of the formal
election campaign. That starts on February 25 and thereafter all political
propaganda is strictly controlled.
Indeed, Mr Berlusconi's opponents believe that one of the reasons behind his
running for office is the future of his debt-burdened Fininvest empire.
They say Mr Berlusconi fears a victory by the alliance headed by the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left in the March 27 general election
would lead to an early renegotiation of commercial television franchises to
the detriment of Fininvest.
Yesterday, the Republicans, Greens and members of Reconstructed Communism
all called for tighter government controls on the use of television air
time.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Poland's PM lets finance minister go
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland faces a shift away from tight budget policies following the
acceptance by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister, of his finance minister's
resignation.
Mr Marek Borowski, a member of the Social Democratic party (SLD), offered to
quit last week after failing to win assurances from Mr Pawlak, who heads the
Peasant party (PSL), that co-ordination of economic policy would be improved
within the two-party governing coalition.
Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, who had been urging Mr Pawlak to
keep Mr Borowski, said yesterday he was 'inclined to look for a compromise',
suggesting that he would not put the four-month-old coalition at risk over
the resignation.
Mr Borowski departs as parliamentary committees debate this year's draft
budget before a final vote later this month. The budget, which assumes a 4.2
per cent deficit in gross domestic product, has already been agreed with the
International Monetary Fund, whose approval is crucial to a decision on
reducing Poland's Dollars 30bn Paris Club debt by 20 per cent at the end of
March.
The present draft budget differs little from that planned by the previous
government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, whose election defeat last autumn paved
the way for the present coalition.
Mr Pawlak said on television last night that the draft would be modified,
but the changes would 'respect the needs of the economy', implying awareness
of the inflationary dangers of too great a change.
The shift in tone comes as opinion polls are telling the government that its
support is waning, and precedes a large street demonstration planned for
tomorrow by the Solidarity trade union in Warsaw.

West European new car sales rose by 6.3 per cent to 1.029m in January
compared with the same month in 1993, according to provisional figures from
the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, writes Kevin Done.
The increase ends 12 successive monthly declines, but the scale of recovery
remains modest since sales in January 1993 were very depressed, having
fallen 23 per cent from the previous year. Sales fell by an estimated 15.2
per cent in the whole of 1993 to 11.45m. Most industry forecasts suggest a
1-2 per cent recovery this year.

FT  08 FEB 94 / OECD calls Sweden to order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden was told bluntly yesterday it was living beyond its means and should
take tougher measures to reform its welfare policies.
The pension and benefit systems should be overhauled, labour market laws
eased, and new ways found to finance state debt, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development said in its latest report. 'Given the
limits to sound financing of welfare expenditure have already been
surpassed, the country cannot simply continue as if nothing has happened,'
the organisation stressed.
Tough action was necessary to prevent a 'rising tide of unemployment and
budget deficits' from destroying conditions for stable economic growth.
Unemployment, including people on training schemes, has risen to 13 per cent
of the workforce, while the budget deficit at 14 per cent of gross domestic
product is one of the highest among OECD members.
The organisation's report said unemployment and sickness benefit levels were
still high by international standards, and the pension system needed to be
put on a sounder financial footing. It called for measures to increase
labour market flexibility, including reforms of employment protection
legislation.
It also urged the government to signal its commitment to low inflation by
introducing index-linked debt instruments.
The OECD expects the economy to start rebounding this year from its worst
downturn since the 1930s. It forecasts GDP growth of 1.5 per cent in 1994
and 2.2 per cent in 1995, significantly less optimistic figures than
government forecasts of 2.4 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The OECD believes the export-led recovery, which became evident last year
following the sharp weakening of the krona, will continue over the next two
years. But it is not so optimistic about prospects in the domestic sector,
where it expects demand to stay weak.
Unemployment, excluding those on training schemes, is forecast to peak this
year at 8.8 per cent of the workforce before easing next year to 8.4 per
cent. 'Even with some likely recovery of business investment in response to
lower interest rates, unemployment can be expected to rise further before
beginning to fall slowly. Similarly, with revenue growth remaining subdued,
progress in reducing the huge government deficit will also be slow,' the
OECD warned.
On the positive side, it said it expected inflation to remain low and the
external balance to move into surplus.

Foreign ministers of the European Union were last night poised to give the
green light for talks on a more generous trade agreement with Ukraine to be
concluded before next month's elections there, writes Lionel Barber in
Brussels.
The proposed agreement is viewed as a tool for strengthening the hands of
moderates in the former Soviet republic as they struggle to prevent the
disintegration of the economy and the rise of nationalism.

FT  08 FEB 94 / ILO reports severe job losses in Russia

Russian industry has suffered severe job losses over the past three years
according to an International Labour Organisation report released yesterday.
Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's central and eastern European team, said
there had also been a big rise in those on unpaid leave or short time. This
year could see even more jobs cut.
Nearly a third of the enterprises surveyed last year feared they could soon
go bankrupt, under new laws soon to come into effect, mainly because of
debts owed to other enterprises.
The real level of unemployment in Russia was already some 6-7 times the
official rate of about 1.5 per cent, he added, warning that the growth of a
large marginalised minority endangered economic and social reforms.
However, the findings were dismissed by Professor Richard Layard of the
London School of Economics, who has been helping Russian economic reformers
with labour problems. He said he had had 'long conversations' with the ILO
representative compiling the figures but remained convinced unemployment
stood at 1.4 per cent.
The ILO has called for an international commission to co-ordinate assistance
to Russia on labour market and social protection issues.
The 340 enterprises surveyed in 1993 cut employment on average by 8.8 per
cent over the previous 12 months, similar to the decline shown in two
previous surveys and bringing the cumulative fall since 1991 to well over 20
per cent. Nearly 40 per cent of factories said they could meet current low
levels of output with fewer workers, almost a quarter fewer on average.
Five per cent of all workers were on unpaid leave in 1993 which, if extended
to the economy as a whole, could involve more than 2.5m workers. Short-time
working had become 'pervasive', with 10 per cent of normal hours not being
worked.
At a news conference in Geneva Mr Standing said the survey results
contradicted claims by some Russian reformers that 'shock therapy' had never
been tried because industry had not shed workers. State enterprises had
actually cut employment by more (13 per cent) than those in private hands
last year, he noted.
Russia recorded a Dollars 16bn foreign trade surplus in 1993, thanks to
increases in energy and raw material exports and a sharp fall in imports due
to a cut in the system of centralised purchases by the state, writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Finland's loser is still a winner: Hugh Carnegy assesses the
result of the presidential election run-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defeated candidate in Finland's presidential
election, discovered on Sunday that standing political convention on its
head was not, after all, as easy as the opinion polls had suggested two
weeks ago.
In the end the solid, if unspectacular, appeal of Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a
United Nations diplomat and Social Democrat, overcame the flamboyant
challenge by a margin of 53.9 per cent to 46.1. Her natural charm and easy
intelligence at one point seemed set to make Mrs Rehn, the defence minister
and a member of Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority, the country's
first woman president.
But Mrs Rehn still achieved a remarkable result which may have further
consequences for Finland's political establishment. She demonstrated that
after three years of deep recession, when the economy has shrunk by almost
15 per cent, many Finns had become so disillusioned they could be persuaded
to vote for a candidate who represented a 6 per cent ethnic minority
traditionally viewed with some suspicion by the Finnish majority.
Her emergence in the first round of voting ahead of the candidates of the
Centre and Conservative parties - the main parties in the coalition of Prime
Minister Esko Aho - stunned government and opposition parties alike.
The Social Democrats are now favourites to win the general election in March
1995, but all the main parties expect an erosion of traditionally strong
voter loyalty, making the outcome more unpredictable.
Meanwhile, Mr Ahtisaari may face an uncomfortably warm introduction to
office when he takes over, for a six-year term, from President Mauno
Koivisto on March 1. By then, Finland - along with fellow applicants
Austria, Norway and Sweden - is supposed to complete negotiations on an
accession accord with the European Union, clearing the way for a referendum
to decide the issue later this year. But the deadline could well be missed
as key questions remain unresolved.
On the Finnish side, the chief obstacle is Helsinki's demand that its
agriculture be treated as a special Nordic category under the Common
Agricultural Policy. This demand has been rejected by Brussels, which so far
has conceded only that certain areas be afforded subsidies under the Union's
regional policy structure.
'We have to have the principle of subsidies for all of Finnish agriculture
or we are in big trouble,' a senior Finnish diplomat said. Mr Ahtisaari, a
strong supporter of Finnish entry to the EU, said on Sunday he would
intervene in the negotiating process once in office 'if need be' - an
eventuality which could lead to tension with Mr Aho, whose rurally-based
Centre party is split on joining the EU and cannot afford an accession deal
which is unpopular with farmers.
Mr Aho has already firmly rejected any question of altering the government's
tight fiscal policies following Mr Ahtisaari's victory. The new president -
who has little formal role in domestic policy - says he wants to persuade
the government to adopt more interventionist policies to tackle
unemployment, running at almost 20 per cent.
But with the economy set to return to modest growth this year, Mr Aho is
anxious to curb a budget deficit of around 10 per cent of GDP. He insists
that he will stick to his strategy of tight spending limits, market reforms
and low interest rates.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Head of BNL in temporary step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro announced last night he
was stepping down temporarily following unspecified criticisms by the Bank
of Italy.
Mr Giampiero Cantoni's announcement after an evening board meeting shocked
bankers and immediately prompted speculation about the bank's transactions.
BNL, which is Italy's largest commercial bank and is controlled by the
Italian treasury, reached international notoriety in September 1989 when it
was revealed that its Atlanta, Georgia, branch had been the source of huge
unauthorised loans to Iraq. The 'Atlanta affair', which is still being
investigated, led to the replacement of BNL's then chairman, Mr Nerio Nesi,
by Mr Cantoni.
There was no suggestion last night that Mr Cantoni's move was related to the
Atlanta affair.
More recently, Italian banks have come into the spotlight in the country's
two-year-old political corruption scandal, which has led to allegations of
politically-influenced lending decisions or financial transactions on which
kickbacks were paid to political parties.
Last week, Mr Roberto Mazzotta, chairman of Milan's big Cariplo savings
bank, temporarily stepped down after being implicated in alleged financial
misdemeanours involving the bank's pension fund. Mr Mazzotta, who was in
London when magistrates issued an arrest warrant against him last week, gave
himself up to magistrates in Milan yesterday.
The developments involving Mr Cantoni appeared to be linked to judicial
inquiries into allegations of loans by the bank to members of the Cantoni
family for property dealings in the Milan area. BNL said Mr Cantoni's
decision was taken entirely 'for personal reasons' and related to
investigations into alleged infringements of land-use regulations in the
Milan suburb in which he lived.
'Such events are of a personal nature and absolutely unconnected in any way
with the bank,' said BNL.
BNL also announced Mr Cantoni had informed the bank that he intended to
terminate his contract as chairman ahead of schedule in order 'to dedicate
himself to his business and university activities'. Mr Cantoni is the
founder of a Milan-based electro-engineering group.
BNL, which has been trying to put the Atlanta affair behind it, has reported
a steady profits improvement since Mr Cantoni's arrival. However, the bank,
which is still closely identified with the now discredited Socialist party,
remains undercapitalised and has appeared increasingly isolated in the
present government's privatisation drive.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Sarajevo deaths revive debate over response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest atrocity in Sarajevo, in which 68 people were killed by a mortar
bomb in a city-centre market, has revived the long-running debate over the
appropriate response to such an outrage.
The United Nations has not yet been able to provide proof that the Bosnian
Serbs, the widely presumed perpetrators of the tragedy, were responsible and
US President Bill Clinton has pointed out that any retaliatory action should
be based on such evidence.
But if it is established that the Bosnian Serbs were responsible, it is
still a matter of disagreement what the international response should be.
With any action by UN ground troops, other than in self-defence, ruled out
in advance - not least because they are far too weak to undertake such a
task - western governments appear to be swinging in favour of air strikes
against Bosnian Serb artillery positions overlooking Sarajevo.
That would salve the consciences of western governments which have shown
themselves powerless to stop the slaughter in Bosnia by peaceful means or
verbal threats. It would also do something to restore the credibility of
Nato, which has failed so far to carry out repeated threats to strike back
at the Serbs if they did not end their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo.
Possibly, air strikes could help to bring the Bosnian Serbs to their senses
and persuade them to make a bigger effort to reach a peace settlement with
the Moslems. But that is very much an outside chance. A more likely result
would be a renewed offensive by the Serbs.
They would probably redeploy their artillery around the Bosnian capital,
retaliate against the thousands of UN peace-keeping troops in Bosnia -
mainly French, British, Canadian, Spanish and Dutch - and force their
withdrawal from Bosnia. as many politicians are already demanding.
The inevitable result would be that UN aid convoys would be deprived of
their military escorts and that their operations might have to be suspended
altogether, threatening hundreds of thousands of Bosnians with starvation
and death from cold.
A decision to launch air strikes is also likely to break the international
consensus on Bosnia, since it does not look as if it would gain Russian
support in the UN Security Council. Under great pressure from Russian
nationalists, such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, President Boris Yeltsin would
find it very difficult to endorse armed action against Russia's traditional
Slav allies, such as Bosnia's Serbs.
Air strikes, as the new US defence secretary, Mr William Perry, has pointed
out, could only be the first act. After the initial shock, it would still be
necessary to reach a political settlement, for which prospects would not
necessarily have been improved by international military intervention.

Foreign ministers of the European Union were last night poised to give the
green light for talks on a more generous trade agreement with Ukraine to be
concluded before next month's elections there.
The proposed agreement is viewed as a tool for strengthening the hands of
moderates in the republic as they struggle to prevent the disintegration of
the economy and the rise of nationalism.
During his visit to Washington last week, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign
secretary, was told by Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, that
the Clinton administration viewed political instability in nuclear-armed
Ukraine as the number one national security problem.
The proposed partnership and co-operation agreement between the EU and
Ukraine would be broadly similar to one currently under negotiation with
Russia. It suggests that the European Union is trying to pursue a less
Russo-centric and more even-handed policy toward the two most important
ex-Soviet republics.
EU officials said ministers were likely to give the European Commission the
go-ahead for a new mandate for talks aimed at reaching agreement before the
parliamentary elections on March 27.
Ukraine would like to include a commitment by the EU to review the
partnership accord in 1998, with a view to joining a future free trade zone.
It also wants more generous access for Ukrainian steel and aluminium
imports, and an easing of restrictions on visas for businessmen.
Mr Anatoly Zlenko, Ukraine's foreign minister, is due in Brussels today. He
is expected to submit Ukraine's formal application to join the Nato
alliance's Partnership for Peace, and to hold talks with the Greek
presidency on the trade accord.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of an all-out strike in Germany's vital engineering industry
loomed closer yesterday, when negotiations for a 'pilot agreement' in the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia broke down without progress.
Both sides accused each other of refusing to compromise in the talks, in
which the employers are demanding absolute cost cuts while the union is
seeking guarantees of job security in the recession-hit industry.
The national executive of IG Metall, the trade union representing 3.6m
engineering workers, will meet in Frankfurt today to decide its next move.
Calls for an all-out strike will be on the agenda.
It was clear yesterday, however, neither side wanted an outright conflict in
an industry which has seen job losses running at more than 30,000 a month
for the past year. Most observers expect urgent efforts to reach a
compromise.
The national executives of IG Metall and Gesamtmetall, the engineering
employers' federation, were waiting in the wings of yesterday's
negotiations, in the Maritim Hotel in Cologne, in the hope of a possible
national deal emerging from the talks. They had to leave empty-handed.
In the late afternoon the two sides emerged to declare: 'There is no pilot
agreement.'
'We have broken off the talks without any result,' Mr Norbert Wrobel, IG
Metall's chief negotiator in North Rhine-Westphalia, said. Both sides agreed
there was no point in continuing. 'The signs are very bad,' he added, when
asked about the danger of an all-out strike. 'Something special has to
happen to prevent it.'
Yesterday's talks went ahead as token strikes in the industry continued,
with 2,800 workers stopping work briefly at the Robert Bosch Blaupunkt plant
at Hildesheim. The stumbling block is the need to find a trade-off between
the union demand for job security, and the employers' insistence on real
cost cuts.
Yesterday's talks focused on changes in working hours, which might bridge
the gap. Employers proposed a flexible 'working-time corridor' of between 30
and 40 hours a week, with each plant free to decide its own appropriate
level - thus allowing either a reduction or an increase in working hours
from the current 36-hour week. The union said the proposal was not new,
insisting that only a deal to reduce working hours for a temporary period
would provide real job security.
The union has made it clear it is prepared to reduce its claim for a 5.5 per
cent pay rise, in exchange for job security guarantees. The employers are
seeking, in addition to more flexible working hours, a reduction in the
holiday bonus.

FT  08 FEB 94 / UK less cool to military action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government last night backed away from its previous opposition to
military action by the west to break the siege of Sarajevo.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, summoned an emergency meeting of
senior ministers for this morning, senior officials said he was committed to
immediate and 'muscular' action to end the bombardment of the Bosnian city.
But they repeated that British participation in air strikes against the Serb
forces would depend on such action setting out to secure limited tactical
objectives. The UK would also insist that western governments be guided in
their response by the advice of UN commanders in Bosnia.
Officials said Mr Major remained convinced that generalised strategic
bombing would not bring the conflict to an end and would threaten the
humanitarian aid effort in the former Yugoslav province. In the past,
Britain has also been the most forceful opponent of any action which might
prompt the Serbs to retaliate against UN ground troops.
With some 2,500 troops in Bosnia, the prime minister has faced strong
pressure from Conservative MPs not to take action which would threaten
British forces. That pressure was reinforced yesterday by warnings from
leading MPs of the risks of air strikes.
But Mr Major's officials acknowledged yesterday that the weekend massacre of
civilians in Sarajevo had created 'a new situation'. They also suggested
that the UK was now prepared to back armed efforts to demilitarise Sarajevo
and to establish UN administration in the city.
This morning's meeting of ministers had been called to endorse the new
position ahead of planned talks by Nato ministers and commanders to agree on
the precise terms of military action.

2.2 per cent this year, rising to 2.5 per cent in 1995. Private consumption
is expected to increase by 3.1 per cent this year and next, against a rise
of just 1.7 per cent in 1993. This increase will be helped by a forecast
fall in interest rates.

Norwegians are warming to membership of the European Union, according to an
opinion poll published yesterday in the tabloid daily Dagbladet, writes
Karen Fossli from Oslo.
The poll showed a three percentage point gain from January to 36 per cent in
favour of Norway's application to join the EU. Opposition fell two points to
52 per cent.
Norway is currently negotiating accession to the EU alongside Sweden,
Finland and Austria, but its electorate has voiced the fiercest resistance
of the four countries' voters to the move. However, fears about developments
in neighbouring Russia, where nationalists gained the largest vote in recent
parliamentary elections, have swelled support for EU membership, say
analysts. Those undecided about joining the Union dropped one percentage
point to 12 per cent, but overall support for EU membership is the strongest
in more than six months.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Police probe 'suspicious' death of Tory MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government last night faced the prospect of a perilous
by-election battle after the sudden death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the
Conservative MP for Eastleigh in Hampshire.
Police were investigating what they described as 'suspicious circumstances'
after 45-year-old Mr Milligan was found dead in his west London flat.
A post-mortem examination was being carried out last night. The unexplained
death follows a spate of personal scandals which have hit Mr Major's
government since the start of the year.
Mr Milligan, who entered parliament in 1992, was regarded as one of the
rising stars of the new intake of Conservative MPs. He had been appointed
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, and
could have expected a junior ministerial job later this year.
Amid visible shock among his colleagues at Westminster, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, described the news as 'dreadful' and Mr Aitken spoke of his
'profound sadness'. Early today Mr Major, in a statement from Downing
Street, expressed his distress at the death.
Other colleagues said they were stunned by what had happened, and Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, went immediately to Hammersmith
police station to be briefed.
A former journalist and broadcaster, Mr Milligan was on the centre-left of
the party and was an outspoken supporter of the prime minister. He was BBC
TV's Europe correspondent from 1988 to 1990 and before that was foreign
editor and Washington correspondent of The Sunday Times.
Mr Milligan's death leaves the government facing an awkward test of its
popularity in one of the areas in which it is most vulnerable to an upsurge
in support for the Liberal Democrats.
He won Eastleigh with a majority of 17,702 over the Liberal Democrats. But a
government majority of more than 22,000 was overturned last autumn by the
Liberal Democrats in the nearby constituency of Christchurch. The
expectation at Westminster last night was that the by-election would be
postponed to coincide with the local elections on May 5.
Mr David Willetts, Tory MP for Havant and a friend of Mr Milligan, said: 'He
was one of the best of the 1992 intake of MPs. It is a great personal loss.'
Mr Andrew Mackay, a Conservative whip, added: 'He was a very able and
popular MP who had a great future.'
Mr Milligan was the third MP to die in recent weeks. The others were Labour
MPs Mr James Boyce and Ms Jo Richardson.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Maxwell show banned as court fears 'prejudice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday banned Maxwell: The Musical, the West End revue
about the life of the late Robert Maxwell.
Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, was granted an injunction
preventing the show opening.
A judge said there was a 'substantial risk of serious prejudice' upon the
trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, and four others charged
with fraud over the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
The move - for which there is no legal precedent - came just four days
before the first public preview of the musical due to be staged at London's
Criterion theatre.
The show's producer Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Mr
Maxwell's private companies, said afterwards: 'Obviously I am bitterly
disappointed, but the law is the law and sadly the show must not go on.'
Although Mr Steadman could appeal against the injunction, he admitted last
night that this was unlikely.
The musical, which tells the story of the late tycoon through adapted
Gilbert and Sullivan songs, had been scheduled to run for 13 weeks in London
with a transfer to the US planned.
The injunction will cost Mr Steadman, the sole backer of the show, about
Pounds 1.1m. All 3,700 people who have bought tickets would have their money
refunded, he said.
The late publisher is named as a co-conspirator in six of the 10 fraud
charges variously brought against those due to stand trial.
Under the terms of the injunction, the musical could go ahead after all
criminal proceedings have ended. However, this could be 18 months away, and
Mr Steadman was yesterday unsure whether the show could be revived then.
Pointing at posters for a show that would 'make you laugh, sing - and
angry', Mr Steadman said: 'Well troops, the simple answer is - oh no, it
won't'
The Society of London Theatres said: 'Anything that has an effect upon what
is already a pretty frail industry has to be bad news.'

FT  08 FEB 94 / Air attack threat against Serbs grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of air strikes against Serb forces encircling Sarajevo moved
closer to reality last night after the European Union called for an
immediate lifting of the siege of the Bosnian capital.
EU foreign ministers agreed that a decision could be taken at a meeting of
the Nato council as early as tomorrow.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Saturday's mortar attack on
Sarajevo's outdoor market, in which 68 people died, marked a turning point.
'This brings us near a decision in one way or another to use force."
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said his government was losing
patience. 'If there is no agreement in Nato, then France will not live with
the status quo.' President Bill Clinton said the US would back air strikes
if it were demonstrated beyond all doubt that the Serbs were responsible for
the attack.
Mr Clinton welcomed the request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, that it prepare for the use of air power to relieve the
siege of Sarajevo and to protect peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.
But Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, again said all options
were under review. Air strikes might or might not help bring the parties to
a settlement; if the latter, 'we ought to reject them categorically'.
Mr Juppe noted that the US attitude was crucial, saying: 'The European Union
cannot act alone. That is not enough.' The Nato session this week will
consider a French plan to issue an ultimatum to the Serbian forces ringing
Sarajevo to withdraw at least 30km and hand over all their heavy arms to UN
troops, or face air strikes.
Other options, however, are being reviewed based on UN commanders'
assessment of the risks of Serb retaliation against the UN peacekeepers and
the danger of a halt to humanitarian aid.
A Nato decision in favour of force would require unanimity, overcoming
earlier reservations expressed primarily by the UK and Canada.
The UN Security Council has already passed resolutions which could enable
air strikes to go ahead. However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign
minister, yesterday raised the prospect that Russia might block any further
Security Council decision.
The EU declaration yesterday called for 'the immediate lifting of the siege
of Sarajevo, using all the means necessary including the use of air power'.

banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hermann Josef Abs (left), who during his postwar heyday as head of the
Deutsche Bank stood at the centre of corporate Germany, died at the weekend
aged 92. He won renown as the quintessential German banker, using his
network of directorships and influence to play a significant role in
rebuilding the West German economy, but attracted controversy, not least
because of his wartime role.

FT  08 FEB 94 / US shares bounce back after Europe and Far East stumble:
Rate rise aftershock felt around world - Fears of steeper falls unfounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US share prices rebounded yesterday after Friday's big declines but stock
markets in Europe and the Far East stumbled as the aftershock of the rise in
short-term US interest rates reverberated around the world.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 34.90 up at 3,906.32.
The big European markets, however, suffered sizeable losses as investors
caught up with the 96-point decline in the Dow Jones average on Friday, much
of which occurred after European markets had closed.
In London yesterday, the FT-SE 100 fell 56.3 points to 3,419.1, a drop of
1.6 per cent, although it had been down by 93.4 points at one stage. The
broader FT-SE 350 index fell 28.8 points to 1,731.7. In Frankfurt, the Dax
fell 58.85 points, or 2.75 per cent, to 2,079.4. In Paris, the CAC Index
dropped 42.11 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 2,287.06.
Asian stock markets suffered worst, with Hong Kong dropping 6.1 per cent and
Thailand 6.9 per cent.
Fears of a substantial setback proved unfounded, though, with European
equity markets rallying in the afternoon after a calm opening on Wall
Street.
The mood in the markets indicated that Friday's drop in New York and
yesterday's falls elsewhere were a one-off correction. For now, attention is
likely to focus on the more vulnerable Far Eastern markets, although in
early trading today the Nikkei average was up 325 points to 20,340 following
Wall Street's rise and on hopes of a coalition tax reform agreement.
Singapore stocks were also stronger.
International markets were clearly jittery at the opening yesterday, but
traders said there was little sign of panic.
The timing of the Federal Reserve's move was a surprise, but a rise in US
interest rates had been expected and does not necessarily presage a similar
rise in Europe.
Analysts said there was still scope for European rates to fall, given low
inflation and the relatively depressed economies.
However, analysts pointed to a number of issues that might yet disturb the
markets: the Fed might increase rates farther and faster than anticipated;
US private investors might redeem some substantial holdings in mutual funds,
causing managers to sell equities; or the Bundesbank might decide not to cut
German interest rates, to stop the D-Mark from weakening against the dollar.
Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy,
said the latest changes marked an end to the 'emerging markets bubble'.
He said markets such as Hong Kong, which had been buoyed by speculative
flows from US investors, might suffer particularly.
In the US, financial markets were restored to relative calm yesterday.
Although share prices fluctuated erratically at the start of trading, it was
not long before buyers had returned to the market.
By early afternoon a series of computerised buy programs pushed stocks,
especially those of big companies such as IBM, General Motors and Walt
Disney, firmly higher.
The US Treasury market was relatively quiet, although continued selling of
long-term government securities, some of it linked to this week's auction of
Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.4bn) in new bonds, pushed the benchmark 30-year issue
down less than half a point.
In Europe, government bonds traded lower, with gilts down about  3/4 of a
point.
On the foreign exchange markets, the US dollar rose against the D-Mark in
early trading, but by late afternoon in New York it was little changed at
DM1.7587. The US currency weakened slightly against the yen.

FT  08 FEB 94 / Stock markets slide but fears of steeper fall are unfounded:
European exchanges stem declines - Far eastern bourses hardest hit

International stock markets stumbled yesterday as the aftershock of Friday's
rise in short-term US interest rates reverberated around the world.
In London, the FT-SE 100 fell by 93.4 points to 3,382.0 by midday before
eventually closing down 56.3 points at 3,419.1, a drop of 1.6 per cent on
the day. The broader FT-SE 350 index fell 28.8 points to 1,731.7.
Asian stock markets were the worst hit, with Hong Kong dropping 6.1 per cent
and Thailand falling 6.9 per cent.
But fears of a substantial setback proved unfounded, with European equity
markets rallying in the afternoon after a calm opening on Wall Street.
The mood in the markets indicated that yesterday's falls were a one-off
correction. Attention will now focus in the short term on far eastern
markets, with the Hong Kong market falling a further 3 per cent in
indicative trading in London yesterday.
The markets were clearly jittery but traders said there was little sign of
panic. Much of the fall represented a catch-up with the 96 point decline in
the Dow Jones Average on Friday, a large part of which occurred after
European markets had closed.
The timing of the Federal Reserve's move was a surprise, but a rise in US
interest rates had been expected and does not necessarily presage a similar
rise in Europe.
Analysts said there was still scope for European rates to fall, given low
inflation and the relatively depressed European economies. In Frankfurt, the
Dax fell 58.85 points, or 2.75 per cent, to 2,079.4. In Paris, the CAC Index
dropped 42.11 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 2,287.06.
However, analysts pointed to a number of issues which could yet disturb the
markets: the Federal Reserve might increase rates farther and faster than

holdings in mutual funds, causing managers to sell equities; or the
Bundesbank might decide not to cut German interest rates, in order to stop

Mr Michael Hughes, managing director, BZW Global Economics and Strategy,
said that the latest changes marked an end to the 'emerging markets bubble'.
He said that markets such as Hong Kong, which had been buoyed by speculative
flows from US investors, might suffer particularly.
US financial markets were restored to relative calm yesterday after Friday's
big losses. Although share prices fluctuated erratically after the opening
bell, by noon the stock market had settled down with dealers reporting
plenty of buying and selling activity but no clear direction.
Later, a series of computerised buy programs pushed stocks, especially those
of big companies such as IBM and Walt Disney firmly higher. By 1pm the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was up 22.23 at 3,893.65.
The US Treasury market was also relatively quiet yesterday morning, although
continued selling of long-term government securities, some of it linked to
this week's auction of Dollars 11bn in new bonds, pushed the benchmark
30-year issue down about half a point, to where it yielded 6.387 per cent.
In Europe, government bonds traded lower, with gilts down around  3/4 of a
point.
In London, the US dollar traded slightly higher against the D-Mark at
DM1.7630 and slightly weaker against the yen at Y108.7050.
Analysts said the Fed interest rate move had been positive for the dollar
but was insufficient to move the US currency any higher until the Bundesbank
indicates the likely direction of German interest rates.

<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, the government-backed peace commissioner in the Mexican
state of Chiapas, is set to meet rebel guerrilla leaders in the middle of
this week, according to officials involved in the peace process.
The planned meeting would be the first between armed guerrillas, who seized
several towns on New Year's Day, and Mr Camacho. The two sides are likely to
meet privately, although they may put out a joint communique after the first
encounter, according to the officials.
The guerrillas appear to have reached a compromise with Mr Camacho, whereby
the peace commissioner will listen to their demands for national political
changes, but will not make any concessions on such issues. Instead, direct
negotiations are likely to focus on the political and social conditions in
the state of Chiapas.
Mexico's governing party recently reached broad agreement on democratic
reform with the opposition, which Mr Camacho hopes will satisfy rebel
demands for political change in Mexico. The guerrillas, known as the
Zapatista Army of National Liberation, have nevertheless continued attacks
on what they view as Mexico's authoritarian political system.
In his first interview since the uprising, Commander Marcos, the spokesman
for the Zapatista, declared the rebel revolt a 'spectacular victory'. The
government is now paying attention to the country's indigenous peoples,
no-one is now talking about the success of the Mexican economy, and the
issue of poverty has emerged, he said.
Mr Marcos, who is of mixed descent, formally reports to a committee of six
indigenous leaders. But it is evident he is the principal political and
military strategist of the group. In the interview, extracts of which were
published in La Jornada newspaper, he comes across as highly educated,
self-confident, humorous, and undogmatic.
Mr Marcos made it clear the aim of the Zapatista had been to mobilise
society against government policy, rather than win a military victory. 'We
see the armed struggle not in the classic sense of guerrillas before, that
is to say, the armed struggle is the only way. . . Instead, we have always
seen the armed struggle from the beginning as part of a series of steps and
forms of fighting.'
The rebel commander leaves no doubt that his fight is a national one, even
if he accepts that the government will not directly negotiate such issues
with an armed force. 'The peasants are very clear; it is a lie to think that
our problems can be solved at a state level' he says 'This can only be
solved if there are changes higher up.'

<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and his Christian Democratic Union
yesterday stepped up accusations against the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD), suggesting they had undermined the process of German unification with
secret promises to the former East German government.
The latest SPD leader to be accused is Mr Rudolf Scharping, the party's
challenger for the chancellor's post and current state premier in the
Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state.
The Welt am Sonntag newspaper yesterday published documents from the former
East German Communist party, claiming that Mr Scharping had agreed to
recognise East German citizenship on a trip to the country in 1987.
West Germany always insisted that East Germans enjoyed automatic West German
citizenship, a key factor in allowing Hungary to open its borders in 1989,
and precipitate the exodus which ultimately destroyed the East German
regime.

<TEXT>
US aircraft yesterday ferried medical staff into Sarajevo and evacuated
civilians injured in the city's worst massacre since fighting started there
22 months ago, agencies report from Sarajevo.
The death toll from Saturday's mortar bomb attack in the Bosnian capital
rose to 68 as some of the more critically wounded died.
As United Nations armoured vehicles collected patients from city hospitals,
the UN refugee agency said well over 50 injured were expected to leave,
including some hurt in earlier incidents.
In Germany, meanwhile, preparations were made at a US military hospital to
receive nearly 100 wounded from Sarajevo - 50 in a US Air Force transport
aircraft and 48 on board a Red Cross aircraft.
A US medical team flew in to Sarajevo on a Hercules transport aircraft
earlier yesterday to assist local doctors in preparing for the evacuation.
The Bosnian government declared a day of mourning, while families laid
flowers at the market place in memory of the dead. Most of the damage had
been cleared but blood still lay in some shrapnel holes.
Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kreselvjakovic said: 'This was the worst day of death
in this city for 500 years.'
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, appealed to world leaders to help
save Moslems from 'slow-motion genocide'. He blamed Serb gunners for the
attack, in which about 200 were wounded.
The Bosnian Serbs, denying responsibility for attacks on Friday and
Saturday, have accused the Moslems of massacring their own people to scupper
peace talks.
The UN said experts, analysing the market crater, had been unable to
determine who fired the single 120mm mortar bomb.
Peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg were last night due to
meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. The Bosnian Moslems said they
would still attend peace talks in Geneva on February 10.
Lord Owen said on his arrival in Belgrade yesterday that he wanted to get an
agreement to put Sarajevo under UN control even if he could not achieve an
overall settlement to the war in Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic had indicated that the Serbs had been ready to 'discuss a
demilitarisation of Sarajevo under UN administration', Lord Owen said.
'What we are really trying to do is get a settlement in Sarajevo even if we
can't get an overall settlement,' Lord Owen added.
Earlier, Lord Owen said he had a 'glint' of optimism that Sarajevo could be
put under UN control as a result of the mortar attack.

The leaders of Poland's coalition partners are expected to meet today to try
to resolve the fighting between the two parties over economic policy which
culminated last week in the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, deputy premier
and finance minister.
At the weekend Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the Social Democratic movement
(SLD) leader, said he would continue to urge Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime
minister and Peasant party leader, not to accept the resignation of Mr
Borowski, an SLD member.
He was speaking after an SLD leadership meeting which saw no alternative to
the present SLD-PSL coalition.
Mr Borowski resigned on Friday after failing to win assurances from Mr
Pawlak that economic policy and personnel decisions would be agreed between
the coalition partners.
Also the weekend, the Finance Ministry said it would reduce the scale of
electricity and gas price increases planned for this month.

Thursday. Analysts are forecasting a surplus of around SKr3bn (Dollars
380m), compared with SKr1.3bn in 1992. The advance has been driven by
massive growth in orders for digital cellular equipment. Investors cooled to
the shares after the third quarter and will be looking for an upbeat
statement about prospects in 1994.
Also in Sweden, Stora, Europe's leading forestry group, will present

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (32): Figuring out the
differences - Accounting and reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the countries in all the world, very few offer investors a consistent
or comparable set of accounting standards to help them interpret financial
performance.
The pitfalls in attempting to interpret different sets of accounts and
negotiating through the widely varying tax structures pose considerable
challenges.
Many emerging markets have less formalised accounting standards, varying
degrees of disclosure and different underlying philosophies which affect the
figures.
A number of commentators divide the world between tax-driven accounts and
accounts more geared to investors. The former may often have the incentive
to keep published profits low, the latter to boost them.
For countries in the former category, the published accounts are those that
are submitted to the revenue authorities. Countries often have relatively
hidebound, fixed formats governed by legislation or 'charts of accounts'.
The latter category includes the UK and the US, where tax returns are
separate - and even contradictory - and accounts are geared primarily
towards investors.
Mr John Tetley, a member of the consultative group of the International
Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc), who has particular knowledge of
French and Portuguese-speaking Africa and South America, says the
differences between countries can 'cause quite a lot of trouble'.
'If you are thinking of investing in family-owned local businesses, you have
very little idea what the accounts mean,' he says. 'They report what they
want to.'
He argues that many have relatively few accountants or bookkeepers, let
alone consistent standards which they can apply. Policies vary on the
revaluation of assets, on depreciation and the treatment of foreign
currency.
In particular, he highlights the role of indexation in high inflation
countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, which can make comparisons
confusing. 'You are never quite sure what you are looking at,' he says.
A survey conducted last year by the Centre for International Financial
Reporting and Analysis (Cifar)* pointed out a number of difficulties in
interpreting international financial statements.
The information on companies in emerging markets is limited and often filed
long after the year-end. Many subsidiaries conduct transactions with parent
companies, adding to the awkwardness of extracting relevant, timely data.
English translations of annual reports and other financial information are
often unavailable or unreliable. Converting figures expressed in local
currencies may prove problematic. Varying year-ends makes comparison
difficult and auditing standards vary.
That is before accounting standards. Cifar cites eight particular issues
treated in vastly divergent ways across the globe: depreciation, inventory
methods, deferred taxes, consolidation principles, discretionary reserves,
inflation adjustments, foreign currency translation, and the valuation of
fixed income and equity securities.
Some see signs of optimism for the future from the work of the Iasc, which
has been attempting over many years to establish a set of standards
transcending national differences.
Some countries have adopted Iasc standards wholesale, or developed their own
versions based on the same international approach. For example, the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange last year issued new rules requiring foreign
incorporated companies to present reports in line with Iasc standards. They
have been incorporated into requirements in Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Malaysia,
Kenya and India.
The Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Intergovernmental Working
Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting have
used Iasc standards.
However, Iasc standards have been criticised for the political compromises
necessary to build consensus between different countries' standards. The
result has been a wide range of alternative treatments which did little to
improve ease of interpretation for readers of accounts.
That has now begun to change significantly, with the organisation's
'comparability/improvements' project designed to bring about greater
harmonisation.
The motivation has been partly to gain recognition for Iasc standards from
the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), which
would allow far wider recognition of the standards in different national
stock exchanges.
The strategy has begun to pay off, with Iosco now endorsing the Iasc cash
flow statement standard, for example. But more wholesale ratification is
likely to be a long way off.
To add to the confusion, some of the national accounting standards setters
are also beginning to become more interested in international collaboration,
in a way that may threaten the Iasc's traditional role.
Standards setters from the UK, US, Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere
have in the past two years begun discussing sharing the workload for
research and standards drafting on a number of topics.
There are still wider concerns that Iasc and other national standards were
devised in the developed world and may be far less appropriate without
substantial modification in many of the emerging markets regions.
Meanwhile, investors need to bear in mind tax issues within emerging
markets. Mr Peter Dickinson, international tax partner with Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in London, says one of the key tax questions in emerging markets is
'how to get one's money out'.
'You need to understand the exchange control regulations,' he says. 'A lot
of countries have very tight controls, such as South Africa and India.' In
addition, he says there may be specific stipulations on how money is held
through the banks.
Within countries, there are often federal, regional, state or city taxes to
be considered. Then there is the small print in the double taxation treaties
agreed between the investor's country and the country for investment, which
may impinge on returns.
'There is a much higher degree of risk in emerging markets,' says Mr
Dickinson. 'Investors should think long and hard at their potential
after-tax returns.' He says the most important factor for investors tends to
be withholding taxes on dividends paid outside the country.
In addition, the position is far from static. 'The rules keep changing,' he
says. 'In some countries like China the rules on how much tax to pay move
from one month to the next.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (31): Foreign investors take
stock - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the rise and rise of the world's emerging markets foreign investors
have naturally been showing keen interest in privatisation issues.
In Singapore last October, for instance, the government's flotation of a 10
per cent stake in the telecommunications utility was some 10 times
subscribed and the stock exchange extended its hours on the first day of
trading to cope with the demand. Offered at SDollars 2.00 the shares
initially rose to SDollars 5.00 and now trade at around SDollars 3.60,
making it by far the largest company in terms of market capitalisation.
Nearby, in Bangkok, TelecomAsia also became the largest capitalised company
on Thailand's stock exchange when its shares were publicly traded for the
first time in December, the shares closing the first session more than
double the Bt55 (Dollars 2.15) offer price. The shares are now trading
around the Bt130 level.
While there was considerable domestic interest in these two issues, demand
was really fuelled by overseas investors, looking for opportunities in what
became a spectacular rally from the third quarter onwards for emerging
markets in general.
Kleiman International Consultants, a US-based consultancy which monitors
emerging markets, reported earlier this month that OECD data found portfolio
investment from the west and Japan 'climbed by half in 1992 (the last time
data was available) to Dollars 94bn, outstripping official finance of
Dollars 60bn for the first time'.
The main reason for this was due to the extent of liberalisation and
privatisation in the emerging economies: Kleiman notes that globally Dollars
70bn was transferred from state to private hands in 1993, with Latin America
making up 30 per cent of that figure.
It was not, however, a coincidence that telecommunications has been among
the first sectors to take off, since it is an area to which emerging
economies have been giving priority for growth. Among the regions Latin
America has been leading the way: according to Baring Securities, market
growth in this sector for the period 1990-1995 is estimated at 12 per cent,
just exceeding the 11 per cent forecast for south-east Asia.
By comparison the same source estimates something like 4 per cent growth in
Europe and 2 per cent in north America.
Taken in context Latin America's lead is not so surprising, since over the
past few years the authorities in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela
have sold majority shares in the national telephone utilities. Meanwhile,
foreign investors are awaiting opportunities elsewhere, particularly in
Brazil where Telebras, the state-owned group, is seen as a sell-off
candidate.
However, the privatisation process in Brazil ran into difficulties at the
end of last year when the government was forced to cancel the auction of
Petroquimica Uniao, a petrochemical company. This embarrassing situation -
the first time an auction had been cancelled in the country since 1991 -
arose after it was revealed that less than 7 per cent of the shares on offer
had been bought. The auction was finally completed on January 27.
This contrasts with the sale of the Argentine government's 45 per cent stake
in June 1993 of oil and gas group YPF, which has claims to being the oldest
state oil company in the world. This was the second and by far the largest
of the state's privatisations of its main energy groups, raising some
Dollars 3bn, including an international tranche of some Dollars 2.3bn. The
country's first sale was of federal gas and electricity companies in 1992
and the last the sale of Hidronor, the hydroelectricity generator which
raised Dollars 1.1bn.
YPF was heavily subscribed by the foreign community, being a high quality
stock which is also traded in New York. Access is also helped by Argentina's
deregulated market environment with no restrictions placed on access or
repatriation of funds, and the fact that unlike many of the region's
economies it has a stable currency which is pegged to the dollar.
The oil group, now the most active issue in Buenos Aires with a market
capitalisation of around Dollars 8.5bn, saw its shares rise steadily in the
first weeks of trading, before settling down to the Dollars 25 level,
one-third above the flotation price. Because of its listing in New York,
most of the trade is now of the arbitrage kind - one estimate has put the
amount at some Dollars 80m a day.
With investors constantly searching for new investment opportunities eastern
and central European countries have become popular, with many of that
region's markets showing strong gains during 1993. In Poland, for example,
the equity market, comprising just 22 shares, soared last year,
demonstrating gains of some 700 per cent in dollar terms; and such
enthusiasm has spilled over into Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Privatisation is the key word to the region's performance. In Poland the
government has pledged that it will give this area top priority, with
between 20-30 'National Investment Funds', run by foreign and domestic
investment managers, being set up to control the first round of
privatisation.
Last year the sale of a 30 per cent stake in Bank Slaski, one of the nine
state-owned banks being sold through the government's privatisation of
banks, was greatly over-subscribed, and the shares started trading at 13.5
times the 500,000 zloty (Dollars 23) offer price.
Research, often one important difficulty with emerging markets, is improving
with brokers such as Smith New Court, IMI Securities and Creditanstalt, the
Austrian bank, active in Poland.
The Czech Republic has also excited interest among foreign investors as its
voucher privatisation scheme takes off, with shares in more than 1,300
companies being distributed between 8m voucher holders. A second round of
privatisation, involving more than 700 companies worth nearly Dollars 5bn,
is also under way. Most of the vouchers have been deposited with investment
funds.
Capitalising on interest in this region, Kleinwort Benson has just launched
the European Privatisation Investment Trust, which raised some Pounds 320m
in the pre-placement phase - the public offer closes on February 2 - some
eight times the amount anticipated. Up to 20 per cent of the fund will be
invested in eastern and central Europe.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (28): Calculated risks for higher
rewards - Performance measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not difficult to see why emerging market investments have caught on:
the best performing emerging market funds last year made returns of more
than 100 per cent, while the top 20 funds over the past three years have all
returned more than 200 per cent, according to Micropal, which tracks funds'
performance. Meanwhile, interest rates in developed countries are
approaching their cyclical lows, and although economic growth is starting to
pick up in some western countries, it is expected to remain slow.
Investors are becoming increasingly willing to venture further afield to
enhance their returns. But the rewards offered by emerging market
investments are, inevitably, accompanied by greater risks, and the
first-time investor may find it difficult not only to select a market but
also to track performance.
Emerging markets are both less liquid and more volatile than investments in
established stock and bond markets. They are also less transparent, and
often subject to restricted access for foreign investors.
Even for the institutional fund manager, investments in emerging markets are
a complicated affair. While a fund manager in the UK stock or bond market
can, if he so desires, replicate the FT-SE index or a gilts index, and then
try to outperform them, indices on emerging markets are more complex.
Among existing bond indices, JP Morgan's liquid Brady bond index and Latin
American Eurobond index are widely followed. But these, and other bond
indices, include only a relatively small portion of the potential universe
of investments.
In one sense, this has favoured the performance of bond fund managers,
because it has made it relatively easy to outperform such indices. This is
because the indices tend to cover the most liquid, least volatile, and
therefore lower risk bonds. However, investors need to be aware of the risks
involved in investments in markets where, for example, there may be a high
level of political instability.
'No index is perfect,' says Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed income at Latin
American Securities, the emerging markets division of Foreign and Colonial.
'The problem is that the markets change so quickly, and have enormous access
and liquidity constraints. You can't have an index that reflects all that.'
For example, he points out that many Latin American bond indices are heavily
weighted towards Mexican bonds, and may not include more esoteric paper such
as that of Peru. Latin American Securities adopts a three-pronged approach,
to achieve a balanced measurement of its performance.
First, managers do not use a single index, but look at a number of
benchmarks. Second, they look at their 'peer group' - that is, similar funds
with which they are competing. Third, they try to set targets in terms of
the type of risks, return on investment, volatility, and so on. 'We are not
just selling returns, we want to sell a good risk/return investment,' he
says. 'Some people don't necessarily want the highest returns, but are keen
to have controlled volatility.'
Agreeing the parameters of investment in emerging markets is therefore a
vital part of the fund manager's service to a client. 'It's a difficult
thing for a fund manager and an end-investor to get to grips with,' agrees
one London-based emerging markets salesman. 'What risk is the fund manager
allowed to take? The eurobond and Brady bond indices are just a guide stick.
You have to decide whether the fund manager will be able to throw in Algeria
and the Ivory Coast.'
He points out that the prospectus for a specific fund always sets out in
detail what the constraints on investment are.
But, for both bond and equity markets, the problem is not merely one of
selection but also of access. Many markets, particularly equity markets
which tend to be more politically sensitive, are partially or largely closed
to foreign investors.
'In many emerging markets, much of the market capitalisation is not
available to a foreign investor,' says Mr Bruce Johnson, head of global
research at Baring Securities, whose emerging equity market indices are
among the most widely followed.
In setting up its index, Baring tried to take account not only of market
size and volume, but also of whether stocks are 'investable' or available.
Many markets have a series of legal restrictions - on the total amount a
single investor may hold in any one company, the total amount foreigners can
hold in any one company, and the total amount all foreigners can own in the
market overall.
There can also be tax and other difficulties, for example forcing investors
to hold stocks for as long as three years, or treating capital gains
inconsistently. Other issues include the convertibility of the domestic
currency, and the fact that some foreign-held stocks trade at a premium.
Mr Johnson points out that although stocks may be legally available, there
may be practical restrictions on their availability due to illiquidity.
There are some ways round restrictions and illiquidity problems, such as
buying American depositary receipts (ADRs).
However, there is a danger of a mis-match between ADRs and the domestic
market. Other methods of circumventing regulations include buying country
funds or using swaps, or bonds with embedded options.
The Baring index places some importance on the ease of replicating the
index. To this end, the market turnover has to be at least Dollars 2bn a
year. Pakistan, for example, is a borderline case.
Other leading equity indices, such as those compiled by Morgan Stanley,
place greater emphasis on economic criteria.
The smallest market included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International
Index is Sri Lanka, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 2.5bn.
'Our indices are broadly based,' explains Mr Mark Sladkus, who publishes the
index. 'We are trying to provide a benchmark. Some investors do try to buy
every stock, but they will have problems.'
For investors keen to venture into the emerging markets, there are no simple
choices.
Individual country funds have been a popular choice, and have often
performed well, but are risky if they do not form part of a more diversified
portfolio.
Generally, it is safer to try to find an investment vehicle which gives
exposure across a range of emerging markets, taking the view that, while
individual market moves will be hard to call, in the longer term, the
developing economies are likely to offer falling yields on bond investments
and strong equity markets fuelled by economic growth.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (30): A new asset class created -
Debt trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Out of the disaster of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, a number
of big international banks have created a booming business in issuing and
trading emerging markets debt.
The skills learned have been transferred to the Far Eastern markets, and now
some of the banks hope that the same pattern can be repeated in eastern
Europe.
From the rubble of the sovereign lending boom that originated in the
petrodollar recycling bubble of the 1970s, the international banks have
ingeniously created a new class of high-yielding international debt
instruments. They may be of uncertain creditworthiness in the long run, but
they are immediately attractive to income-starved investors.
'We are at the forefront of recognising that emerging markets are global,'
says Mr Jorge Jasson, senior vice-president in charge of the emerging
markets group at Chase Investment Bank, in New York. 'We have dedicated our
resources to the asset class.'
Chase is by no means alone. Big US banks such as Citicorp and JP Morgan,
which sweated for years over their Latin American exposures, are now cashing
in. Elsewhere, one of the few European banks to have persevered in Latin
America during the bad times is the Dutch-based ING; and it is now seeking
to make its experience count in Europe, where it has, for instance, just
bought a stake in Bank Slaski, in Poland.
'ING expanded in Latin America while other international banks were
retreating,' says Mr Jacques Kemp, chairman of its international division.
'Now we are doing the same in eastern Europe.'
He adds: 'There is a global transformation as multinationals transfer to
emerging countries. For the next five years there will be more growth in the
non-OECD economies, especially in comparison with western Europe. The next
generation will talk about the problems of the First World rather than the
Third World.'
The trading of emerging markets debt has now become an important activity,
based principally in New York and London. There are indications that trading
teams are also being established in Hong Kong to develop the Far East
market.
An Emerging Markets Traders Association has been established, to provide a
self-regulatory framework in which common standards can be developed.
And, to complement the 15 or 20 international banks which handle most of the
trading, a network of inter-dealer brokers has sprung up to improve the flow
of information. Brokers are in the process of installing live screens, a
reflection of the fact that emerging markets debt is no longer a
thinly-traded fringe market but now operates on a comparable basis to the
mainstream securities markets such as First World government paper.
One of the leading brokers, Mr Martin Quintin-Archard, says that the
development of the legal documentation by the market has been a significant
advance. 'You can assign a loan without a thought,' he remarks.
Mr Quintin-Archard, who is managing director of debt trading at
Intercapital, in London, says that the Latin American crisis was of
fundamental importance, in that it taught the banks to trade loans. 'If
there is another crisis like this elsewhere, you already have the
blueprint,' he says.
Bank regulators may regard this with misgivings: the reported readiness of
certain banks to trade distressed debt in cases such as Euro Disney may
hamper crisis management. Yet the banks are making considerable fortunes out
of Latin America. One result, however, is that there is a serious shortage
of skilled traders. 'There's tremendous movement in the market,' says Mr
Quintin-Archard. 'Entire teams are being lifted.'
The big boom came last year. Although the climate had been rapidly improving
since 1990, and many Latin American governments and corporate borrowers
regained access to the international markets in 1991, it was in 1993 that
the big payoff was seen in emerging market debt.
A cascade of money (mainly from US institutions) arrived, seeking high
returns in the face of slumping yields on US Treasuries and similar
top-grade paper.
The inflows generated their own lucrative price spirals, and the average
return on Brady bonds, for instance, was around 44 per cent. The action more
recently has been shifting to still more speculative debt, in anticipation,
for instance, of Brady-type restructurings yet to come.
Mr Jacques Kemp, of ING, comments that a lot of bank provisions are being
written back; and, in fact, Latin America's overall credit record in the
past 10 years has been quite good, certainly in comparison with the
extensive bad debts which banks suffered in the developed countries between
1989 and 1992.
But are investors losing sight of the credit risks? The collapse of Banco
Latino, Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank, a few weeks ago provided
a reminder of the problems.
The Latino failure was a one-off, insists Mr Jasson. But he agrees that a
lot of paper is coming to the market without a credit rating, and without
consistent quality. 'There is an over-enthusiasm to bring to market issues
that don't meet international standards,' he says. 'You should be very
selective.'
Mr Kemp is also wary about the extent of the securitisation of the debts,
which raises questions about who exactly will be holding the paper when
future defaults occur. 'We are concerned that there will be an
over-extension of credit in the next few years,' he says. 'But most of the
issues are in the private sector, which has a much better record than the
public sector. The markets have been steering clear of major issues for the
governments.'
Now the game moves on. Once international emerging market debt - much
better-sounding than junk bonds - has been established as an asset class,
there is enormous scope to supply an ever-broader range of product. 'There
is rapidly increasing interest from global investors who have a greater need
to diversify their holdings,' says Mr Jasson.
Mr Kemp has his eyes on the potential of eastern Europe: his bank has 2,000
staff there, and it hopes to open a branch in Moscow later this year.
'Latinos are now investing in east European debt, because they feel there
are some common trends,' he says. A rise in status can be very profitable
for investors, as Latin America has shown. 'East Europe will have to start
at spreads of 300-400 basis points, but they will fall,' Mr Kemp predicts.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (29): Investors spoilt for choice
 -Specialist funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investor who decides to back his or her favourite emerging market is
spoilt for choice. According to Micropal's emerging markets monitor, there
were nearly 500 emerging markets equities funds at the start of 1994.
Twenty-one funds were devoted to Indonesia alone.
These funds are often based in 'offshore' centres such as Luxembourg or the
Cayman Islands to maximise their tax efficiency. The majority are
denominated in US dollars, although some are in sterling and some in the
local currency.
Emerging markets funds fall into three obvious categories: the global, the
regional and the single country. The former have been both extremely popular
and successful; they have a number of attractive arguments on their side.
The first is that there are simply so many emerging markets that it is
difficult for individuals, or even institutions, to keep track of them all.
It makes more sense to sub-contract the task to a specialist manager.
The second argument is that individual emerging markets are highly volatile.
By investing in a spread of emerging markets, via a global fund, one can
reduce this volatility. This factor is reinforced by evidence which shows
that emerging markets are not correlated with each other: in other words,
there is no reason why the Brazilian and the Turkish stock markets should
move in the same direction. Therefore, an investor can benefit from the
phenomenon of greater economic growth, and therefore faster increases in
corporate profits, without increasing risk.
Regional funds also have some advantages for investors who do not feel
confident enough about choosing individual markets in Asia or Latin America.
Single country funds have a more mixed reputation. Inevitably, they will be
more volatile than global funds. But they offer a focused investment route
for those who want to back the growth of a particular market, say, Mexico in
the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The reputation of the single country sector was damaged by the establishment
of a number of closed-end funds in the late 1980s. These funds, often based
offshore but with a London listing, were designed to tap institutional
investor enthusiasm for individual, usually Far Eastern, stock markets.
Problems arose because such funds were often launched when an individual
market was the height of fashion. In some countries, a few authorised funds
represented the only route for outside institutional investors to gain
exposure to the market. In their early days, some funds moved quickly to
stand at premiums to asset values.
However, when such markets subsequently fell out of favour, the asset value
of the funds dropped. Furthermore, the closed end nature of these funds
meant that investors could only sell their shares in the market. A
combination of illiquidity, and out-of-favour markets meant that shares
dropped to discounts to asset values. These could be as wide as 35-40 per
cent.
In the early 1990s, there were rumblings of discontent from some
institutions, who felt that brokers were neglecting the needs of existing
investors. Some believed brokers were interested only in the substantial
fees available for launching funds; they were less concerned about doing
something to rescue investors when their holdings stood at a discount.
One or two attempts were made to unitise closed-end funds which stood at a
discount, a device which would allow investors to realise their holdings at
asset value. But the discount factor was also attacked by a number of
predatory investors, who built up large stakes in funds at high discounts,
with the aim of provoking managers into action and earning a handsome
profit.
A general narrowing of discounts followed, enhancing investors' returns at a
time of generally buoyant stock markets. City of London Emerging Markets, a
unit trust which specialises in buying the shares of single country funds,
produced returns of 236 per cent over the two years to January 1, 1994,
(offer-to-bid with net income reinvested: source Hardwick Stafford Wright)
making it the best performing international growth trust over the period. It
is also top of its sector over one year, and second over three and five
years.
Nevertheless, the volatility of the discounts in the single country fund
sector inevitably raises the question of whether it is better to construct
such funds on an open- or closed-end basis. An open-ended fund, constructed
as a unit trust or mutual fund, avoids the discount problem. However, were
an emerging market to crash sharply, the open-ended fund manager would have
a problem. His investors would be rushing to redeem their holdings and he
would have to offload stock on to an illiquid and fast-plunging market. The
manager of a closed-ended fund can sit tight, however, since his investors
cannot sell their shares back to him.
In essence, the closed-end structure passes the liquidity risk on to the
investor, in the form of the danger of a discount. However, the fans of
closed-end funds argue that the freedom given to closed-end managers should
improve their performance (and thus the return to the investor) in the long
run.
The debate could become louder if the Securities and Investments Board goes
ahead with proposals to replace its list of approved securities and
derivatives markets with a general duty on unit trust managers to ensure
that the markets in which they invest meet certain criteria.
The old system has restricted the freedom of UK unit trust managers to
invest in certain emerging markets, and thus has limited the number of
onshore single country funds. The new system may help pave the way to a
plethora of Brazilian and Argentine funds, aimed at the British small
investor.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (26): Venturing in search of
higher yields - Bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed income investors are proving ever more adventurous in their quest for
higher yields, turning to the world's more exotic emerging market locations
to invest their funds.
While the yields on US Treasury bonds, Japanese government debt and European
government bonds have declined steadily over the past couple of years, bond
issues from some of the emerging economies have provided fixed income
investors with an attractive, high-yielding alternative.
Many international investors are already familiar and comfortable with the
idea of investing in emerging market debt which is denominated in US
dollars, yen, or one of the core European currencies. But recently the trend
has been for the more adventurous investors to explore the domestic debt
route, investing in government - and where possible, corporate - bond
markets.
'Lots of people are out looking for opportunities, and an increasing number
of emerging market debt funds are looking at these domestic debt markets,'
says Ms Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International
Consultants, which specialises in emerging markets and which publishes data
on the emerging bond and money markets*. While emerging market debt funds
already invest in Brady bonds and eurobonds, some are turning to the
domestic bond markets of emerging economies as well.
Of the various domestic debt markets, Mexico has already seen considerable
interest: in 1992 and 1993, international investors eagerly invested in
Mexican 'cetes' or short-dated paper to obtain double-digit yields.
'North Africa is attracting a lot of international investor interest at the
moment - in countries such as Morocco and Egypt you can obtain double-digit
yields tax-free, and it's really not that difficult to buy the paper,' says
Ms Morrissey. In Ghana, short- and medium-dated paper yields 'over 30 per
cent', she adds. Given that the yields on US Treasury bonds reached their
lowest levels in nearly 20 years last year, it is easy to see why
double-digit yields are such a lure.
Other markets which are attracting investor interest include the Peruvian
corporate bond market, where the paper is denominated in US dollars. Ms
Morrissey says this is seen as an 'evolving' market, given that there have
been several new issues, although she maintains it is still easier to invest
in Peru via the eurobond market.' The problem with some of these emerging
bond markets is the currency risk: as an investor you have to feel confident
with the government's overall economic policy and interest rate policy,'
says Ms Morrissey.
Mr Justin Cormack, an emerging markets fund manager at Guinness Flight,
points out that 'many of these domestic bond markets are quite large, but
can be difficult to invest in, for example, South Korea'.
Guinness Flight recently launched an Asian currency and bond fund, which has
attracted about Dollars 11m from investors so far and which invests in the
domestic bond markets of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong
Kong, and India (which is seen as particularly attractive because of the
high yields available), as well as more developed markets in the region such
as Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Cormack believes there are several good reasons to invest in the region's
bond markets. Many of these countries will need to borrow heavily for
substantial infrastructure projects. At the same time, some of the domestic
stock markets are relatively expensive, while the currencies are cheap and
have scope to appreciate, Mr Cormack says.
For some international investors these domestic bond markets may still seem
rather esoteric. Their route into the emerging markets tends to be through
the international bond market where there has been a plentiful supply of new
issues, particularly from the Latin American countries.
Last year was a bumper year in the eurobond market, with record new issuance
of Dollars 412bn, up from Dollars 279bn in 1992, according to figures
compiled by IFR Securities Data. Of the Dollars 412bn in new issuance,
Dollars 35.9bn - equivalent to 8.7 per cent of the total - was issued by
emerging market names, with the bulk of this (Dollars 29.7bn) issued in
dollars.
The volume of new issues from emerging market borrowers - especially Latin
American ones - has surged. Total new issues from the emerging markets has
more than doubled, from a total of Dollars 14.4bn in 1992 to Dollars 35.9bn
last year, and total issuance from Latin American names has increased from
Dollars 9.88bn (106 issues) in 1992 to Dollars 19.2bn (187 issues) in 1993,
according to IFR Securities Data.
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina remain the most important source of new issues,
and as investors have become more familiar with the individual corporate
names, the yield spreads (in other words, the yield pick-up over the
relevant US Treasury bond) for new issues have gradually narrowed, while
yields in the secondary market have continued to decline.
At the same time, there have been several exciting new developments in the
Latin American sector in the past year, partly aimed at enhancing their
appeal to investors. These include the launch of larger, more liquid issues;
the issuance of bonds in a wider range of currencies; and a noticeable trend
towards longer maturities. Five- and 10-year bond issues have become a more
common occurrence, and Pemex (the Mexican state oil company) issued a
Dollars 250m, 30-year Yankee bond with a coupon of 8 5/8 per cent last year.
Cemex, the largest cement company in Mexico, set the trend for larger issues
with the launch of a Dollars 1bn, five-year eurobond issue in May 1993. This
was the biggest eurobond issue ever by an emerging market name. Since then,
the Republic of Argentina has raised Dollars 1bn with a global bond issue,
and at the start of 1994, Bancomext, Mexico's state- owned import and export
bank, launched the first global Dollars 1bn 10-year deal for a Mexican
borrower.
Larger bond issues are obviously more liquid in the secondary market, a
factor which is appreciated by international investors who tend to complain
about the poor liquidity of Dollars 100-200m issues. Emerging market
specialists point out that there is much more investor interest in these
large liquid issues.
In addition, the more frequent Latin American borrowers in the international
bond market have become more adventurous currency-wise, braving the
non-dollar currency sectors: for example, the Republic of Venezuela has
issued D-Mark eurobonds, while Pemex has issued Canadian dollar, sterling
and French franc eurobonds.
Mr Ian Tweedley, director at West Merchant Bank, points out that by issuing
in other currencies, Latin American borrowers have been able to reach a
wider range of investors, and this process of diversification seems likely
to continue.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (27): Analysts point to pricing
anomalies - Brady bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From unsure beginnings, Brady bonds have become one of the most
actively-traded sectors of the international bond markets.
The bonds emerged from the ashes of the 1980s developing-country debt crisis
and the debt initiative launched in 1989 by the then US Treasury Secretary,
Nicholas Brady.
Brady bonds were concessional bonds issued to holders of bank debt which had
been subject to restructurings throughout the 1980s; often the bonds were
backed by guarantees of some interest and principal.
Now the universe of Brady bonds is around Dollars 95bn, of which issues
amounting to something less than Dollars 80bn are actively traded. A large
proportion of these bonds are no longer held by banks, and are traded among
individual and, increasingly, institutional investors.
For much of the 1990s, helped by the improved economic performance of
countries such as Mexico and Argentina, the prices of Brady bonds have moved
relentlessly upwards. As yields fell on the bonds of these well-performing
governments, investors began to cast the net wider, seeking high yields.
Even poorly performing countries such as Nigeria and countries without a
Brady deal, such as Peru, have seen the prices of their debt rising sharply.
The rises - J P Morgan calculates total 1993 return from fixed-rate Brady
bonds last year were 48.99 per cent and floating-rate Brady-bonds 38.37 per
cent - have been such that some investors have begun to question whether
there is anything left for investors in the Brady bond market. To argue that
there is, many analysts are pointing to what they say are pricing anomalies
between the Brady bond market and comparable Eurobonds.
Typical of these anomalies is the yield gap between the Dollars 1bn global
bond issued by Mexico's Bancomext in January and so-called Aztec bonds,
issued by the government under a 1988 attempt to restructure debt which
anticipated the Brady initiative. The issue for state-owned Bancomext was
launched at around 160 basis points of 10-year US Treasury note rates; the
Aztec bonds - which mature in 14 years' time - yield 200 basis points over
the Treasury yield curve. Yet, because of the US Treasury collateral, the
yield, stripped of its US Treasury element, is calculated at 400 basis
points or more - significantly more than the Bancomext issue.
Mr Shahriar Shahida, head of emerging market debt trading and sales at
Paribas Capital Markets in London, argues that, not only do many Brady bond
issues yield more than equivalent Eurobonds, but they are also often more
liquid and easy to trade.
Mr Paul Luke, at Morgan Grenfell, and others say that Brady bonds may be a
superior risk to comparable Eurobonds. He argues that, in Latin American
restructurings arising from defaults in the 1930s, bondholders that had
already been forced to take a write-down were treated better in subsequent
restructurings.
Furthermore, the 'specialness' of the Latin Eurobond issues, which meant
that there were no significant defaults through the 1980s (because there
were hardly any outstanding bonds), is disappearing. Some Dollars 25bn of
new bond market debt was issued by Latin American issuers last year alone.
Some investors still believe that the biggest gains are to be made in that
shrinking number of countries yet to achieve a Brady deal. Brazil, which has
scheduled a closing for its Brady deal by April 15, Peru, Ecuador, and
Poland have all to complete Brady reschedulings.
The price of Peru's debt, for example, has risen sevenfold in the past
couple of years, and is now trading at 70 cents to the dollar. Roughly half
of this is accounted for by unpaid interest. Some investors are still
excited by the opportunity for profit through an expected active
debt-for-equity swap programme in the mould of Argentina's privatisation
plan.
Investors in this pre-Brady debt have emerged as an increasingly important
force: the Dart family of the US - which made its fortune in the 1960s
through the invention of the polystyrene cup - has amassed a holding of at
least Dollars 1.2bn face-value of Brazilian debt - 3.5 per cent of the
outstanding medium-term debt not held by Brazilian banks. The family is
unwilling to join the agreement carved out between the banks and the
government, which threatens to hold up the agreement. The Darts, bankers
reckon, may have important positions in other pre-Brady countries.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (25): Continent of hazard and
opportunity - Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Which of the world's emerging markets can boast an investment fund where a
Dollars 1,000 stake a year ago has risen to nearly Dollars 1,500?
Surprisingly, the answer is Africa. Even more surprising, the country
concerned is Nigeria, where the economic reform programme has collapsed  -
but a shrewd purchase of Nigerian debt is paying off for investors.
The New York-based International Asset Transactions decided in 1992 that
Nigerian promissory notes (issued in the mid 1980s to clear Dollars 4.2bn in
trade arrears) and par bonds (which discounted commercial bank debt at 40
cents to the dollar in a 1991 settlement with the London Club) were
underpriced.
Gus Udo and Donna Young of IAT noted that servicing these deals cost Nigeria
comparatively little - around 14 days a year of the country's 1.4m-barrel
daily production of oil. They reckoned that no sensible government would
alienate the banks and the trading houses by defaulting on the terms of the
two settlements.
So, in January 1993 they launched the Nigeria Emerging Market Fund, an
open-end mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands, with about two thirds
in Nigeria Central Bank promissory notes and most of the balance in Brady
par bonds. The results have been remarkable.
Behind the general view that Africa's debt instruments are generally
undervalued lies a fundamental reappraisal of the continent's prospects.
'Africa is poised for growth,' declares Morgan Stanley, which has launched a
Dollars 40m Africa Investment Fund. Its bullish 50 - page appraisal of the
continent argues that the economic and political reforms under way for the
best part of a decade are coming good. Prices for the region's exports such
as cocoa, coffee, gold are recovering, and industrial metals are bottoming.
Africa, argues the report, which includes a useful guide to the dozen stock
markets operating and the 20 others being developed, 'harbours undervalued
assets, particularly in the natural resource and manufacturing sectors'.
'Where stock markets are up and running,' says Morgan Stanley, 'investors
can find attractively priced issues, both on a price-earnings and
price-to-book basis.'
By international standards the African market - excluding South Africa,
which ranks just outside the world's top 10 - is tiny. Its exchanges have a
combined market capitalisation of around Dollars 12bn compared to India's
Dollars 91bn.
Nevertheless, the belief in the resurgence of Africa's fortunes, led by
hopes for a thriving post apartheid South Africa, has caught the imagination
of international fund managers.
Mr Miles Morland, of London-based Blakeney Management, calculates that at
least Dollars 3bn of foreign money is being targeted at South Africa and a
further Dollars 1bn at the rest of Africa in 1994: 'Peanuts in Mexico or
Hong Kong, but they are liable to blow the African market apart at the
seams.'
The total amount of stock available in the whole of Africa (excluding South
Africa) is about Dollars 2.2bn, he reckons: 'If almost half of this turns
over in 1994, a huge increase on the 1993 levels, there will still only be
Dollars 1bn of African equities to be fought over by local investors, global
investors and all the new Africa funds.'
The continent's heavyweight is South Africa. With a market capitalisation of
some Dollars 150bn, South Africa is not so much an emerging market but a
re-emerging market, comments Nigel Scheckter of Micropal, the Boston-based
fund performance measurement service, which monitors 26,000 funds.
But 'the true float is tiny relative to the wave of US guilt money that will
elbow its way into the market this year,' says Mr Morland.
Foreign buyers have already made their mark on Diagonal Street. Figures
supplied by Baring Securities show that for the foreign investor, who
benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthing in the financial rand, the
investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4
per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41
per cent.
'The market is the best one-way ticket I can think of, barring the 20 per
cent bloodbath prospect' - a reference to fears that the April elections may
trigger destabilising violence.
Elsewhere, Mr Morland singles out Ghana, a tiny market but likely to grow
rapidly as the privatisation programme led by Ashanti Gold moves ahead,
Zimbabwe, where foreign buying in the second half of 1993 helped more than
double the industrial index, Morocco and Tunisia.
Is the excitement warranted, are the risks appreciated, and how well do the
analysts know Africa?
Morgan Stanley's upbeat view of the continent does not overlook the problems
 -pointing among other things to weak management, and what it calls Africa's
'fear and distrust of foreign business influence'.
But the overall picture that emerges may strike some readers as too rosy.
The assertion that 'tribal tension in most of black Africa is probably less
of a problem than racial tension in the US' may simply be an unorthodox
view. More serious is the assertion that 28 of Africa's 50 states 'have
economic reform programmes in place'.
This list is based, says Morgan Stanley, on World Bank evaluations - not
always, it should be said, the best judge of its own reform efforts.
Some examples of reform listed by Morgan Stanley are risible - such as
Zaire, where the political and economic malaise deepens by the day.
Also on the list is Burundi, where the recent coup (which took place after
the report's publication) illustrates the volatility of the African
condition. The inclusion of Sao Tome, little more than a dot in the ocean,
trivialises the list.
Nigeria - 'a powerhouse waiting to happen', according to Morgan Stanley -
'perseveres with its structural adjustment programme, launched in 1986',
writes the analyst.
At the time the report was published (October 1993) it was clear that
Nigeria's erratic attempt to implement the programme was the reason an IMF
agreement lapsed some two years ago.
Any hopes that Nigeria's military regime would revive the lapsed programme
were set back last month, when it fixed the exchange rate and local interest
rates at unrealistic levels.
Africa's performance in general has been weak. As Professor Tony Hawkins of
the University of Zimbabwe writes in a recent paper: 'More than a dozen
years after the launch of aid-funded structural adjustment programmes, it is
impossible to identify a single mainland sub-Saharan country that has made a
success of economic reform.'
'The best that can be said,' he continues, 'is that in countries such as
Ghana and Uganda, the spiral of decline has been reversed, but it will take
well into the next century before earlier living standards are regained.'
A somewhat tougher investment appraisal comes from the Meridien BIAO group
which runs a network of banks in 20 countries across Africa, led by Andrew
Sardanis and Colin Goodwin, two veteran Africa hands.
The investment climate is improving, says Colin Goodwin, president of the
group, 'but by nothing like enough.
'Investment through individual African stock exchanges is not the best route
for the emerging market fund,' he adds, 'as these exchanges are still too
small and surrounded by too many restrictions'.
The response of Africans with resources abroad may well prove the acid test
of whether an African investment makes sense: if the continent's
politicians, businessmen, civil servants are not risking their capital,
foreign investors may suspect that Africa's elite knows something they do
not.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (24): Magic carpet not ready for
take-off - Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets in the Arab world are not yet in a position to offer a
soaring magic carpet to international investors. The swathe of states from
Morocco to Syria have no roaring economic 'tigers' and there is as yet no
golden prospect of a capitalist rebirth - though progress towards Middle
East peace has quickened the pulse of many investors. Most countries remain
in the very earliest stages of liberalising reforms which might eventually
present profitable opportunities.
But the region is far from being an equity desert. Most states have stock
markets of varying maturities and development - the exceptions being Libya,
Syria, Yemen and, for the time being, Lebanon. And although most markets are
either closed to foreign investors, or difficult to penetrate, international
interest is rising. A survey by Kleiman International Consultants last
November found that half of the 40 institutions it surveyed had holdings in
Middle Eastern or North African markets in 1993, against just 7 per cent in
1990.
The trick, according to the growing number of institutions showing an
interest in the region's generally pre-emerging markets, is careful picking
and choosing. And while none of the region's markets makes it, for instance,
into The Economist's new premiership league table of 24 markets to watch,
investors have already begun to pick some regional leaders and laggards. Two
markets, in particular, are already being singled out for particular
attention.
Chief among these is Jordan's market. The Amman financial market, with more
than 110 listed companies and capitalisation of JD3.5bn is among the
region's most profitable and ably-run. Buoyed by two successive years of
strong real economic growth, sustained government commitment to
International Monetary Fund reforms, high liquidity and, most recently, by
optimism over the peace process, the market's index rose by 30 per cent in
1992 and was a further 23 per cent up by the end of last year.
Although the government and its agencies hold substantial stakes in many
Jordanian companies - notably in tourism and minerals companies - it is
nevertheless among the most highly traded markets in the region. Mr Miles
Morland, of Blakeney Consultants, one of the few Middle East market
specialists, says at least half of total issued stock is tradeable - far
higher than the regional average. As important, in Mr Morland's view, is the
degree of local participation in the market, in which he estimates there are
around 100,000 participants. Few if any Middle Eastern bourses can compare
on that count.
Such buoyancy has attracted considerable outside interest, even though
direct non-Arab participation in the market requires government approval - a
procedure which can take months. Official figures suggest, however, that at
least 15 per cent of the market is in non-Jordanian, mostly Gulf Arab,
hands. Only 2-3 per cent is reckoned to be held by non-Arabs. But this
should change given the degree of interest being shown by western
institutions.
Ten leading institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Baring
Securities and Citicorp recently won approval from the prime minister's
office to operate in the market and, according to Mr Dan Smaller of Lehmans,
the market can expect 'substantial' inward investment during 1994. 'The
peace process has taken away a big risk. Even if the details of peace take
time to negotiate, the breakthrough has removed a big obstacle,' he says,
adding that he expects Lehman to commit up to Dollars 25m to the market
during the first quarter of this year.
The second regional star performer is Morocco, where investors are impressed
less by the maturity of the local stock market than by the government's
clear and so far successful commitment to privatisation. The Casablanca
bourse remains lethargic, suffering the common regional ailments of a
shortage of scrip - only 69 companies are listed - and low liquidity. But
this has not impeded a large influx of foreign capital into a privatisation
programme which the government has been seeing through with untypical energy
for the region. As Mr Morland remarks: 'Privatisation is the key - because
that's what forces governments to look at their stock markets.'
Last year the Moroccan government exceeded by 40 per cent its target of
state asset sales, with total receipts hitting Dollars 250m. By the end of
1995 the government aims to have sold a further 112 companies or assets
worth almost Dollars 2bn, and foreign buyers are being embraced. At the end
of last year, for example, a French subsidiary of Holderbank bought a 51 per
cent stake in CIOR, the state cement group in an offering which was five
times oversubscribed. The sale last summer of CTM, a state transport group,
also injected 40 per cent of its capital into the equity market, and
analysts are confident that privatisation will substantially add to the
supply of new scrip throughout 1994.
Elsewhere in the region, however, prospects appear more mixed. In North
Africa, Tunisia is seen as offering some opportunities, again because of the
government's commitment to IMF-guided liberalisation policies and its equal
desire to attract foreign capital. However, Tunisia's privatisation
programme continues to move more cautiously than in Morocco, where some
analysts also consider that the absence of any history of socialist
administration is also giving Casablanca an enterprising edge.
Egypt is perhaps the greatest disappointment in the region. Although the
government has made remarkable progress with broad macro-economic reforms
under two years of IMF tutelage, its own privatisation programme has become
heavily bogged down by a combination of bureaucratic inertia and profound
government caution over the potential political effects of selling off large
parts of the sprawling public sector.
The result has been to deprive Egypt's market of the new issues it requires
to establish a properly liquid bourse - one which before the 1950s was the
world's fifth busiest. Although more than 450 companies are technically
listed on the exchange, no more than 35 or so are ever traded and Kidder
Peabody includes only 24 of these on its market index as truly liquid
stocks. These, according to Mr Aladdin Saba, vice-president of Kidder
Peabody Egypt, represent a capitalisation of around EPounds 1bn (USDollars
297m).
Direct foreign participation is possible - though some companies retain a
statutory ban on foreign ownership - and, according to Mr Saba, some foreign
money has been entering the market over the past 18 months, mainly from the
Gulf. The result has been to lift the Kidder index by more than 60 per cent
over the past year. But, as Mr Saba concedes, this was from a low base.
There is also some disappointment in the market over the new capital market
regulations introduced last year, which abolished an historical imbalance in
the taxation of dividends and bank deposits. Many consider the new rules,
which also govern the creation of market intermediaries, remain too
restrictive. 'The government looked at these rules as a regulatory
instrument, rather than as a business opportunity,' says one market player,
who believes Egypt is in danger of losing out to Jordan and other regional
bourses.
For the time being, this excludes markets in the Gulf states, which remain
closed to foreign investment. But this, too, may soon change. The biggest
and healthiest Gulf market, in Saudi Arabia, boasts a capitalisation of
around Dollars 50bn and vigorous trading. So far, however, the Saudi
authorities have resisted any temptation to open their floorless and
increasingly sophisticated market to foreign investors.
Other Gulf states, however, may prove less cautious. Oman and Bahrain, in
particular, are already examining ways to open their small bourses. For Mr
Morland and several other analysts, these markets may well be among the most
interesting of 1994. Falling oil prices, diminishing state revenues and the
attendant appeal of attracting foreign capital into non-oil industrial
ventures might all spur a greater opening, Mr Morland suggests. 'My guess is
this is the year when these markets will begin to emerge,' he says. Just
this month, the government of the United Arab Emirates set up a cabinet
committee to examine formalising and centralising its kerb share market. The
committee is expected to consider from the outset the option of opening the
market to international investors.
Another newcomer over the next year could be Syria, where a draft bill for
the country's first stock exchange has been awaiting submission to the
People's Assembly since last Spring. Informal share trading thrives in the
Damascus souk and many businessmen in the country believe an official market
is an inevitable concomitant to Syria's cautious economic liberalisation -
though little financial infrastructure exists at present in what remains a
highly centralised state-based economy.
But perhaps the most exciting prospect in the region lies in Lebanon, where
the stock market has been closed since it was abandoned at the height of the
civil war in 1983.
The successful offering to Lebanese and Arab investors in Solidere, the
company established to rebuild downtown Beirut, has created the basis upon
which the Lebanese government will restart what many in the region consider
likely to be the Middle East's most promising market. Andersen Consultants
in London are already working on creating the framework for a secondary
market in the Dollars 1.8bn company's shares and the central bank says it
hopes to see trading in up to eight companies' shares within eight months.
Few doubt the appeal of a resumed Lebanese stock market, which is likely to
be open to outside capital. Those with the greatest faith in the inherent
trading ability of the Lebanese predict the new market will be among the
highest flyers in 1994/95.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (22): Istanbul bounces to the top
 -Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After spending the whole of 1992 at the bottom of the table, Istanbul has
risen over the past 14 months, to outperform all the world's emerging
markets, according to the World Bank's International Finance Corporation.
Thanks to robust retail demand, an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy
and timely legal changes, giving tax breaks for those funds investing in
equities, the 85-share index has been pushed to record heights.
The market lists some 150 companies, and is capitalised at around USDollars
30bn. Daily trading volume is around Dollars 80m. The best performers are
those companies with low debt and a strong franchise in the local market,
such as Arcelik, the white goods manufacturer, local retailer Migros, or
beer companies such as Ege Biracilik. Brokers say there has been a marked
deepening in the market, with the arrival of foreign investors and more
tentatively the local institutional buyers. But trading still suffers from a
shortage of liquidity, a restrictive settlement system, and the lack of good
research facilities.
For the bull market to continue, the government will have to contain its own
appetite for funds which has had a damaging effect, not only crowding out
the equity markets but undermining corporate profitability as borrowing
costs have been pushed higher. Today, treasury bills and other official debt
instruments still account for 80 per cent of capital market activity.
There also remains some concern about the permanence of the government's
interest rate policy after the Central Bank last month was forced to devalue
the lira by 12 per cent after raising interbank rates which at one time
reached 200 per cent. If interest rates are to settle at these new levels,
equities may find it harder to entice funds away from fixed interest
instruments. This could force the small retail investor, who has provided
much of the momentum of the bull market, to reconsider his portfolio
options. For all that, there remains an underlying confidence in the market.
Brokers point out that in dollar terms, the index still has some way to go
to attain the levels enjoyed in the 1990 bull market, which lasted until the
day Saddam Hussein's tanks rolled into Kuwait.
The market has made considerable strides, on the regulatory side and in
improving settlement and clearance systems. Under the Turkish practice, on
any transaction, the physical delivery of stock must be completed before the
end of the following day. This is a direct result of Turkey's high
inflation. It is also an attempt to encourage trading in larger volumes and
take away some of the attractions of speculative dealing. But for foreign
investors, particularly those dealing from far-flung markets such as Hong
Kong, where there is a time difference, it can present a serious headache.
In an effort to ease this problem, the exchange has now introduced a new
centralised custodian system which accounts for 70 per cent of transactions.
In addition, a new electronic trading system was inaugurated in early
December, on some 50 shares. The whole exchange shifts to screen-based
system later this year when trading moves to its new premises.
The market's other constraints have more to do with Turkey's particularly
conservative corporate culture, where equity finance remains a small part in
the thinking of many companies. Private concerns are wary of the disclosure
requirements and the dilution of ownership. However, all that may soon
change.
Reforms have been introduced to allow companies to float non-voting shares.
In addition, the new tax law included incentives for companies going public.
Brokers anticipate a wave of new issues, as companies seek to rationalise
the spread of their empires, ahead of the move to a customs union in 1995.
Equity finance could also be useful as companies upgrade technologies, in a
bid to keep pace with the renewed competition from imports.
The number of public offerings has already increased as banks seek to float
subsidiaries in a bid to meet new capital requirements set by the
Basle-based Bank of International Settlements. A less welcome prospect is
that the market might be flooded with government stock as Turkey's
privatisation speeds up. If only for political reasons, Turkey seems
destined to offer some part of the state corporations now being considered
for privatisation to local investors.
How well the market digests this will depend largely on whether big Turkish
institutions are attracted. The fund managers of insurance companies and
state enterprises have traditionally remained averse to risk, preferring
government securities to dabbling in the more uncertain waters of the equity
market. However, rule changes introduced in 1993, now make it easier for
banks and brokerages to establish funds. The law also provides tax breaks
for those A-type funds invested in equities. According to figures from the
Capital Market Board, the government's securities watchdog, the government
has approved 23 funds, with a further 13 under consideration.
It is still a relatively immature area. Many banks, for example, make use of
funds they establish to buy stock in their own industrial affiliates. As one
leading broker put it: 'That's not fund management, that's price fixing.'
But on one thing the brokerage community is agreed - this is the only way
forward. For only with the ballast provided by long-term institutional
investors, will Turkey's market attract fresh interest and enable the index
to reach new heights.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (21): Creating capitalism without
capital - Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nowhere is the term 'emerging market' more apposite than in central Europe
where markets of all kinds have emerged over the past two or three years
from what President Lech Walesa of Poland once called the 'fish soup' of a
command economy - a system with no place for markets, or real money or
economic logic.
The speed with which commodity and financial markets alike have gained in
size, scope and efficiency has been phenomenal, certainly as dramatic as the
equally under-appreciated structural changes in the economies of the region.
Leading the pack have been the 'fast track' reforming economies of central
Europe, the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland and, to a lesser extent,
Slovakia, with the addition of Slovenia - and Estonia, the first of the
former Soviet states to establish a viable currency.
Whole swathes of the economies of the fast-track reformers - including
politically sensitive heavy industries such as steel making and mining -
have been scaled back, leading to heavy unemployment which the fast-growing
private sector emerging from local entrepreneurship and foreign investment
has been able only partially to prevent turning politically dangerous.
As a general rule, markets have developed pari passu with privatisation,
although in the specific case of financial markets, with a certain delay due
to the time needed to train staff in the hitherto arcane arts of buying,
selling and valuing securities and for putting in place the necessary
physical equipment, from security printing of share certificates to stock
exchange screens.
But 1993 saw emerging financial markets come into their own. First Warsaw,
then Prague and then, with greater caution, Budapest, experienced
extraordinary stock market booms as a wall of local and foreign investment
hit fledgling markets with their tiny lists of quoted stocks.
The boom on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), the star performer on world
stock markets last year, was sparked off by a sharp fall in the interest
paid on local bank deposits in the first half of the year. As Poles
cautiously at first, and then with abandon, piled into the 22 stocks quoted
on the electronic board in the former communist party central committee
building in central Warsaw, the rising tide of share prices attracted the
attention of a handful of western investors. Among the first in were
veterans of other emerging markets in Asia and Latin America such as Salomon
Brothers and J P Morgan, and the Boston-based Pioneer Group, which set up
the Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund and invested heavily in the fast rising
market.
Lift-off began just after Easter and brought Warsaw's WIG index racing up
from a 1993 low of 1,040 at the start of the year to 11,760 at the end of
1993. Convinced of the unsustainability of such a meteoric rise, which
pushed p/e ratios into the high 30s in many cases, many foreign investors
quietly took profits over the latter part of the year and waited for what
could be a substantial market correction.
Such is the weight of local money, however, that shares have continued to
find local buyers so the year started on a high note, although a sure proof
of two-way trading was the way that trading was characterised by high volume
rather than higher prices.
Significantly, Poland's new left-of-centre government has decided that a
healthy stock market is too important to jeopardise by imposing punitive
taxation or too many restrictions. Strapped for cash, and obliged by the IMF
to keep the deficit around 4-5 per cent of GDP, the government is looking to
a combination of mass privatisation and the flotation of the shares of
selected state enterprises, especially the banks, to raise revenue.
The flotation late last year of 30.1 per cent of the shares in Bank Slaski,
the second of nine state-owned commercial banks in line for privatisation,
was massively over-subscribed with 800,000 would-be investors clamouring for
six times more shares than actually on offer. The 500,000 zloty offer price
is expected to more than triple when the banks' shares are first quoted in a
few weeks. With existing shares at their present high level, investors are
looking for a steady flow of reasonably priced Initial Public Offers (IPOs)
to sustain their interest in the market.
While Warsaw was last year's star performer, however, Prague looks poised to
take over the mantle this year. The success of the first round of mass
privatisation has put most of the shares of the 1,300 companies into the
hands of a dozen investment funds. The shares were offered at way below book
value to the 8m citizens who took up the government's offer of privatisation
vouchers costing Dollars 30. More than 70 per cent of voucher holders
deposited them with the funds who have been busy building up significant,
and in some cases controlling stakes, on their behalf. The funds are the
biggest participants on the Prague scene, buying and selling shares both on
and off the Prague Stock Exchange and the rival electronic over-the-counter
R-M system.
Marginally bigger than the Warsaw stock exchange, with 28 quoted stocks to
Warsaw's 22, Prague also has a handful of very big companies. CEZ, the
electricity utility company, is the biggest with an end-year market
capitalisation of Dollars 2.7bn equivalent to the total capitalisation of
the WSE. It is followed by the two biggest commercial banks, the Sporitelna
and Komercni banks, and a couple of foreign-controlled companies, Tabak, the
former state tobacco monopoly now controlled by Philip Morris, and
Cokoladovny, controlled by Pepsi-Cola. With a further 800 companies at
present being privatised in the second round of the mass privatisation
scheme (MPP), and fund managers anxious to raise liquidity by issuing new
equity, the Prague bourse seems set for a phase of rapid expansion in the
years to come.
Somewhat ironically, Budapest, whose budding financial entrepreneurs were
the first to set up a stock exchange, has been the least expansive stock
market to date. Early investors suffered substantial paper losses on the
initially over- priced first issues and several shares remain below 1992
levels in real terms in spite of the 50 per cent rise in the market over the
last weeks of the year.
The relatively slow development of the Budapest bourse is largely
conditioned by the fact that much privatisation has been through trade sales
to foreign investors rather than mass privatisation schemes or stock market
flotations. But, with elections looming in May, Hungary too is heading for a
limited form of MPP as the realisation dawned on politicians that schemes
which gave ordinary citizens a material stake in former state industries
were politically popular.
Whatever the original motivation, however, the development of stock
exchanges and other financial institutions such as pension funds, insurance
companies and revamped, self-financing health insurance funds, is providing
an answer to the basic question which hovered over post-communist Europe
only four years ago - how to create capitalism without capital? The answer
seems to be: through a combination of foreign investment and the mechanisms
and markets needed to tap the domestic savings generated by rising income
differentials and structural reforms which eliminate the wasteful and
irrational old ways.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (23): Lisbon shapes up for change
 -Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lisbon stock exchange will this year mark its 250th anniversary by
moving out of the arched 18th century building where it began, into a sleek
office block in the new financial centre taking shape on the outskirts of
the city.
The change signals a coming of age for the exchange after putting into place
sweeping operational and administrative changes that officials believe place
Lisbon on the same efficiency level as the most advanced exchanges in
Europe.
Recent reforms include the adoption of a continuous trading system, a
computerised national stock registration house and a 700-section
administrative law that governs insider trading, company disclosure rules
and many other areas.
'The reforms have inspired new confidence in investors who have seen the
exchange taking great strides towards becoming more efficient, transparent
and well regulated,' says Mr Jose Cardoso de Matos, director of marketing
and organisation for the Lisbon bourse.
This confidence was a contributing factor to the positive performance of the
exchange over the past year. Trading volume rose by 97 per cent to Es2,849bn
(Dollars 16.2bn) in 1993 while the value of the market more than doubled to
Es2,193bn.
It is true that bond trading accounted for 85 per cent of total volume while
shares represented only 15 per cent. But share trading volume nevertheless
rose 58 per cent on 1992 to Es417.9bn. The 183 companies quoted had a market
capitalisation of Es2,193bn in December, 1993 compared with Es1,431bn a year
earlier.
Share prices also increased substantially, with the Bolsa de Valores de
Lisboa (BVL) share index rising 55 per cent in 1993 to a year-end high of
848.54. The index has continued to rise steadily this year, reaching 922.37
on January 24.
Sharply falling interest rates that made the return on bonds and bank
deposit increasingly less attractive were the main reason behind the solid
performance of shares in 1993. One-year bond rates fell to 10.5 per cent
compared to 19 per cent two years earlier. Bank deposit rates dropped from
15 per cent to 7 per cent in less than a year. This compared less than
favourably with earnings of around 20 per cent offered by share investment
funds.
For the first time in the recent history of the Lisbon bourse, domestic
investors, particularly pension, mutual and other investment funds, led the
movement into shares from May, 1993. Foreign investors, who have previously
dominated share rallies and still account for an estimated 30 per cent of
total trading, followed closely in their footsteps.
A second reason for Lisbon's strong performance in 1993 was the official
listing of the exchange on the Morgan Stanley index of emerging markets,
with a 5 per cent weighting.
'Lisbon had been trying unsuccessfully to establish itself as a developing
but traditional European market,' says Ms Elizabeth Rothfield, a director of
sales and research with Lisbon-based independent stockbrokers Midas
Investimento. 'By becoming an emerging market, the bourse has attracted new
investment from the growing number of emerging market funds launched mainly
in the US and the UK.'
Most analysts see continued growth for share prices in 1994, though it is
unlikely to be as strong as last year. They are also agreed that a price
correction is almost inevitable. 'If share prices continue to climb over the
next few months it is very likely there will be a spell of profit-taking
that will set the index back,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based
partner with consultants Arthur Andersen.
Mr Joao Rendeiro, president of fund managers Gestifundo, forecasts that
shares prices will rise between 20 to 30 per cent this year. He says
industrial companies have the greatest potential for price gains, which
could reach 100 per cent, while banks may show a 10 per cent fall in price.
He sees Banco Comercial Portugues and Banco Portugues do Atlantico as the
only positive exceptions in the banking sector.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (19): All eyes on new president
after a roller-coaster year - Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In many respects, 1993 was another bad year for the Venezuelan equities
market. After three years of strong growth, the economy of this South
American oil exporter went into a recession in 1993, and inflation rose to
46 per cent.
The country continued to suffer political instability, including the removal
of a president to face corruption charges, a series of terrorist bombs in
Caracas, and recurring rumours of a coup d'etat. (There had been two
frustrated coups in 1992.)
Added to this was the uncertainty associated with elections, held last
December, to choose a new president and national and state legislatures.
Moreover, Venezuelan equities had to compete with high real interest rates
that could provide holders of savings accounts with a 30 per cent return in
dollar terms.
As a result of all this, the Caracas Stock Exchange index had fallen in real
terms by 17.5 per cent at the end of a rollercoaster year. (Nominally, the
index rose by 10.2 per cent.) This was a far cry from 1990, when the Caracas
exchange posted the world's highest gain in dollar terms.
Trading activity in shares, as measured by the number of operations, rose by
11.2 per cent to over 165,000 trades; but trading volume in dollar terms
dropped by over 28 per cent, to Dollars 1.85bn, according to figures
released by the exchange.
The Venezuelan bolivar lost 25 per cent of its value last year against the
dollar. Trading remained highly concentrated, with 10 issues out of 157
companies listed (up from 139 companies in 1992) accounting for 85 per cent
of shares traded. These 10 issues are: La Electricidad de Caracas (the most
active stock), Mantex, Vencemos (Class I), Banco Union, Sudamtex (Class B),
Mavesa, Sivensa, Sudamtex (Class A), Banco Occidental de Descuento and
Venaseta (Class A).
Despite all this, some issues did very well. 'Investors who picked up blue
chips on dips were treated to very large gains,' wrote Mr Alex Dalmady,
editor of InvestAnalysis Stock Guide.
'The market was very volatile during the year, reversing trends about a
dozen times. High interest rates made sharp rallies, since the opportunity
cost of holding a stock that wasn't rising (or wasn't rising fast enough)
became unbearable. Trend-following traders, expecting powerful rallies, got
burned time in and time out. The contrarians, who bought when nobody wanted
stocks and who sold when everyone was in the market, raked in profits.'
According to Mr Dalmady, the top five performers in 1993, with overall gains
in dollar terms, were:
Corimon, a diversified industrial group (+107.6 per cent);
Proagro, an agribusiness company (+106 per cent);
Venepal (Class B), a papermaker (+49 per cent);
Vencemos Class I, a cement company (+43.6 per cent);
Electricidad de Caracas, a utility (+33.7 per cent).
The five worst performers in 1993 of the 51 issues analysed by
InvestAnalysis were:
Tordisca ( - 65.6 per cent);
Bancor ( - 66.8 per cent);
Grupo Zuliano ( - 68.7 per cent);
Inverdica ( - 71.5 per cent);
and Torvenca ( - 77.8 per cent)
During 1993, the Caracas exchange attracted a significant number of foreign
investors, who had been absent from the Venezuelan equities market since
1992.
Moreover, the exchange improved the efficiency of its operations, increased
automation, and was managed in a more professional manner than in previous
years.
At present, the economic outlook for 1994 is poor. The economy continues to
be in recession, and inflation is rising. The failure of a large commercial
bank (Banco Latino) in mid-January has sent shock waves through Venezuela's
financial system. Most Venezuelans, battered by inflation over the past few
years, say they want to abolish market reforms initiated in 1989.
Investors are waiting to see how the new president, Mr Rafael Caldera, who
has just started a five-year term, will confront these problems.
A 78-year-old politician, who served as president from 1969 to 1974, Mr
Caldera took a strong line against market reforms during his presidential
campaign last year. But as inauguration days drew nearer, he and his
advisers indicated that, while the country's free-market policies will be
altered, they will not be scrapped.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (20): Edging closer to US
standards - Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's financial convergence with the US is forcing its stock market to
adopt US practices of accounting, disclosure and financial analysis. The
result is the most sophisticated and liquid emerging market in Latin
America, but one which can still spring surprises for ill-prepared
investors.
The financial integration, which is expected to intensify with
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, is having a
profound impact on the way Mexican companies manage their businesses.
Companies that used to be controlled by one or two families, and could
afford to ignore outside shareholders, are now keeping in touch with
domestic and international investors, and are highly sensitive to their
criticisms.
However, the harmonisation is far from complete, and the Mexican bolsa is
much more volatile than that of a typically mature market. As was
demonstrated at the time of the New Year uprising in the state of Chiapas,
daily movements of 5 per cent are not uncommon.
For many companies, liaison with investors is already as close as that of
the US. 'There is a huge dichotomy between the highly sophisticated Mexican
companies quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and what is happening in the
economy as a whole where average incomes are only Dollars 4,000 per capita,'
says Mr Timothy Heyman of Baring Securities in Mexico City.
The main pressure for change has come from Mexican companies that have
raised capital internationally, and have sought listings in the US. To
attract foreign money, these companies have had to adopt US rules of
disclosure, and to accept US focus on short-term earnings performance.
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of practically every large Mexican
company are now traded in New York, while a growing number of Mexican
companies enjoy full listing on the New York Stock Exchange - including
Telmex, Vitro, Televisa, Dina, ICA, Radio Centro.
While some companies have managed the change fairly painlessly, others have
found it difficult. Many barely conceal irritation at having to answer to a
group of foreign analysts who often show little understanding of the
cultural differences between the US and Mexico. Foreigners in turn are still
critical about lack of timely information, insider trading, and poor
management of investor relations.
Foreign investors criticised Cementos Mexicanos, the cement company, for not
warning investors it intended to use money from an equity offering to buy
two Spanish cement companies, Sanson and Valenciana. Cemex says at the time
of the offering it was not planning to buy the companies.
Telmex, the largest quoted company in Mexico, is one of the few US-quoted
companies without a professional firm of public relations, and occasionally
its management's inexperience has created difficulties with international
investors. At a conference in New York last June, the company finance
director caused the Telmex stock price to tumble after making what he
thought were innocuous remarks about low earnings prospects.
Investors also complain that information about a company often reaches some
participants before others. Mexico's stock market watchdog tightened rules
on insider trading last year. It says that it is investigating several cases
of participants using privileged information for gain.
'Mexico has the problem of every emerging market. There exists the ability
to acquire information ahead of public announcements,' says Jeremy
Campbell-Lamerton, managing director of the London branch of Inverlat, a
Mexican broker.
Most fund managers in Mexico are also stockbrokers, and investors have
complained that they shuffle money between mutual funds they run and the
stockbrokers' own accounts to the disadvantage of some clients. 'When you
are the operator, distributor, evaluator and seller of the fund there is a
conflict of interest,' says Mr Carlos de Laborde, general director of Covap,
Mexico's largest mutual fund reviewer.
The government last December passed new regulations that make it more
difficult for fund mangers to buy and sell shares for a mutual fund at less
or more than the true market value. Covap, which is an independent body, now
evaluates about 140 of the 230 mutual funds in Mexico.
Mexico is slowly moving to US accounting standards, says Jorge Mariscal of
Goldman Sachs. The latest example is the decision of banks to adopt US rules
of evaluating goodwill. Mr Mariscal expects eventually there will be few
important accounting differences between the two countries.
While Mexican accounting can confuse Americans by expressing numbers in
constant terms (ie, eliminating the effect of inflation), this is becoming
less important as Mexican inflation falls to US levels. Eventually, Mexico
is expected to abandon inflation accounting.
For Mexico, the cost of harmonisation with the US is that it is losing
control of its own capital markets. Because dealing costs are lower in the
US than in Mexico, and liquidity of trading often higher in the US than in
Mexico, many foreign investors prefer to buy stocks in New York.
The research on Mexican companies by foreign brokerages is considered better
than that published by Mexican brokerages, although this is gradually
changing. In a recent Institutional Investor poll of foreign money managers,
no Mexican broker was among the top five researchers of their own country's
markets.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (17): Lenient but lopsided -
Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina now has one of the world's most open and least-regulated financial
markets. This, plus a fast-growing economy and the pegging of the peso at
par to the dollar, has drawn flight capital back to Argentina and attracted
genuinely foreign money into the equity, debt and banking systems.
The government has removed nearly all investment barriers, to encourage
development of the capital markets and finance economic growth. The
Argentine economy has grown by over a quarter since reform began in earnest
in 1991, and is expected to expand at 5-6 per cent a year for the next six
years.
The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's market capitalisation has doubled in less
than a year to over Dollars 33bn, the result both of rising share prices and
flotation of big privatised utilities. Most analysts expect prices to
continue rising, though perhaps not at the same rate as last year's 36.5 per
cent rise in the Merval market index. They forecast above-average growth for
sectors like construction, food, energy, cars and banking.
Entering, trading and leaving the market is straightforward. Argentina has
no exchange controls. Investors need not register with the government.
Brokers' commissions are not fixed, and vary between 0.5 and 1 per cent,
plus a 0.12 per cent stock exchange levy. Capital gains and dividends are
not taxed. There is no stamp duty. Companies are not subject to foreign
ownership limits. No sectors are closed to foreigners.
Settlement and custody is handled by the exchange's computerised Caja de
Valores settlement system. Users say it is reliable and cheap.
Although most investors obviously like light regulation, there is concern
that the market's existing insider trading, disclosure and reporting rules
are poorly enforced. The Comision Nacional de Valores, the capital markets
watchdog, rejects the complaints and points to substantially increased fines
for offences and more aggressive policing.
The market may have grown strongly, but it is still heavily lopsided: five
stocks account for three-quarters of market capitalisation. There are no
marketmakers, so liquidity in all but the largest companies is limited. The
bulk of trading in the largest stocks, such as the semi-privatised oil
company YPF or the two privatised telephone operators, has moved to New
York, where they are listed in ADR form.
Although a dozen companies have listed since the market took off three years
ago, just as many have delisted. Most of the departing companies were small
and illiquid, with small floats. The listing of big privatisation stocks and
a few private industrial companies, such as the carmaker Sevel (licensee of
Peugeot and Fiat) and fast-growing Pepsi bottler Baesa, has made the market
increasingly representative of the economy.
Most companies are majority-owned by families, and still prefer raising debt
to selling equity. Hyperinflation virtually eliminated debt, leaving
companies room to borrow. This may change as gearing reaches international
levels, forcing owners to choose between listing, merging or selling to
larger competitors.
The lure of equity may increase with the launch in July of private pension
funds. At the moment, institutional investors are conspicuous by their
absence. Foreign investment funds and institutional investors are
increasingly important. Deregulation makes it hard to measure the foreign
presence, but foreigners probably account for 20-30 per cent of the market
float.
Political risk is considered small. President Carlos Menem's decisive
handling of rioting in December calmed investors' nerves. Devaluation before
next year's presidential elections is ruled out by most analysts. Mr Menem -
who wants to lift the constitution's ban on re-election and stand for a
second term - appears too committed to reform to backtrack.
Economy minister Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's reforms, is
entrenched in power. However, commitment to reform still does not extend
much beyond the economy ministry or the Casa Rosada presidential palace.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (18): New sparkle to market image
 -Chile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chilean stock market has, for the moment at least, shaken off its image
as being 'safe but dull' after a year-end surge compensated for months of
sluggish activity, producing real annual gains of 50 per cent on the IPSA
selective price index.
More than 18 per cent of that rise came in December alone as traders reacted
positively to firm economic indicators, smooth presidential elections and
the upgrading of Chile's risk rating by Standard &amp; Poor's to triple B plus,
the highest in Latin America.
That new-found confidence, also spurred by hopes of an early free trade
agreement with the US, has been sustained in 1994. Daily volumes, at Dollars
20m-Dollars 30m, remain high by Santiago standards and by mid-January the
IPSA had already posted gains of more than 10 per cent.
Market capitalisation is now approaching Dollars 50bn, compared with Chile's
gross domestic product of around Dollars 40bn. Of this, Dollars 1.55bn is
held by foreigners through 17 registered funds, one way of by-passing
foreign investment regulations which prohibit the repatriation of capital
for one year. Investments through registered funds pay capital gains tax of
10 per cent.
An increasingly popular way of investing in Chilean stock is through the
purchase of American Depositary Receipts on the New York exchange. Eight
Chilean companies, all of which have overcome rigorous guidelines laid down
by Chile's central bank, have issued ADRs. Chilean paper is heavily sought
after, though a further 12 companies are planning issues this year.
The Santiago exchange, underpinned by private pension funds (AFPs) which
have accumulated around Dollars 15bn since the early 1980s, is one of the
most solid and best run in Latin America. Trading, more than 30 per cent of
which takes place on an electronic bolsa where transactions are
instantaneous, is regulated by the securities and exchange commission.
The commission has the power to investigate unusual share price movements,
which it can refer to court where necessary. Mr Michael Harcombe, a
Kleinwort Benson representative in Santiago, says: 'The way things operate
here is fairly close to how a market would work in any European capital,
only on a smaller scale.'
New capital markets reform, which has been dragging its way through congress
for the past year, should tighten up regulations still further. Among
proposed reforms are measures to discourage the sometimes incestuous
relationships between large companies and powerful institutional investors.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (16): Stock market soars to dizzy
heights - Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a stock market doubles in a year in US dollar terms, then rises a
further 40 per cent in the first few weeks of January, warning bells usually
get drowned out by the alarms.
But in Brazil, where just such a dizzying rise has occurred, things often
happen differently and there is still no consensus on whether the market has
been overbought. 'Judging by historic Brazilian standards stocks are now
expensive. But compared to foreign markets, where most of the new money is
coming from, it's still cheap,' one local broker claimed.
Of Brazil's nine stock markets, the Sao Paulo exchange accounts for about
65-70 per cent of trading and is the most modern. Rio de Janeiro accounts
for most of the remaining volume. Sao Paulo's main Bovespa index, which
tracks the market's 54 largest companies by capitalisation, has gained about
180 per cent in dollar terms in the past 12 months. But, as an indication of
the market's volatility, the index has only recently returned to its 1986
level and there have been months in between when it has moved 40 per cent
either way.
What has driven the latest rally has been an expectation that the
government's economic 'shock' plan will bring inflation sharply down from
last year's annualised rate of 2,500 per cent. Foreign money has been
flooding into Brazil, partly in anticipation of the plan and partly
reflecting the worldwide trend towards emerging markets. Finally, there is
evidence the private sector is at last becoming more competitive and less
reliant on an interventionist state.
Foreign holdings more than doubled last year, according to the Sao Paulo
exchange, from 8 per cent to 19 per cent of the market's value. The inflow
has continued with central bank figures suggesting about Dollars 260m of
foreign investment flowed into exchanges in the first two weeks of January
alone, a record start to the year.
These investors face a problem, however. There are comparatively few large
and liquid Brazilian companies quoted. Meanwhile, a poor but improving level
of corporate disclosure among smaller second line companies means the race
for stock has made the well known shares very expensive.
The government-controlled oil company Petrobras, for example, which is
Brazil's largest company in terms of turnover, is a key holding in any
portfolio. But its shares added 40 per cent in just five days' trading at
the start of January, before falling back slightly.
Orders in Sao Paulo and Rio can be executed through open outcry or through
one of the two exchange's real time screen systems. All trades are monitored
by the exchanges, which have a reasonable supervisory reputation among
foreign investors.
Physical settlement is due on the first working day after the trade and
financial settlement is made on the second working day. Sao Paulo's clearing
house, known as Calispa, also guarantees settlement through its Operations
Settlement Fund. Rio has the same regulations, although its Custody and
Settlement Chamber is independent and profit-making. Commission fees due to
brokerages vary according to transaction size, while there is a fixed 0.05
per cent transaction fee levied on every trade.
Most foreign portfolio investment, is made under Annex 4 of the March 1987
investment resolution 1289. This allows direct foreign investment as long as
funds are not used to acquire control of local companies and a Brazilian
administrator is appointed. Foreigners are not subject to capital gains or
corporate income tax. Withholding tax on dividends is 15 per cent.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (15): Great expectations
reinforced - The markets are viewed as being less frothy than they were a
couple of years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 1993 was the year of Asia's emerging stock markets, many investment
analysts believe the attention of international investors will swing more
towards Latin America in 1994.
These expectations were reinforced in January, when many investors
apparently took profits on their sizeable gains in Asia last year, to build
up their exposure to Latin America.
Mr Michael Howell, investment strategist at Baring Securities in London,
estimates that close to Dollars 40bn in new funds swept into the emerging
stock markets last year. Of this 60 per cent went to Asia and 20 per cent to
Latin America.
The Latin American share of the total fell from about 60 per cent in 1992
and 80 per cent in 1991. Mr Howell believes that international investors
will allocate a higher percentage in 1994 to Latin America, which - along
with rising commodity prices - should support the region's markets.
What happened in 1993 was that US institutional investors - whose interest
in the emerging markets had been almost exclusively concentrated on Latin
America - woke up to the Asian markets and rapidly increased their exposure.
In 1994, some strategists are expecting UK institutional investors to wake
up to Latin America.
Susanne Carrington, manager of Latin American funds at Flemings Investment
Management, says that the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement
in November last year triggered an important change in
UK investor attitudes.
'Nafta has been incredibly
important for focusing
people's attention on the whole region,' she said.
Furthermore, the continuation and deepening of economic reform have
impressed investors, and markets are viewed now as being less frothy than
they were a couple of years ago. Growth in the region should average 3 per
cent this year (3.4 per cent excluding Brazil), according to the latest
forecasts from the London-based Consensus Economics, compared with 3.5 per
cent last year.
Still, investors have their problems across the region. Front-running -
where brokers fulfil their own orders
before those of clients
and insider dealing - is
common. 'It's a real
problem,' said one equity
analyst, who also said
there was a perception that the Mexican market had improved in this respect
over the past year.
Many companies in the region are run by families who remain unwilling to
cede control to outside investors. This means some companies are positively
unhelpful about providing information. This is changing in Mexico, where
disclosure is improving all the time, but in many other markets remains an
important issue.
The Venezuelan market gets the wooden spoon for being the most difficult
market in which to deal: settlement and custody are usually problems. Of
Venezuela, Ms Carrington of Flemings says: 'There's only one stock that I'll
buy in the local market.'
Such difficulties - and other factors, such as Chile's restrictions on sale
of stock and a 35 per cent withholding tax - drive many investors into the
New York market for ADRs.
Nonetheless, some investors think these ADRs show a strong correlation with
the New York market and are therefore not completely satisfactory for the
purpose of diversification.
The biggest question about Latin American stock markets is: how long can the
current inflows continue?
More specifically: what will happen when US interest rates - the low levels
of which have had a big impact in encouraging the flows of funds to emerging
markets - take a decisive turn upwards?
Many strategists think the flow of funds - assuming continued economic and
political stability in the region's key markets - will continue, though
perhaps at a lower level, while investors build up their holdings to desired
levels. There has, say some analysts, been a step-change in institutional
investor attitudes to the region's stock markets which should sustain flows.
Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson Securities
in London, says the money flowing into mutual funds in the US - currently
important investors in Latin America - would not slow the moment that US
interest rates turned upwards. Furthermore, even if interest rates turned
high enough to tempt holders of mutual funds back into bank deposits,
certificates of deposits and the like, the growing interest of pension funds
and other institutional investors should help to sustain a continued flow of
funds for some time.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (14): Foreign buyers cast a spell
 -India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Stock markets in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all fallen under the
spell of the foreign buyer in the past year. International fund managers,
flush with money for emerging markets, have put money into all three
countries, pushing equities to record levels in Karachi and Colombo and
close to record levels in Bombay. The Karachi Stock Exchange's index rose by
74 per cent last year, the Colombo Stock Exchange index of leading stocks by
73 per cent and the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of 30 top shares by 29 per
cent.
Each country has its attractions for foreign investors. India is in the
throes of its biggest economic reforms since independence; it has weathered
many political shocks, including the assassinations of two prime ministers
and last year's religious riots; its markets are potentially the largest in
the world after China. Moreover, foreign portfolio investment has been
permitted only since late 1992 - so international fund managers must build
their holdings virtually from nothing.
A single foreign investor may not hold more than 5 per cent of any Indian
stock. Foreign investors as a whole are limited to a combined 24 per cent.
Foreign investors enjoy special concessionary tax rates - tax on short-term
capital gains is levied at 30 per cent on foreigners (51.75-57.75 per cent
for Indian investors). Gains on stocks held for more than a year are taxed
at just 10 per cent for foreign investors (46 per cent for most Indians.).
The taxes are payable prior to repatriation of profits, which can then be
freely converted into foreign exchange.
India offers investors a large market with some 7,000 listed companies,
quoted on 22 stock exchanges of which the biggest is the Bombay Stock
Exchange, accounting for about two-thirds of total turnover. The BSE's total
capitalisation exceeds USDollars 100bn. However, only about 2,000 shares are
actively traded and only about 200 of these are traded in volumes large
enough to attract foreign investors.
The Bombay Stock Exchange is run largely by its member brokers, who have
been repeatedly criticised for alleged insider trading, mis-pricing
investors' transactions for their own benefit and ignoring accounting rules.
Most recently, the parliamentary report into the 1992 Bombay securities
market scandal dealt extensively with the BSE's alleged regulatory
shortcomings. The Securities and Exchange Board, the markets watchdog
established in 1992, has recently forced the BSE to raise its standards of
service for investors. At the time of writing, it had ordered brokers to
suspend an untransparent informal forward market, known as badla, in an
effort to curb abuses. Internationally-minded brokers are pressing the BSE
for reforms, including the planned introduction of computer-based trading,
which should eventually speed transactions and settlements, reducing the
scope for cheating. Today, settlement periods run to one week for the most
actively-traded stocks and two weeks for others. The exchange has been hit
by several brokers' strikes in the recent past, which cause delays and
undermine confidence.
Investment by foreigners is limited to institutions which have secured prior
approval from SEBI. Non-resident Indians, treated as a special category
under many Indian laws, may invest without prior authorisation. About 130
institutions have secured SEBI approval, but only around 15 of these are
investing actively. The others are in the process of preparing and launching
funds. Bombay has a long tradition of western-style commercial services,
such as book-keeping and legal advice. Nevertheless, services geared to the
needs of foreign portfolio investors are still in their infancy. There is,
for example, a grave shortage of custodial services.
Pakistan has been open to large-scale foreign portfolio investment since the
early 1990s and foreigners now own an estimated 5-7 per cent of Pakistani
equities. Pakistan has undertaken considerably more radical pro-market
reforms than India, but its attraction for foreign investors is clouded by
the disruption caused by power struggles in the ruling elite. Ms Benazir
Bhutto's recent return to the prime ministership has prompted a sharp rally
in equities, though doubts remain about her ability to bring long-term
political stability.
The Karachi Stock Exchange lists about 650 companies with a combined value
of about USDollars 12bn. About one third of all companies are in textiles,
Pakistan's biggest industry. Settlement takes place on Mondays, with at
least seven days break between trading and settlement, a period which runs
to a maximum of 13 days. The cumbersome trading and settlement procedures
give rise to complaints of brokers mis-pricing trades and of insider
trading. Foreign investors are free to buy up to 100 per cent of any stock.
There is no tax on stock market capital gains and no restrictions on the
repatriation of profits.
Sri Lanka has been carrying out market-oriented reforms since the end of
socialist-inspired policies in the mid-1970s. Thanks to its relatively small
size, it has become by far the most internationally-oriented economy in
south Asia, with exports accounting for about one third of GDP. Foreigners
account for half the trading on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Shares rose
rapidly last year in spite of the assassinations of an opposition leader and
of former president Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa and an escalation in the civil
war with Tamil separatists in the north. Investors are impressed that none
of these events seemed to disturb the country's political stability.
There are no limits on foreign shareholdings in Sri Lankan companies, with
the exception of banks and a few other companies regarded as
strategically-important.
There is no capital gains tax on stock investment profits, but investors who
make a business of buying and selling shares in Sri Lanka might be liable
for income tax (if they are individuals) and corporate tax (if companies).
There are no restrictions on repatriating profits.
The Colombo Stock Exchange is fully computerised and a model of efficiency
in south Asia. Settlement takes place in five days for buyers and seven days
for sellers. There are 201 listed companies with a total market value of
just under USDollars 3bn.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (13): Foreigners risk
disappointment - Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Analysing Taiwan's mercurial stock market has never been easy, but it is
simpler than divining the mood of the country's central bankers. Citing
concerns over an appreciating currency and impending chaos in the financial
markets, the powerful bank moved to quash a year-end stock rally by mopping
up liquidity and cutting off foreign investment, writes a correspondent in
Taipei.
Until a few months ago, none but the strictest of asset managers went to the
trouble of investing in Taiwan's historically overvalued stock market. But
when neighbouring markets became dangerously top-heavy, fund managers
flocked to invest in Taiwan, which after several sluggish years looked
comparatively cheap.
Most of them will be disappointed. While other Asian countries have chosen
to capitalise on the deluge of foreign funds pouring into the region,
Taiwan's conservative Bank of China appears determined to keep the local
stock market all but hermetically sealed.
At about 2 per cent of total market capitalisation of Dollars 183bn as of
January 14, foreign investment remains a force of inspiration more than
substance in Taiwan's bourse. 'In the context of Asian markets, Taiwan is
successfully becoming a non-market', says Mr Mark Mobius, president of
Templeton Emerging Markets Fund. 'Taiwan has got to join the world. That's
the bottom line'.
Long-standing promises to liberalise financial markets appear designed more
to enhance Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
than to attract foreign investors. Unlike South Korea, Taiwan has yet to set
a timetable for its reforms, which for the most part have been painfully
slow and fitful.
The central bank has set an overall ceiling of Dollars 5bn on foreign
investments in the local bourse. Each would-be foreign institutional
investor (foreign individuals are not allowed to buy local shares) must
apply to the central bank for an investment quota of no more than Dollars
200m.
If approved, funds may be remitted, usually in small tranches, into the
country at the discretion of the central bank. The entire process can take
several months. Investors must wait at least three months before profits may
be repatriated again, at the central bank's discretion.
As of mid-January, foreign institutions had brought a net amount of roughly
Dollars 3bn into the country since the equity market was first opened to
outside investment in early 1990. Approved quotas worth Dollars 1.3bn
awaited the central bank's green light to be remitted into the country.
Applications pending at the central bank totalled Dollars 1.5bn.
The total now exceeds the cap on foreign investment. But fearful that the
runaway bourse, stoked by underground financing, would career out of control
and destabilise the financial system, authorities recently ruled out raising
the ceiling. Foreign investors have thus been virtually frozen out of the
market which promises some of the best growth prospects in the region.
This situation may eventually change, but the process will likely be slow,
punctuated by back-tracking and muddied conflicting signals. Ultimately,
Taiwan may open up to foreign investment only if it is forced to do so as a
condition to GATT entry, or when it decides that it needs foreign capital to
upgrade its industrial base and develop infrastructure.
For the time being, planners feel they have the luxury of turning foreigners
away.

Malaysia

In terms of market capitalisation, Kuala Lumpur is now the largest market by
far in south-east Asia. As the index of the KL market raced upwards in 1993,
finishing the year nearly 100 per cent up on January, total market
capitalisation increased more than 150 per cent to nearly MDollars 600bn
(Dollars 225bn).
The top 10 companies on the KL exchange account for about 45 per cent of
total market capitalisation: the top two, Tenaga Nasional, the partially
privatised electricity utility, and Telekom, the telecommunications company,
account for 17 per cent of the market.
Kuala Lumpur has become known as one of the world's more exciting - and
volatile - markets. In common with many Asian markets, large amounts of
foreign funds - mainly from the US - flooded into Malaysia in early 1993.
Retail investors within the country followed the foreign lead and now
account for about 70 per cent of trading volumes.
As a result of the increased liquidity in the market trading volumes have
skyrocketed: in January 1993 Kuala Lumpur's average daily turnover was
MDollars 200m. In the first week of 1994 average daily turnover was around
the MDollars 4bn mark.
Such growth in market activity has created regulatory and logistical
problems. KL is moving towards a scripless trading system. At times the
present mixed system has been unable to cope. There have been several cases
of share scrip going missing. There have been allegations of syndicates
rigging share prices, particularly on the second board, the focus of much of
the retail trading.
As in many Asian countries, politics and business in Malaysia are closely
related. Stock assessments often focus on a particular company's political
connections rather than on its balance sheet.
In March 1993, a Securities Commission was appointed to take action against
market abuses. 'The Securities Commission wants people to make money,' said
Mr Mohamad Munir, its chairman. 'However, they should not make mischief.'
Some market abusers have been brought to court. The authorities have also
insisted on more transparency in share transactions and better disclosure -
often a problem within tightly run, mostly Chinese, family companies.
Meanwhile, brokers have been told to improve their back-office operations to
deal with sudden surges in volume.
Foreign ownership: Foreigners have to check on the shareholding limitations
of particular companies. A limit of 30 per cent on foreign ownership applies
to many of the older listings. But on newer listings deemed to be strategic
companies by the government - such as Tenaga and Telekom - the limit for
foreign ownership is 25 per cent. However, on some companies, particularly
those listed on the second board, there is no ceiling on foreign ownership.
Share acquisitions of more than MDollars 5m or of 15 per cent of a company
have to be first approved by the government's foreign investment committee.
Foreign exchange/repatriation: While Malaysia operates foreign exchange
controls these are fairly liberal. Profits, dividends, capital, royalties,
fees and commissions can be freely transferred abroad in any currency. The
Central Bank requires forms to be filled in for payments above MDollars
10,000: this is principally designed to monitor monetary flows in and out of
the country.
Foreign investors do not need special permission to invest in Malaysian
shares. There is a 34 per cent tax on income from dividends. A 20 per cent
withholding tax is imposed on foreigners whose countries do not have double
taxation agreements with Malaysia.
Settlement procedures and other regulations: Settlement has to be completed
within seven days of the transaction on normal or 'ready' deals. The regular
trading lot is 1,000 shares.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (12): Learning from misfortune -
Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia's stock market has steadily gained equilibrium, after problems
arising from overheated share prices caused foreign investors to flee, in
many cases with heavy losses, in 1991.
Though it rose steadily throughout 1993 - ending the year 115 per cent up in
local currency terms - memories of that shake-out, coupled with low
liquidity, protected the stock market from some of the excesses of the flood
of foreign money into south-east Asia in the later months of the year.
Many brokers and fund managers believe this means that Indonesian shares
remain attractive. Mr Mike Balfour, overseas investment director of
Edinburgh Fund Managers, which runs the EFM Java Trust, says: 'Of all the
stock markets in Asia, Indonesia's is the most attractive, because it has
not had such a speculative run-up as other markets have.'
Liquidity is low, because many companies remain closely-held by family
owners, with only a small portion of their equity really available to be
traded. According to Baring Securities, average daily trading volume is only
Dollars 33m, compared with market capitalisation of Dollars 39bn. However,
both figures are well up on 1992, when they were Dollars 13m and Dollars
19bn respectively.
The number of new listings picked up last year, after a lull. Barito Pacific
Timber immediately became the largest company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange,
and saw its shares move to a large premium as soon as they were issued in
October.
Foreigners are limited to holding 49 per cent of a company's listed stocks.
This means that investors must monitor foreign holdings closely. It also
means that, as in some other Asian markets, the price for foreigners can
differ from the local price quoted on the Jakarta exchange. Shares in demand
among foreigners may be at a substantial premium.
In other respects, however, there are few restraints on foreign investors,
and regulation has become far more effective since the debacle of 1991.
Analysts believe that the economic outlook underpins a healthy outlook for
the stock market. The economy is expected to grow at around 7 per cent in
1994, slightly up on 1993, with inflation declining to around 7 per cent
from 10 per cent in 1993. Interest rates are expected to fall.
Growth in exports and in corporate earnings are forecast to be strong, and
aid flows to remain high. The rupiah is expected to continue to depreciate
by about 5 per cent a year.
Though there is uncertainty about the longer-term political future,
President Suharto, who has managed the country's economic development for 26
years, remains firmly in control at the age of 72.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (8): Watchdog vigilant - The
Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippine stock market is is still largely rumour-driven, despite the
emergence of professional research activities among brokers.
However, expectations of economic resurgence, along with political and
economic reforms, have produced sharp gains for the market.
A government watchdog agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
oversees the conduct and development of the market, but it has weaknesses.
While it is a quasi-judicial body, the commission is without police powers,
so that it cannot enforce implementation of some of its controversial
rulings.
Yet the SEC has tried to instil discipline. It has been involved in
upgrading the level of professionalism; and these efforts have been capped
by the recent unification of the two active stock exchanges into a
Philippine Stock Exchange, though the two trading floors (PSE-Ayala, in the
Makati financial district, and PSE-Tektite, at the fast-developing Ortigas
Center) were maintained.
There are 285 issues from 182 companies listed simultaneously on both
exchanges, though only about 100-110 of these issues are traded daily.
Foreign investors may buy only the Class B shares. Philippine nationals may
acquire both A and B shares. Local companies usually allocate up to 40 per
cent of their equity to foreign investors.
However, since most companies going public only offer up to 15-20 per cent
of capital on the market, the amounts actually made available to foreigners
are small. Thus, liquidity problems arise in many counters whenever there
are huge inflows of foreign funds, as happened in late-1993.
The exchanges have two major sections: the big board and the small board.
Big-board issues, also referred to as 'blue chips', are from companies with
a track record of earnings and dividend payments to shareholders. These
include the country's leading commercial, industrial and mining enterprises.
The small board is for speculative stocks, mostly newly established mining
and oil exploration companies with small irregular production or none at
all, and which therefore have no dividends to declare yet.
On each of the two exchanges, 90 broker members currently operate. -
Eventually, all 180 will be members of the new entity.
Unification will not bring the two exchanges' activities under one roof, but
their computer systems will be linked, providing each other with real-time
prices and allowing match-ups of bids and selling prices from either
exchange.
Trading on the exchanges starts at 9.30am and ends at noon, with 15-minute
extensions allowed but using only 12-noon closing prices. Current SEC rules
prescribe a freeze on the trading of a particular issue when its price moves
up by 50 per cent or down by 40 per cent during any single day. Trading on
such issue resumes only after the SEC has ruled that such fluctuation there
is justified.
Sales are done in lots of five to 200,000 shares, depending on the price
range of a particular stock. The lots become bigger as the price level goes
down.
Brokers charge commissions of usually 1.5 per cent of the total cost of each
transaction.
There is no capital gains tax, but a transaction tax of 0.25 per cent of the
total transaction cost is charged - which the government is seeking to
increase to 0.5 per cent.
There is no tax on dividends received from Philippine companies by resident
individuals or corporations. For non-resident foreign individuals, there is
a tax of 30 per cent, while that for foreign non-resident corporations is 35
per cent.
Paperwork on transactions involving foreign investors has become simplified
in recent years. For an investor who maintains a custodian bank, the process
takes about four days.
After confirmation of the sale, the investor may instruct the broker to
register the shares in the custodian's nominee name and informs the
custodian of the arrangement.
Payments fall due in four days. The custodian bank is to be paid in foreign
exchange, converts this amount into pesos and pays the broker that amount in
local currency. The custodian bank issues a registration document (a
requirement from the Philippine central bank) and gives two copies to the
broker. One of these copies is sent to the transfer agent.
After competion of the procedure, the certificates are delivered by the
transfer agent to the broker, who delivers the same to the custodian bank.
For investors who do not maintain custodian banks, all transactions are
centralised with the broker, who coordinates with a local bank in fixing the
local currency equivalent of the foreign exchange requirements on the deals.
The shares certificates may be kept by the broker for the investor, or they
may be delivered elsewhere upon instructions of the investor.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (9): Manipulators targeted -
Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ekamol Kiriwat, head of Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
was only half joking when he explained recently how Thai stock manipulators
had developed their use of bogus nominees to influence share prices: 'They
used to use their drivers,' he said. 'Now they use their golf caddies.'
The rapid expansion of the 19-year-old Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)  -
more than 360 companies and mutual funds are now quoted and volume on a busy
day exceeds Dollars 1bn - has been accompanied by a fair share of volatility
and insider trading.
The Thai market, however, remains popular with foreign investors. Active and
wealthy local speculators ensure that most stocks are liquid, the disclosure
of financial information by Thai companies has improved, and foreign
currency transfers in and out of Thailand have been simplified.
Recognising the need for greater regulation, the Thai authorities
established the SEC in 1992.
Under Mr Ekamol, the SEC has taken the pragmatic view that it cannot hope to
abolish all insider trading overnight and should concentrate on eliminating
deliberate, large-scale conspiracies to create false markets in particular
shares. The SEC has fingered three groups of alleged share manipulators
since it was founded, and although no-one has yet been convicted (such
convictions are hard to achieve even in developed markets) the SEC's
vigilance has embarrassed the accused and helped to cool the speculative
fever in Bangkok's trading rooms.
Foreign investors have learned to cope with share-ramping; when the word is
out in Bangkok that such and such a stock will rise, they are happy to buy
shares which they themselves believe to be ridiculously overvalued on
fundamentals (and then sell the stock quickly).
Of more concern to foreign investors is the future of Thailand's foreign
ownership limits. Foreign ownership is restricted under a variety of laws,
usually to less than 50 per cent but to 25 per cent in the case of banks.
Such restrictions create 'foreign premiums' when certain stocks - Bangkok
Bank for example - reach their foreign ownership limits; in other words the
price of the 'foreign' share rises above the price of the 'local' share in
the same company.
As in other countries with foreign limits, the possibility that limits might
soon be eased in line with Thailand's financial liberalisation policy has
caused volatility in premiums.
The problem is complicated by the fact that many foreigners do own 'local'
shares through nominees. This is a grey area, but it is supposed to be
illegal to pass on dividends or rights to someone not registered as the
beneficial owner of the shares.
At least one custodian bank continues to pass on such dividends via nominees
to foreign holders, but others have decided not to, although they are
prepared to hold the stock itself. Most US institutional investors shun
'local' shares in any case, because their internal rules prevent them buying
stock without voting rights.
The dangers were highlighted recently when some foreign holders of shares in
National Finance and Securities were denied access to a rights issue by
their custodian and saw the value of their investment in the company halved
overnight.
Foreign investors are thus faced with a dilemma: if they buy 'foreign'
shares, they risk losing money if the premium falls; if they buy 'local'
shares, they risk losing dividends and rights. Only the 80 per cent rise in
the value of Thai shares since June last year makes these dangers bearable.
Thailand is considering a system of so-called Mexican trusts, which would
allow foreigners to buy 'local' shares, without voting rights, through the
trusts. However, the lack of voting rights would still be unacceptable to US
institutions, and the establishment of the trusts might still cause a drop
in foreign premiums as non-US investors moved from the foreign board to the
trusts.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (10): Protectionist policy -
South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Seoul bourse reflects the nature of the South Korean economy:
protectionist, and subject to intrusive government meddling.
Only since January 1992 has the stock market been open to direct foreign
investment. Foreigners are limited to buying 10 per cent of a company's
shares, and must go through a cumbersome identification process before being
registered.
This has proved frustrating for foreign investors who want to take advantage
of the country's buoyant economy, which is expected to grow by at least 6
per cent this year.
The foreign shareholding ceilings for Korea's leading blue-chip companies
were filled long ago, forcing tardy investors to pay premiums of between 25
to 100 per cent for attractive Korean stock on the over-the-counter market.
Overseas funds specialising in Korean equity, which are not subject to the
shareholding limits, have also seen their premiums rise sharply.
The government has promised to raise the foreign shareholding ceiling by an
unspecified amount in two stages by 1997. But it appears reluctant to do so
quickly. The first increase is not due until the second half of this year at
the earliest, and may be only a slight rise to 15 per cent.
The government justifies its caution by arguing that a sudden and rapid
inflow of foreign capital would destabilise the economy, increasing the
money supply and boosting inflation, while threatening to cause wide swings
in share prices.
Foreign brokers complain that simple xenophobia is the real reason for
keeping foreign investment at bay.
Ironically, foreign investment in the past two years has probably stabilised
the stock market, which previously had been driven by short-term
speculation, with domestic investors paying little attention to
fundamentals.
Foreigners have tended to be long-term investors, and, by example, have
encouraged Koreans to do the same. But analysis of fundamentals is
difficult, because accounting and corporate disclosure rules need to be
improved.
Recent government efforts to curb anonymous stock accounts have also
contributed to a less volatile market, having reduced opportunities for the
so-called 'big hands' - the main investors that dominate the market - to
manipulate share prices.
But this has not discouraged the government from trying to play its part in
manipulating the market for political reasons.
The crash of the bourse in 1989 forced the government to intervene as small
investors complained about losses.
The government created a stock market stabilisation fund, to buy shares and
boost prices. Financial institutions, which operate under tight state
supervision, were also ordered to become net buyers. 'Korea would like to
have the world's first no-fault stock market,' said one western banker.
Those efforts have paid off, the share index having almost doubled in the
last 18 months. But the government slammed on the brakes in mid-January, as
small investors complained that they were losing out to big institutional
investors in the bull run.
Individual investors, for example, claimed they had been handicapped by a
requirement that they deposit 40 per cent of their buy order before shares
are purchased; while institutional investors have not been forced to make an
immediate payment guarantee. The government promptly ordered institutional
investors to made a 20 per cent deposit.
Foreign institutional investors will be subject to the new deposit
requirement, which could further complicate their purchase of shares.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (5): Exciting investments with a
rosy glow - Most countries are moving rapidly up the development curve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia provided some of the world's most exciting investments last year.
US institutional investors, in particular, became more aware of the economic
prospects for the region, as markets in the developed world appeared less
appealing.
East and south-east Asian countries, after years of rapid growth, do
increasing amounts of business with each other. Their development is
therefore more self-sustaining and less reliant on the health of the
industrialised world - though they still depend very much on keeping their
exports competitive. Most countries are moving rapidly up the development
curve, seeking to focus on higher technology and expertise and leaving
labour-intensive, low-cost production to emerging countries such as China
and Vietnam.
South-east Asian markets saw large inflows of foreign cash at the end of
1993 and a number have since seen price corrections. However, their economic
outlook remains rosy.
Hong Kong, too, saw a big influx of investment from abroad in spite of the
Sino-British row over its political development. Investors are attracted to
the Hong Kong market as a proxy for China, which is seen as the world's most
promising growth prospect over the coming decade but still offers only
limited means of direct portfolio investment.
The exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, however, are likely to see many more
companies listed in the next few years.
South Korea and Taiwan are viewed as attractive markets by foreign
institutions. However, the governments in Seoul and Taipei severely restrict
the amount and means of investment from abroad.
The Indian subcontinent has seen economic reform and promises more, with
India already boasting a large and well-developed stock market which is
increasingly catching attention abroad. Governments in New Delhi, Islamabad
and Colombo still have to overcome chronic political problems before they
can boast the kind of economic growth rates seen further east. But there is
considerable potential.
Elsewhere, Vietnam's economic reforms may soon lead to the establishment of
a stock market. Mongolia, mired in economic problems, boasts a stock
exchange which has been used to hasten privatisation.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (7): Caught up in the bull run -
Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago Singapore brokers were bemoaning the unexciting nature of the
local market. All that changed in 1993 as Singapore was caught up in the
bull run that swept through the Asian markets.
The Singapore main index went up 59 per cent in 1993 and total market
capitalisation increased by more than 150 per cent to SDollars 219bn
(Dollars 138bn).
Singapore is heavily influenced by the Kuala Lumpur market. The two were
once joined but split in 1990. However, Singapore can still trade in
Malaysian stocks through CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) International, an
over-the-counter market for trading securities listed on foreign exchanges.
It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of Singapore's daily trading volumes
are in CLOB-listed Malaysian stocks. Out of the 30 most active stocks traded
last year in Singapore 24 were Malaysian companies.
Singapore has the reputation of being an open and well regulated - some
would say over-regulated - market. In spite of recent government moves to
partially privatise a number of state companies and encourage share
ownership among the public, the market is also still a narrow one.
Though 21 companies went public last year, raising a total of SDollars
6.85bn - compared to 15 initial offerings in 1992 raising only SDollars 514m
 -almost 60 per cent of total funds raised in 1993 were in connection with
the October listing of Singapore Telecom (ST), the telecommunications and
post utility. Analysts say it is unlikely that any more large, state
entities will come to the market before early 1995.
Foreign ownership: The Singapore government jealously guards what it
considers to be key industries and places limits ranging from 15 to 49 per
cent on foreign ownership of such companies.
These include Singapore Airlines, Singapore Press Holdings and the four big
local banks. There are separate quotations for foreign shares in these
companies. Names of foreign owners must be declared when shares are
registered. Individual foreign investors must declare their interest if they
hold 5 per cent or more of any one company.
Foreign exchange/repatriation: There are no controls on such funds in or out
of Singapore. Singapore deducts at source a 27 per cent withholding tax on
dividend income earned within the country. There is no capital gains tax in
Singapore.
Settlement procedures and other regulations: Singapore is moving towards a
fully scripless trading system. Dealing costs are payable by both buyer and
seller on a downward sliding rate starting at 1 per cent for the first
SDollars 250,000.
Trades on the Ready Market are due for settlement on the same day in the
week following the date of transaction. The SES enforces a buy-in on the day
following a failed settlement. The regular trading lot is 1,000 shares.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (6): Shop window for red chips -
Hong Kong and China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big-time investors are not normally renowned for toeing the same line as
die-hard communist governments, but when it comes to Hong Kong both groups
are united in their failure to recognise the place as a separate country
distinct from China.
To the Chinese leaders, Hong Kong is a victim of evil colonialism. To the
investors - who recognise it in so far as they pour money into it - Hong
Kong is an English-speaking, sanitised shop front for the mainland, which is
precisely where their money is directed.
Mr Eugene Law, Hong Kong research director at Standard Chartered Securities,
said: 'When we market Hong Kong equities to clients, we market Hong Kong
just as part of the China concept. A lot of the new money coming into Hong
Kong is coming in with China in mind.'
The attractions of Hong Kong as a gateway to China embrace not only
westerners - who are more comfortable with the banking and legal framework
operating in the colony, and widespread use of English - but also to
overseas Chinese, particularly in Taiwan where direct links with the
mainland are still prohibited.
Corporate Hong Kong has been quick to cash in on this change in sentiment,
just as the economic infrastructure has evolved to address new demands on
its service industry. Of the 64 new companies that were listed in Hong Kong
last year hardly any neglected to devote serious column inches in the
prospectus to China plans.
Investors with a foothold in Hong Kong can participate in China's growth via
equity, debt or venture capital. So far the share market is the most
vibrant, although there is a significant number of funds invested in
unlisted China projects and many businesses are also taking this route,
injecting funds into land and plants across the border.
Equity investors have a number of options ranging from the purest form of B
shares (shares specially designated for foreigners which are listed on one
or other of China's two stock markets) through to Hong Kong-listed companies
which carry out the bulk of their activities across the border: the
so-called red chips.
In between are H shares, former state-owned enterprises now listed on the
Hong Kong stock market; American Depositary Receipts of China and Hong
Kong-listed companies traded on Wall Street; convertible bonds based on Hong
Kong shares and listed on Luxembourg or London stock exchanges; and Hong
Kong-listed China funds.
Six of an initial nine state enterprises earmarked for H shares are now
listed in Hong Kong; a second batch is due to be announced by Beijing any
day now.
The popularity of China exposure is reflected in over subscription levels of
stocks touting China links: the first H share, Tsingtao Brewery, was
oversubscribed by 110 times and saw its share price rise 28.57 per cent on
the offer price; China Travel Service was 411 times oversubscribed.
Mr Douglas Eu, an investment manager with Jardine Fleming Investment
Management, says: 'It has always been my view that Hong Kong is China. It
will indisputably be China in three and a half years, and any investment
stretches past that time frame. So what people are paying for today is
China, and the market has already put a value on Hong Kong shares that is
100 per cent China based.'
For foreigners, there is a greater availability of China shares in Hong Kong
than there is in the mainland itself. As of January 7, the market
capitalisation of the B share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen stood at,
respectively, USDollars 1.7bn and USDollars 952m, while the total for H
shares was USDollars 2.32bn. Adding in the wealth of pure China companies
traded in Hong Kong - such as China Travel Service and Guangdong Investments
 -gives an aggregate market capitalisation of something approaching
USDollars 15bn, he said.
Mr Robert Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, reckons the
Hong Kong market - which now has a capitalisation of around HKDollars 2.97
trillion - will be split equally between Hong Kong and Chinese plays by the
time the colony reverts to China in 1997.
'If you take the market as a whole, we reckon that now something like 80 to
100 companies could be defined as China plays: mostly smaller manufacturing
companies, H shares, red chips and China shell companies,' he said.
The last category is a more recent phenomenon where China companies - many
of which are PRC government-related - back into listed entities. Recent
examples of these so-called backdoor listings include Shougang International
and Shougang Grand (both belonging to Shougang Beijing); Continental Mariner
and Beijing Development ( CITIC Beijing) and the World Trade Centre
(CEROIL).
Part of the appeal of buying a Hong Kong-listed entity - regardless of what
its origins might be - stems from problems attached to more direct China
investment. B shares are illiquid, in limited supply - at the moment there
are just 19 B shares in Shenzhen and 23 in Shanghai - and expensive.
(Even when B shares are chosen they are broadly transacted through Hong Kong
offices as it is not only investors who prefer the colony: brokerages say
staff transferred to offices in Shanghai will often respond by resigning on
the spot.)
Mr Law said: 'When it comes to investing into China, a lot of investors find
it difficult to go into the market itself. Even B shares and H shares pose
difficulties because of the shortage of information.'
Bread-and-butter disclosure is sketchy by international standards, and UK or
US-based fund managers can find it tricky to make informed decisions on the
material available. More often first-time investors will look to Hong
Kong-based researchers to interpret the data, or simply stick their money in
a China fund and leave the fund manager to do the worrying.
There are some 17 China funds managed by Hong Kong registered companies,
with a total net asset value of around USDollars 733m.
There is also the comfort factor. The Hong Kong stock exchange, which has
been on a roadshow to woo overseas investors, prides itself on its
internationally acceptable regulatory standards. Much of the perceived risk
and volatility is ironed out and investors buy into a more sanitised China.
Mr Herbert Hui, head of the Hong Kong stock exchange's listing division,
says shareholder protection is a key priority. 'The shareholder, be he a
fund manager in London or a taxi driver in Hong Kong, should be able to rely
on the same standards of protection,' he said.
Also important for international institutional investors is Hong Kong's more
stable currency, which is pegged to the US dollar. Swings in China's Yuan,
as demonstrated last year, can still wreak havoc on a China operation's
receipts and outgoing, but where the scrip is denominated in Hong Kong
dollars the face investment is not affected.
But while Hong Kong has carved itself a unique niche role for now, brokers
say it has a limited shelf life. Shenzhen and Shanghai are now as important
stops on visiting fund managers' Asia circuit as Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok.
Given a year or two, Mr Law reckons Shanghai will become as important a
stopping off point as Hong Kong itself.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (4): Wide quest for pot of gold -
Profile of Mark Mobius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Mobius, president of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, gives two
addresses on his business card - one in Hong Kong and one in Singapore  -
but he might more correctly take a leaf out of the book of Truman Capote's
heroine Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's and simply put
'travelling'.
For nearly 10 months of the year the 57-year-old bachelor is on the road in
far-flung parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America in pursuit of would-be
wealth for armchair investors back in the industrialised countries.
He now covers more than 20 countries, helped by a team of consultants in
situ, exploring mining operations, digging up agricultural investment
opportunities and inspecting production plants in search of the potential
pot of gold in some of the developing world's more unlikely spots.
Recently he returned from a tour of a pasta flour mill in Botswana. The
flour is used to make spaghetti and cookies, big business in that part of
the world in spite of the dearth of Italian mamas and big-eyed bambinos.
Botswana's proximity to South Africa - the two are neighbouring states  -
where there are government controls on the sale of flour, allows Botswana
traders to ship in higher quality flour at competitive prices. This is good
news for the South African bakers, who otherwise have to put up with batches
cut with poorer grades: quality is extremely difficult to maintain.
What is good for the bakers is also good for the factory, which has a ready
stream of business. And what is good for the factory must also be good for
any investors - the clinching factor for Dr Mobius, one of the leading
lights in emerging markets funds.
Templeton's Emerging Markets Fund, over which he presides and which stood at
USDollars 364m at the end of last year, has risen an annualised average of
61.6 per cent over the past three years. Last year it rose 97 per cent. The
fund has a portfolio which spans citrus fruit plantations in Swaziland and
tyre manufacturers in Indonesia, and is complemented by the Dollars 1.39bn
Templeton Developing Markets Trust.
In 1987, when Templeton launched the Templeton Emerging Market Fund it was
the world's first such fund listed on a stock exchange with investments in
emerging markets as its specific objective. Altogether, the group now has
some USDollars 4.6bn under management in 20 emerging markets' funds and
portfolios.
Of course, Dr Mobius has a wide horizon: the emerging nations cover 77 per
cent of the world's land area and represent 85 per cent of its population,
he says - although only 23 per cent of the world's gross domestic product.
In spite of this, when it comes to strategy, painstaking research and
attention to detail are paramount. Not for nothing does Dr Mobius quote Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle: 'It has long been an axiom of mine that the little
things are definitely the most important.' It is also for this reason that
he spends so much of his own time travelling extensively.
'Very often the kinds of information we need cannot be obtained readily. You
have to dig for it. We have about 24 analysts, but not all travel as much as
me. The idea is for us to understand what's happening on the ground,' he
says.
Dr Mobius - who has not married and has no children - has spent 25 years
working in Asia, Africa and Latin America, operating his regional economics
and research consulting firm based in Hong Kong throughout the 1970s.
In 1980 he moved to international securities firm Vickers da Costa (which
has subsequently merged with Citibank), again starting off in Hong Kong but
moving three years later to Taiwan to open the firm's office there and
direct operations in India, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Korea.
From 1983 to 1986, he was president of Taiwan's first and biggest investment
management firm, International Investment Trust Company, and joined
Templeton International in 1987.
Equally peripatetic as a student, Dr Mobius has augmented his bachelors and
masters degrees from Boston university with further studies in the US - at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he obtained his Ph. D. in
economics and political science, and at the University of Wisconsin - as
well as at the University of Mexico and Kyoto University of Japan.
Nowadays the stops are shorter and - contrary to most people's post-student
travelling experiences - possibly conducted in more rudimentary lodgings.
Speaking to him a week apart will often mean calling different countries.
While eschewing the black-and-white alternatives of picking countries or
companies first, Dr Mobius tends towards the bottom-up approach: 'We look at
stocks first then look at the country through the eyes of the company and
how it is being affected by the macropolitical economic social financial
situation in that environment: not just in that country but in that part of
the country.
'For example, Botswana is as big as France so you cannot make
generalisations. Then we look at the political suitability because it may be
favourable depending what side of the fence one is on.'
While emerging funds have proved to be voguish vehicles - on the back of
their often impressive returns - Dr Mobius is quick to stress these are
long-term investments and not without risk.
'There is a lot more interest in emerging market funds and for that reason
we have to make sure we warn people of the dangers, and don't mislead them
into thinking this is manna from heaven,' he says.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (2): Third world reaches for the
big-time - Investment: Institutions and managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few years ago investors regarded third world securities as being of
interest only to specialists and speculators. The International Finance
Corporation, the Washington-based development institution, ploughed a lonely
furrow in formulating stock market indices and generally promoting the
potential of the emerging equity markets.
Now emerging markets have emerged into the big-time. 'The early investors
were only the sophisticated ones,' says Mr Narayan Ramachandran, of the
Connecticut-based pension consultants Rogers, Casey &amp; Associates. 'Today
this is widely accepted as a legitimate asset class.'
He reckons that emerging markets now account for about 10 per cent of the
international allocation of equities by US pension funds. Other investors
may be more adventurous: the US Securities Industry Association estimates
that in the 1990s US investors of all kinds have directed nearly 15 per cent
of equity outflows into emerging markets, against 4 per cent of a much
smaller total in the 1980s.
In London, Mr Michael Howell, global strategist with Baring Securities,
reckons that even this is an underestimate, because a significant part of
the US outflows pass through London before being invested in emerging
markets and are not clearly reported to the American authorities.
Baring estimates that from a tiny base in the 1980s - only Dollars 3.2bn
from all international sources went into Latin American and Pacific Rim
equities (excluding Japan) in 1988 - the total soared to almost Dollars 20bn
in 1992 and to Dollars 38bn last year. This year the figure is likely to
rise further, to some Dollars 45bn.
At the end of 1993, says Mr Howell, international holders owned emerging
market equities worth Dollars 160bn. US investors accounted for two-thirds
of this total.
A variety of factors lies behind the surge in interest. The growth of
market-oriented economic policies has opened up many countries to serious
foreign investment, and in Latin America the ending of the debt crisis has
been crucial to the restoration of international confidence.
For institutional investors, however, the slowdown in western economies and
the accompanying sharp fall in long-term interest rates, especially on
dollar bonds, may have been vital triggers.
US pension funds cannot meet their actuarial rate of return targets by
investing in top grade domestic assets, and so are looking further afield.
'The principal rationale for investment in emerging markets is high
returns,' says Mr Ramachandran. 'The overall rate of return expectation for
a pension plan is 10 per cent, but for emerging markets the projection is
15-20 per cent.'
Mr Howell takes this a stage further by arguing that mature market equities
are likely to provide much less attractive returns in the future because of
slower economic growth in the developed world. Accordingly a third of mature
market equity portfolios should be shifted into emerging markets. For a
typical US defined benefit pension plan this would imply that a fifth of its
overall portfolio should be in emerging market equities.
Mr Nigel Morecroft, of Foreign &amp; Colonial Pensions Management, argues that
the exposure of UK pension funds to what are today defined as emerging
markets will climb from 2 to 20 per cent over the next two decades.
It is certainly true that many investment institutions are seeking to raise
their exposures sharply. Several pioneering emerging markets fund managers
have therefore been in a strong position to cash in on the mushrooming
demand for their expertise in this area.
The biggest is probably the Capital Group, the Los Angeles- based firm of
global money managers that linked up with the IRC in 1986 to launch the
Emerging Markets Growth Fund, a US closed-end fund now worth some Dollars
3bn.
A London consultancy firm, Fund Research, conducts highly detailed research
on emerging markets fund managers, both on a global and regional basis. It
says that the top-ranking managers are to be found in the US, the UK and
Hong Kong.
Among the top firms, besides Capital Group, is Emerging Markets Management,
of Virginia. This was founded in 1987 by Mr Antoine van Agtmael, himself a
former executive at the IRC. EMM is described as a 'leading edge' manager
which has recently been exploring the potential of the more esoteric markets
in Africa and eastern Europe.
Another top manager is Templeton, like Capital Group a bottom-up
stock-picking global investor which has been drawn into emerging markets by
the values to be found there. Mr Mark Mobius runs Templeton's emerging
markets funds out of Hong Kong.
Back in the US, Morgan Stanley Asset Management has been very prominent in
the recent institutional charge into emerging markets, under the
chairmanship of Mr Barton Biggs.
As for the UK, Schroder Investment Management is a highly- rated
participant, along with GT Management and Genesis Investment Management. The
first two have the advantages of being substantial international
organisations: GT, for instance, runs all its emerging markets funds out of
Hong Kong, while Schroder operates primarily in London, although with the
benefit of an international network.
Genesis, however, is a young (less than five years) specialist boutique
which has quickly built up a presence of approaching Dollars 1bn in emerging
markets. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial is probably about the same size in emerging
markets: it built up its presence under the name Latin American Securities,
but it now trades as F &amp; C Emerging Markets.
This is not, of course, an exclusive list. Giants such as Merrill Lynch and
Fidelity run a lot of emerging markets money. In London there are many other
contenders for a slice of this booming sector, including Baring Asset
Management, Mercury Asset Management, Kleinwort Benson and Robert Fleming
(the latter especially through Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong).
Nowadays there are even emerging markets index-tracking funds, for instance
the IFC Investable Emerging Markets Index Fund which was launched last
October. It is run by State Street Asset Management out of Boston.
According to Mr Peter Jeffries of Fund Research the best emerging markets
managers tend to be quite senior people. 'Because general research in this
area is so scant you need to have very experienced people,' he says.
'Stock selection is becoming terribly important,' he says. 'There is a huge
performance disparity among managers.'
A question for the future, perhaps, is whether the emerging markets
specialists will continue to remain a distinct category among global
managers. In a rapidly maturing scene, the picture of the sturdy pioneer
with a survival pack who is the first foreign investor to hit town is
becoming rather irrelevant.
Much of the emerging markets investment is now conducted through deals in
the principal financial centres such as New York and London. For instance,
turnover in the American Depositary Receipts of Mexican companies is running
at Dollars 30bn a year.
This shows the scale of the boom. But how robust will the emerging stock
markets prove to be in a more demanding investment climate?
The recent successes have been achieved in the context of a continuous rise
in share prices on Wall Street for more than three years, and a pump-priming
monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, which led to US capital outflows
of well over Dollars 100bn last year into all global securities markets.
When the Fed tightens will there be a dangerous emerging markets panic as
foreigners retreat?
Probably there will not be any serious exodus on the part of the US pension
funds. Mr Ramachandran of Rogers, Casey accepts that there is some concern
among institutional investors over the possibility of a short-term
correction. However, he adds: 'Our investors all realise they went into
these markets for the long term.'
Retail investors who have bought emerging markets mutual funds or (in the
UK) unit trusts could be another matter, however. They have often been
chasing short-term profits: for instance, several unit trusts investing in
south-east Asia achieved 100 per cent-plus returns last year, as did one or
two global emerging markets funds.
In December 1993, net sales of unit trusts in the Far East excluding Japan
sector reached Pounds 114m, and there were also big sales of international
growth funds which include the global emerging markets specialists. Emerging
markets funds may have therefore accounted for something like a fifth of all
unit trust sales for that month.
But these open-ended funds can rapidly go into net redemption when
conditions worsen and investors try to take their profits.
Fund managers are forced to sell at any price to meet the demands of their
investors for immediate cash.
'When the Fed finally hikes US interest rates and slows savings flows to US
mutual funds, some of these emerging markets could experience larger
corrections than New York,' warns Mr David Hale, international economist at
Kemper in Chicago.
In the space of a very few years many third world securities markets have
emerged from volatile obscurity into the mainstream of global investment.
But the emerging markets may not yet have left their often turbulent past
completely behind them.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (3): Technical problems not
insurmountable - Investment barriers and risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in emerging markets is not purely a stock-picking process. As well
as poring over balance sheets, investors must also examine government
regulations, tax rules and the share settlement process before making their
decisions.
The type of restrictions varies from market to market. In China, for
example, foreign investors are only allowed to buy special B shares. There
is a 10 per cent withholding tax on gross income from dividends, interest,
leases of properties, royalties and other China non-source business income.
In Pakistan, according to the GT Guide to World Equity Markets, foreign
investment is not permitted in agriculture, forestry, irrigation, real
estate, radioactive minerals, insurance or health.
A common tactic for international investors is to try to bypass the
regulations. The most frequent route is via global depositary receipts
(GDRs) or American depositary receipts (ADRs), which are traded on principal
stock markets.
According to Mr Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson 'the market generally has
an enthusiasm for ADRs and GDRs. The enthusiasm can be judged by the extent
to which they go to a premium to the underlying shares.'
Dr Arnab Banerji of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets gives a practical
example. 'In Chile, investors face a five-year lock-up clause on their
capital. Profits and dividends can be remitted, after a 10 per cent tax, but
the mechanics are pretty complicated and bureaucratic.' Instead of investing
directly, foreign investors use funds and ADRs, tradeable on the New York
Stock Exchange. 'When you look at the premiums at which the ADRs stand to
the domestic stocks,' says Dr Banerji, 'you can see the price investors are
prepared to pay for liquidity.'
Mr Giles Neville of Schroders says his company is always going to be led by
the custodian. 'We have to have confidence that the custodian has settlement
procedures worked out in the market. We will buy ADRs and GDRs if we cannot
get custody in the local market.'
The restrictions may thus only succeed in driving the capital markets
offshore, rather as US banking regulations in the 1960s led to the
development of the Euromarket. Dr Banerji points to India, where there is a
short-term capital gains tax of 30 per cent. 'Of the Dollars 3bn raised in
India last year, some Dollars 2bn was in the form of global depositary
receipts,' he says. 'If the authorities changed the tax structure, that
money would flow to the domestic market.'
Restrictions can be side-stepped by investing in another, more open, market
which has close ties to the chosen economy. With only a limited number of
Chinese quoted companies, for example, most investors still prefer to gain
access to China via those Hong Kong companies which have strong links with
the People's Republic.
Another favoured tactic is to invest via a fund which has particular tax
privileges. According to Mr King, 'Mauritius has a more favourable tax
treaty with India than the rest of the world. Funds based there avoid the
capital gains tax problem.' Restrictions on ownership can also lead to the
use of a fund by international investors. 'In Korea, the foreign registers
for attractive companies are more or less full,' says Dr Banerji, 'which
means you have to find a fund with a local partner to avoid the constraint.'
Using a fund, which has already received regulatory approval from an
emerging market's authorities, can save a lot of administrative hassle. One
fund manager has commented that its application to invest in India was a 2
1/2 -feet high pile of paper. Another reported that it took more than 70
pieces of paper to settle a trade in Venezuela.
But there is a limit to the use of these devices. 'If people use Mauritius
too much,' says Mr King, 'eventually the Indian authorities will get upset
and close the loophole.' If there are only a limited number of funds in a
market, they can often trade at a premium to asset value, adding an extra
element of risk to the investment decision.
Furthermore, there is a constraint on ADR and GDR premiums, says Mr King.
'Eventually so many ADRs will be issued that the premiums will go down.'
It may be possible to deal with those regulatory and tax problems which are
already in place but, of course, there is always the threat that once
foreign capital has been attracted, countries might impose new regulations.
However, Dr Banerji says: 'The international investment community has
communicated pretty clearly to governments, that if the rules are changed
disadvantageously, they can kiss goodbye to foreign capital for some time.'
The tide towards liberalisation and free markets is certainly running pretty
strongly at the moment and Mr King thinks a general move to tighten
regulations is unlikely. 'The whole evidence is that demand for fresh
capital is so huge that countries are pressured into facilitating the entry
of money,' he says.
And over-burdensome regulations will encourage capital to go elsewhere. The
emerging markets index-makers tend to underweight those markets with
restrictions to reflect the lack of availability of stocks. Given the
tendency of investors to weight their portfolios in relation to the index,
this factor may encourage government to open their markets further.
So although the technical problems involved in investing in emerging markets
can be complex, they are not impossible. The issues of settlement, tax and
possible regulatory changes are all part of the investment decision, says Mr
Neville of Schroders. 'It's a risk control process,' he says.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (1): Funds pour into new growth
regions - While economic progress in the developed countries has slowed
seriously, expansion in the rest of the world has generally been rapid, and
often accelerating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
A potentially dramatic new phase in the development of the global economy,
in which growth is shifting towards poorer countries, is becoming ever more
clearly detectable. It is being matched and stimulated by a massive
strategic move by international investors into the so-called emerging
markets.
It is estimated that last year close to Dollars 40bn was invested in
emerging market equities by international investors, especially Americans;
meanwhile, eurobond issuance by emerging markets borrowers approached
Dollars 30bn.
Although many of the emerging equity markets are still very small, taken
together they now have a capitalisation of some Dollars 1,300bn. For some
asset allocation purposes they can be regarded as constituting the third
largest market in the world, after the US and Japan.
Following the big share price advances typical of 1993, when the average
emerging market equity return was nearly 70 per cent, holdings of emerging
market stocks by foreigners may now be worth Dollars 160bn, according to
Baring Securities.
As for debt instruments, Chase Manhattan estimates that the value of
tradeable emerging market debt is almost Dollars 250bn. Of this a little
over half consists of Brady bonds, the form into which many billions of
dollars in bank loans have been restructured in a securitisation process -
notably in the cases of Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela.
These large and active capital markets have developed in the space of only a
few years. Until the late 1980s many of the Latin American countries were
still insolvent and cut off from the bond market, while international equity
interest in emerging markets was limited to a few specialist investors and
pioneers. Now even the staidest institutional investors are making
significant allocations to what used to be regarded as fringe markets.
The rewards for investors who were quick to spot the potential of emerging
markets have been substantial. The average increase in share prices in
dollar terms since 1990 has been 120 per cent, and secondary market prices
for external debt have doubled over the same period.
Buoyancy in the emerging markets contrasts with the fact that economic
growth in the developed world has slumped seriously as the recession which
first damaged the US transferred to Japan and continental Europe. According
to the OECD, the aggregate growth achieved by its members last year was
about 1 per cent (and zero excluding the US), the worst outturn for the
developed world since the second world war. Growth will only pick up to
around 2 per cent in 1994, says the OECD.
Yet expansion in the rest of the world has generally been rapid, and often
accelerating. China has been generating growth in GNP of 13 per cent, and
although this is surely unsustainable, and according to some is
statistically exaggerated, many south-east Asian nations have maintained
growth in the 6 to 8 per cent range for extended periods.
The output gap between rich and poor countries remains immense - but perhaps
that is also a measure of the growth potential of the developing nations.
China and India today have about a half of the world's population but less
than 10 per cent of output, on conventional measures.
Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging
Markets, enthuses about the potential for the developing countries. 'Three
billion people will have a growth rate of 6 1/2 per cent for the foreseeable
future,' he says. 'It's the biggest investment theme of our time.'
The emerging markets boom can be seen as an inverse consequence of the
slowdown in the developed world. As first the US and then Japan and Europe
have decelerated, surplus savings have been generated. Now the capital is
pouring into the emerging markets. They have always had a surplus of cheap
labour but now they have available imported capital and transferred
technology, too. This potent mixture is producing a surge of economic
growth.
But this is only happening because of the collapse of the barriers which
formerly cut off the developing world. Arguably the global economy is
returning to normal after many years of division and distortion. Suddenly
the late 20th century economy is beginning to look more like that of the
late 19th century. 'These are not so much emerging markets as re-emerging
markets,' says Mr Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities.
There are clear parallels with the late 19th century when Britain, as the
leading industrial nation of the day, began - along with other European
nations - to pump large sums into (especially) North and South America. By
1914, British investors owned 27 per cent of the equity market in the US,
the leading emerging market of the day.
Britain's share of global industrial production tumbled from about a third
in 1870 to only 13 per cent in 1913, while the US expanded its share from 23
to 36 per cent over the same period. A similar transfer of output and
capital now appears to be taking place, although these days the US is on the
other side of the fence.
'Developing country growth rates are set to rise further,' says Mr Sushil
Wadhwahi, international equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. 'It is not
unreasonable to expect the total output in developing countries to exceed
OECD output in the next 10 to 20 years.'
Many of the emerging markets remain the same as a century ago. Mr Howell
points out that the international stocks listed in the first Financial Times
in 1888 included Western &amp; Brazilian Telegraph, Central Uruguay Railway and
Imperial Ottoman Bank.
So why is this shift taking place now? It seems that the political
environment has changed fundamentally. The event that more than any other
symbolised the change was the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soviet communism
collapsed, and with it the model of centralised state economic planning that
had held so many poor country governments in thrall - if only for the
opportunities such an approach provided for the exercise of political power
and the practice of corruption. Most third world nations are now turning to
market-based economic policies, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but with
little practical choice.
There is some irony in that Latin American countries regarded the tearing
down of the Berlin Wall four years ago with dismay. Capital would flood from
western Europe and the US into eastern Europe, they reasoned, and would be
diverted from Latin America because of its financially chequered history.
It has not worked out at all like that. Political clouds still loom over
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, while in the third quarter of
1993 alone US investors poured some Dollars 3.8bn net into Latin American
equities.
Other factors have played an important part. The ending of UK controls on
overseas investment in 1979, for instance, stimulated cross-border flows to
an important degree. In contrast, most Continental European investment
institutions remain shackled by controls.
Now American and, to some degree, Japanese investors are becoming active
buyers of emerging equity markets, seeking better growth prospects than are
available in their sluggish domestic economies.
They are also seeking higher returns in emerging bond markets, as an
alternative to the very low interest rates in their domestic bond markets.
It is all very reminiscent of the approach of the managers of Foreign &amp;
Colonial, Britain's first closed-end investment trust (and after 125 years
now its biggest) when it was floated in 1868. Its Pounds 1m portfolio of
emerging market government bonds yielded 8 per cent, compared with only
about 3 per cent on UK Consols at the time. Now, late 20th century American
pension funds are chasing high returns in much the same way and in much the
same countries. F &amp; C today has its own specialised emerging markets
offshoot, managing assets of Dollars 1.3bn
One other essential condition for the triggering of the newemerging markets
boom was that the Latin American debt crisis should be resolved. The tangle
arising from the misguided bank lending of the 1970s was finally unravelled
in most cases by 1990.
According to the Institute of International Finance in Washington,
commercial banks now hold no more than 40 per cent of emerging markets debt,
down from 55 per cent in the early 1980s. The dangerous concentration of
risks within the banking system has been largely dispersed.
However, six significant debtor states with total commercial bank
liabilities of Dollars 135bn, including Brazil, Peru and Russia, have still
to agree restructuring deals. If and when they do, the scope for activity
through the international capital markets will be still further enhanced.
It is now back to basics in the finance of emerging markets. The theory is
that it is much sounder for the securities markets to finance private sector
organisations than for banks to lend to governments. All the better if
foreign investors can ride alongside domestic investors and thereby gain
political security. This can be achieved through voucher-based privatisation
schemes, as in eastern Europe, mutual fund promotions, as in India, and the
growth of domestic pension schemes, as in Chile.
The US and Japan have matured from emerging to developed status during the
20th century. The emerging markets boom reflects the increasingly confident
view of global investors that many more poor countries will follow the same
path to prosperity during the next few decades.

Monday 7
Clinton presents his budget
The Clinton administration is due to send its 1995 budget to Congress.
President Bill Clinton (left), intent on reducing the federal deficit below
Dollars 180bn in the coming fiscal year, has said that nine of his 14
cabinet-level agencies will have to get by on less. The greatest interest
lies in which programmes get cut and which spared.
The European Parliament holds a plenary session in Strasbourg (to Feb 11).
MEPs are expected to debate the much-delayed Schengen agreement on open
borders, progress on the European Union enlargement negotiations, and the
Herman report on a possible European constitution.
EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. Greece chairs the first EU foreign
ministers' meeting of its six-month presidency (to Feb 8). Items include
former Yugoslavia; efforts to improve trade relations with Russia, Ukraine
and the Baltic states; new rules on the use of trade weapons; and relations
with troubled Algeria.
CFA franc
France's president Francois Mitterrand and prime minister Edouard Balladur
are to meet the leaders of the 13 west and central African countries forced
to devalue their common CFA franc by 50 per cent in January. It was the
first change in parity for the communaute financiere africaine franc since
1948. Discussions take place in in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, after the
funeral of the West African country's late president, Felix
Houphouet-Boigny.
Thorp in court
Greenpeace, the environment pressure group, and Lancashire County Council
make their final attempt to challenge the UK government's decision to grant
a licence to the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria,
north-west England. The verdict of the judicial review in the High Court in
London will be final. Thorp's critics are worried about radioactive
emissions. The government announced its decision to give the go-ahead to the
Pounds 2.8bn plant before Christmas. The licence came into effect on January
17.
Maxwell musical injunction
UK attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, is to apply for an injunction to
stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, a West End show chronicling
the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell. Fears that the show might
prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian,
have prompted the action.
Holidays
Taiwan (markets closed).
Tuesday 8
US health reform plan
The US Congressional Budget Office is due to deliver its verdict on the
financial soundness of the Clinton administration's proposed reforms of the
health care system.
The House Ways and Means Committee also holds its first hearing on the plan
and will discuss the budget office cost analysis.
US-Japanese trade
The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan is to send a delegation to
Washington to call for the opening of Japanese markets ahead of Friday's
summit between Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US president
Bill Clinton.
UK inflation
The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report will be examined for
indications of the authorities' attitude towards base rate cuts. The
inflation picture has improved since the last report in November, so the
tone is expected to be upbeat. However, international interest rate
developments have reduced the likelihood of a UK rate cut.
EU enlargement
European Union foreign ministers continue their meeting in Brussels. The
main topic on the agenda will be the state of the enlargement negotiations
with Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria. Officials are trying to meet the
March 1 deadline for completing the talks.
Works councils
The European Commission is due to approve a plan which dilutes earlier
proposals for mandatory elected works councils in about 1,500 pan-European
companies.
Employers have objected to any mention of minimum requirements for
consultation. Trade union organisations, however, are unhappy at what they
see as a U-turn by the Commission.
Azerbaijan's president, Gaidar Aliyev, visits Turkey. The trip will
demonstrate a warming in relations after disagreement over the proposed
Azeri pipeline project and last year's ousting of pro-Turkish former
president Abulfaz Elchibey.
Armenia's president, Levon Ter Petrossian, makes the first official visit to
the UK by a president of the Republic of Armenia. President Ter Petrossian
will meet the Queen, prime minister John Major and foreign secretary Douglas
Hurd (to Feb 10) . The aim of the visit is to strengthen political and
economic ties between the two countries.
Saleroom
A doll, 64 cm high, is expected to sell at Sotheby's in London for between
Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000. The doll is unique, as Kammer and
Reinhardt, its German manufacturers, apparently made just this one mould in
1909. The previous auction record for a 20th century doll is Pounds 90,200.
Holidays
Taiwan (markets closed).
Wednesday 9
Japan's economic forecast
The Japanese government is due to decide its economic forecast for the
fiscal year 1994. By then, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa may have been
able to present his package of economic stimulus measures, after running
into strong opposition from his coalition partners last week.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to announce the draft 1994 national
budget by Thursday.
Scott inquiry
Sir Robin Butler, Cabinet Secretary and head of the UK Home Civil Service
gives evidence to Scott inquiry into arms exports to Iraq. The judge will
take evidence today and for the rest of the week from Sir Robin, who as
cabinet secretary, is responsible for the conduct of civil servants.
He is expected to be pressed for his views on ministerial accountability and
the responsibility of officials to carry out orders which may go against
government guidelines.
UK Sunday shopping
The shops bill, which liberalises trading laws in England and Wales, may be
sabotaged by an alliance of Labour and Conservative MPs. Ministers fear that
die-hard Tory supporters of the Keep Sunday Special campaign will back a
Labour amendment guaranteeing double time to shop workers. The government
fears other groups would seek similar statutory protection.
City of London
Winning People, a report commissioned by city institutions and the City and
Inner London North Training and Enterprise Council, is due to be published.
It concludes that unless there is a change in management practices, the City
risks losing its position as Europe's premier financial centre.
Desperately seeking Oscar
Hollywood opens for Oscar business with the nominations for the 66th Academy
Awards. Spielberg's Schindler's List is firm Best Film favourite, having won
top honours at the run-up award sprees. If Spielberg himself misses out on
Best Director - which would be Hollywood keeping to its anti-wonderboy
custom - Jane Campion (The Piano) may change history by becoming a woman
winner.
Other bookie's favourites: The Piano's Holly Hunter for Best Actress and any
of an army of Britons for Best Actor. Among them, David Thewlis (Naked) and
double-threat performers Daniel Day-Lewis (The Age Of Innocence, In The Name
Of The Father) and Anthony Hopkins (The Remains Of The Day, Shadowlands).
Holidays
South Korea, Taiwan (Chinese New Year's Eve).
Thursday 10
Hosokawa starts his US trip
Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa leaves for Washington to meet US
president Bill Clinton (to Feb 12). Their session in the White House on
Friday will be the climax of an intense week in US-Japan relations, centring
on trade issues.
The US expects Japan to make big concessions, agreeing to set numerical
targets for the penetration of US goods and services into the Japanese
market. Japan has shown little sign of budging.
US economy
The assumptions and projections underlying the Clinton administration's
budget pronouncements on Monday are laid bare in the report of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers.
Elf privatisation
Deadline for buying shares in the privatisation of the French oil group Elf
Aquitaine. The price of FFr385 (Dollars 65) per share was set last week. Elf
is the largest company to be sold so far in the programme to divest the
state of 21 publicly owned concerns.
Bosnia talks
Peace talks between the three warring parties are due to resume in Geneva
under United Nations-European Union mediation. The three sides appear to
expect no halt to hostilities, so the meeting, if it takes place, is likely
to focus more on confidence building-measures than the future borders of
Bosnia's partition.
Brittan in Turkey
Sir Leon Brittan (left), the European Union commissioner for external
economic affairs, arrives in Turkey for two days of talks. The discussions
will cover Turkish-EU relations and progress towards a customs union, which
is due for completion in 1995.
Tomorrow's Company, the interim report of an inquiry by Britain's The Royal
Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce, is
published.
Carnival begins in German states bordering the Rhine. Many people in the
area will work a half day before starting the festivities, which last until
Tuesday 15. Many business and the federal government in Bonn will be out of
action for the period.
Berlin film festival
The 44th annual celebration of cinematic art begins (to Feb 21). Italian
actress Sophia Loren will be attending to receive a Golden Bear in
recognition of her life's work.
Holidays
China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (Chinese New
Year's Day: the Year of the Dog).
Friday 11
Mandela visits his prison
Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, who is on the campaign
trail, chooses the fourth anniversary of his release from detention to visit
Robben Island prison, where he spent most of his 27 years in jail.
Italian corruption
A trial in Milan is expected to hear evidence from the accused, Sergio
Cusani, financial consultant to the Ferruzzi/Montedison group. Since
November, Cusani has declined to go to the witness stand. He is believed to
hold many secrets relating to the payment of L150bn (Dollars 88m) by
Ferruzzi/Montedison to exit from Enimont, the chemical joint venture with
ENI, the state oil concern.
Strike in Portugal
Public sector unions have called their second 24-hour strike in less than
three weeks to protest at the government's 1994 pay offer of 2.5 per cent,
against forecast inflation of 6 per cent. Public transport, hospitals,
schools and other services will be hit.
Holidays
Japan's National Founding Day (markets closed), China, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (Chinese New Year).
Weekend 12-13
Europe's steelmakers meet
Eurofer, the steelmakers' lobby group, is due to meet on Saturday to discuss
strategy ahead of Monday's discussions on capacity cuts with the European
Commission in Brussels. Private-sector producers have complained that they
are being asked to sacrifice more than state-owned producers.
South African elections
Saturday is the deadline for parties to register for the country's first
all-race elections on April 27. Last week it was still uncertain whether
Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party would agree to take
part.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Prices top out in a volatile environment -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were signs late last Friday that the UK equity market may at last have
topped out as share prices weakened following the Federal Reserve move to
lift short-term interest rates.
The market has become increasingly volatile, as trading activity and the
value of customer and marketmaker business has hit record levels.
Last week saw all the main equity market indices - the FT-SE 100, the Mid
250, the All-Share and the Smaller Companies - race ahead to all-time highs
and, more importantly, to all-time inflation-adjusted records. July 1987 was
the last market peak - two months before it crashed 500 points in two days.
However, towards the end of this week, share prices tumbled, the market
being hyped by a dealer-driven story that a wave of European interest rate
cuts was imminent. This would have produced a burst of buying in equities as
international institutions continued their search for value in a low
interest rate environment.
The Bundesbank council's refusal to cut rates upset the equity market apple
cart, producing a near 50-point swing in the FT-SE 100.
However, there is more to the market's short-term performance than purely
rate cuts. Some see the carrot of lower rates as better for the market than
an actual cut. 'The longer the authorities leave it, the better,' said one
senior trader. 'The minute they cut, this market will slide.'
The equity market's rise this week was once again underpinned by the futures
market. Friday saw a development in the equity market as the OMLX market
introduced its futures and options contract on the Mid 250 index. The Mid
250 has consistently outperformed the senior FT-SE 100 index this year,
rising a startling 9.4 per cent compared with the FT-SE 100's 1.5 per cent.
Much of this rise, traders argue, has been prompted by heavy demand for the
Mid 250 stocks by the big integrated securities houses, which have been
aggressively marketing various covered warrants and derivatives instruments
to their institutional clients. The OMLX launch will be followed by the
London International Financial Futures Exchange, whose Mid 250 futures and
options contracts commence trading on February.
Salomon Brothers, the influential US securities house, and a rampant bull,
rates the UK equity market as its most favoured in Europe, with a year-end
FT-SE 100 target of 3,950. Salomon forecasts base-rate reductions to 4 per
cent, in order to offset fiscal tightening, a strong recovery in earnings
and further increases in institutional and private cash flow in 1994. It
says the UK's public finances are likely to be the strongest in Europe by
1995-96.
The broker expects earnings growth of over 38 per cent for 1993, 16 per cent
for 1994 and 12 per cent for 1995. The risks to the market, Salomon says,
are posed by potential internal strife in the Conservative party.

TOKYO
Trading is expected to remain light with many investors cautious ahead of
the Hosokawa-Clinton meeting in Washington on Friday. Although the Nikkei
index managed to remain above the psychologically important 20,000 level on
Friday, in spite of delays in the announcement of the government's
long-awaited economic stimulus package, some market participants fear the
effects on share prices if the government scales down its tax cuts from the
originally planned Y6,000bn.
Chinese New Year holidays on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will restrict
trading in Asian markets.
PARIS
Private investors have until Thursday to buy shares, or confirm existing
orders, in Elf Aquitaine, the largest company to be privatised so far in the
French government's programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups.
Corporate announcements due this week include figures from UAP, the insurer
and privatisation candidate, which Hoare Govett expects to post a recovery
in net profit to FFr1.9bn.
The market expects a strong recovery at Matra Hachette while some analysts
also expect improved results from Total on Wednesday, in contrast with the
sharp drop recorded at Elf.
MILAN
Shares in Instituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial services group which
was heavily oversubscribed when it was privatised last week, begin trading
on Wednesday. The stock was quoted at L12,600-L12,900 on the grey market
last Friday, compared with the the issue price of L10,900.
STOCKHOLM
Full-year figures come from Ericsson on Thursday. UBS, which expects a 130
per cent rise in net profits, recalls that the group disappointed the market
with its third-quarter results. However, the bank believes that some
expectations are too optimistic. It says investors should remember the
volatility of the shares as US investors sold after the last report. Stora,
Europe's largest forest products group, reports finals tomorrow.
OSLO
Hafslund Nycomed, due to report 1993 results on Friday, is expected to post
higher sales but little changed earnings. Full-year figures are due on
Thursday from Bergesen, the bulk shipping group.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Swaps dealers upset by threat of legislation
 -Risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A prominent US Congressman is proposing a new agency to oversee US
derivatives dealing, a move that some swaps dealers fear would inhibit the
fast-growing industry.
Mr James Leach, the top Republican on the House Banking Committee, has
introduced legislation to set up a Federal Derivatives Commission which
would establish standards for capital, accounting, disclosure and
suitability for institutions dealing in derivatives.
The Commission would co-ordinate the fragmented derivatives oversight of six
US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Comptroller of
the Currency.
The bill has received little support in Washington, but it sets the stage
for a battle between some members of Congress and the derivatives industry
when the re-authorisation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission begins
later this year. Congress gave the CFTC partial oversight of
over-the-counter derivatives in 1992, but promised to revisit the issue this
year.
Mr Leach's bid for a co-ordinating agency echoes recommendations made in
several comprehensive studies of the derivative industry during the past
year. The last of these studies, by the General Accounting Office, the
independent research arm of Congress, is expected later this month.
These studies were sparked by concerns that growing derivatives exposure
among financial institutions was fuelling systemic risk, and that potential
problems may not be spotted because some derivatives operations were
slipping through the regulatory net.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the swaps industry
body, responded to the Leach proposal with a statement that 'some provisions
of the bill may inhibit desirable risk management activity; impose an
inequitable scheme of regulation on derivatives dealers and end-users; and
roll back some of the protections currently afforded market participants in
the event of insolvency'.
Nevertheless, the current regulatory structure, based on divisions between
banking and securities operations, does appear increasingly archaic.
Paribas, the French bank, has introduced an innovative equity-linked
structure to the sterling bond market. On Friday, Paribas launched a Pounds
50m offering of five-year bonds for ABB International Finance, an arm of the
international electrical engineering company. The bonds are convertible into
a cash amount based on the performance of the FT-SE 100 index of UK stocks.
Similar deals, linked to the CAC-40 index, have been launched in the French
market.
The ABB issue is structured to resemble a conventional convertible bond
which can be converted into the shares of a single company. But the investor
is exposed to the FT-SE index, according to a predetermined formula, instead
of an underlying stock. The premium is 20 per cent, and the bonds pay a
coupon of 3 per cent and are priced at par.
The deal was placed mainly in continental Europe among insurance companies
and other financial institutions. Some institutions, which are not allowed
to use derivative products but can buy bonds with embedded derivatives, buy
such bonds for asset allocation.
For ABB, the structure provides cost savings over a conventional financing.
However, the disadvantage for the issuer is that the bonds can be exchanged
at any time after the first year, so the exact term of the financing is
uncertain.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Traders hope the first cut is the deepest -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street may discover this week that it is more pleasant to fret over the
inevitable than to deal with its consequences.
After months of hand-wringing by market observers over the timing of a move
to tighter money, the Federal Reserve finally acted on Friday. In announcing
the move to tighter credit conditions, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
made good on his word. Earlier in the week he told a congressional committee
that the central bank would have to adjust its policy to stamp out incipient
inflationary pressures in the economy.
The timing was somewhat of a surprise, however, as was the extent of the
damage to stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average limped into the weekend
after its worst single-day battering since November 15 1991. The bellwether
blue-chip index tumbled 96 points, or 2.4 per cent, to 3,871.42, led by the
hasty retreat of interest-sensitive financial and utility issues.
The good news is that few analysts expect to see stocks fall as sharply this
week. 'The first cut is always the deepest,' says Mr James Solloway, chief
investment analyst at Argus Research in New York. With plenty of bargains on
offer today, the Dow index may bounce back.
The bad news is that most expect a weak trend over the next month or two, as
the euphoria that has gripped the market since the new year unwinds.
Wall Street has worried about a shift in policy because stocks have thrived
over the past three years in the rarefied atmosphere of Fed accommodation.
In that time, funds have flooded into equities as investors sought higher
returns than other financial instruments could offer. Cheap money has also
made stocks attractive because it has helped lift the earnings potential of
American companies, which have taken advantage of low rates to reduce debt
and buy new equipment.
The question is whether a move to tighter money will finally rein in the
long-running bull market, or at least trigger a 5 per cent to 7 per cent
correction, as many analysts have predicted after Friday's developments.
A conclusive answer is months away, but many analysts believe the key lies
in how soon the Fed tightens again and by how much. 'This is the end of the
beginning,' says Mr David Shulman, chief investment strategist at Salomon
Brothers, 'not the beginning of the end.'
When the Fed acts again depends on economic data still in the pipeline. In
the meantime, trading is expected in a narrow range. The 4,000 barrier
appears a more formidable barrier than just a week ago.
'The market may go down a bit more in the next week or two, but then we'll
sit tight for a while before waiting for these questions about inflation to
be resolved,' says Mr Bill Dodge, an investment strategist at Dean Witter
Reynolds.
The picture may clear somewhat this Friday, when the Commerce Department
releases the January producer price index.

Last week, the Federal Reserve surprised the bond market by tightening
monetary policy as a precautionary move against inflation. The central bank
said it was not so much worried about inflation now, or over the next few
months, but about what inflation might do in the longer term if the economy
continued to grow at its heady pace.
On Friday, fixed-income investors will be able to judge for themselves if
the Fed's optimism about the short-term outlook for inflation is well-placed
when the January producer price index is released.
Wall Street analysts are not expecting the PPI to be as weak as it has been
lately (it posted a fall in December), and some are even forecasting a rise
of as much as 0.6 per cent.
If it is at or above that level, investors could offload more bonds on the
market in the expectation of further rate rises from the Fed. The consensus
forecast for the January PPI is for a 0.3 per cent rise.
The latest retail sales data will be released alongside the PPI report. The
harsh weather is expected to have dampened sales in January, and analysts
are forecasting a fall of between 0.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent, against the
0.8 per cent rise in December.
Attention on Thursday will focus on the year's first auction, of Dollars
11bn in 30-year bonds.

FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Great bull run may have lost steam -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON, TRACY CORRIGAN, MARTIN DICKSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many analysts on Wall Street believe that when the Federal Reserve raised
its Fed funds rate target to 3 1/4 per cent on Friday from 3 per cent, bond
traders sensed that the end had finally come. The end, that is, of a bull
run in the US Treasury market which has lasted more than three years. The
rally has exceeded the expectations of analysts, many of whom were calling
the end of the bull market a year ago.
It is not unexpected: 10-year US bond yields backed up  1/2 a point at the
end of last year, as strong economic data convinced traders that a change in
Fed policy was on the way.
Friday's move may have been the first of several policy tightenings designed
to head off the threat of inflation.
Mr Dick Hoey, a fund manager at mutual funds group Dreyfus, says: 'It could
very easily be a two-stage, 50-basis point rise.' Analysts at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, brokerage firm, believe the next move could come soon.
Investors should 'be wary of a further move within the next few weeks to 3
1/2 per cent'.
Another Wall Street house, Salomon Brothers, expects even bigger rate
increases by the Fed, arguing that 'money market rates and short-term bond
yields will be pushed higher in the next few months as robust economic
growth data will justify additional tightening moves that could total 50-75
basis points by mid-year'.
While the prospect of further tightening is bound to trigger a sell-off, the
longer-term outlook, given continued low-inflation, is favourable for
long-dated bonds.
Salomon believes that upward momentum in long-term Treasury yields will
stall, because investors are likely to adopt the view that the Fed's
vigilant stance against inflation is positive for the bond market.
Longer-dated government securities are less likely to suffer from a
concerted sell-off following further rate rises because bonds have been sold
heavily in recent months in anticipation of such a move.
However, Mr John Lipsky, Salomon's chief economist, says it may be some time
before the benefit of the Fed's actions begin to show through in lower bond
yields. 'This move helps set the stage for an ultimate return of long-term
interest rates, at least in my opinion, to back below 6 per cent. But that's
not likely to occur anytime soon. Quite the contrary, if we're right about
the economic data, over the next few months the risks lie on the other side
 -of higher long-term interest rates.'
Almost everyone agrees that, after several years of a steep yield curve, the
gap between short and long yields will start to close. Mr Dennis Bushe,
managing director of Prudential Investment Advisors, says 'longer term,
there will be a flattening of the yield curve' because markets will gain
confidence from the Fed's pre-emptive strike.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago, is another
who believes that last week's rate rise is positive for longer-dated
government securities. 'It protects the long-end from having a blow out on
the upside. I think if the Fed hadn't tightened you would have seen long
bond yields rising. I think you'd have seen the bond market vigilantes
riding it.'
The negative knock-on effect on the European bond markets could prove
relatively short-lived. True, since the US economic cycle is ahead of
Europe's, the US market offers a taste of things to come. But the fact
remains that the US and Europe are at quite different points in the economic
cycle, and the start of Fed tightening, when European governments are
expected to ease further, means that it no longer makes sense for European
bonds to track the US market.
'We are going to decouple,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at
S. G. Warburg. He believes real interest rates in the US had fallen too low.
For example, real short-term rates in the US are below 1 per cent compared
with 2 1/2 per cent in the UK.
The Fed move leaves room for further tightening of spreads between European
bond markets and the US Treasury markets. In the current low yield
environment, these spread-trades are likely to become an increasingly common
feature of investment management strategy.

FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Turkey searches for central bank chief -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search is on for a central bank governor in Turkey following the
resignation of Mr Bulent Gultekin last week. One man who fancies his chances
is the head of the Treasury, Mr Osman Unsal, a 39-year-old former Citibanker
well-known in the international bond market as the ringmaster of Turkey's
foreign debt programme.
A man with expensive tastes and who favours monogrammed cuffs on his shirts,
Mr Unsal has one advantage over his peers: he can work with the prime
minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller. This is something Mr Gultekin admitted he was
unable to do.
Unlike the former governor, Mr Unsal was quick to grasp that, as far as
economic policy goes, it is Mrs Ciller who calls the shots. But then, she
was his professor at university.
In the wake of last month's liquidity crisis and the subsequent devaluation
of the lira, Mr Unsal will need all his powers of persuasion to win over his
critics, particularly the foreign banks which are reappraising Turkish risk.
His debt plan has been to limit the government's domestic borrowing while
increasing its foreign debt in an effort to edge down domestic interest
rates. He has argued that the high level of domestic debt has been the main
reason for Turkey's runaway budget deficit and inflation.
He has shifted the emphasis from syndicated loans to bond issues. Having
secured an investment-grade rating in 1992 from Moody's and Standard &amp;
Poor's, the two leading credit rating agencies, Turkey has frequently tapped
the Samurai market, Japan's domestic market for foreign borrowers, and has
also issued Eurobonds in D-Marks and sterling.
His strategy has helped diversify the investor base and improve the maturity
and term structure of the national debt. The move may have curbed the
volatility in debt servicing but the debt has risen rapidly. Total external
borrowing - public and private - has increased to an estimated Dollars 64bn
at the end of last year from Dollars 54bn at the end of 1992 and is forecast
to reach Dollars 68bn in 1995.
The policy has been driven by twin imperatives - to maintain reserves at a
time of a large current account deficit and to avoid overloading the
domestic capital market. Domestic rates have eased through much of 1993,
helped by the decrease in domestic borrowing. In addition, the government
cancelled the regular Wednesday auction of bills nine times in the past
three months in an attempt to make the banks take longer-term paper.
Sticking to this policy has required some nerve. On one occasion Mr Unsal
telephoned to cancel the weekly auction while in mid-air to Japan, promising
worried Treasury colleagues that he would return with 'a suitcase full of
money'.
This 'can-do,' sometimes cavalier, approach may have won him Mrs Ciller's
admiration, but it has worried a number of Turkish and foreign economists.
Some maintain it may have contributed to Turkey's recent currency crisis.
Certainly, the catalyst for the run on the lira was the decision by the two
rating agencies to downgrade Turkey's credit rating, in Moody's case to
sub-investment grade. But by cancelling the auctions, the government
deprived itself of one tool with which to control liquidity. When the
Treasury also resorted to increasing advances from the central bank to
finance the budget, the result was a market awash with lira.
To bolster the lira, the authorities raised rates sharply. Interest on
three-month bills rose to 99 per cent last week while interbank rates
touched 600 per cent. What is more, the devaluation, which adds to Turkey's
debt servicing, has put budget projections further out of kilter.
While most of the government appears dazed by the events of the past two
weeks, Mr Unsal has not lost his stride. This month, Turkey will raise a
further Dollars 750m equivalent in the Samurai market. It intends to launch
its first offering of global bonds which is expected to raise up to Dollars
1bn.
How Mr Unsal salvages the situation is hard to predict. He has few friends
within Turkey's powerful civil service. Many senior civil servants, jealous
of his meteoric rise up the ranks thanks to Mrs Ciller's patronage, want him
to be replaced.
He does not have much support in parliament either. Members of parliament
foiled an attempt by Mrs Ciller to secure him the job as head of the
Treasury by drafting a special decree citing the rulebook on civil service
appointments. This tactic showed up that Mr Unsal's years in the civil
service were not sufficient to warrant such a senior position. Today he is
still only acting under-secretary for the Treasury and foreign trade.
However, to those who know him, his political ambition remains as strong as
ever. As one former Citibank colleague put it: 'He was the only one of us
who had a career plan and I don't think his plan is over'.

Gilts are likely to face a difficult week after the gloomy news on
international interest rates. The Bundesbank's decision to leave rates
unchanged and the Fed's move to tighten US monetary policy seem to have
reduced the prospects of a cut in UK
rates.
Debate will concentrate on whether the Fed move is a turning point and
heralds the end of the long bull market in international bonds. Gilt
sentiment may accordingly be dominated by the reaction of the US and German
government bond markets.
Gilt enthusiasts will emphasise the positive UK economic background and the
level of real yields which are relatively high, in historical term. Bears
may see worrying signs in the government's easy acceptance of the public
sector pay deal.
With little UK economic news to go on, the week's main event will be the
Bank of England's inflation report, out on Tuesday. This is likely to
present a benign view of inflation, especially as the outlook has improved
since the last report in November.
However, last week's Treasury monetary report painted an upbeat picture of
economic growth, indicating that the Bank may keep rates unchanged for the
moment. A March/April cut, to soften the impact of the forthcoming tax
package, continues to be favoured by the markets.

Fortunes of the German bund market are closely tied to those of US markets
and the Federal Reserve's move to tighten interest rates on Friday will have
repercussions for German government securities.
In addition to digesting the US move, the bund market will be looking for
domestic signs that the Bundesbank will be able to resume cutting interest
rates at the next meeting of its policy-making council on February 17.
Positive developments on the wage front - particularly in respect of
engineering workers who are today resuming talks for a settlement in the
state of North-Rhine Westphalia - will encourage hopes that the Bundesbank
will cut rates.
Equally important will be the nature of the German central bank's security
repurchase operations tomorrow. After months in which the Bundesbank has
fixed the repo rate at 6 per cent, a move to a variable tender auction -
allowing banks to determine money market rates via their bidding - is likely
to be interpreted as a signal that the Bundesbank is preparing itself for a
cut in the discount rate.
If there is a cut there should be a reversal of some of the downwards price
pressure which has afflicted government bunds since December's poor money
supply data were released last Thursday.

The implications of high bond issuance following the government's plan to
reduce income tax will continue to weigh heavily on bond prices this week.
Although politicians are still haggling over the financing of the tax cut
after the first three years of its implementation, it is likely that the
first few years will need to be funded by short-term government bonds.
The Socialist Democratic Party's opposition to a rise in the sales tax in
1997 may mean that the period where the tax cut will be funded by government
bonds may be longer than expected. Aside from the tax cut, the Y9,100bn
spending by the government will increase bond supply.
If long-term yields remain at current levels this week, the long-term credit
banks are expected to raise long-term prime rates, or long-term lending
rates for first-tier clients.
A sharp sell-off of bonds may be limited by the Bank of Japan. In order to
prevent long-term yields from plunging, the central bank last week led
short-term money market rates lower through its money market operations.
However, with only six weeks left until the March year-end, institutional
investors are unlikely to increase their positions, and the market is
expected to fluctuate on light trading within a narrow range.

Strategy
The rise by the US Federal Reserve late on Friday of interest rates caused
little surprise among most emerging market strategists.
Mr Kevin Smith, a fund manager of Foreign and Colonial in London, commented
just after the announcement that he did not expect the impact on Asian
equity markets today to trigger a major sell-off. However, he said that the
most vulnerable markets would be those with dollar exposure, such as Hong
Kong, Thailand and Malaysia.
Russia
The government minister responsible for the privatisation programme has said
that he hopes it will proceed, in spite of the country's political
difficulties. The privatisation process started in late-1992, when vouchers
were distributed which could be swapped for shares in state firms. Several
oil and energy enterprises, a big car plant in Ulyanovsk, and the
Novorossiisk shipping company are among the companies to be opened to public
ownership.
Zimbabwe
The country's equity market remained strong last week - the industrial index
almost attaining the 3,100 level - with some analysts forecasting that 4,500
would be breached this year.
Mining shares have attracted investors with the sub-index also setting a new
record high. Financial reforms, which were announced at the start of this
year, falling inflation and lower interest rates have also underpinned the
market.
SE Asia
Union Bank of Switzerland has signed a joint venture agreement with Finance
One, the Thai financial services group.
UBS will acquire 15 per cent of the expanded capital of Finance One's
subsidiary, Thana One Finance and Securities. The price was not announced,
but stockbrokers in Bangkok said UBS would pay Bt300m (Dollars 11.8m) for
the first 5 per cent tranche.
Bolivia
A privatisation programme is in the early stages, with the government of
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada planning to sell-off six state
companies.
Under the scheme investors, to be selected by an international bidding
process, are expected to take up to half the equity in each company at no
cost, but would then have to invest in them. The remaining equity would be
divided among local investors, and kept in private pension funds.
Seoul
Standard Chartered reports that the stock exchange will be seeking a 40 per
cent deposit from institutional investors - including foreigners - before a
purchase order for shares is made. This measure has been imposed in an
effort to cool the market which, according to IFC data, rose 10 per cent in
dollar terms last month.
East Europe
Another fund has been launched to tap the investment potential of central
and eastern European countries. CS First Boston and Cazenove are seeking to
invest in listed companies, and the Dollars 200m fund is expected to be the
biggest of its kind.
Some Dollars 150m is expected to come from international institutions, and
the rest from the retail community.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Strong dollar to dominate markets -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong dollar will dominate foreign exchange markets this week after
Friday's tightening of monetary policy by the US Fed caused a sharp rise in
the US currency.
Focus will now shift to the Bundesbank to see how the it responds.
The D-Mark lost more than 3 pfennigs to trade on Friday evening around the
DM1.76 level.
The Bundesbank has recently been under pressure to cut rates, but the
strength of the dollar will have made it more difficult to ease policy.
Although the D-Mark weakened against most ERM cur-rencies on Friday, it may
benefit this week from a flight into quality as investors respond to the
greater un-certainty by abandoning some of the weaker ERM curren-cies such
as the Spanish peseta.
Analysts cautioned that markets should not get too bearish about the
prospects for European currencies after the US move.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ, said conditions in Europe remained
very disinflationary, and there was still scope for these countries to ease
monetary policy. The market has recently responded positively to rate-cuts
in Spain, Belgium and Denmark.
Mr Hannah said he felt the market had been too pessi-mistic in its reaction
to the US news. Interest rate futures in the UK, Germany and France all fell
sharply on Friday's news. The June contracts in the UK and France, for
example, both fell by seven points.
Attention will switch back to the US on Friday for the release of the
important Producer Price figure. If it is low, it will show that the Fed has
acted in a pre-emptive fashion and that raising rates is a real tightening.
Less bullish for the currency would be a high PPI number suggesting that the
Fed was responding to inflationary pressures.
Also in the spotlight will be the Canadian dollar, which plummeted on Friday
after Mr Paul Martin, the Canadian finance minister, said their interest
rates might go lower than those in the US. Traders said the central bank was
forced to intervene to stabilise the currency. Observers said there was a
real prospect of the Canadian currency going into free fall this week.
Another area of attention will be Japan/US relations with President Clinton
and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, scheduled to meet for
trade talks in Washington on Friday.

FT  07 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Warning bells for Thai convertibles - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past nine months, European investors wanting to profit from
south-east Asia's equities boom while protecting themselves from the worst
of the dangers of a market crash have been enthusiastic buyers of
convertible Eurobonds issued by large Thai companies and quoted in London.
The primary market in such bonds - which are usually denominated in US
dollars and convertible into shares at a fixed value above the current share
price - is likely to reach a peak in the next few months before tailing off
towards the end of the year.
Liberated by new financial services laws, Thai companies raised the
equivalent of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) through these so-called
euroconvertible debentures in 1993, but the country's regulatory authorities
have begun to sound warning bells about the risks of issuing too many bonds
in too short a time.
Next in line is Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank and a prime blue chip
company, which plans to raise between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m through
a convertible bond issue to expand its capital base.
Bangkok Land, the country's biggest property company, has already gone to
the convertible bond market for Dollars 130m, but wants to raise a further
Dollars 600m. Thai Airways International is also considering an issue of
about Dollars 200m.
The convertible bonds of blue chip Thai companies are popular with investors
 -especially the cautious Swiss who hesitate to invest directly in volatile
equity markets, stockbrokers say - because the right to convert into shares
gives the holder the chance to profit from a rising stock price with only
limited exposure (in the form of a falling bond price) to the risks of a
decline.
Even if one discounts the equity conversion 'sweetener,' usually the main
attraction of such issues, the interest rates paid by the Thai bonds
(usually between 3 and 5 per cent) provide a satisfactory return compared
with US dollar rates elsewhere. There is also an active secondary market.
Thai companies favour the bonds over domestic bank borrowing because they
can obtain funds at a fixed rate of interest and at less than half the
present cost of a bank loan in Thai baht. The main disadvantage, from their
point of view, of the bond is the future dilution of their stock when
conversion rights are exercised - although because the conversion is at a
premium to the current share price the dilution is smaller than if stock was
issued at current prices.
In recent weeks, however, brokers and government officials in Thailand have
expressed concern about the dangers of the put options which many Thai
issuers - nine out of 17 in 1993 - have added to the bonds to reassure
potential investors.
The put option allows the holder to redeem a bond early - typically after
five years for a 10-year bond - at a fixed price at a premium to the issue
price. Holders would normally exercise this right if the share price failed
to rise enough to merit a conversion into shares.
A put option makes a bond more saleable, but the company faces the
possibility of having to repay the entire bond issue on the put option
exercise date, a situation which caused severe financial difficulties for
some British companies after the 1987 stock market crash.
Some brokers say it is hard to imagine Thai stock prices failing to rise
enough in five years to reach the conversion price. Conversion premiums over
the price at the time of issue are rarely more than 20 per cent, and many
holders of bonds issued last year by Land and House, the property developer,
have already converted following the surge in the Thai stock market.
Other brokers are more cautious. 'Thai companies have this optimistic view
that their share prices will always go up and up,' says one foreign
stockbroker in Bangkok. It has been suggested that auditors should force
companies to set aside reserves each year as if the put payments will have
to be met on the due date, but the idea is unlikely to be adopted in
Thailand and undermines the purpose of borrowing the money in the first
place.
Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission is worried not only about the
risks to companies of the put options but also about the country's finances.
'Many of them (the bonds) are bunching up, particularly the ones with put
options,' says Mr Rapee Sucharitakul of the SEC. 'It could affect the inflow
and outflow of capital from the country if we're not careful.'
The SEC has drafted a new regulation which should come into force within
weeks to oblige companies to improve their disclosure on the effects of
convertible bond issues. The companies will have to explain to shareholders
both the potential earnings dilution effects of the issue and the possible
results of early repayment of the debt. They will also have to inform the
Bank of Thailand about new issues.
After a few more big issues, the ardour among both issuers and buyers for
new convertible Thai eurobonds is likely to cool.
Most Thai companies with sufficient standing to raise money in this way have
either issued bonds or announced their intention to do so, and a rise in US
interest rates would make such instruments less attractive for the borrower.
Furthermore, the market in London might, in the words of one broker, 'be
getting slightly saturated'. Some Thai convertibles are already trading at a
small discount to their issue price.
'We're going to see fewer and few issues from the second half of this year,'
says one investment banker in Bangkok. 'But there will be a continuing
trickle and an active secondary market. Then in a few years we're going to
have the refinancing issues.'

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Markets: Fed blows off market froth - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next few days will be tense as the world waits to see just how serious a
sell-off develops in stock and bond markets following Friday's surprise
tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve.
Despite Friday's 96 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the
bank's  1/4 percentage point increase in the Fed funds rate seems unlikely
to kill off the global financial bull - though it will certainly blow away a
lot of speculative froth from the beast, and that is no bad thing.
The first Fed tightening in five years is a long-term positive for the US
economy and its stock and bond markets. With America leading the world out
of recession, a turn in the US interest rate cycle was inevitable. Only the
timing and degree of tightening were in doubt.
By taking Wall Street by surprise, with a rise in rates so small it will not
jeopardise growth, the Fed has underlined its inflation fighting credentials
 -at a time when it was in danger of losing them - and may prolong the
current economic expansion.
The recent resignation of two inflation hawks, Mr David Mullins and Mr Wayne
Angell, from the Fed board had raised questions about the bank's resolve at
a time when speculative funds were starting to flow into traditional
inflation hedges, such as commodities.
And by taking the unusual step of formally announcing its action - rather
than leaving the market guessing - Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may
have ameliorated criticism in Congress over the bank's secrecy.
The tightening, at a time when many Wall Street analysts said one was not
yet necessary, suggests the Fed expects first quarter GDP growth to come in
ahead of the consensus forecast, which stands at about 3 per cent.
Mr David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial, who welcomes the Fed
move as a 'stitch in time,' thinks GDP may be growing by as much as 4 per
cent.
So the Fed's pre-emptive action may have prevented a sharp rise in long bond
rates some months down the road, accompanied by a severe tightening, which
would have had much more serious consequences for market confidence than
Friday's move.
US Treasuries may have further to fall over the next few weeks, but the
tightening means they should not move too far from their current trading
range. The Fed, in other words, may have put a floor under the bond market.
Bonds could even rally later in the year. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at
Salomon Brothers, reckons that a combination of moderate economic growth,
low inflation, a falling Federal deficit and sluggish international growth
could push long bond yields below 6 per cent again, though that is a
minority view.
Equities
It is hardly surprising that the Fed's move should have knocked some
stuffing out of the equity market. After the sharp run up of the past few
weeks US stocks are very generously valued by historic standards. And turns
in the interest rate cycle have traditionally been accompanied by market
corrections.
However, this cycle is different in one important respect: the explosive
growth of the mutual fund industry. US households have moved a large
proportion of their liquid assets from bank deposits and money market funds
into mutual funds in a search for higher returns, as US interest rates have
fallen in recent years.
Over the past year these funds have moved large amounts of money into
overseas markets, triggering huge increases in valuations in volatile,
illiquid emerging markets.
A key question now is the extent to which these investors take fright at
falling equity prices and pull funds from the market, thus accentuating its
fall; or repatriate funds to the US in the expectation that Friday's sharp
rise in the dollar is symptomatic of a long period of appreciation; or move
cash back into money funds as interest rates rise.
A mere 25 basis points on Fed funds is in itself not going to trigger such
action, but many Wall Street analysts think further tightening could push
the rate to between 3.5 and 4 per cent by the end of this year. The Fed will
need to move gingerly in the months ahead if it is not to spook the equity
markets. That said, a slowdown, if not reversal, of the flow of cash into
the mutual fund industry is to be welcomed, since it may deflate a worrying
speculative bubble.
At least, the Fed's action will slow the upward momentum of both US and
foreign equity markets, since any increase now will have to be based on
higher earnings potential, rather than driven by market liquidity. That
bodes fairly well for the US, where corporate profits are rising healthily.
Europe may fare less well, and some of the most speculative Third World
markets could lose a great deal of fizz.
GM and Ford
The importance of strong earnings potential should be underlined this week
when America's two largest car manufacturers, General Motors and Ford Motor,
announce fourth quarter results. Both are expected to produce greatly
improved profits, following the example set by cross-town rival Chrysler in
January.
So is it time for investors to take profits and lighten holdings of US
automotive stocks, which have outperformed the market over the past year,
with GM and Chrysler up by more than 50 per cent, and Ford up by 38 per
cent?
Almost certainly not. For the auto companies are in the early stages of a
cyclical upswing as cheap loan rates and rising consumer confidence push up
US sales of cars and light trucks. The industry expects sales to peak in
about 1996-97 at approximately 17m units a year - beating the 16m record set
in 1986 - which allows a window of perhaps 18 months for the shares to
outperform the market.
Sales are expected to rise 7 per cent this year, to about 14.8m vehicles,
and the pace could prove even stronger. So far the recovery has lagged
previous upturns, and there are an abnormally high number of rust-buckets
cruising America's highways which are likely to be replaced.
Rising demand means Detroit can reduce the large discounts it has had to
offer to shift vehicles from dealers' forecourts, while the rise in the yen
(now going into reverse) has helped make Japanese cars more expensive than
their US rivals (the price differential averages about Dollars 2,500), which
has helped Ford and Chysler win big market share gains.
Add to this large gains in Detroit's efficiency (due to the twin challenges
of recession and Japan), together with some upturn in the European market in
1995, and you have a recipe for a sharp rise in profits. Ford looks the most
attractive of the trio in 1994. Its earnings have not reflected its strong
market share gains in recent quarters, but that may be about to change.
Market Mania
With immaculate timing, The Bank Credit Analyst, the Montreal-based research
firm, has just issued a strong warning about the rush into mutual funds and
emerging markets, and forecasts that this 'financial mania' will end in a US
market correction of between 10 and 15 per cent.
It points out that the shift into mutual funds is finite and will stop when
bank deposits have been reduced to a core level. Then, which may be soon,
the equity market will be particularly vulnerable.
However, the Analyst argues that any correction will probably be
short-lived. The bull will revive, partly because Europe will follow
America's move into mutual funds as interest rates there continue to fall.
To support this idea, it points to a close historic correlation between US
and UK household holdings of securities.
It is an interesting theory, though it perhaps gives too little weight to
Europe's traditional lack of enthusiasm for equity investments, which
contrasts sharply with American shareholder democracy.
The Analyst sees non-US mutual fund investment propping up the bull market
for a couple more years, before the mania ends in a 'climactic blow-off.' Of
such stuff - and not a   1/4 point on Fed funds - are market nightmares
made.

FT  07 FEB 94 / The Markets: Race for top job raises profile of the OECD -
Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has seemed the cinderella of the international bodies set up
after the second world war to help manage the global economy.
Without the financial largesse of the World Bank, the intimidating
prescriptive mandate of the International Monetary Fund or the high profile
negotiating role of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it has been
easy to dismiss the 24-nation OECD as a mere talking shop, tucked away in
one of the more desirable residential areas of Paris.
But suddenly there is a rush of high level candidates for the OECD's top
job, which falls vacant in September.
As soon as the UK government disclosed last week that Lord Lawson, the
former chancellor, was seeking the post, others came forward or confirmed
long nurtured ambitions to be OECD secretary general.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the French diplomat who has held the post since 1984,
confirmed that he would seek another five-year term. Already in the field
was Mr Donald Johnston, a little-known former middle ranking Canadian
economics minister, who has been given assurances of US support. Germany put
forward Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior economics ministry official, who has
been closely involved with the OECD since 1987.
At first sight, the story might seem a familiar one of the great and good
jockeying for a comfortable, well paid tax-free post in one of the world's
more agreeable capitals. But the global economy is in a period of profound
and radical change and the OECD, which exists to promote co-operation among
its industrial member states, is swept up in these developments.
How its shareholders respond to the choice of candidates will determine how
the organisation evolves into the next century. The British argue that Lord
Lawson is the ideal candidate. Officials make much of his vast experience
and suggest that the OECD has adopted too low a profile under Mr Paye. With
Lord Lawson in charge, they say, the organisation would be given a new sense
of direction.
It is indisputable that Lord Lawson is fascinated by public policy issues.
Although the last years of his chancellorship were marred by rising
inflation and cabinet discord, his tax reforms were bold and innovative. He
moved decisively to strengthen the UK economy through micro-economic
measures and apparently feels that other industrialised countries could
benefit from this experience. As chancellor, he was active on the
international stage and has since become involved with central and eastern
Europe - also a preoccupation of the OECD.
The British government also has an obvious, but unstated desire to increase
high level UK representation in international organisations and so dilute
France's dominant hold over such posts.
In promoting Lord Lawson's candidacy there is a clear presumption in
Whitehall that the OECD needs a high profile, heavyweight political figure
in charge who can knock heads together if necessary.
But does it? Political clout is a necessary adjunct to negotiating with and
among governments, and is very important when an organisation has money to
disburse. It is helpful in the cases of the IMF managing director and World
Bank president. Mr Peter Sutherland's political background and experience
served him well as GATT director general in the final stages of the Uruguay
Round trade negotiations.
But it is not so self evident that the OECD secretary general needs to be a
political heavyweight. The OECD has no big money to dispense. More than 75
per cent of its FFr1.58bn (Pounds 170m) annual budget is expenditure on
personnel and pensions for its 1,900 staff. Its work involves policy
analysis, gathering statistics and organising meetings. Publications are the
main tangible result of its efforts.
Some OECD countries actually favour its low profile, arguing that the
organisation should think of itself as the wholly-owned subsidiary of its 24
industrial member governments. They value the non-partisan analysis of the
OECD secretariat, which can cover issues ranging from macro-economics to
trade, the environment, education, health and technological change.
This does not mean the OECD cannot be innovative. The organisation's work in
the 1980s in assessing the cost of agricultural subsidies was a genuine
breakthrough that helped bring the GATT talks to a successful conclusion.
The OECD has also changed rapidly, forging close links with eastern Europe
and the fast developing countries of east Asia and Latin America. One result
is that its work on eastern and central Europe has expanded to account for
10 per cent of its activities as measured by the budget compared with
nothing four years ago.
The accompanying charts show how the industrial world's share of global
output has declined since the early post war years. But instead of
diminishing interest in the OECD, this shift of economic power has triggered
growing awareness of the organisation among non-member states. Membership
negotiations are underway with Mexico. South Korea would also like to join,
as would Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic.
Last week, Mr Paye cited the list of aspiring member states in support of
his own candidacy and as evidence that the organisation must be doing
something right.
That view will not guarantee his re-selection. There will be much horse
trading in the months ahead, and there is a strong feeling in the US that
the OECD has been a European fiefdom for too long.
But at present, with one strong political candidate against three eminences
grises, the odds seem weighted against the organisation taking a radical
change of direction.
This is Peter Norman's last notebook until after Easter when he returns from
sabbatical.

FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: Two businessmen in rival bids
for Portuguese bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two Portuguese entrepreneurs are lining up rival bids of more than Es100bn
(Dollars 574m) to wrest control of Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), a leading
Portuguese retail bank, from Banesto, the crisis-hit Spanish bank.
The bids emerged following indications that Portuguese authorities may
require Banesto to dispose of half its 50 per cent holding in BTA, which
contravenes legislation limiting foreign ownership of the bank to 25 per
cent.
Potential investors believe Banesto may sell part or all of its stake in BTA
to help bolster its depleted debt to assets ratios.
Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portugal's finance minister, said he welcomed the
proposals to re-establish Portuguese control of BTA. He has asked the public
prosecutor's office to determine whether there are grounds for legal action
to force Banesto to dispose of 25 per cent of BTA.
The Spanish bank is believed to have acquired its shareholding in BTA by
funding Portuguese companies to buy equity on its behalf.
Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a Portuguese entrepreneur, has told the Lisbon
government that he has raised Es50bn as the basis for a bid to acquire 51
per cent of BTA. The bank's current capitalisation on the Lisbon stock
market is about Es200bn.
However, Mr Champalimaud believes it will not be difficult to find partners
to mobilise Es100bn or so for the takeover bid.
Mr Jose Jose Manuel de Mello, head of a large industrial and financial
group, has informed the Portuguese government of plans to make a similar bid
for control of BTA.
The two entrepreneurs count on acquiring both part of Banesto's holding in
BTA and the 13 per cent of its capital that is held by the state following
the bank's partial privatisation in 1989.
The government said the state would only dispose of its remaining holding
when a stable shareholder framework that complied with Portuguese law was
established for BTA.
Banco Comercial Portuguese, a privately-owned retail bank, is believed to be
another potential bidder for a controlling stake in BTA. It has yet to
register an official proposal with the Portuguese authorities.
