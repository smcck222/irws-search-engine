FT  03 FEB 94 / BNF urges government to guarantee costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has told the government that it will be unable to
secure Pounds 19bn of reprocessing contracts without a government guarantee
against unexpected costs.
The state-owned fuel reprocessing company has been trying for four years to
conclude long-term deals to treat waste fuel from the UK's two nuclear power
utilities. But Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are refusing to agree
unless the government protects them against unforeseen cost increases.
In a section of the company's annual report yesterday headed 'fundamental
uncertainty' the auditors Ernst &amp; Young said that if such government
financial support were not to be obtained, 'the assumptions on which these
accounts have been prepared would be rendered invalid'.
The contracts hold the key to the future of BNF, which recently received the
go-ahead to start its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
Ernst &amp; Young, said that the company 'regards government financial support
in the form of underwriting to be a prerequisite to the completion of these
contracts'. The accounts were drawn up on the assumption of a government
guarantee.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which a year ago withdrew an earlier
commitment to underwrite the contracts, said yesterday that it was
considering BNF's request.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it may challenge BNF's accounts on
the basis that the government may not agree to the underwriting.
The accounts also revealed that the year-long delay in approval for Thorp
helped depress BNF's 1992-93 profits to less than half their previous year's
level. BNF reported profits of Pounds 76m for the year to March 31, against
Pounds 161m for the previous year. Turnover was marginally down at Pounds
1.05bn from Pounds 1.08bn. The results were at the lower end of analysts'
expectations. The dividend to the government was halved to Pounds 26m.
Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability in 1993-94 to be
similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay playing an even greater
role in the result. He said the Thorp effect last year was Pounds 18m but
this year it would be about Pounds 90m.
BNF said Thorp was not the only reason for the profit downturn. Profits had
been depressed by Pounds 30m as a result of the nine-week shutdown in 1992
of Magnox reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria. A further Pounds 40m was an
advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's enrichment
assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco. Restructuring costs
were put at Pounds 20m.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Rivers watchdog warns on pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pumping water out of abandoned mines in the Durham coalfield, which costs
British Coal Pounds 1m a year, must continue in order to avoid a serious
pollution threat to the River Wear, the National Rivers Authority warned
yesterday.
The river pollution watchdog said new information and results from
observation boreholes had led consultants to revise upwards their estimates
of the volume of polluted mine water which would enter the Wear should
pumping cease.
British Coal maintained pumping at nine places in central County Durham,
where deep mining ended long ago to protect coastal pits, which were the
Durham coalfield's last collieries. But with the pits' recent closure, it
now has no operational need to maintain the pumping network.
The NRA statement, based on research by consultant Wardell Armstrong, has
implications for the coal privatisation programme. Prospective purchasers
have warned the government that the historical liabilities of mining are
hampering sale prospects.
The authority yesterday joined a growing number of organisations expressing
concern that the coal bill does not spell out the new Coal Authority's
responsibility for the legacy of past mining including mine water pollution.
The government has said that the authority will take on these
responsibilities 'to the extent that they are not taken over by the private
sector'.
Wardell Armstrong estimates that if the central Durham pumping stops, 7.26m
gallons of mine water a day will eventually pour into the River Wear. Its
earlier estimate was 4.5m gallons.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Major pledges more cash for science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Science enjoyed an unaccus-tomed day in the political limelight yesterday.
Mr John Major made his first big speech on science as prime minister -
promising to give research more money next year and a 'high priority' in
future spending plans.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister responsible for science, used a Commons
debate on research to announce that Pounds 15.4m would be allocated in
1994-95 to several initiatives including a scheme to encourage researchers
to collaborate with industry.
Some of the shine was taken off these announcements last night, however,
when Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, announced that
his department's chief adviser on science and technology would not be
replaced when he leaves next month.
Speaking to the parliamentary and scientific committee, Mr Major said that
science and engineering had 'too often been undervalued' in Britain.
'In the past 18 months we've done more to redefine science policy than in
the last 20 years,' he said. 'We have set a long-term course and now we must
hold to it.'
Mr Waldegrave said the government would know by the end of April which of
its research establishments are suitable for privatis-ation.
He said a specialist team had already begun a review and would be
recommending candidates for privatisation. Where privatisation was not
considered appropriate, the team would suggest more efficient working
arrangements. 'It is essential that Britain does not waste resources on
out-of-date structures,' he said.

In a Commons debate on research, Mr William Waldegrave, minister responsible

several initiatives, including a competitive scheme to encourage researchers
to collaborate with industry. He said the government would know by the end

privatisation.
Mr Waldegrave said a specialist team had already begun a review and would be
recommending candidates for privatisation. Where privatisation was not

arrangements. 'It is essential that Britain does not waste resources on
out-of-date structures,' he said.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour spokesman on science, warned that the 'uprooting
of institutions' through privatisation and contracting out would undermine
staff morale.
The most innovative new scheme is for competitive research grants - called
Rewarding Our Potential Awards after the title of last year's white paper on
science.

FT  03 FEB 94 / CBI warns Labour on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party was warned by the Confederation of British Industry last
night that its plans to close tax loopholes would have damaging consequences
for investment, growth and employment.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI president, said measures proposed by Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, would raise an additional Pounds 3.6bn from business
over two years. That would represent an increase of almost 25 per cent in
the current corporation tax yield, which Labour would use for higher public
spending or lower personal taxes.
In CBI News, Mr Howard added: 'That kind of switch is precisely what the
economy does not need at a time when investment is historically low, and
consumption, both personal and public, correspondingly high.'
Mr Davies added that many of the measures proposed by Labour were also
individually objectionable. It would remove carry-forward and carry-back
provisions and reverse the introduction of the foreign income dividends
scheme.
In addition the proposed windfall tax on privatised utilities' profits would
probably push up charges to business users and also lead to cut-backs in
investment programmes.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Major masks fury with US: Sinn Fein leader's visit to New
York sours relationship with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday launched a concerted attempt to paper over deep
cracks in the Anglo-American relationship in the wake of Mr Gerry Adams'
visit to New York.
As Mr Major - who is to visit Washington this month - moved, officials were
desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the
almost unchallenged access to the US media which the Sinn Fein president
enjoyed for 48 hours.
But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at President Bill
Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams.
Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior official said the
Anglo-US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'.
In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at
President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers.
One senior minister said the president appeared to have put UK/US relations
and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate
the US's vocal Irish-American lobby.
The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to
Mr Adams by the US media, and by the lack of balancing comments from Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said:
'Douglas Hurd worked his arse off to get himself on American television
screens. He has been pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided
that Gerry Adams is more interesting.'
The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a broad hint from
Mr Raymond Seitz, the US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton
not to allow Mr Adams into the US.
Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on
Tuesday as part of a diplomatic drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance
himself from Sinn Fein. 'There was a big tussle in my government about
this,' Mr Seitz added.
He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the US would 'act as an encouragement for
him to renounce violence and condemn it when it occurs. We will have to wait
and see'.
The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British
ambassador to Washington.
Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore fruit in Mr
Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the Anglo/Irish joint
declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy'
to Belfast.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Six consortia to bid for West Coast rail study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six consortia have been shortlisted to carry out a feasibility study for the
Pounds 500m modernisation of the main west coast railway line, Railtrack,
the company which will manage British Rail's track, announced yesterday.
More than 40 groups bid to carry out the study into improvements to the
480-mile line linking London with Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and
Glasgow, including re-signalling and straightening the route, said Mr Gil
Howarth, Railtrack's director of major projects.
Railtrack did not name the shortlisted consortia, but they are understood to
include the following:
Sir Alexander Gibb, an engineering consultancy, with Brown &amp; Root,
engineering and construction;
Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar House, the construction and engineering
group, BICC, communications and cabling, and GEC, electrical systems;
Kennedy &amp; Donkin, an engineering consultancy, with Laing, the construction
company, and Ansoldo Trasporti, an Italian engineering company;
ABB, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group with Amec, a
construction company.
Railtrack expects to award the feasibility study contract by early April for
completion in nine months. It will then call for tenders for a contractor to
carry out the upgrading work, which is expected to take five years in two
phases.
One company which did not make the shortlist said it believed its bid had
been rejected because it had proposed changes to the terms of the tender. It
was unhappy that it might not benefit from its proposals for improvements in
the study because another company might win the upgrading contract.
Mr Howarth was speaking at the launch of a week-long series of roadshows
expected to attract up to 1,500 directors and senior managers of
construction, engineering and rail equipment companies including many non-UK
groups.
Railtrack will have Pounds 500m to spend on improvement schemes this year
rising to Pounds 600m next year and Pounds 750m in 1996/97. These are
'considerably larger' amounts than those previously available to BR, Mr
Howarth said. Passenger transport executives and local authorities will
contribute an additional Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m a year to local rail
improvements.
Railtrack expects to carry out about 5,000 projects a year, of which 200
will be worth Pounds 500,000 or more each.

FT  03 FEB 94 / District councils turn against Banham review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several district councils yesterday rejected attempts by their own umbrella
organisation to organise a national lobbying campaign against Sir John
Banham's review of local government.
The Association of District Councils has urged all district councils to fax
government ministers to say that the revised review process was working and
encourage the government to stand firm.
But some refused. Mr Malcolm Fletcher, chief executive of Erewash District
Council in Derbyshire, said: 'There's a growing feeling in Derbyshire that
the review should be abandoned altogether.'
Mr Geoffrey Woods, leader of North Hertfordshire District Council, also
refused, saying that on preliminary indications his county would be best
served by the status quo.
Meanwhile Ryedale District Council announced that it would mount a court
challenge to the Local Government Commission's plans to abolish North
Yorkshire County Council and replace it with unitary authorities. Ryedale,
controlled by independents and Liberal Democrats, said it saw no need to
change the two-tier system and said the only improvements needed involved
the positioning of council offices.
Mr Ken Binks, chairman of Ryedale, said: 'Why abolish something that works,
for a vast, costly and impossible exercise of political gerrymandering?'
Opposition to the review has so far come almost exclusively from county
councils, but now Labour has demanded a Commons statement. Mr Doug
Henderson, Labour local government spokesman, said: 'The procedure has
fallen into complete chaos now and that the government have to make a
complete statement.'
Downing Street dismissed suggestions that ministers are considering ways of
modifying or abandoning the reform process. A senior government official
said Mr John Major, the prime minister, was aware of concern among Tory MPs
and councillors. But he said rumours that Mr Major had met Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, to discuss a
climbdown were incorrect.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Insurer to drop bar to union recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MSF, the white-collar technical union, has secured a new recognition and
representation agreement for its 500 members working for Zurich Insurance in
the UK.
This follows the union's five-month campaign against the Swiss-owned
company. Zurich de-recognised the union last January after acquiring
Municipal Mutual Insurance. Details of the deal will be announced today.
MSF believes it has regained partial recognition partly because of pressure
from 83 local authorities which protested to Zurich.
Adverse publicity is understood to have caused acute embarrassment to the
head office in Switzerland.
The new agreement gives MSF representatives seats on the company's
consultative staff council. Union officials will have the right to represent
members. There has not been a full restoration of the union's position in
the company.
Just over a week ago Mr Denis White, the company's chief executive in the
UK, made clear his dislike for having any trade unionism among its Zurich
employees.
The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association said yesterday that it gained
4,100 members last year.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Plans may boost GP fundholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering making it easier for family doctors to become
fundholders, in a move intended to inject fresh momentum into this element
of its health reforms.
The proportion of the population which is served by fundholders - family
doctors with budgets who buy hospital care for their patients - will rise to
around 33 per cent by April and 40 per cent by April next year.
But ministers are anxious to push this figure above 50 per cent before the
next general election, which must be held before April 1997. With Labour
pledged to abolish fundholding, ministers see the issue as a way of eroding
the electoral advantage Labour has traditionally enjoyed on health issues.
Ministers are convinced of their ability to persuade voters that Labour's
stance poses a severe threat to an innovation they maintain has brought
about improved standards of patient care.
A Labour document confirming the party's commitment to the abolition of
fundholding is expected shortly.
The main proposal being considered by ministers will give prospective
fundholders more choice over the range of treatments and services they would
be responsible for purchasing.
At present the budgets they are allocated cover a defined group of hospital
and community nursing services, such as health visiting and psychiatric
nursing.
Legislation may be introduced to enable fundholders to adopt more of a
pick-and-choose approach, controlling budgets only for some of the services
on the present list.
Such a move would be particularly likely if the range of services now
covered by the fundholding scheme is expanded, as many anticipate.
The government may also decide to lower from 7,000 to 6,000 the minimum
number of patients which GP practices or groups must have to qualify for the
fundholding scheme.
Ministers believe that this threshold is unlikely to fall below 6,000 for
the foreseeable future, however, because of the start-up costs which are
associated with becoming a fundholder.
The government has for some time been encouraging smaller GP practices to
band together in order to reach the minimum threshold.
A new batch of smaller practices intending to make this change is expected
to be announced shortly.

FT  03 FEB 94 / BNF profits hit by Thorp: Greenpeace to challenge accounts -
Results show sharp fall to Pounds 76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delays in the commissioning of the Thorp reprocessing plant helped depress
the 1992-93 profits of state-owned British Nuclear Fuels to less than half
their previous year's level.
BNF yesterday reported profits of Pounds 76m for the year to March 31,
against Pounds 161m for the previous year. Turnover was marginally down at
Pounds 1.05bn from Pounds 1.08bn. The results were at the lower end of
analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was halved to Pounds
26m.
Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability in 1993-94 to be
similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay playing an even greater
role in the result. He said the Thorp effect last year was Pounds 18m, but
this year it would be about Pounds 90m.
Mr Guinness said next year's profitability would rebound significantly as
Thorp would play a full role.
Yesterday's results, and the accompanying annual report, were prepared on
the assumption that the government will agree to underwrite at least some of
the unexpected costs which may arise in contracts worth about Pounds 19bn
with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear.
The government rejected previous underwriting arrangements. Ernst &amp; Young,
auditor to the accounts, said the company considered underwriting to be a
prerequisite to the completion of the contracts.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, said yesterday that it was considering
a challenge to the accounts on the basis that the government may not agree
to the underwriting. The Department of Trade and Industry said it was
considering the revised underwriting arrangements.
BNF said that there were several reasons apart from Thorp for the downturn
in the profits.
They had been depressed by Pounds 30m as a result of the nine-week shutdown
in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria, the company's biggest
cash-producing operation. BNF said the money could be recouped in future
years.
A further Pounds 40m depressant was an advance writedown of costs associated
with the merger of BNF's enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a
company, Urenco, which it operates with Dutch and German partners.
BNF said the benefit would be a rise from 8 per cent to 15 per cent of
returns on investment in the project over the long term.
It put restructuring costs, including staff cuts, at Pounds 20m. Although
total numbers rose from 15,783 to 16,186, this was partly due to increased
needs for staff for Thorp.
It said further internationalisation of the company was a priority.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Officials try to patch up relationship with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downing Street yesterday launched a concerted attempt to paper over deep
cracks in its relationship with the US after the visit to New York by Mr
Gerry Adams.
At the same time, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to
British interests caused by the almost unchallenged 48-hour access to the US
media which the Sinn Fein president had.
The government was unable, however, to conceal its dismay at President Bill
Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams.
Publicly, Downing Street put a brave face on the affair. A senior official
said the UK/US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'.
In private, ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at
President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One
senior minister said the president seemed to have put UK/US relations and
the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the
Irish lobby in the US.
The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to
Mr Adams by the US media, and the lack of interest in balancing comments
from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
A Downing Street official said Mr Hurd was 'pushed off the networks by
programmers who decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting'.
The bitterness in London was not eased by a broad hint from Mr Raymond
Seitz, US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr
Adams into the US. Mr Seitz did not dispute a suggestion that he argued
against giving Mr Adams the chance to capture US media attention.
Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday as part of a
drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein.
The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British
ambassador to Washington.
Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity had borne fruit in Mr
Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the British/Irish joint
declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy'
to Belfast.
Officials vehemently denied suggestions that Britain lost the propaganda war
in the US because it was caught unprepared by Mr Clinton's decision to grant
a visa to Mr Adams.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Export agency 'overpaid Pounds 83m' in debt recoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK export credit insurance
agency, has overpaid exporters by Pounds 83m since 1975, says a report by
the National Audit Office.
News of the report emerged in a written reply by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, to a parliamentary question.
Mr Heseltine said the government did not intend to recover these
overpayments 'given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty and cost
of establishing the case for recovering these excess payments'.
The overpayments, discovered in a review of the department's information
technology systems, were due to the different treatment of supplier credit
insurance policies - which insure UK exporters against non-payment by
overseas purchasers - by the ECGD's London and Cardiff offices.
Both offices issued policies insuring between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of
any loss but often paying a lower percentage of any loss, as claims were
paid after deductions for expenses saved.
There were differences, however, in the way recoveries made by the ECGD from
the original debtors were allocated to policyholders. While the London
office retained the full 90 per cent to 95 per cent of any recovery, the
Cardiff office allocated recoveries to policyholders in the ratio in which
the exporter and the department had borne the original loss.
'On that basis Cardiff had paid out moneys to policyholders in excess of
their contractual entitlement,' says the report.
Recoveries will now be allocated according to the stricter criteria.
The report has prompted criticism from the Labour party. Mr Stuart Bell,
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Mr Heseltine had had to make a
judgment 'between the interests of the taxpayer and the exporter'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Gardiner's future as chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory
MPs looked in doubt last night after a meeting on Tuesday with the prime
minister which was deferred after a few minutes.
Group members condemned the way the engagement was handled after Mr John
Major had been angered by publicity suggesting that he was being offered
terms for his survival as leader.
One group member said the meeting should have been cancelled as soon as
reports appeared that the group was demanding changes.

FT  03 FEB 94 / BCCI auditing methods queried
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inadequate auditing tech-niques were used by accountants Price Waterhouse to
check the books of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
a partner with the firm admitted at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Simon Chapman, PW's audit manager for BCCI from 1986 to 1989, made the
admission during the trial of Mr Mohammed Baqi, former managing director of
Attock Oil.
The prosecution alleges Mr Baqi helped falsely inflate BCCI's profits by
signing bogus audit confirmation letters which pretended the oil company
owed the bank Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m). Mr Baqi denies 16 charges relating
to the furnishing of false information.
Mr Chapman was being questioned over the methods used by Price Waterhouse to
obtain such confirmations with BCCI's clients. Mr Stephen Solley QC, for Mr
Baqi, said PW's practice of allowing confirmation correspondence with Attock
Oil to go through BCCI was a 'serious inadequacy'.
Mr Chapman replied: 'We realised it was an inadequacy which we discussed
internally.' The practice was then tightened up, he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Hurd to explain aid for Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is to be called before a Commons
committee to explain the government's decision to give aid to Malaysia's
Pergau Dam project in the late 1980s, James Blitz and Jimmy Burns write.
Members of the foreign affairs committee yesterday agreed to summon Mr Hurd
and Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, to answer questions
on the decision to give Pounds 234m to the Malaysian government in 1988 for
the construction of a dam on the Pergau river.
The committee has asked several departments - including the Foreign Office,
the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry - to draw
up a 'comprehensive memorandum' outlining details of the dam project, which
was recently described by Whitehall accountants as a 'very bad buy'.
The committee has also drawn up a list of questions for officials. One of
these is whether the offer of aid was linked to the sale of Pounds 1bn of
defence equipment to Malaysia which took place at about the same time.
Baroness Thatcher and Lord Younger, the former defence secretary, took the
original decisions relating to the deal in 1988. They signed a protocol with
the Malaysian government which mentioned aid.
Mr Hurd and Mr John Major took the final decision in 1991 to 'sign the
cheques' triggering the donation of aid to the Malaysian government.
Mr Hurd will be asked why, in February of that year, he overruled Sir
Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, who opposed the proposal.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Howard revises police proposals
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday made significant changes to part of its flagship
law-and-order legislation, bowing to criticism that its proposals would
centralise control over the police and courts.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, abandoned plans in the police and
magistrates courts bill to have the people who chair police authorities
appointed by him, and agreed to introduce greater local flexibility in
determining the size of authorities.
Further concessions came from Lord Mackay, Lord Chancellor. He said
amendments to proposals, which have been described by Lord Taylor, Lord
Chief Justice, as threatening the judicial independence of justices' clerks,
would underline the government's commitment to independent, locally managed
courts.
Chairs of local magistrates' courts committees will continue to be appointed
by the committee without needing the Lord Chancellor's approval. Terms of
employment for justices' clerks will be left to local discretion - meaning
that Lord Mackay will have no power to impose fixed-term contracts or
performance-related pay - and many renewals of clerks' appointments will not
need Lord Mackay's approval.
The changes could be seen as an embarrassing reverse as the government tries
to demonstrate a firm grip on law-and-order issues. Ministers put a brave
face on the announcement, which was described by Downing Street as
'certainly not a climb-down or a U-turn'.
The need for changes became apparent when the bill was savaged by senior
Tories in the Lords last month. Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime
minister, who led the opposition from Conservative peers, said the bill
would now have his 'full support', virtually guaranteeing that it will pass
through the Lords without further significant changes.
However police staff associations remain opposed to proposed reductions in
the proportion of local authority representatives on police authorities.
The associations also oppose plans to set national objectives for police
forces and powers to amalgamate forces without public inquiries.
The local authority associations said that unless police authorities
contained a significant majority of democratically elected representatives
they would become unaccountable quangos.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the announcement was 'a
humiliating retreat' which left the bill with 'no consistent rationale'.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Fleet chiefs slam brakes on company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many UK company car drivers who felt hard done by if required to keep their
cars for more than two years or 40,000 miles in the boom years of the 1980s
now have to drive more than 70,000 miles and wait four years for a
replacement.
And 84 per cent of companies with a turnover of Pounds 500m-plus are
intending to encourage employees to trade down to a cheaper car, provided it
is suitable for their job, according to a survey published today. Almost
half (48 per cent) of the smaller companies surveyed are planning similar
action.
Employees who trade down stand to make substantial savings on their personal
tax bills when a new tax system for company cars comes into effect in April.
It is based on a simple percentage of a car's purchase price rather than the
present system of bands for price and engine size.
To sweeten the pill however, a greater number of companies are allowing
drivers to trade up to a higher grade of car by making a personal
contribution to the cost.
The findings by the Monks Partnership, in its annual survey of companies'
car policies, show that 36 per cent of cars are being kept for more than
70,000 miles, up from 28 per cent in the previous year's study, and that
even directors are being offered less choice of car.
Even though they have to pay more tax on their company cars, fewer than one
in 10 drivers being offered a cash alternative is taking it up. The small
take-up on a cash alternative comes in spite of a near-doubling in the
percentage of surveyed companies making the offer.
The reduction in choice is being driven by greater cost-consciousness after
the recession, with more companies negotiating large discounts by
bulk-buying from a single manufacturer.
Among the Pounds 500m-plus turnover companies, 58 per cent are now offer-ing
a cash-for-car scheme, compared with 30 per cent 12 months ago. Only two out
of 171 companies had moved to compulsory cash-for-car policies however.
The survey makes some com-forting reading for BMW, the impending new owner
of Rover group.
BMWs are already twice as popular as Rovers among surveyed chief executives
and all other directors except the chairman, who still usually drives a
Jaguar.
The survey is widely regarded as representative of British business as a
whole. It was undertaken in December and January among a total of 171
companies, 62 of them with a turnover in excess of Pounds 500m.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Scott may extend probe to more immunity certificates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry may examine the granting of public interest
immunity certificates in a 1990 case involving a Malaysian banker.
The certificates were issued in an appeal by Mr Lorrain Osman against
attempts to have him extradited to Hong Kong. This was the first time that
immunity certificates, preventing disclosure of government documents, had
been used in a criminal case.
A senior lawyer said last night that the use of immunity certificates in the
Osman case had formed the precedent for their subsequent use in the Matrix
Churchill case which is at the heart of the Scott inquiry.
Separately, Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the Scott inquiry, said that the
use of immunity certificates by government ministers fell within the scope
of the inquiry.
'We are aware that the Osman case has been cited as a legal authority on the
use of PII certificates,' he said. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told
the Scott inquiry last week that he had signed immunity certificates as home
secretary but made no mention of their signing by Foreign Office ministers
in the Osman case.
Whitehall officials confirmed last night that two former ministers, Mr
Francis Maude and Lord Caithness, applied for immunity certificates in 1990
and 1992 to prevent the release of documents relating to the collapse of
Bank Bumiputra, a Malaysian bank.  Mr Osman was in charge of the bank's Hong
Kong operations.
In November 1992 Mr Robert Parry, Labour MP for Riverside, alleged in an
early-day motion that the immunity certificates were used to conceal cables
transmitted to the Foreign Office relating to an alleged cover-up of the
involvement of senior Malaysian politicians in lending by the bank.
The early-day motion names the Malaysian prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad
as one of the politicians allegedly involved in lending to the failed
Carrian Corporation.
The Foreign Office confirmed that Mr Maude had applied for a certificate to
prevent the release of documents in the trial of Mr Osman. The banker was
accused of having had a main role in the loss of Pounds 600m by Bank
Bumiputra, which is now owned by the Malaysian Ministry of Finance.
The office said Lord Caithness had applied for the immunity certificates in
1992 'as a follow-up', and added that the certificates were issued 'to
protect privileged documents that had no bearing on the trial'.
Lord Justice Scott yesterday took evidence in private from Mr Andrew Collins
QC on the issue of disclosure of government documents.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Operations resume after fire at petrol additives plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operations resumed at Associated Octel's petrol additives plant (above) at
Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, yesterday after a blaze had destroyed a reaction
vessel and injured one worker and five firefighters. All the injured were
released from hospital after treatment, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The fire started while emergency services were trying to stop a leak of
ethyl chloride. About 200 firefighters battled the blaze, which began at
8.30pm on Tuesday. A police helicopter flew over parts of Cheshire downwind
of the blaze warning people to stay indoors because hydrogen chloride vapour
was escaping. Associated Octel said the vapours dispersed quickly and were
not a danger.
The biggest concern was over a fire under a storage tank with a two-hour
protective coating. Firefighters put it out with 20 minutes to spare,
leaving other fires to burn while they tackled it. All fires were out by 8am
yesterday.
The accident prompted calls by residents and politicians for an independent
inquiry and relocation of the plant, which employs 1,650 people. The plant
is part of a petrochemical complex which includes Shell's Stanlow refinery
and dominates the south bank of the Manchester Ship Canal.
Mr Bob Larbey, corporate affairs manager, said: 'This was a major fire but
safety procedures worked. We do not yet know what caused the leak, but
automatic sniffing equipment detected it. The coating on the storage tank
also did its job. It is all very well calling for shutdown and relocation,
but we are a major employer. Exports from the site are worth about Pounds
250m a year.'
The company will use local stocks and supplies from abroad until the ethyl
chloride plant is rebuilt. Mr Larbey said the cost of the fire was still
unknown but the plant was fully insured.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inadequate auditing techniques were used by accountants Price Waterhouse to
check the books of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
a partner with the firm admitted at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Simon Chapman, PW's audit manager for BCCI from 1986 to 1989, made the

Attock Oil.
The prosecution alleges Mr Baqi helped falsely inflate BCCI's profits by

Mr Chapman replied: 'We realised it was an inadequacy which we discussed
internally'. The practice was then tightened up, he said.
Earlier, Mr Chapman said PW had carried out its audits in accordance with
best practice. 'We pride ourselves on our standards,' he told the court.
Mr Chapman also said that by October 1990, nine months before the bank
collapsed, supervisors from the Bank of England, BCCI's lead regulators, had
a 'considerable understanding' of PW's deep concerns about BCCI's
operations.
This followed a meeting that month between Bank officials and two PW
partners. However, at this point, the Bank still supported attempts to keep
BCCI going in the interests of depositors, he said.
The trial continues today.

MPs looked in increasing doubt last night after the botched handling of an
abortive meeting with the prime minister.
MPs in the group were vociferous in condemning the way the engagement was
handled after Mr John Major had been angered by publicity suggesting he was
being offered terms for his survival as leader.
As rumours about a possible challenge to Sir George's chairmanship started
circulating, one prominent group member said the matter had been
'appallingly badly handled'. He said the meeting should have been cancelled
as soon as reports appeared that the group was demanding changes. The
outcome - the meeting was deferred after a few minutes - reflected badly on
Mr Major and the group.
Separately, the rightwing No Turning Back group of Tory MPs released a paper
arguing that a single currency would signal the end of the UK as a nation
state. It urged the government to guarantee there would be no return to the
European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Councils refuse to back review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
The review of local govern-ment in rural England came under fresh attack
yesterday as several district councils ignored national lobbying attempts by
the Association of District Councils and called for the review to be
abandoned.
Opposition has so far come almost exclusively from county councils, but now
Labour has demanded a Commons statement on the review. Mr Doug Henderson,
Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'It seems that the procedure has
fallen into complete chaos now and that the government have to make a
complete statement in the house to clarify the position.'
But Downing Street dismissed suggestions that ministers are considering ways
of modifying or abandoning the reform process. A senior government official
said Mr John Major, the prime minister, was aware of concern among Tory MPs
and councillors. But he said rumours that Mr Major had met Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, to discuss a
climbdown were incorrect.
However, Ryedale District Council announced that it would mount a court
challenge to the Local Government Commission's plans to abolish North
Yorkshire County Council and replace it with unitary authorities. Ryedale,
controlled by independents and Liberal Democrats, said it saw no need to
change the two-tier system.
Mr Ken Binks, chairman of Ryedale, said: 'Why abolish something that works,
for a vast, costly and impossible exercise of political gerrymandering?'
Association secretary, Mr Geoffrey Filkin, has urged all district councils
to fax Mr Major, Mr Gummer, and Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the
Conservative party. He said they should tell the ministers that the revised
review process was working and encourage the government to stand firm.
But some refused. Mr Malcolm Fletcher, chief executive of Erewash District
Council in Derbyshire, said: 'There's a growing feeling in Derbyshire that
the review should be abandoned altogether.'
Mr Geoffrey Woods, leader of North Hertfordshire District Council, also
refused, saying that on preliminary indications his county would be best
served by the status quo.

FT  03 FEB 94 / MPs call Hurd to explain aid for Malaysian dam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is to be called before a Commons
committee to explain the government's decision to give aid to Malaysia's
Pergau Dam project in the late 1980s.
Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday agreed to summon Mr Hurd
and Baroness Chalker, the Minister for Overseas Development, to answer
questions on the decision to give Pounds 234m to the Malaysian government in
1988 for the construction of a dam on the Pergau river.
The committee has asked several departments - including the Foreign Office,
the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry - to draw
up a 'comprehensive memorandum' outlining details of the dam project, which
was recently described by Whitehall accountants as a 'very bad buy'.
The committee has also drawn up a list of questions for officials. One of
these is whether the offer of aid was linked to the sale of Pounds 1bn of
defence equipment to Malaysia which took place at about the same time.
Lady Thatcher and Lord Younger, the former defence secretary, took the
original decisions relating to the deal in 1988. They signed a protocol with
the Malaysian government which mentioned aid.
Mr Hurd and Mr John Major took the final decision in 1991 to 'sign the
cheques' triggering the donation of aid to the Malaysian government.
Mr Hurd will be asked why, in February of that year, he over-ruled Sir
Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, who opposed the proposal. Sir Timothy recently
described the deal as an 'abuse' of the administration's budget, amid
indications that the dam has pushed up the retail cost of electricity in
Malaysia.
An official at the administration said last night there was nothing in
British legislation prohibiting the linkage of arms deals with aid. However,
he also said officials have traditionally abided by a set of guidelines -
called 'Restrictions on the use of the aid programme' - which prohibit
linkage between arms deals and overseas aid.
In addition, guidelines on development assistance drawn up by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - to which the UK is
a signatory - specifically exclude 'any kind of military assistance'. The
official said these guidelines are regarded as a 'bible' by desk officers.

Finnish exports to Russia, which crashed following the collapse of the
Soviet Union, doubled last year as a surge in transit trade helped what
officials in Helsinki hope will be the gradual rehabilitation of a trade
relationship that was previously a mainstay of Finland's economy, Hugh
Carnegy reports from Helsinki .
Figures published showed a 100 per cent increase in exports to Russia to
FM6.04bn (Pounds 700m) in 1993. Exports to Estonia were also up almost 110
per cent to FM1.9bn, helping to push up the share of Finnish exports bought
by former Soviet territories to 6.2 per cent of the total, compared to a low
of 4.3 per cent in 1992.

France's Patronat employers' federation said yesterday it would watch
closely to see if the Uruguay Round agreement for a new World Trade
Organisation fulfilled the 'great hopes' for this body, David Buchan writes
from Paris.
France championed the WTO in the Uruguay Round negotiations as a means of
reining in the US tendency to retaliate unilaterally against what Washington
deemed unfair trade practices. Mr Francois de Laage de Meux, head of the
Patronat's international committee, said he did not expect the US to abandon
entirely the unilateral provisions of Section 301 in its trade laws. This,
he said, would not matter, provided - once the WTO came into force - the US
only used its 301 weapon against non-Gatt countries in non-Gatt trade areas.

Ares - Serono, the fourth largest Swiss pharmaceuticals company, is to
transfer the manufacture of diagnostic products from its Swiss base at
Coinsins in the canton of Vaud, to sites in Rome, Italy, and Allentown,
Pennsylvania, US, Daniel Green reports from London.
The closure of the Swiss plant is the latest stage in the restructuring of
the European healthcare industry as it struggles to reduce costs in the face
of government healthcare spending cuts. The company said the move was a
cost-cutting measure and that it was part of a stronger emphasis on drug
development at the expense of diagnostic technology. It plans to launch six
new drugs over the next few years.
In the first nine months of last year, diagnostics products accounted for
Dollars 67.3m (Pounds 44.8m) out of total sales of Dollars 548.3m. The
remainder was accounted for by drugs. The transfer of manufacturing abroad
would take around 18 months.

The Lebanese government has awarded a Dollars 380m (Pounds 253.3m) contract
to Alcatel, Siemens and Ericsson, the French, German and Swedish
telecommunications companies, to rehabilitate and expand the country's
shattered telephone network, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo.
The contract is the biggest so far awarded towards the reconstruction of
Lebanon's infrastructure since the end of the civil war, which left much of
the telephone system barely operable. Fewer than half the country's 500,000
lines work, and businesses and private users have been forced to resort to
cellular phones, many using US networks.
Lebanon's present telephone system is an increasing hindrance to the
economy, with many 'difficult numbers' from one part of town to another
often proving impossible to dial, while international direct-dial lines are
scarce even from the main hotels.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A last-ditch effort by the US to steer its trade talks with Japan towards
agreement appeared to meet stiff resistance yesterday from leading Japanese
politicians.
Meetings between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Tsutomu
Hata, Japan's foreign minister, and later with Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade
minister, failed to make a breakthrough. The bilateral trade and economic
framework talks are deadlocked because of opposing views on how to increase
access to Japan's markets.
Mr Kantor is in Tokyo with Mr W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential
assistant for economic policy, on a special mission to try to push the talks
forward ahead of a US-Japan summit due next week.
The meetings, which both lasted for nearly two hours, were described as
'tough' by Japanese officials. The discussion with Mr Hata focused on the
entire framework agreement, and a great part of that with Mr Kumagai was
taken up with one of the most contentious issues - trade in motor vehicles
and parts.
Although Mr Kantor did not use the word 'sanctions', according to Japanese
media reports, he suggested that failure to conclude the agreement would
affect relations badly.
The Japanese are understood to have stood firmly behind the official
position that the use of numerical targets to boost imports, which the US
has been insisting on, would lead to managed trade and was therefore
unacceptable.
Nevertheless, it was also reported that Mr Kumagai hastily arranged meetings
with the heads of Toyota and Nissan, suggesting that as on many occasions in
the past, the trade ministry could be orchestrating some kind of 'voluntary'
effort by the Japanese car industry in order to appease the US.

FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Canada goes in search of its Nafta cousins
 -Bernard Simon on a flurry of getting-to-know-you exercises with trade deal
partner Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican navy broke with tradition last month. The newest house in its
officers' compound in Mexico City is not the usual locally-made,
cement-block structure, but is built around a wood-and-polystyrene frame
imported from Canada.
Nascor, a Calgary-based homebuilder whose biggest shareholder is MacMillan
Bloedel, the big west coast forestry group, hopes the prototype model built
for the navy marks the start of a stream of orders from Mexico. Wooden
houses, the Canadian company claims, are not only quicker to put up than
cement ones, but also more resistant to earthquakes and hurricanes.
Nascor is one of dozens of Canadian companies drawn to Mexico by a flurry of
getting-to-know-you activity which accompanied the talks leading up to the
North American free trade agreement, implemented on January 1.
The three Nafta partners, the US, Canada and Mexico, are often likened to a
sandwich, with two thin slices separated by a giant filling. The US is both
Canada's and Mexico's biggest trading and investment partner. But the two
junior partners have in the past had little in common. Two-way shipments
between Canada and Mexico totalled only CDollars 3.6bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in
1992, less than 2 per cent of US-Canada trade.
The tangible impact of Nafta - such as the gradual elimination of customs
tariffs and relaxed investment rules - has yet to be felt.
But the mere prospect of liberalisation has been enough for Canadians and
Mexicans to forge a multitude of new links.
SHL Systemhouse, an Ottawa-based computer systems company which already has
several contracts in Mexico, last month became the first Canadian company to
hold a board meeting in Mexico City.
Among the mushrooming areas of official co-operation, Mexican officials have
visited the bureau of competition policy in Ottawa to improve their skills
in reviewing mergers and takeovers. At least five Canadian ministers will be
in Mexico City later this month for the annual cabinet-level review of
bilateral relations.
Evidence abounds of a spurt in trade and investment flows. According to
Statistics Canada, Mexico's exports to Canada grew by 23 per cent in the
first ten months of last year to CDollars 2.86bn. The biggest increases were
in shipments of motor vehicles (Mexico's biggest single export to Canada)
and furniture.
Mexican investment in Canada remains minuscule. One of the few examples is
Targa, a Mexico City construction group, which joined a group of Quebec
entrepreneurs a year ago to rescue Artopex, a Montreal-based
office-furniture maker whose products Targa distributes in Latin America.
The partners have subsequently sold Artopex, but have kept the land on which
its factory is located. They are also examining at least three construction
joint ventures in Mexico and El Salvador.
Investment flows have been stronger in the opposite direction. Bank of Nova
Scotia two years ago bought a small stake in Inverlat, one of Mexico's
largest financial service groups.
Mr Paul Friser-Frederiksen, who is in charge of Royal Bank of Canada's
Mexican business, identifies 10 key areas of opportunity for Canadian
business: agri-business, transport, petroleum, telecommunications,
environmental services, mining equipment and services, industrial machinery,
consumer products, financial services, and computer systems.
Canadian businessmen suggest that simply not being American often gives them
an edge against US competitors. In particular, Canadians are more accustomed
to working in a second language, which may explain why a high proportion of
trade and investment deals between the two countries involve Quebec
companies. Quebecois also make up more than half the Canadian tourists to
Mexico.
Ms Sandra Fuentes, Mexico's energetic ambassador in Ottawa, says she is
trying to encourage Canadian companies to participate in ventures in Mexico
which can employ the 5,000-6,000 seasonal labourers who work on Canadian
fruit and vegetable farms each summer. She cites a Quebec-based company
which has invested in a Mexican cucumber-processing plant.
The relationship is not entirely smooth, however. Ms Fuentes makes no secret
of her frustration with Canadian non-governmental groups, which have
complained loudly about Mexican human rights policies in the wake of the
recent peasant uprising in Chiapas. Canadian aboriginal groups were quick to
take up the cause of the Mexican rebels.
Canadian officials, for their part, express doubts about the ability of the
Mexican legal and administrative structure to adapt to the disciplines of a
comprehensive trade agreement with two of the world's most developed
countries.
A guide to business in Mexico, published by Royal Bank and the department of
foreign affairs, recently cautioned that 'people like to name drop, and can
promise you the world while they are leading you down the garden path. There
are people who deliver on their promises, but always check, double check and
triple check'.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Clinton decision on Vietnam trade soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will decide 'within the next several days' whether to
lift the 19-year-old US embargo on trade with Vietnam, he said yesterday.
Virtually all Mr Clinton's advisers are urging him to resume trade links
with Vietnam, and the US Senate last week gave the president political
backing for the move by voting heavily in favour of a resolution urging an
end to the embargo. But to do so will bring down the implacable hostility of
veterans' organisations and groups representing the families of servicemen
listed as missing in action (MIAs) during the Vietnam war. Mr Clinton
himself, to the ire of many veterans, evaded military service in Vietnam.
The US embarked three years ago on a slow journey towards normal relations
with Vietnam. The Bush administration offered the Hanoi government a 'road
map' linking progress towards the establishment of a peacefully elected
government in neighbouring Cambodia, and towards full accounting for MIAs,
with economic and diplomatic concessions from the US.
A new Cambodian government is now in place - fulfilling the fourth and final
phase of the US road map - and Vietnamese co-operation in tracing the
remains of MIAs has been, according to the US taskforce in Vietnam,
excellent. But the US has still not lifted its embargo, foreseen in phase
three, let alone allowed full normalisation of economic and diplomatic
relations, as laid out for phase four.
'The road map policy for normalisation established by the Bush
administration was intended to answer the charge that the US was always
moving the goalposts for normalisation. It would be unfair, and beneath the
dignity of the US, to do so again,' said Senator John McCain, a decorated
Navy pilot who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and who was one of the
leaders behind last week's Senate resolution.
Mr Clinton last year dropped US opposition to Vietnam's reinstatement as a
member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and US
companies are now allowed to bid on projects sponsored by the multilateral
development banks. Over 30 have opened offices in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City.
US companies are champing at the bit to take advantage of what many see as
potentially one of Asia's most promising market opportunities.
The US Justice Department has found no grounds for prosecution of Mr Ron
Brown, the commerce secretary, on charges that he had accepted Dollars
700,000 (Pounds 467,000) to help lift the US embargo on trade with Vietnam.
Justice's criminal division told Mr Brown's lawyers that it was closing its
investigation into the allegations, made by a Vietnamese-American
businessman, and said no further investigation was warranted.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the tobacco group, has filed suit against the city of San
Francisco to overturn a tough anti-smoking ordinance that went into effect
this week.
The action is the first such legal challenge by the tobacco industry to
local smoking restrictions, which are becoming widespread in California.
In San Francisco, smoking is now banned in almost all workplaces.
Restaurants will become 'smoke free' at the beginning of next year and at
least 35 per cent of hotel rooms must now be 'non-smoking'. Smoking is also
prohibited in outdoor sports arenas, including Candlestick Park, home of the
49ers football team.
San Francisco's anti-smoking rules are being matched in towns and cities
throughout the state. 'California is approaching smoking with a
prohibitionistic fervour unlike any other state in the nation,' said Mr Tom
Lauria of the Tobacco Institute. Close to 100 communities now ban smoking
entirely in restaurants, workplaces or both.
San Francisco bar and hotel owners who fear that restrictions may damage
their businesses have joined Philip Morris in challenging the city's
anti-smoking rules. Their lawsuit charges the city has overstepped its
powers by enacting regulations that pre-empt state workplace safety laws.
'If every local government took it upon itself to issue varying workplace
regulations,' said Mr Jeffrey Tanenbaum, a San Francisco attorney
representing the plaintiffs, 'it would be impossible to do business in this
nation.'
Mr Steve Parrish, senior vice-president and general counsel for Philip
Morris, said it 'believes the common sense solution to this issue is to
provide separate sections for smokers and non-smokers'.

Mr Rafael Caldera, a 78-year-old specialist in labour law, began his second
term as president of Venezuela yesterday by underlining his rejection of
both neo-liberal economic policies and their populist alternative.
Mr Caldera, who arrives in office with Venezuela facing a combination of
deep economic, social and political problems. rejected the need for a 'war
economy' or a series of 'dramatic economic adjustments'. Instead, he said
there would be a 'dialogue for solidarity'.
In a speech generally light on specific policy proposals, he said his
government would send a package of bills to Congress calling for repeal (at
least at the retail level) of a value added tax imposed last year; new
levies, including a selective tax up to the wholesale level and a luxury
tax; and reforms of existing income tax laws. It will also try to reduce
income tax evasion estimated at about 70 per cent of potential revenue.
Mr Caldera said he would raise the minimum wage (now at the equivalent of
Dollars 83 per month), and denied that his government was planning a large
devaluation of the bolivar or the imposition of exchange controls.
Other priority initiatives included reforms of the constitution, stiff
penalties for those guilty of causing bank failures, particularly
stockholders and managers, new efforts to assist agriculture, improvements
in public services and aid for slum dwellers. He outlined seven priority
areas for the economy: A commitment to control inflation (which reached 46
per cent last year) over the short to medium-term;
A policy of austerity in public spending to achieve fiscal equilibrium
'without affecting the social area, to which I attribute priority', he said.
There would be cuts in spending by the president's office and better
co-ordination between fiscal and monetary authorities;
An opening of the economy and promotion of competition 'within a framework
of (international) reciprocity;
An economic stability programme that took into consideration the average
Venezuelan family rather than macroeconomic indicators;
Efforts to control waste and inefficiency in the public and private sectors;
Continued privatisations, but ones in which workers would play a more
important role;
A new tax policy under which 'those who earn more will pay more'.
Mr Caldera takes over with the economy in recession, persistently high
inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and an estimated 43 per cent of the
nation's 21m people live in 'extreme poverty'.
He has taken over a huge inefficient government bureaucracy, whose militant
employees are expected to seek more money and which provides among the
poorest health and education services in Latin America. The country's
military has been in turmoil ever since rebellious officers led two
unsuccessful coups attempts in 1992. Violent crime, often drugs related,
remains a prime concern. His ability to deal with these issues is
constrained by low prices for the country's main export, oil, and a
financial system weakened by the recent failure of the country's second
largest bank.
Yet Mr Caldera won the chief executive's job last December with only 30 per
cent of the popular vote in elections where abstention reached a record 40
per cent.
He is viewed as Venezuela's last caudillo, a man who appeals to many as a
strong and charismatic leader. This quality of leadership, combined with his
experience, will be necessary if the president is to gain the support he
will need from a congress divided into four blocks.
The two main parties that supported him in the presidential campaign,
National Convergence and the socialist party MAS, together lack a majority
in either the upper or lower house. He must therefore hammer together a
working majority with the help of the Democratic Action party or Copei - the
Christian Democrats - both of which are officially in the opposition.
This attempt will be complicated by Mr Caldera's break with Copei, which he
helped found in the 1940s, last year during his sixth campaign for the
presidency. Causa R, a militant leftist party that holds an important share
of congressional seats, has given signs that it will be a critical
opposition force and seems an unlikely ally for the new president.
During his presidential campaign, Mr Caldera focused on the injustice of
unpopular free market reforms that began to be implemented in 1989, and said
he would change them. Recently, however, members of the new government have
signalled to businessmen that the new government will be in favour of
private investment and will not return to heavy government intervention in
the economy.
In spite of this, investors and businessmen remain worried about the
presidents traditional commitment to labour and his self-confessed
inexperience in economic affairs.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Surge in US housing as recovery accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US housing market experienced near-boom conditions at the end of last
year as the pace of US economic recovery gathered momentum, figures
indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department also reported a strong rise in the composite index
of leading indicators in December, which points to further robust growth
this year.
New home sales rose 11.4 per cent between November and December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 862,000, the highest rate since March
1986. Sales were up 30 per cent on the same period last year.
Most analysts were surprised by the strength of the housing market, which
appeared to reflect consumers' desire to take advantage of the lowest
mortgage rates in two decades. However, the figures are volatile on a
monthly basis and could be heavily revised.
There were big differences in regional markets. The strongest sales gains
occurred in the Midwest and the south. Sales fell on the west coast.
Abnormally cold weather and the Los Angeles earthquake last month may have
caused a national setback for the housing market.
The index of leading indicators - designed to provide advance warning of
economic conditions six to nine months ahead - rose by 0.7 per cent in
December, its fifth consecutive monthly gain. The index rose 0.5 per cent in
October and November.
Eight of 11 indicators contributed to the rise in the leading index. The
most important were increases in consumer confidence and commodity prices,
and a fall in claims for unemployment insurance.
Analysts are now keenly awaiting payroll employment figures due tomorrow.
These will provide the first comprehensive guide to economic conditions in
January. Most economists expect a solid gain of about 200,000 non-farm jobs.
The Labour Department is also revising the way it calculates the
unemployment rate. The new series is expected to result in jobless rates
about 0.5 percentage points above previously published figures. This
suggests the January jobless rate could be 6.5-7 per cent on the new basis.

President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has sacked the governor of the country's
central bank following the failure of monetary reform launched last year,
according to Zaire television, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
The central African country, crippled by a political stand-off between Mr
Mobutu and his opponents, launched a disastrous currency reform last
October, converting 3m old zaires to one new one.
The new zaire's parity against hard currency was set at three to a dollar,
but by late January the parallel market rate had plunged to 130 to a dollar.
Some regions loyal to the president's main political adversary, Mr Etienne
Tshisekedi, have refused to use the new currency.
The World Bank, the last big source of foreign aid for Zaire, is closing its
office in the bankrupt country, which faces expulsion from the International
Monetary Fund.
Troops in Zaire have executed thousands of people for opposing Mr Mobutu's
29-year dictatorship, Amnesty International claimed yesterday.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Pakistani banks taken for a Dollars 500m ride
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani banks have clocked up a Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) taxi bill,
after the import of 50,000 cars created a financial nightmare.
These days, passengers leaving a main airport or train station can choose
from scores of brand-new yellow cabs ranging from a small Suzuki to a
Mercedes Benz. The yellow cabs - which replaced battered old makes,
including many Morris Minors - are now at the centre of a political
controversy.
As parliament began debating the issue this week, 13,000 more vehicles
remained stranded at Karachi's seaport and at dealer outlets.
Unemployed youths who wanted to become taxi drivers were allowed to buy
their vehicles on 10 per cent down-payment while paying back the rest in
easy instalments. Banks were ordered to approve requests for loans on
receipt of the deposit.
But in the first year of the plan, according to bankers, after cab owners
had been given PRs15bn (Pounds 333m), up to 60 per cent of them began
defaulting, and banks refused to sanction any new loans. The supreme court
has ruled the government should resolve the issue of the stranded vehicles,
but the government has no easy way out.
At the outset of the scheme two years ago, Mr Nawaz Sharif, then prime
minister, considered the yellow cabs the most important symbol of his
economic reforms.
'The prime minister feels that just as bright new cars have replaced older
ones, new and fresh policies of deregulation and privatisation will
eventually replace older ones of bureaucratic management,' a senior official
said at the time.
But because the scheme involved reducing import duties on the taxis, it
worsened already strained finances, leaving the new government an even
larger budget deficit.
'If I get another opportunity, I shall import half a million vehicles to
help the poor,' said a defiant Mr Sharif as he led an opposition attack in
parliament alleging the government's decision to abandon the scheme was
hurting the underprivileged and unemployed.
'The yellow cabs gave a sense of pride to their owners, because they now had
their own cars. For the first time in this country, we really helped the
poor.'
Mr Makhdoom Shahabuddin, minister of state for finance, retorted: 'When
there is an inherent tendency in such a scheme for it to be hijacked by
people who don't deserve it, then it's a problem.'
Many expensive vehicles such as Mercedes, imported on loans for being used
as taxis, were in fact in private use, he claimed. The government is
investigating reports that many dealers took payments from clients before
placing orders. Allegations of sales under fictitious names to make the cars
untraceable are also being investigated.
The stranded cars could be sold in the open market free of much of the usual
import duty, under one proposal being considered.
But even so, Pakistan's financial sector may still be looking for stronger
measures to support recovery of bank loans. 'The cab issue shows that giving
out loans is much easier than getting them back. This should be a lesson for
us to tighten our belts if we want to prosper,' one banker said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's run of good economic news was reversed yesterday with the
publication of December balance of payments figures showing a
seasonally-adjusted current account deficit of ADollars 1.765bn (Pounds
830m), above market expectations, which had ranged around the ADollars 1.3bn
mark, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
It also represented a sharp deterioration from the revised November deficit
figure of ADollars 1.194bn.
The news, which initially sent the Australian dollar plunging, came less
than 24 hours after Mr Ralph Willis, federal treasurer, released some
sharply upgraded forecasts, saying economic prospects were 'the best for 30
years'. But by the end of the day, the currency and bond markets had
recouped most of their losses.
On Tuesday, Mr Willis revised the current account deficit estimate for
1993/4 downwards from ADollars 18bn to ADollars 17bn. Some economists fear
faster growth in Australia will bring balance of payments problems next
year.
The December data showed the balance of trade moved from a surplus of
ADollars 169m in November to a deficit of ADollars 505m last month, on a
seasonally-adjusted basis. Merchandise exports fell by 7 per cent, while
imports rose by 6 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea should drop a confrontational approach in dealing with North
Korea and give Pyongyang time to resolve the issue of nuclear inspections,
the South Korean foreign minister said yesterday.
Mr Han Sung-joo's comments reflect growing concern in Seoul that diplomatic
efforts to persuade North Korea to accept international nuclear inspections
are in danger of being derailed.
The US has warned that if North Korea will not allow the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect all its declared nuclear facilities
by February 21, the UN Security Council might consider economic sanctions, a
step that North Korea has said is tantamount to war.
Last night the US defence secretary nominee, Mr William Perry, referred to
the prospect of the 'rogue regime of North Korea' acquiring nuclear weapons
and said the US was pursuing aggressive diplomatic efforts to deal with this
'nightmare scenario'. He added the presence of 100,000 US ground, sea and
air troops in the western Pacific served as a deterrent.
North Korea on Monday threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and protested against the proposed US
deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea.
Over the last week South Korean officials have sought to calm the war of
words between Washington and Pyongyang.
Prime Minister Lee Hoe-chang insisted that recent developments did not
signify growing tensions on the Korean peninsula or an increased threat from
the North.
Although the Seoul government says it is co-operating closely with the US on
the nuclear issue, Mr Han appeared to criticise the US deadline for
acceptance of IAEA inspections.
'Even if North Korea earned time by the use of delaying tactics (in its
negotiations with the IAEA), such time would not be of any help to North
Korea's nuclear development programme,' he said.
This reflects the view of most South Korean officials that the North is
using the nuclear inspection issue to win concessions from the US, such as
diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
But there is a growing feeling in Washington that North Korea is intent on
developing a nuclear weapon, if it has not already done so, and that it is
playing for time to complete its nuclear programme.
The issue could arouse anti-American feelings in South Korea, where the
media are criticising 'American hardliners' for trying to raise tension on
the peninsula and thereby prompt Seoul to buy US weapons.
The IAEA is expected to state at its next board of governors meeting on
February 21 that the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has
been broken. This would set the stage for the Security Council to consider
the issue.
North Korea has vacillated over allowing full IAEA inspections since it
threatened to withdraw from the NPT last March.
Some analysts believe the North is delaying full inspections until the US
formally announces the suspension of military exercises in South Korea this
year and agrees to hold another round of high-level talks on improved
relations. But the US refuses to suspend the annual 'Team Spirit' exercise
and resume discussions with the North until Pyongyang accepts full
inspections and renews talks with South Korea on denuclearisation.

It could still take 'weeks' to reach agreement with the Palestinian
Liberation Organisation on implementing self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank area of Jericho, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said
yesterday.
His comments came after several other Israeli ministers involved in the
peace process sought to cool hopes that a final agreement could be
initialled between Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman, in Cairo next Monday.
Mr Rabin's pessimism follows excitement raised at the weekend when Mr Peres
and Mr Arafat drafted understandings on the main outstanding issues.
Israeli officials say Mr Rabin has taken a more cautious attitude than his
foreign minister and is concerned about the concessions Mr Peres offered the
PLO on control of border crossings.
Mr Rabin is determined the final agreement will be comprehensive and include
all remaining obstacles, including the new Israeli-Palestinian economic
arrangements and the division of authority between the Palestinian police
force and Israeli security.
'People are not aware of the complexity and I don't want to start to
implement before overall agreement is reached and signed,' Mr Rabin said.
Yesterday, in the first serious Palestinian attack for weeks, Islamic gunmen
wounded three Israelis near the West Bank town of Hebron. In the Gaza Strip,
the bodies of five Palestinians killed by Arab gunmen as suspected
collaborators with Israel were left on the streets.
Meanwhile, the Israeli right-wing opposition to the peace process continued
to splinter as three parliamentarians from the ultra-right wing Tsomet party
said they had quit and formed a new faction. The three accused the Tsomet
leader Mr Rafael Eitan of authoritarianism. Mr Nissim Zvilli,
secretary-general of Mr Rabin's Labour party, invited them to join the
fragile coalition government.

FT  03 FEB 94 / HK property prices undaunted by 1997: Simon Holberton on a
new surge in values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong is on the verge of overtaking Tokyo as the most expensive property
market in the world, as a new surge in prices for land and buildings feeds
through to rents.
In January alone property deals totalling more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds
1.7bn) were executed. This included two hotels on the Kowloon peninsula, at
HKDollars 2bn apiece, and a luxury housing development on Hong Kong island
for HKDollars 2.2bn.
The trend looks like continuing. On Tuesday, Wing On International, a
retailer and financial services group, started February off with the sale of
two of its centrally-located office towers to a private developer for
HKDollars 2.2bn.
It is all further evidence - if it were needed - that investors believe Hong
Kong has a secure future after 1997. 'One simply can't pay the prices being
paid now if one had a short-term view,' says Mr Michael Greene, property
analyst at Warburg Securities.
Many of the properties that have been sold since the beginning of this year
are for re-development. But even in Hong Kong it takes time to pull down one
building and put up another. Developers are betting that Hong Kong will
remain business-friendly after China resumes sovereignty.
The deals also point to continued upward pressure on office and housing
rents. According to figures compiled by Brooke Hillier Parker, a property
consultant, Hong Kong has the highest rents for retail space - at an average
of HKDollars 545 a sq ft - in the world and is second only to Tokyo in rents
for office and industrial space.
Already big companies, such as Shell, the oil group, Apple, the computer
company, and American Telephone and Telegraph have moved out of Hong Kong's
central business district to Causeway Bay, beyond the old red-light district
of Wan Chai to the east.
Office rentals rose on average 19 per cent last year and, with fresh supply
of new offices some years off, rents are expected to rise for the next three
years at least.
The same is true of the housing market, where prices have doubled and
transactions have risen threefold in the past three years.
It is not limited to the so-called 'high end' of the market - a house on
Victoria Peak sold for HKDollars 120m last month - but is also true of the
market for family flats.
According to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley, the US securities house,
transactions in the market for typical properties of between 600 sq ft and
800 sq ft rose to about 15,000 a month in 1991-93 from 5,000 a month between
1985 and 1990. Prices for flats rose to more than Dollars HK2,500 a sq ft by
the end of last year from Dollars HK1,250 in 1990.
Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says
property prices are supported by steeply negative real interest rates, an
artificial market in land where the government controls the supply of new
land allowed on to the market, and a powerful banking sector which through
credit policy can influence prices and rents.
The colony's monetary authorities have kept Hong Kong's interest rates
pegged to those of the US as part of the policy of linking the currency to
the US dollar. Given Hong Kong's average inflation rate over the past year
of about 10 per cent this has produced negative real interest rates of
around 5 per cent - a strong spur to speculation.
'Investors have a US dollar hedge and they are not paying for Hong Kong's
inflation by holding a depreciating currency,' Mr Churchouse says.
On credit policy, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and its affiliate Hang Seng
Bank recently said they would limit mortgages for luxury flats to 50 per
cent of the asking price. Analysts say this may place a cap on luxury flat
prices but rents will continue to rise because of the shortage.
Mr Churchouse points out that conditions today are different from those in
1980/81, when Hong Kong had its last big crash in property prices. At the
time interest rates were at 17 per cent, the world was in recession and
prime office rentals had risen by 90 per cent a year for three successive
years.

FT  03 FEB 94 / S African right may win poll changes: African National
Congress seeks to avert boycott of April's election

<TEXT>
The African National Congress, in a last-minute attempt to avert a violent
right-wing boycott of April's all-race elections, appears ready to make
important concessions to the right-wing Freedom Alliance when constitutional
talks resume today.
The ANC's policy-making body, the national executive committee, met until
late on Tuesday night trying to find a formula for constitutional changes
which would entice the Freedom Alliance to participate in the poll.
The NEC is understood to have decided on a package of measures which include
changes to the voting system to include separate national and regional
ballots, rather than one ballot to elect representatives to both national
and regional assemblies. This is an important concession to the Inkatha
Freedom party, which would have been prejudiced by the one-ballot system.
However, it is unclear whether other elements of the package - especially
provisions for the autonomy of regional governments - will meet Inkatha's
demands. ANC officials said the organisation had improved its offer in this
area, and further changes could be made.
The Tuesday meeting appears to mark a significant shift in the position of
the ANC, which has so far failed to demonstrate the political will to
accommodate Inkatha. It is uncertain whether this will carry the two sides
over the main hurdle which separates them - the gulf between the strong
central state which the ANC wants and the federal system which Inkatha
demands.
ANC officials said a strong central state could not be compromised, adding
that talks could drag on for a further 10 days until the expiry of the last
legal deadline for political parties to register for elections. This
deadline was set last night when President FW de Klerk proclaimed the date
of the first all-race elections.

FT  03 FEB 94 / ANC's mines policy 'potentially harmful'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African mining industry yesterday criticised mining policy
proposals put forward last month by the African National Congress.
Mr Nick Segal, economics spokesman for the chamber, said that although it
would be wrong to suggest the ANC's draft mining policy was 'entirely
flawed', it included elements 'potentially highly injurious to the industry'
and its role as the country's leading employer and foreign-exchange earner.
Mr Segal said the chamber was concerned at the level of proposed state
intervention in the sector and the implication that mining companies were
not taking advantage of lucrative commercial opportunities by neglecting to
develop mineral rights they owned. He was 'unaware of any company which is
simply sitting on potentially profitable mineral rights'.
Meanwhile, the ANC is trying to bolster local and international investor
sentiment damaged by fears of nationalisation and state intervention in
minerals marketing. Mr Paul Jourdan, co-ordinator of ANC mineral and energy
policy, told a 20-strong delegation from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, the
US investment banks, that nationalisation of mining companies or mineral
rights was not under consideration.
The organisation has redrafted its mining policy statement, emphasising the
importance of wide consultation with the industry, and is understood to be
considering hiring public relations consultants to improve the presentation
of its economic policies.
'We have learnt that it is as important to say what you don't mean as what
you do mean. Our aim is to present South Africa Inc to attract foreign
investment to the country,' Mr Jourdan said.
The Chamber of Mines and the ANC have set up a framework for further
negotiations.

<TEXT>
South Korea should drop a confrontational approach in dealing with North
Korea and give Pyongyang time to resolve the issue of nuclear inspections,
the South Korean foreign minister said yesterday.
Mr Han Sung-joo's comments reflect growing concern in Seoul that diplomatic
efforts to persuade North Korea to accept international nuclear inspections
are in danger of being derailed.
The US has warned that if North Korea will not allow the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect all its declared nuclear facilities
by February 21, the UN Security Council might consider economic sanctions, a
step that North Korea has said is tantamount to war.
North Korea on Monday also threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and protested against the proposed US
deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea.
Over the last week South Korean officials have sought to calm the war of
words between Washington and Pyongyang.
Prime Minister Lee Hoe-chang insisted that recent developments did not
signify growing tensions on the Korean peninsula or an increased threat from
the North.
Although the Seoul government says it is co-operating closely with the US on
the nuclear issue, Mr Han appeared to criticise the US deadline for
acceptance of IAEA inspections.
'Even if North Korea earned time by the use of delaying tactics (in its
negotiations with the IAEA), such time would not be of any help to North
Korea's nuclear development programme,' he said.
This reflects the view of most South Korean officials that the North is
using the nuclear inspection issue to win concessions from the US, such as
diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
But there is a growing feeling in Washington that North Korea is intent on
developing a nuclear weapon, if it has not already done so, and that it is
playing for time to complete its nuclear programme.
The issue could arouse anti-American feelings in South Korea, where the
media are criticising 'American hardliners' for trying to raise tension on
the peninsula and thereby prompt Seoul to buy US weapons.
The IAEA is expected to state at its next board of governors meeting on
February 21 that the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has
been broken. This would set the stage for the Security Council to consider
the issue.
North Korea has blocked full IAEA inspections since it threatened to
withdraw from the NPT last March, although it suspended its decision after
holding high-level negotiations with the US. Pyongyang agreed a month ago to
allow a resumption of IAEA inspections to guarantee the continuity of
safeguards. But it has since disagreed with the UN agency on the extent of
the inspections, claiming it does not have to accept the complete
inspections demanded by the agency as its NPT membership is still under
suspension.
Some analysts believe the North is delaying full inspections until the US
formally announces the suspension of military exercises in South Korea this
year and agrees to hold another round of high-level talks on improved
relations. But the US refuses to suspend the annual 'Team Spirit' exercise
and resume discussions with the North until Pyongyang accepts full
inspections and renews talks with South Korea on denuclearisation.

The South Korean government yesterday introduced its third set of measures
within three weeks to cool the Seoul bourse, writes John Burton. The general
share index closed at 974, continuing a rapid climb towards its peak of
1,007, set on April 1 1989.
The latest measures will require institutional investors to buy Won1,000bn
(Pounds 823m) worth of monetary stabilisation bonds in an attempt to divert
funds from the liquidity-driven stock market. They have also reduced the
ceiling on the amount of money individual investors can borrow from
securities houses for stock investment.

<TEXT>
The UN Security Council is considering a radical contraction of its
peacekeeping operation in Somalia (Unosom), after the departure of US forces
in March, and a diminished role for the UN in brokering a political
settlement among Somalia's fractious clans.
Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy to Somalia, said a draft resolution
before the Security Council envisaged a role for UN troops stationed in
Somalia restricted to monitoring voluntary disarmament. It was a tacit
admission that the UN's coercive strategies had failed.
'The UN is correcting its course, and adopting a more realistic approach to
dealing with Somalia's problems,' he said yesterday in Nairobi. 'The period
of coercive disarmament is over.'
In addition, a donors' conference held in the Kenyan capital agreed to work
directly with Somalis in the reconstruction of their country - in effect
sidelining the UN. Politically, too, Unosom has been told to avoid the
flurry of contacts now taking place between Somalia's clans in various
capitals of east Africa.
'Discussions between Somalis are like three-dimen-sional chess,' Mr Oakley
said. 'They may be difficult for outsiders to understand, but it is my
impression that a lot of work is being done, and that differences are being
narrowed.'
Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi, Mogadishu's two rival warlords,
have yet to meet for face-to-face talks, but spokesmen for both sides say
prospects for a political settlement are good.
Aid workers, however, fear Somalia will slide back into anarchy when the
4,000-strong US force departs, preceded by the Belgians and closely followed
by the French, Italian and German contingents.
Many believe the peacekeeping operation will fall apart without the air
defences, communications and logistics provided by the Americans.
Violence has returned. Bomb blasts rocked the town of Baidoa yesterday.
Similar attacks over the past week hit the Christian charity World Vision
and seriously wounded a Colombian aid worker. The charity said yesterday it
was temporarily withdrawing its five expatriate workers. Food warehouses
have been looted in Belet Weyne and aid workers have received death threats
in the southern Jubba Valley, forcing their evacuation.
In Mogadishu, US troops killed three Somalis on Monday when a diplomatic
convoy they were escorting came under fire. Admiral Jonathan Howe, in charge
of the UN operation in Somalia, regretted the violent incidents, but
insisted that most of the country was peaceful.

Japan plans to launch its first home-grown rocket today - an important step
in its long-frustrated attempts to create a world-class aerospace industry,
writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The National Space Development Agency's H-2
rocket is designed to carry a two-tonne load, the world standard for the
satellite industry.
The H-2 is two years behind schedule, after two explosions on the launch
pad, in which an engineer died. At Y19bn (Pounds 113.8m) a launch it costs
at least 50 per cent more than launches by Arianespace, the European space
consortium, or General Dynamics of the US.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry sees the project as vital
to developing aerospace expertise and reducing Japan's heavy dependence on
US aerospace technology.
Government officials stress the H-2 project has no covert military purpose
and Japan will stick to its principles of not making, owning or allowing the
import of nuclear weapons. They were responding to British and US
speculation that North Korea's nuclear weapons programme might tempt Japan
to abandon its own non-nuclear stance.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Deutsche Telekom closer to sell-off: Ariane Genillard on the
bill that provides for the privatisation of posts and telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the privatisation of
Deutsche Telekom, the national telecoms operator, the postal services and
the Postbank.
A bill providing for privatisation of the three companies is due for a first
reading today in the lower chamber of the parliament. It is not expected to
meet resistance in the German legislature as all parties gave their basic
approval to it on Tuesday night.
This follows two years of negotiations between the coalition government and
the opposition Social Democrats, whose support is needed to change the
constitution which defines telecoms and the postal services as state-owned
activities.
The bill is aimed at allowing all three companies to prepare for
privatisation and intensified international competition, recently
highlighted by the European Union's decision to liberalise basic voice
telephony in 1998.
'The law sets the prerequisites for Deutsche Telekom to position itself in
the global telecoms market . . . and strike alliances with foreign
partners,' Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German post and telecommunications
minister, said yesterday after the cabinetapproved the final text.
The law, which is expected to come into force at the beginning of 1995, will
turn the three into joint-stock companies. Deutsche Telekom is expected to
sell on the stock market, starting in 1996, an initial tranche of shares
representing 25 per cent of the company's equity and worth between
DM10bn-DM15bn.
However, as a result of demands made by the SPD, a state-owned holding
company will be created to keep some of the shares of the three companies
temporarily.
In the case of Deutsche Telekom, the holding company will retain a majority
ownership in the five years after the bill becomes law, that is until 2000.
The state is expected to remain the sole shareholder of the postal services
as long as they continue to report losses.
The holding company will also retain 12.5 per cent of the Postbank with
another 12.5 per cent of the bank held by the postal services. Mr Gunter
Schneider, Postbank's chief executive, recently said the bank would
immediately seek equity partners, starting with German savings and loans
institutions with whom it already has co-operation agreements.
Deutsche Telekom, which has conducted an intensive two-year campaign for its
privatisation, has eased concerns that the holding company might have had
too much power over its activities. Officials at Deutsche Telekom now say
the holding company will not significantly hamper their managerial freedom -
a point also stressed by government officials.
Deutsche Telekom urgently needs to raise cash to reduce its DM100bn (Pounds
38bn) debt and continue its DM60bn investment programme in eastern Germany.
Under an agreement between the post and finance ministries, the company will
have to pay, by 1996, DM6.5bn to the postal services and Postbank, whose
losses it is legally required to cover before privatisation. Officials at
the post ministry say Deutsche Telekom will probably have to use a portion
of its privatisation proceeds to do this.
It will also have to accept the creation of an 'infrastructure committee'
made of officials from the federal government and the states. This follows
demands by the SPD for some continued state supervision. The party wants to
ensure that the private companies will not neglect infrastructure
investments in less-populated areas of Germany.
Mr Botsch yesterday said the committee would only be able to suggest new
infrastructure investments and not order them. Moreover, the federal
government would be able to override decisions taken by the states in the
committee.
The government has also had to reckon with the refusal of the SPD to accept
a law which would put a deadline on the monopolies enjoyed by Deutsche
Telekom and the postal services. As a compromise, the law prolonging the
monopolies will end on December 31 1997. 'We call on the legislators to
tackle this question by then,' Mr Botsch said yesterday.
The date coincides with the EU voice telephony liberalisation. However, the
formula also allows German parliamentarians to keep the monopoly of Deutsche
Telekom on its telephone infrastructure and of the postal services after
1997, depending on whether liberalisation has been decided at the European
level.
Mr Botsch said again yesterday that this concerned only the monopoly of the
postal services over regular letter mail. Talks are to be conducted in the
coming weeks between the postal services, the government and mail-order
companies who want mass mailings to be opened to competition.
Officials at the German industry federation, the BDI, said yesterday that
the final bill was satisfactory, especially in light of the difficult
negotiations between the government parties and the SPD.
The package continues to be rejected by the Post trade union which fears for
the jobs of its members and had hoped to persuade the SPD to refuse to agree
to privatisation.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Italian left clears first hurdle: Poll alliance formed but
tough deal on candidates lies ahead

<TEXT>
Selecting candidates to contest Italy's general election next month is the
main issue outstanding following agreement between eight left-wing groupings
in forming a Progressive Alliance.
The agreement, reached late on Tuesday, lays down the broad principles of an
electoral programme. .
As such it has become the first formal alliance for the elections on March
27. However, it will be severely tested as the members, dominated by the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), attempt to hammer out a
deal on candidates.
Under the country's new electoral laws, 75 per cent of the seats in both
houses of parliament will be elected using a first-past-the-post system.
Proportional representation is retained for the rest. The majority voting
system has put a premium on forming alliances, but these will come to
nothing if there is no prior agreement on supporting individual candidates.
The Progressive Alliance is discussing a formula whereby each party or group
will be allocated a quota of candidates entitled to the support of the
alliance as a whole. These would be based on the performance of the party or
group in the 1992 general elections, last year's municipal elections and
opinion polls.
However, the principle of quotas cannot be reconciled easily with the need
to find the best local candidates. The alliance also has to resolve how its
members will vote for the seats awarded by proportional representation.
Apart from the PDS, Tuesday's agreement was signed by the Greens,
Reconstructed Communism (the rump of the Italian Communist party who refused
to renounce Marxist ideals), the Sicily-based clean government movement La
Rete (The Network), the revamped Socialist party under Mr Ottaviano Del
Turco, the Democratic Alliance that includes members of the reformist
referendum movement, the Christian Socialists and a small left independent
grouping.
The document agreed is a five-page summary of policy guidelines for a future
government which are deliberately vague but promise to retain the broad
lines of the outgoing government's economic policy. Privatisation will
continue 'where necessary'.
Italy's inflation in January was running at 4.2 per cent on an annualised
basis, a marginal rise on the December rate and against the declining trend
projected by the government for 1994. The rise was attributed to petrol and
electricity price increases.

Turkey's budget deficit last year was more than double the original target
figure, according to official statistics, John Murray Brown reports from
Istanbul.
It reached TL129,400bn (Pounds 4.9bn), against a target of TL53,000bn,
equivalent to 9 per cent of gross national product. The public sector
borrowing requirement is estimated to have been close to 17 per cent of GNP,
compared with a 9 per cent forecast.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Germany's private steelmakers revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's private-sector steelmakers will today tell Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the
economics minister, that they are not prepared to make any further cuts in
production capacity for flat products, in spite of the European steel
crisis.
The big unsubsidised German producers, including Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch and
Preussag, are up in arms over public-sector subsidies being provided to
other manufacturers, allowing them to maintain unwanted production capacity.
They are particularly furious about the rescue plan for the Klockner-Werke
steel plant in Bremen, which was formally signed on Tuesday, involving a
consortium led by the government of the city-state. The deal, which is under
investigation by the European Commission for hidden public-sector subsidies,
will maintain crude steel capacity of around 3m tonnes.
'This is the legalisation of a catastrophe,' one leading steel producer said
yesterday. 'It means that production capacity is being subsidised in both
Bremen and at Ekostahl (in east Germany), while private manufacturers have
already made huge capacity cuts without any subsidies at all.'
The private steel manufacturers are also angry and bitter about last
December's deal negotiated by all the 12 European Union member states,
allowing substantial subsidised production capacity to be maintained by the
state-owned steel companies in both Italy and Spain.
Today's meeting with Mr Rexrodt is intended to prepare the way for talks on
February 15 with Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner in
Brussels.
'We are looking for a restructuring concept from the industry, but we do not
have any wild expectations that we will get one,' a German Economics
Ministry spokesman said last night. 'We will be urging the private producers
that something more must happen.'
The response seems likely to be blunt. 'We will tell him that we have done
enough,' one producer said. 'None of the unsubsidised producers are prepared
to make more capacity cuts in flat products. That goes for Thyssen,
Krupp-Hoesch, and Preussag, as well as British Steel and Usinor-Sacilor in
France.'
The European Commission's warning on Tuesday that its steel rescue plan was
on the brink of collapse appears to have been aimed at pressuring the
private steelmakers to offer further cuts in production or face a
free-for-all which would lead to more bankruptcies.
'There is a clear message (to the private sector),' a spokesman for Mr Van
Miert said yesterday, 'if you don't do it now, you can forget it.'
'The real problem is structural,' he added. 'It is overcapacity.'

FT  03 FEB 94 / Moscow less in love with west: But foreign policy has no
truck with extreme nationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those in the west who have been watching Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's
ultra-nationalist, tour the former Yugoslavia and talk of secret weapons to
protect Serbs, may well be asking whether his remarks in any way reflect
Russian foreign policy.
The unequivocal answer is that they do not. Mr Zhirinovsky is seen as a
dangerous lunatic by most of Russia's political establishment and his talk
of a secret weapon, denied by the Defence Ministry in Moscow when he last
referred to it a month ago, is not new.
Only on Tuesday, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, reiterated that
his Yugoslav policy was basically unchanged and joked that Mr Zhirinovsky's
one skill was to 'create an atmosphere of hysteria and suspicion'.
Mr Zhirinovsky's remarks, however, do coincide with a change of tone from
Moscow, which more seasoned Russia watchers had been expecting for some time
as an overdue adjustment of policies which had become so unequivocally
pro-western they were no longer sustainable politically.
Nowhere has that change of tone been clearer than from Mr Kozyrev, long
singled out as enemy No. 1 by Russian nationalists who dominate the new
parliament elected in December. Although most ordinary Russians do not share
the strident nationalism of many of their MPs, they display the natural
sensitivities of citizens of a great nation humiliated by the collapse both
of their economy and of the Soviet Union.
Despite western alarm over a non-binding parliamentary vote opposing
military action in the former Yugoslavia, Russia's willingness to continue
supporting what are viewed as increasingly incredible threats by western
governments there is not the best test for judging consistency on foreign
policy.
If anything, long-standing Russian scepticism about the value of air strikes
or other military intervention appears increasingly justified with the
passing of every month these threats are not carried out.
Most Russians do not even care about what happens in former Yugoslavia - its
conflicts are not brought into people's living rooms every night by the sort
of media coverage of Bosnia which is common in the west.
But they could be made to feel upset if east European states, or those of
the Baltics, joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Russia was
left to its own devices.
Last week Mr Kozyrev used a visit to China to announce that he was fed up
with lectures from the west. The week before, he had expressed anger at US
and Baltic protests over comments he had made to say that Russia could not
tolerate western military might filling the 'security vacuum' left open by
retreating Russian forces. With some justification, he said his remarks had
been quoted out of context to alarm the west into thinking Russia would not
withdraw its remaining troops from Estonia and Latvia.
His deputy, Mr Vitaly Churkin, subsequently warned Estonia and Latvia
against trying to stir up western pressure to expedite a Russian troop
withdrawal. He said Russian forces were on their way out, but that Russia
was also entitled to agreements securing the future of retired servicemen
still living in the Baltics, and allowing Russia to continue manning early
warning systems in Estonia.
In a sign of just how jumpy the west has become and how quickly it could
change its mind about Russia, Mr Kozyrev's remarks were enough to alarm
Scandinavian politicians, who are closest to the Baltics, into considering
sharp protests over a perceived change in policy. That was avoided only
thanks to the deft work of Scandinavian diplomats in Moscow.
The main priority for both the west and Russia, say diplomats, is to avoid
any declarations and gestures that might fuel a fire that is being
maintained at a minimum level for domestic Russian purposes.
As one western diplomat pointed out: 'Russia's ideal foreign policy now
would be not to have one at all.'
In practice, Russia's priorities are increasingly focused on two issues: its
economic crisis, and relations with former Soviet republics making up its
so-called 'near abroad'. Their implications for foreign policy are
long-term.
If not brought under control, Russia's economic crisis could bring an
ultra-nationalist similar to Mr Zhirinovsky - but probably not him because
of fears for his stability - to power. Such a figure would undoubtedly turn
against the west and neighbouring states to distract public opinion from
painful economic problems.

Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, yesterday said his
threat that a secret 'death ray' would be used to defend the Serbs, in the
event of western military intervention against Bosnian Serbs, was not a

Mr Slobodan Milosevic, he gave no details about the alleged weapon, but said
he would be testing it overnight in Brcko, north-east Bosnia.

In an attempt to draw attention to the plight of Sarajevo, Mrs Tansu Ciller,
the Turkish prime minister, and Mrs Benazir Bhutto, her Pakistani
counterpart, yesterday visited the besieged Bosnian capital.
In a joint statement, they said: 'It is shocking that this appalling human
tragedy is being enacted in the heart of a continent which prides itself on
its commitment to human rights and respect for human dignity.'
Amid heavy security, the prime ministers, dressed in bullet-proof vests and
military helmets, called on 'the world community to halt the destruction of
Bosnia-Hercegovina and the killing of civilians'. Mrs Bhutto denounced the
violation of the very principles that Europe claimed to represent, as well
as of the United Nations charter which prohibits the violent change of
borders. Their visit coincides with continued reports of increased military
intervention by both Serbia and Croatia, which officially deny any role in
Bosnia's violent partition.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Brussels probes aid to refinery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday opened an investigation into a DM497.2m
(Pounds 189.7m) state aid package granted to Leuna, the east German-based
petrochemical manufacturer, by the Treuhand privatisation agency.
The inquiry is a further blow to plans to rebuild the Leuna refinery
complex, based in Sachsen-Anhalt. Last week, Elf Aquitaine, the oil group
and France's largest company, said it wanted to reduce its stake in Leuna
from 65 per cent to 35 per cent.
The Commission said yesterday it was opening a preliminary inquiry on the
grounds that the aid package amounted to subsidies for modernisation and
operating costs, and could upset the market.
However, it agreed to allow continued financing of Leuna for six months in
order to avoid the risk of bankruptcy. Leuna is undergoing an ambitious
restructuring plan which has seen its workforce drop from more than 25,000
workers to 7,800 over 12 months.
The German authorities argued that the state aid package was vital for the
future of an interlinked east German chemical industry, including a
feedstock supplier and ethylene cracker for Leuna's down-stream production.
But the Commission noted that no such plan had been presented to Brussels.
It has invited all interested parties to present more detailed arguments
before taking a final decision. Meanwhile it sanctioned a DM30m guarantee
for clean-up funds.
Elf's plans to reduce its stake have drawn threats of penalties for breach
of contract from the Treuhand. The remaining stake is held by Thyssen
Handelsunion, which, along with Elf, agreed to invest DM4.8bn to safeguard
1,000 jobs.

FT  03 FEB 94 / West German output better than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German industrial output rose a provisional 0.7 per cent in December
last year, supporting the widespread view that the economy has seen the
worst of the recession.
The improvement followed an unexpectedly sharp drop of 2.1 per cent in
November, when cold weather severely hampered construction work. Milder
conditions in December bolstered output from the building sector by 5 per
cent.
Although the figures were better than expected, the Economics Ministry
warned it expected a downward adjustment when all the data were available.
The warmer weather depressed electricity and gas production by 2 per cent,
but all other sectors showed increases. Output from manufacturing industry,
excluding energy, mining and construction, rose 0.5 per cent.
For last year as a whole, output was 7 per cent down on 1992, but only 2.9
per cent lower in the fourth quarter than a year earlier. Economists said
the figures supported their forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth in west Germany
this year, but stressed they depended on export demand.
Since real incomes were falling, and government spending was being cut, few
saw any prospects of growth in domestic demand. This view was supported
yesterday by figures from the specialist retail trade which showed a real 5
per cent decline in sales in December.
There were also warnings that strikes in the engineering industry could
wreck economic growth prospects. Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the government's
independent economic advisers, said if the current wave of warning strikes
developed into protracted official stoppages, Bonn's hopes of 1.5 per cent
growth in gross domestic product would be dashed.
While the IG Metall union had already rejected employers' calls for a pay
freeze, Mr Pohl suggested real wage cuts were necessary.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Investment trusts poised to raise Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two UK investment trusts specialising in European privatisation stocks look
likely to set new records for investment trust launches, and could raise
more than Pounds 1bn between them.
The public offer for the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust
closed yesterday, and is thought to have put the fund at or near its maximum
size of Pounds 500m, after Pounds 320m was raised through an institutional
placing in January.
The placing for the Mercury European Privatisation Trust closed yesterday,
having also raised in the region of Pounds 320m. The maximum size for the
fund is likely to be set at more than Pounds 500m, to allow for heavy demand
expected during the public offer, which opens today and closes March 2.
The previous record for an investment trust launch was set last December by
another Mercury fund, the World Mining trust, which raised Pounds 425.8m.
Low interest rates are driving UK investors into equity investments. Many
remember the profits from domestic privatisations in the 1980s, and although
European issues are not always as attractively priced, their share
performance should benefit from improved efficiency over time.
The final result of the Kleinwort public offer was not available yesterday.
But Kleinwort said demand had been 'very strong', suggesting the maximum
size of the fund had been reached and that applications may be scaled back.
The basis of allocations will be announced today.
Both trusts plan to take advantage of extensive privatisation programmes in
France, Spain and Italy over the next few years. They will also buy shares
in recently privatised companies, including in the UK, if there are
efficiency gains still to be made.
Mr Paul Harwood, manager of the Mercury fund, described it as a specialised
European recovery fund. He said that stagging new issues - buying during the
initial offer and selling immediately for a profit - was not an important
part of the fund's strategy. Most holdings would be longer term.

Renault, the French state-owned car group, has sold more than half of its
shares in the parent company of Volvo, its first move to reduce the complex
cross-shareholdings between the two groups since the collapse of their
planned merger last December.
The block of 3.2m Volvo B shares was understood to have been sold to a
number of institutional investors at SKr655 a share, valuing the deal at
close to SKr2.1bn (Pounds 177m).
Renault said the decision to cut its stake in AB Volvo, the parent company
of the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, from 8.27 per cent to 3.45
per cent was financially motivated.
It said its voting rights had only been reduced from just under 10 per cent
to 8.76 per cent. The sale had not affected its shareholdings of 45 per cent
in Volvo's truck activities and 25 per cent in its car operations.
However, the share disposal follows the dismantling of several agreements
between Renault and Volvo over the past few weeks.
Renault and Volvo entered into a far-reaching alliance in 1990, but plans
for a full merger collapsed in December in the face of a shareholder revolt
in Sweden.
Renault said its shareholding in AB Volvo was not covered by the 1990
agreement, and since the collapse of the merger it had been treating the
stake like any other investment.
The timing of the sale had been determined by the strength of Volvo's share
price, which had risen by around 70 per cent since the merger plan
collapsed.
Renault has made an estimated capital gain of about FFr750m (Pounds 84.45m)
from the share disposal.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the sale of Renault's stake would
not affect the continuing dialogue between the two companies over areas for
collaboration.
However, industry observers said the sale confirmed that the two companies
intended to maintain only a limited commercial relationship. 'This is an
almost inevitable step in the parting of the ways,' said Mr Bob Barber,
motor industry analyst at James Capel in London. 'In due course we will
probably see the cross-shareholdings unwinding, but it is hard to predict
how quickly.'
Last month Renault announced it had agreed with Volvo to dissolve combined
purchasing and quality control organisations.
Volvo's B shares continued to rise yesterday, gaining SKr17 to close at
SKr692.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Mayhew plans fresh Ulster move: Downing Street to bring
forward new ideas for devolved government in the province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The British government will within the next two weeks bring forward fresh
proposals for a new political settlement in Northern Ireland in a move
calculated to wrest back the initiative from Sinn Fein.
As the government stepped up its efforts to limit the impact of this week's
highly publicised visit to the US by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he would put forward
fresh ideas for devolved government in the province and formal mechanisms
for enhancing cross-border co-operation.
Sir Patrick repeated the invitation to Sinn Fein to enter exploratory
discussions within three months of a permanent end to violence.
But he strongly rejected accusations from some Ulster politicians that the
government was dragging its feet on the parallel search for a political
settlement. He said the talks process was 'alive and well' and ready to move
into higher gear.
His remarks came amid growing signs of impatience over Sinn Fein's position
from Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Reynolds said
yesterday: 'I have spent some time now in giving out an abundance of
clarifications and I think the time is coming when I expect to get some
clarification in return.'
Sir Patrick emphasised the planned framework for a political settlement
would simultaneously involve both the so-called 'strand one' discussions -
on internal political arrangements for the province - and 'strand two' - the
relationships between the province and the Irish Republic.
The province's constitutional parties now wanted to see 'focus and
direction' given to talks which so far had been exploratory and disparate,
he said. They would continue on the same bilateral basis as the discussions
suspended at the end of 1992. Round-table talks, he added, were not yet
wanted by any of the participants.
The hard-line Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, has
said it will not rejoin bilateral or round-table discussions if meetings
continue between Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour party.
The devolution plans embrace proposals for a new assembly, which has already
attracted some measure of agreement between the parties. Sir Patrick
emphasised both governments were anxious for a return to devolved government
in the province.
But he also moved to reassure unionists that talks about cross-border
co-operation, including the possible establishment of new executive boards,
would not involve any joint authority. He said: 'Joint authority over
Northern Ireland is not on at all. Nobody is going to pretend that the
majority of people living in Northern Ireland are going to agree to joint
authority.'
But he emphasised there were many opportunities for joint action in areas
such as tourism and the environment.
Winding up his US tour, Mr Adams promised he would make 'concrete' decisions
soon on his party's role in the peace process.
Earlier, Downing Street accused him of laying a 'smokescreen of evasions and
falsehoods'. It welcomed President Bill Clinton's call for Sinn Fein to
support the joint declaration, which it said showed the US administration
was not going to be 'sidetracked' by Sinn Fein.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Public sector rises 'mean real pay cut'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay rises of between 2 per cent and 3.25 per cent, which are expected to be
recommended today for more than 1.5m public sector workers, represent a cut
in real disposable income, according to a report published yesterday.
The Institute of Fiscal Studies analysis says that a worker on slightly
below average earnings will need a pay rise of about 5 per cent to maintain
spending power once inflation and tax rises are taken into account.
The cabinet is expected this morning to endorse the recommendations of the
public sector pay review bodies covering nurses, teachers, doctors, the
armed forces and top public officials. Rises of more than 3 per cent may be
phased in.
The increases, however, are still higher than the government would have
liked - it has imposed a three-year freeze on the public sector pay bill.
It said the increases may have to be paid for in productivity improvements,
which could involve job losses and cuts in services.
Separately, Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, used a
parliamentary written answer to emphasise that the government expected pay
rises in all public sector pay groups in 1994-95 to be funded by efficiency
improvements.
The IFS analysis, undertaken for pay analysts Industrial Relations Services,
shows that a worker on Pounds 12,750 a year will pay an extra 2.83 per cent
of income in tax by April 1995 as a result of last November's budget.
With an inflation forecast of at least 2 per cent next year, that means a
pay rise of 5 per cent would be required to maintain current disposable
income.
For a lower paid worker, such as a nurse paid Pounds 8,250 a year, the tax
take will be 2.38 per cent.
IRS said that a higher inflation rate next year and the effect of the tax
changes would increase pay expectations in the private sector, and could
account for the government's acceptance of pay review body recommendations.
Union officials have expressed their fear that the pay bill freeze and this
year's pay recommendations will result in a change in the review bodies'
remit.
The IRS said that although private sector pay rises have averaged 2 per cent
in the past five months, several companies in the finance sector have
awarded rises substantially higher. Sun Life of Canada has made merit awards
averaging 6 per cent to clerical and administrative staff, while American
Express has allocated 4 per cent of its pay rise total to merit reviews.

FT  03 FEB 94 / Japan to boost economy with Pounds 107bn tax cut: Coalition
threatened as SDP says it will quit unless plan is modified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A triumphant Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, early this
morning announced an income tax cut worth Y18,000bn (Pounds 107.8bn) over
the next three years in an attempt to lift the economy out of its worst
recession since the second world war.
The cost of the plan, however, has been heightened instability within the
fragile seven-party coalition. Hours after the announcement, the Social
Democratic party, the largest but least dependable member, said that it
opposed the package and threatened to quit the government unless the plan is
modified. The SDP, formerly called Socialists, campaigned in last July's
general election on a promise not to increase sales tax - one of the planks
of the package.
Mr Hosokowa is now looking to support from the opposition Liberal Democratic
party, with which he is co-operating on economic and trade policy, to enable
him to outvote coalition rebels. This adds weight to the theory that a large
centre-right coalition, including most of the present alliance plus
pro-reformists from the LDP and socialists, is developing.
The package had little initial impact on the stock market. The Nikkei 225
average was about 60 points below Wednesday's close of 20,250.03.
The government plans a Y6,000bn overall tax cut this year, including
Y5,300bn of income tax reductions plus Y700bn of cuts in corporation tax,
car sales tax surcharge and inheritance tax. All, except the car sales tax,
will be backdated to January 1 - but financed by a rise in consumption tax.
The measures form the centrepiece of a package of tax cuts, government
spending and low-cost loans, worth at least an estimated Y14,000bn, to be
published later today.
It will be Japan's largest ever pump-priming package, coming after three
earlier stimulus plans in the past 14 months, together worth just over
Y30,000bn. 'This will increase household incomes and stimulate the economy,'
said Mr Hosokawa.
The income tax cut will be partly financed by a 7 per cent 'people's welfare
tax' which will replace the current 3 per cent sales levy - the equivalent
of the European Union's value added tax - from April 1 1997.
Mr Hosokawa admitted that members of his own Japan New party also had doubts
about the sales tax rise.
Last week's agreement between the government and the opposition over
far-reaching plans for political reform cleared the way for the package,
which had been held up by the reform debate.
The tax announcement is a victory for Japan's powerful finance ministry,
which had insisted that an income tax cut must come with a rise in sales
tax. This is needed partly to avoid straining a state budget already
suffering from a drop in tax revenues used by the recession. The government
is also planning to raise liquor taxes for the first time in 10 years,
officials said.
The income tax cut is by far the largest in recent years, although it is
line with what markets were expecting. It will be welcomed by Japan's
anxious business community and is designed to deflect US pressure for
numerically measured increases in market share for imports. Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, and Mr W. Bowman Cutter, Washington's
chief trade negotiator with Japan, in Tokyo yesterday completed an
apparently fruitless day of negotiations for numerically targeted increases
in imports.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Boxmore expands with Pounds 13.4m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boxmore International, the Ulster-based plastic packaging manufacturer, is
expanding into mainland Britain through the acquisition of Label Research, a
manufacturer of pharmaceutical labels, for a maximum Pounds 13.4m.
The deal will enable USM-quoted Boxmore to manufacturer and distribute
packaging, leaflets and labels for health care products throughout the UK
and Ireland.
Mr Harold Ennis, chairman and chief executive, said the companies had agreed
terms after four months of negotiation.
Boxmore is paying an initial Pounds 10.1m, satisfied by the placing of 3.15m
shares at 250p and the allotment of 805,707 shares, 2.94 per centof the
enlarged group, which the vendors are retaining. There will be a
furtherprofit-related payment of up to Pounds 3.3m, satisfied by loan notes
or shares.
Label reported profits of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.08m) for the year to June
30 on turnover of Pounds 4.88m (Pounds 4.54m).
Boxmore is also raising Pounds 3.21m before expenses to help fund capital
spending through the placing of 1.29m shares, also at 250p.
Existing shareholders can apply for all the placing shares on a 1-for-5
basis. Credit Lyonnais Laing is underwriting the placing and open offer.
Boxmore has also declared a second interim for 1993, in lieu of a final, of
2.75p, making 4p (3.65p) for the year. The payment, said Mr Ennis, reflected
a strong second half performance. Pre-tax profits for 1993 are expected to
increase 21 per cent to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 3.6m).
The shares closed up 9p at 293p.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Jordan hit by scare over food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Claims by a minister that most food and medicines imported into Jordan are
unfit for human consumption has sparked a health scare there.
The health minister, Dr Abdul Rahim Malhas, alleged western countries were
dumping unfit produce on the local market through corrupt drug and food
merchants.
The allegations may damage the kingdom's reputation as an exporter. Saudi
Arabia, one of Jordan's largest markets, and Sudan have banned the import of
Jordanian pharmaceuticals after the scare; Iraq is said to have turned back
a shipment of food.
Retailers complain that goods are being left on shelves as panic sets in.
European food exporters say containers of perishable goods are stuck waiting
for clearance while the government decides what to do.
Today, the lower house of parliament is to hold a special session on the
issue.
In an interview with a local newspaper, Dr Malhas claimed 'the garbage of
the industrialised world' was being dumped on Jordan and existing
legislation was insufficient to protect the consumer.
European exporters and diplomats admitted there were problems with the
quality of consumer goods on the market but that existing regulations for
food imports are stricter than normal international specifications.
The government has said it will look into the issue through committees, but
privately is fuming at the minister's allegations.
The decision by Saudi Arabia and Sudan to ban imports of Jordanian drugs and
the increasing frustration from European exporters trying to bring food in
have intensified the debate.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Canadians to launch big social security review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's new Liberal government has launched a review of the social security
system with a view to trimming costs, targeting programmes more effectively
to people in real need and bringing more people into the workforce.
Mr Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister, told parliament he expected to
introduce legislation by next Christmas to reform programmes such as
unemployment insurance, social welfare and government-funded training
schemes.
In addition, the government plans to follow the example of several European
countries by examining innovative job-creation proposals such as
work-sharing through a shortened work week.
'The objective is to find out what really works so people can work,' Mr
Axworthy says.
Canada has one of the world's most generous social-safety systems, ranging
from unemployment insurance benefits of up to CDollars 445 (Pounds 227) a
week, to taxpayer-funded, universal healthcare.
But spiralling costs have intensified pressure for reforms. Social security,
health care and education now make up about 60 per cent of federal and
provincial spending. In particular, existing programmes are criticised for
their bias towards 'hand-outs' rather than incentives to coax able-bodied
welfare recipients back into the workforce.
Mr Axworthy said the government would draw up its proposals after the widest
possible consultations, including a series of public conferences, a
parliamentary committee, and negotiations with the 10 provinces.
Several of the programmes are administered by the provinces, with financial
contributions from Ottawa. These transfer payments have become a growing
point of friction, as the federal government has sought to lighten its
burden while maintaining uniform standards across the country.
Several provinces have already begun to overhaul their own social-assistance
schemes. Alberta has taken the route of across-the-board spending cuts.
Newfoundland, with a 20 per cent unemployment rate, plans to replace welfare
payments with a guaranteed minimum income which can be supplemented with
earnings from a job.
New Brunswick has launched a 'workfare' project which makes welfare payments
conditional on participation in intensive training courses.

Leaders of Germany's 3.4m-strong IG Metall engineering workers' union
yesterday indicated a readiness to compromise in their current pay dispute,
as more than 140,000 workers downed tools in brief token strikes.
Mr Walter Riester, deputy leader of the union, gave a clear hint that he
would consider flexible deals for individual enterprises, and drop the
current union demand for a 5.5 per cent pay rise, in exchange for measures
to ensure greater job security.
He still insisted that there must be at least a nominal wage increase, as
against the outright pay freeze sought by Gesamtmetall, the engineering
employers' federation.
He was speaking as workers across the country downed tools for up to three
hours in support of the pay claim, more than double the 60,000 who took part
on Monday. However, few observers believe the union would endanger jobs with
a full-scale strike.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Turkish interbank rate at 600% as turmoil persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's interbank rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other, reached
600 per cent yesterday as turmoil continued in the money markets.
Government initiatives have failed to halt the turbulence, which began after
the devaluation of the lira last week and the resignation on Monday of the
central bank governor, Mr Bulent Gultekin.
Several big retail banks increased interest rates yesterday, with Akbank,
the largest privately-owned bank raising rates by 2 percentage points to 90
per cent on one-year deposits. Lending rates are between 120 and 150 per
cent.
The crisis has forced the government back to the domestic debt markets,
after limiting its short-term borrowing to reduce budget costs during 1993.
The treasury has now announced a series of short-term bill issues aimed at
absorbing the liquidity largely created by its own growing demand for
short-term advances from the central bank. Those short-term advances were
cited by Mr Gultekin as the main reason behind the pressure on the lira, and
the subsequent 12 per cent devaluation.
The governor had reportedly sought a 30 per cent devaluation.
The government has also unveiled a novel index-linked government debt
instrument, which will be half repayable in dollars after three months at a
rate of 20,500 to the lira. The dollar closed yesterday at 17,200.

Italy's second big public privatisation was closed ahead of schedule last
night after heavy oversubscription for shares in Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
According to the Rome-based financial services group, about 350,000
applications were received from Italian investors on Monday and Tuesday. The
demand covered about 350m shares - almost five times the amount of stock
offered to domestic retail investors.

Shares in Banesto lost 57 per cent of their pre-crisis value yesterday when
they were re-listed after a five-week suspension.
In hectic trading on Madrid's Bolsa, the stock closed at Pta855 after
opening at Pta800 and hitting a high of Pta894. At the closing price its
market value was about Pta147bn (Dollars 1bn). The stock was suspended at
Pta1,995 on December 28.
Nearly 5m Banesto shares were traded yesterday - at least 10 times more than
a high volume day before the suspension. The closing price surprised both
Bolsa dealers and Banesto's management.
Dealers said yesterday that foreigners were net sellers. They were matched
by domestic buyers willing to speculate that Banesto's value was above that
intimated by the rescue plan.
'If you are very rigorous, Banesto shares are worth at the very most
Pta700,' said Mr Juan Bastos, of Madrid securities house Ibersecurities.
'This has been a one day wonder, or it could be a month long wonder, but the
logic is that Banesto's price must come down,' said Mr Frederick Artessani,
head of foreign trading at stock brokers Benito y Monjardin.

BK Vision, a Swiss financial investment company, is raising SFr480m (Dollars
327.42) in its third rights issue in less than two years.
The company also revealed in its 1993 annual report that it had reduced its
stake in CS Holding, the financial group built around Credit Suisse, and
that Rolex, the Geneva watchmaking group, was one of its leading
shareholders.
Mr Martin Ebner, chairman, said the rights issue, which follows a SFr220m
call last July and a SFr200m one in August, 1992, was a response to market
demand. BK shares are trading at a 13.5 per cent premium to their net asset
value.
The company said proceeds of the one-for-four issue at SFr1,600 per bearer
share, SFr320 per registered share, would be used for investment.
Thanks to the strong performance of thebank and its insurance company
shares, BK had a spectacular year. Net asset value jumped 74.5 per cent to
SFr1.3bn, or SFr1,696 per share, at year-end, while the bearer shares nearly
doubled to SFr2,000.
Gross income soared to SFr366.3m from SFr62.8m, mainly as a result of
disposals of Leu Holding and Banca del Gottardo shares. Administration
expenses, mainly performance-related commission fees paid to BZ Trust, the
company's manager, soared to SFr250.1m from SFr6.5m.
BK continued to build its stake in Union Bank of Switzerland, where it isnow
by far the largest single shareholder with 9.6 per cent of the total equity,
worth SFr1.8bn at the end of last year. UBS shares account for 69.3 per cent
of BK's portfolio.
It reduced its stake in CS Holding, which it acquired inan exchange for its
Leu Holding shares in November. Mr Ebner said he did not believe it was
right for BK to become a substantial shareholder in two large Swissbanks.
In line with last year's amendments to Swiss company law, the annual report
revealed that Rolex Holding was the main partner of BZ Group in controlling
BK Vision. The two each hold 27.8 per cent of the registered shares (10 per
cent of the total capital). Rolex, owned by the Wilsdorf Foundation, would
saynothing about its investment.

Istit uto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, reported a 29
per cent leap in operating earnings in preliminary results issued yesterday.
They reflectthe effects of absorbing two big regional banking subsidiaries.
The merger with Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda, the two banks
controlled by San Paolo in the Lombardy region, formally took place on
January 1 this year.
However, the bank said San Paolo's preliminary results for 1993 had been
calculated as if the deal had taken place a year earlier, as expenses
related to the transaction were incurred entirely in 1993.
Operating profit soared 29 per cent to L2,300bn (Dollars 1.4bn), while total
financial assets under management climbed 6.5 per cent to L189,500bn. Fee
income surged 20 per cent to L5,800bn, reflecting last year's strong growth
in earnings from securities. Interest income, meanwhile, rose by just 2.5
per cent to L4,000bn.
San Paolo said the proportion of non-performing loans, including mortgages,
which account for about 40 per cent of the loan book, had risen to 4.3 per
cent of the total.
Lending from the bank's domestic branches was virtually stagnant, with a 0.6
per cent fall to L78,300bn.
The total loan book, including foreign loans, rose 6.5 per cent to
L102,400bn. Deposits at domestic branchesclimbed 10.3 per cent to L82,500bn.
Consolidated figures for the group - which includes the Crediop long-term
lending institution, San Paolo's foreign subsidiaries, and specialised
domestic subsidiaries in areas such as investment banking - will not be
released until April.

probed

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US congressional investigators have launched an inquiry into the involvement
of J. P. Morgan's Corsair Fund with Banesto, and are questioning the overall
safety of 'vulture funds' that invest in troubled banks, writes George
Graham in Washington.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking
committee, wrote this week to Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairmanof J. P.
Morgan, and to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to
demand an explanation of Corsair's links with Banesto and of how the Fed
supervises bank vulture funds.
'The Corsair Fund was the first vulture fund approved by the Federal
Reserve, and it invested solely in a bank that later failed. The committee
wants to know exactly what happened to Corsair's investment in order to
determine if future vulture funds should be approved,' Mr Gonzalez said.
Morgan describes Corsair as a long-term investor in undervalued banks and
financial institutions, not as a vulture fund, which usually buys the
securities of companies already in trouble. Corsair invested Dollars 175m in
Banesto.
Mr Gonzalez has already launched an investigation into a Dollars 255m
deposit with Banesto made by US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based
institution which actsas a sort of central bank to other credit unions.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Volatile comeback for Banesto -
The bank's return to the bourse may be premature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resumption of share trading in Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, on
Madrid's Bolsa yesterday was as volatile as its rescue plan is
controversial.
Despite a warning by Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto's provisional chairman, that
the true worth of the bank's share was its adjusted par value of Pta400,
down from Pta700, they opened at Pta800 amid heavy volume.
'It's an absolute punt, a casino bet,' said Madrid broker MrRobert Maxwell
whose firm, Maxwell and Espinosa, had been actively trading Banesto paper in
the off-the-floor 'grey' market before the stock was re-listed.
Banesto's existing shareholders, which include US institutions, the US
investment bank J. P. Morgan and former members of Banesto's board, were,
meanwhile, angered by the prospect that they would be barred from exercising
pre-emptiverights in the capital increase that forms part of the bank's
rescue plan.
The Corsair Fund, a portfolio managed by J. P. Morgan, invested Dollars 175m
in a Banesto rights issue last year, paying Pta1,900 a share, to acquire
some 8 per centof the bank's equity. The rescue plan's re-capitalisation
threatens to dilute the Corsair funds stake in Banesto to around 2 per cent.
'At this point in time I have no idea who has got what rights,' said a
lawyer representing large Banesto shareholders. 'I can't understand how the
shares are being quoted again when nobody knows the full details of a rescue
plan which has still to be approved by Banesto's annual general meeting.'
The trading volatility reflected the absence of any detailed statement about
Banesto's past problems, and about its future prospects. The bank's former
board, which was accused of gross mismanagement, was sacked by the Bank of
Spain on December 28. The new team appointed to run Banesto has established
that the bank has gross financing requirements of Pta605bn (Dollars 4.2bn).
It also mirrored intense speculation that Banestowill, as a result of the
rescue plan, end up as a subsidiary unit of one the large domestic banking
groups. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which has seconded senior executives,
including Mr Saenz, to provisionally run Banesto, is one candidate to
control the bank. Banco Santander, the strategic leader of Spanish banks, is
another.
The rescue plan, agreed between Mr Saenz, the Bank of Spain and the domestic
banks, has Banesto itself providing a total of Pta320bn towards restoring
its balance sheet. This will be done by allocating all its Pta244bn reserves
to provisions, reducing the par value of its individual shares and writing
down further provisions over time.
The Bank of Spain and the private banks will contribute to the rescue by
acquiring, on an equal basis, non-performing debtsthat Banesto is unable to
cover, to a value of Pta285bn. The domestic banks will also finance a
Pta180bn capital increase for Banesto, which will be underwritten on their
behalf by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, FGD.
Under the terms ofthe rescue plan, the FGD will publicly auction its Banesto
equity within a year. During the auction, which could take place as early as
this summer, the FGD will reserve a controlling tranche of Banesto shares
for sale to a domestic strategic buyer, either to a bank or to a pool of
banks.
A senior official saidthat only the FGD would underwrite the Pta180bn
capital increase, paying the par value of Pta400, because the private banks
were taking on a considerable portion of Banesto's bad debts. However, he
said existing shareholders could exercisetheir rights when the the FGD
auctioned its Banesto equity later this year.
As well as contesting the FGD's monopoly to re-capitalise Banesto, the
bank's largest existing shareholders are questioning the valuation of the
bank's assets, which the new management says have to be written down.

Italy's second big public privatisation was closed ahead of schedule last
night after heavy oversubscription for shares in Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano.
According to the Rome-based financial services group, about350,000
applications were received from Italian investors on Monday and Tuesday, the
first two days of the public offer.
The demand covered about 350m shares - almost five times the amount of stock
offered to domestic retail investors, who have been been allocated 75m of
the 200m IMI shares being floated.
The demand is well ahead of the first day's response to the sale of shares
in Credito Italiano last month, and suggests the government's privatisation
drive is gathering momentum.
The response to the IMI issue belies initial doubts among ministers that the
company would be hard to sell to retail investors because of its relative
unfamiliarity and lack of a big branch network.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, one of France's largest holding companies, yesterday saw its shares
rise sharply on speculation that it is close to selling Victoire, the French
insurance company.
The shares closed FFr5.50higher at FFr361 following a newspaper report that
BAT Industries, the UK insurance and tobacco conglomerate, was poised to
acquire Victoire.
Suez and BAT declined to comment.
Victoire's ownership has been clouded by speculation since last autumn's
deal whereby Suez took full control of the company by acquiring the minority
stake held by Union des Assurances de Paris in part exchange for control of
Colonia, the German insurer.
Victoire is the fifth largest insurance company in France and has been
valued by analysts at about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.5bn). It was until recently
one of the more robust members of the recession-scarred French insurance
industry but last year suffered from the problems at Baltica, the troubled
Danish insurer in which it has a holding.
A sharp fall is expected in Victoire's 1993 net profits. It has reported a
41 per cent fall in net interim profits to FFr275m in the first half of the
year fromFFr470m in the same period of 1992.

fourth quarter

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the troubled US photographic equipment manufacturer,
yesterday reported a 33 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income.
The drop, however, was due largely to lower profits at chemicals operations
which were recently spun off and one-time gains in 1992. The company
reported net earnings of Dollars 201m, or 61 cents a share, down from
Dollars 299m, or 92 cents, a year ago. Revenues dipped to Dollars 4.5bn from
Dollars 4.6bn.
Fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations totalled Dollars 203m, or
62 cents, down from Dollars 251m, or 77 cents, in the same period of last
year, when the group had a 23 cents a share gain from the sale of Eastman
Kodak Credit Corporation and other investments.
Kodak, which has suffered a lacklustre profits record for years, ousted its
chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, last summer and replaced him with Mr George
Fisher, formerly chairman of Motorola.
For the full year it reported a netloss of Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 4.62 a
share, due mainly to the adoption of new accounting standards, compared with
net earnings of Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.53, in 1992.
Mr Fi sher said that excluding special charges, 'the fundamentals show we
are beginning to make real progress in reducing our cost base, improving
productivity and strengthening our financial position'.
Earnings from operations in itsthree continuing businesses - imaging,
information and health - had increasedsignificantly for the year, including
a 20 per cent gain in the fourth quarter,as manufacturing productivity
improved and marketing, administration and research costs all declined.
He said the company was well ahead of its plan to achieve Dollars 2.8bn in
cash flow by the end of 1995, which would increase operating flexibility and
allow the company to pay down debt.
In the fourth quarter, earnings in the imaging division dipped 5 per cent,
from Dollars 316m to Dollars 299m, while information turned a Dollars 12m
loss into a Dollars 22m profit. Profits from the health care side rose 57
per cent, from Dollars 123m to Dollars 193m, while the discontinued
chemicals business saw a 59 per cent drop to Dollars 45m.

Research Machines, a privately-owned computer manufacturer based in
Oxfordshire, returned to profit following restructuring and a change of
business strategy.
The company had been a leading supplier of computers to the education sector
since its inception, but had been trying to expand into the business market.
Now it has decided to refocus on education.
In the year to September 30 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.53m,
compared with a loss of Pounds 6.6m for the previous year when substantial
restructuring costs were incurred.
Turnover rose slightly from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 66.2m. Basic earnings per
share were 12.4p (32.2p losses), or 11.3p fully diluted.
Operating costs were reduced by Pounds 3.8m during the year as operations
were consolidated on a single site. The company had gross cash balances of
Pounds 6.6m at the year-end.

The balance will be satisfied through a mixture of cash, the issue of shares
to the vendors, a loan from British Land and bank borrowing. British Land
will initially receive 5m shares and has the option on a further 16.7m as
repayment of Pounds 2m of the loan.
Premier said that as a result of the deals its rental income would exceed
all debt servicing and overhead costs.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ex-Lands seeks Pounds 20m to fund property
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ex-Lands, the property and leisure company, yesterday announced a placing
and open offer to raise a net Pounds 19.85m for the acquisition of a
substantial property portfolio.
The group, whose largest shareholders are the Saatchi brothers, is
topurchase Londinium Investments for Pounds 16.5m, providing it with a
number of office and industrial properties with annual rental income of
Pounds 1.9m.
Ex-Landsis issuing 35.28m new shares at 36p, compared with yesterday's
closing price of42 1/2 p, and Pounds 7.05m of 7.5 per cent convertible loan
stock. The shares are beingoffered to existing shareholders on a 3-for-10
basis and Pounds 3 of loan stock for every 50 ordinary shares.
This is the company's second share issue in sixmonths, as management reacts
to what it describes as a highly favourable climate for property
acquisitions. In July last year, the company launched a Pounds 14.3m open
offer and placement to pay for several properties in southern England.
Londinium owns 13 industrial/office properties around London, with a gross
asset value of Pounds 12.5m. In addition, it has agreed to acquire several
properties inthe Great Western Trading Estate, Brentford, for Pounds 4.75m.
Ex-Lands will pay Pounds 16.5m for the combined assets, of which Pounds
10.4m will be utilised to pay off Londinium's existing debt.
Following the acquisition, Ex-Land's gross rental income will be increased
to Pounds 3.6m, based on current rental rates.
The company is also involved in a number of golf course projects in
continental Europe.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Margins improvement helps Adscene jump 50%
to Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An improvement in operating margins - from 15 to 19.5 per cent - helped
Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, lift pre-tax
profits by 50 per cent in the half-year to November 27. The shares rose 10p
to 300p.
The increase from Pounds 946,000 to Pounds 1.42m, was, said Mr Harry
Lambert, chairmanand chief executive, 'a result of the progress in the
publishing division', which in turn was a result of increases in advertising
revenues.
Operatingprofits for the division advanced 52 per cent to Pounds 1.27m
(Pounds 836,000) on turnover up 10 per cent from Pounds 5.84m to Pounds
6.4m. Mr Lambert said that of this figure, about Pounds 6m derived from
advertising revenue and the balance from copy sales. Revenues climbed 18 per
cent in Kent, where all the titles are free; by 6 per cent inLincolnshire,
where all but one are paid-for; but fell by 7 per cent in London,where half
are paid-for and half free.
Revenue from recruitment advertising rose 41 per cent across the group, and
though Mr Lambert said the rise in Kent had been 80 per cent, it had been
from a very low base. Revenue from retail advertising grew 18 per cent and
from motor advertising 11 per cent, and these 'meant much more in revenue
terms', he said.
Circulations of the paid-fornewspapers had fallen in line with the decline
across the industry, said Mr Lambert, though circulation revenue was higher,
as some cover prices were raised.
Profits for the printing division fell 20 per cent to Pounds 189,000 (Pounds
237,000) on turnover down 17 per cent to Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 1.28m). Mr
Lambert said he thought the market was beginning to 'firm up' with the
bottom of the cycle already reached.
Group turnover was 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 7.11m); earnings
rose to 6.15p (4.54p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p
(1.8p).

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Japanese raising up to Pounds 250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fleming Japanese Investment Trust has placed Pounds 94.9m of a conversion
share issue with institutions, and is seeking to raise up to a further
Pounds 155.1m through a public offer, closing on February 23.
The trust is the largest in its sector, with net assets of Pounds 288m at
the end of 1993.
The maximum issue size has been set fairly high at Pounds 250m to avoid the
necessity of scaling down applications. Conversion of C shares into ordinary
shares is due to take place between mid-March and the end of June, once 90
per cent of the new funds have been invested.
On conversion, one free warrant will be issued with every five ordinary
shares, to rank equally with existing warrants, which are trading at about
140p.
Expenses for the issue are capped at 1.7 per cent, meaning that the 100p
shares will have a net asset value of 98.4p or more.
The existing ordinary shares have been trading at a premium to net asset
value of almost 8 per cent.
The C share issue was planned to take advantage of the weakness in the Tokyo
stock market and buy in cheaply while the Nikkei index was trading at less
than half its peak level. On Monday, the Nikkei climbed 7.8 per cent in one
day on news that parliament had passed a political reform package.
However, Mr Patrick Thompson of Fleming Investment Management, said the
rally was unlikely to continue at the same rate.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MY expands via Insight purchase - Placing
and open offer to fund acquisition heralds full listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in MY Holdings climbed 10p to 61p yesterday after the specialist
packaging company announced plans to buy Insight, the carton manufacturer,
for up to Pounds 21.3m.
The acquisition, funded by a Pounds 23m placing and open offer, is expected
to promote the company from the USM to the Official List and more than
double its market capitalisation to Pounds 45.8m.
Under the transaction, MY is acquiring Insight for Pounds 19.3m,
pendingpre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in the 12 months to December 31 last
year.
MY will pay the Kent-based group a further Pounds 2m if its pre-tax profits
exceed Pounds 2.5m this year. In the interim period, the balance of Pounds
3.75m raised by the placing and offer will be used as short-term working
capital.
Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the deal marked the culmination of a
two-year search for a substantial acquisition opportunity.
Insight, which reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
2m on turnover of Pounds 12.1m in 1992, would broaden MY's customer base and
raise its profile in the packaging industry, he said.
He predicted that the enlarged group, employing more than 700 workers at10
UK plants, would enjoy a 25 per cent increase in turnover.
Shareholders were also promised an interim dividend of at least 0.5p in
respect of the year to August 28.
As part of the deal, Tawneydown - a wholly owned subsidiary of Malbak, MY's
South African parent company - will take up 21.9m of the 44.2m new ordinary
shares being issued at the offer price of 52p.
The remaining 42.3 per cent on Tawneydown's entitlement, some 16m new
ordinary shares, will be placed with institutions by Hambros Bank, which is
sponsoring the deal.
Once the acquisition and placing have been completed, Malbak's stake in MY
will fall from 85.7 per cent to 65 per cent.
Existing shareholders would be offered a clawback on the outstanding 6.3m
shares, Hambros said.
Mr Terry Neill, Insight's managing director and majority shareholder, will
retain 2.6m new ordinary shares as part of the transaction.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stronger fourth quarter lifts Marine
Midland to Dollars 173m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marine Midland Bank, the US retail banking subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
yesterday disclosed a 59 per cent rise in post-tax profits to Dollars 173.2m
(Pounds 115.4m) for 1993, despite losing Dollars 203m on home mortgage
servicing contracts.
The bank, continuing its recovery from high levels of bad debt, raised
fourth quarter post-tax profits by 27 per cent to Dollars 45.4m (Dollars
35.6m). It made no provisions for loan losses in the quarter, and released
provisions of Dollars 115m in the year.
The bank lost Dollars 12m (Dollars 1.1m) in mortgage servicing fees in the
fourth quarter, suffering from having to write down the value of servicing
rights as consumers re-financed home mortgages because of falling US
interest rates.
Mr James Cleave, president and chief executive officer, said Marine, a
regional bank operating in New York state, had raised profitability. It had
reduced non-accruing loans and mortgage servicing rights to below industry
benchmarks.
Allowances for loan losses in the balance sheet fell by 34 per cent to
Dollars 350m (Dollars 529.9m), but cover against non-accruing loans rose
from 75 per cent to 102 per cent. Non-accruing loans fell by 51 per cent to
Dollars 341.4m (Dollars 697.8m).
Interest-earning assets rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 15.2bn (Dollars
14.6bn), and the bank's tier one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted
assets rose to 10.1 per cent at the year-end from 9.1 per cent at the end of
1992.
Return on common equity for the year rose to 14.1 per cent (9.9 per cent)
and return on assets rose to 1.03 per cent (0.66 per cent).
Moody's Investor Services said, following the results announcement, that it
was raising Marine Midland's debt rating from BAA1 to A3.
HSBC shares closed up 23p at Pounds 10.14p.

Talks between Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, and its bankers over the
extension of its standstill agreement were continuing yesterday.
The standstill on Queens' Pounds 1.3bn of debt expired at midnight on
Monday. Talks were continuing to be 'constructive', it was said yesterday.
Queens said talks were continuing with the steering committee, headed by
Barclays Bank, and it could not comment further. Although it is unusual for
a standstill agreement not to be rolled over, bankers said that no party was
taking precipitate action.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Updated punchline for old German joke -
BMW/Rover Deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'BMW swallows Rover,' proclaimed a front-page headline in yesterday's Bild,
the popular daily. 'English pissed off]' said the first sentence.
Bild, a splashy but effective opinion former, was one of the few German
newspapers to rush to judgment after Monday's takeover announcement.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman, had delivered 'a masterpiece of
modern industrial policy,' it said in a leader. BMW was big, strong,
successful, and had come through the auto industry crisis without a scratch.
The brilliance of the deal had bathed the whole of German industry in
sunshine. 'Onwards and upwards]' it concluded.
In its less flamboyant way, the Frankfurt stock market also vigorously
applauded the move. Following analysts' strong 'buy' recommendations, based
mainly on the allegedly low price paid for Rover, BMW's shares closed DM51
(Pounds 19.40) higher yesterday at DM790 - bringing the surge since the
start of Monday trading, when the news broke, to DM107.
Daimler-Benz stock caught a little of the sun, too, rising DM6 to DM818
after losing DM4 the previous day.
The quality press was decidedly guarded. Handelsblatt, the financial daily,
was not sure that BMW's move out of its comfortable high-performance niche
was altogether wise.
The purchase would increase BMW's exposureto the cyclical bumps of the car
market, it noted. Rover would also need continued financial support.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung was puzzled that Honda letthe prize slip away. Was
the real reason liquidity problems, or were the Japanese trying to push the
price down? Whatever the reason, it hoped BMW did not become too cocky.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which relegated the story to the fourth
page of its business section, reflected the risk-aversion common in German
business. Rover was not at the peak of health, and BMW's profitability was
likely to be diluted, it said.
Although several papers took the opportunity to revive an old German joke
about British Leyland (once known as Britisch Elend or British Misery), most
delicately avoided the nationalist or emotional issues involved.
True to form, Bild quoted a UK car worker as saying:'Outrageous, why did we
win the war?' But Handelsblatt side-stepped the issueeven in its page one
splash headline: 'The last great British car maker will be steered by
foreigners in future.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BMW chief enthusiastic about future of the
Mini - BMW/Rover Deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I personally am sure there is a market for the Mini under the Metro as an
up-market small car,' says Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman and the
man who holds the future direction of Rover, the carmaker, in his hands.
With its limited financial resources Rover was never able to make a business
case for developing a successor for the 35-year-old Mini,but Mr
Pischetsrieder is enthusiastic.
'Sure they will have the resources now,' he says, 'others can manufacture
minicars but only Rover can manufacture Minis. This car has a unique
position in the world outside the US. To give that away would be foolish.'
He insists that the takeover of Rover is based on maintaining BMW and Rover
as two separate entities, although the UK carmaker will now be able to draw
on BMW's extensive engineering resources.
'BMW engineers know what a BMW is, but they would have difficulties
developing a Jaguar. They would think it was imperfect. If you asked them to
develop a competing car they would again develop a BMW.'
The BMW chairman has still to discover exactly what resources Rover has of
its own, but he says 'it is a fraction of what we think you need to develop
a proper motor car'.
'Does Rover have a wind tunnel? We have a test track in the south of France
that Rover engineers can use. We have experts in suspension settings, in
noise reduction and in electronics. They are now available to Rover.
Mr Pischetsrieder says that the first project that BMW will start at Rover
will be the development of a successor for the Rover 800 executive car,
which was originally launched in 1986 and was largely engineered by Honda as
a sister car of the Honda Legend.
No joint project had been started with Honda to replace this car, and it is
the obvious part of the existing Rover range, where BMW can begin to gain
significant cost savings through the use of BMW components.
Mr Pischetsrieder says that the new generation 800 will be derived from the
chassis platform of the next BMW 5-Series, which is due to be launched in
1995.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: German labour costs almost double UK level
 -BMW/Rover Deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has the highest total motor industry labour costs in the developed
world while the UK has the lowest according to a study by the German auto
industry, writes Kevin Done.
German costs at DM49.6 (Pounds 19) per hour in 1993 were almost double the
UK's level of DM25.6 according to figures from the German automobile
federation (VDA), which exclude South Korea.
The gulf in labour costs between Germany and theUK underlines a key part of
the strategy behind BMW's Pounds 800m takeover of Rover,the leading UK
volume carmaker, announced on Monday.
The acquisition gives the German executive and luxury carmaker access, for
the first time, to a low-cost production base in Europe.
As a result of the takeover BMW has abandoned its earlier plan to develop a
small car for sale under the BMW badge. It has decided to make Rover the
European centre for the production of small and medium-sized front wheel
drive cars. They will be under the Rover, rather than the BMW, badge.
The UK position at the bottom of the labour costs league is the result of
the very low level of social costs, such as payroll tax or
nationalinsurance. UK social costs accounted for only 27 per cent of total
wage costs, compared with 43 per cent in Germany.
The appreciation of the D-Mark and the yen against many other European
currencies and the dollar have had a substantial impact on the
competitiveness of leading vehicle producing countries.
Japanese carmakers now have the highest gross wage levels in the world's
auto industry at DM34.3 per hour, compared with DM28.5 in Germany, DM18.7 in
the UK and only DM12.9 in Italy.
Total Japanese wage costs are still 16 per cent lower than the German level,
however, thanks to a much lower social costs.
Japanese carmakers have rapidly built up a large production presence in
North America and Europe. Three of the leading Japanese producers, Nissan,
Toyota and Honda, have chosen the UK as the location for their first
European car plants.
UK car production rose by 6.5 per cent last year in contrast to sharp falls
in most continental European countries and is forecast to show the strongest
increase during the whole of the 1990s chiefly as a result of rising
Japanese output.
The biggest improvement in competitiveness in total labour costs last year
came in the UK, Spain, Italy and Sweden largely as a result of the
devaluation of these countries' currencies against the D-Mark and the yen.
Italy now has the second lowest total labour costs after the UK, but it is
still 6 per cent above the UK level, because of much higher social costs,
which are more than double the UK level.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury to announce change in auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the high street retailer, is expected to announce imminently
that it intends to change its firm of auditors from next year.
In a statement likely tobe released through the Stock Exchange it will
recommend that Clark Whitehill is replaced by Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The shift, to the UK's biggest firm froma medium-sized one just a tenth of
the size, represents a significant blow for smaller accountancy firms trying
to retain large quoted companies as audit clients.
The move reflects Sainsbury's growth and its ambitions towards greater
international expansion, which it believes demands a more widely-known
accountancy firm with an international network of affiliates.
The company began considering a change in auditors towards the end of last
year, and Coopers won the tender against competition from KPMG Peat Marwick.
Clark Whitehill will continue to act as joint auditors for the coming year,
and after that will remain as auditor to the pension fund and provide
consulting and tax advice.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, will state that the firm has provided high
quality service in the past. The income from Sainsbury represents about 2.5
per cent of Clark Whitehill's total billings.
Only a handful of large quoted clients are still audited by accountancy
firms below the largest six, such as PannellKerr Forster, auditor to
Williams Holdings.

<TEXT>
Shares in Berisford International closed last night at 232p, 104p above the
128p price where trading was suspended before the announcement last month of
the deal to buy the Magnet kitchen and joinery company.
The Pounds 56m reverse takeover, which is to be financed by a 1-for-2 rights
issue at 120p, was approved by Berisford shareholders at a special meeting
on Monday.
The volume oftrading was high at 33.1m of the existing shares and 12.5m of
the rights shares. This included the placing of some shares held by the
Pritzker's - Berisford directors and substantial shareholders - and the
whole of the 3.6 per cent stake in the company held by Compagnie Noga, a
Swiss group. The shares were placed by Hoare Govett, the broker, at 215p.
It is understood that Associated British Foods, which held a 17.9 per cent
stake, had sold some of its rights but was planning to take up most of its
entitlement.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Northern Rock tops Pounds 89m despite
heavier provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Rock building society, the UK's 11th largest society, yesterday
reported a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 69m to Pounds
89.3m in 1993, despite a 40 per cent increase in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts.
Mr Chris Sharp, managing director, attributed the rise in provisions,from
Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 17.1m, to a number of factors, including a fall in
the valuesof repossessions below the society's expectations.
Other factors reflected adjustments as a result of a switch in mortgage
indemnity guarantee insurancearrangements from Sun Alliance to Commercial
Union and the setting up of a general provisioning fund.
Mr Sharp said that this last move was an innovation for the society. 'We
intend to use highly profitable years, like 1993, to build up funds as a
buffer for the future.'
Mr John Wriglesworth, societiesanalyst at UBS, said that even though most
societies would be reporting markedly lower provisions for 1993 compared
with the previous year, the increase at Northern Rock showed a prudent
approach. He added that the growth in profits was particularly impressive as
it followed a sharp increase in 1992.
There was also substantial balance sheet growth, despite a year in which
societies have faced fierce competition both for mortgage lending and retail
savings.
Overal l mortgage balances rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 6bn (Pounds 5bn).
Retail receipts rose from Pounds 717m to Pounds 738m, helped by the
popularity of the society's postal accounts. Total assets grew from Pounds
6bn to Pounds 7.3bn.
The ratio of costs to total income fell to 35 per cent from 38 per cent.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stronger UK demand helps Gardiner achieve
Pounds 4.02m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady growth in UK demand for home security helped Gardiner Group, the
security and surveillance equipment distributor, announce improved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.02m for the year to October 31.
The shares added 4 1/2 p yesterday to close at 33 1/2 p.
The comparative figure of Pounds 620,000 is restated in accordance with FRS
3 to include the Pounds 2.03m exceptional closure costs of the Spanish
subsidiary in 1992.
Turnover grew by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 73.8m),though on
continuing operations the rise was 10 per cent.
Earnings per share were 2.23p (0.17p) and a final dividend of 0.5p (0.19p)
is recommended, making a total of 0.73p (0.66p).
Mr Harvey Samson, chief executive, said thecompany had restored stability
after the dislocation caused by the discovery two years ago of falsified
accounting which led to the depart-ure of Mr Yashar Turgut, the then chief
execu-tive.
New accounting policies have been adopted for the company's asset valuation,
resulting in a reduction of net assets as at October 31 1992 from Pounds
13.3m to Pounds 6.75m. The change reduces depreciation costsand turns
pre-tax losses of Pounds 473,000 for that year into profits of Pounds
620,000.
Gardiner Security, the market-leading UK subsidiary, recorded strong sales
growth at stable margins. Mr Samson said that rising crime offered
substantialgrowth potential in the residential sector where fewer than one
in 10 homes hadsecurity systems.
The group's French and Scandinavian subsidiaries both performed well in
spite of recession. However, in Belgium and the Netherlands a harsh economic
climate made trading more difficult.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cedardata for market with valuation of
Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cedardata, a Surrey-based accounting and financial management software
group, is coming to market next month through a share placing which is
likely to value thecompany at about Pounds 30m.
The company, founded in 1983 by Mr Leon Fattal, as a computer bureau
services company specialising in payroll and accounts processing, is best
known for for its modular Cfacs (Commercial and Financial Accounts Systems)
software, which was launched in 1987 and now has a strong blue-chip customer
base.
The core of the Cfacs software package, which has been developed and based
on Oracle's relational database products, is the General Ledger. To this
clients can add various other modules to meet their specific accounting
requirements. Some 25 modules are currently available.
Since the launch of Cfacs turnover and profits have grown rapidly. In the
year to March 31, pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds
5.3m. In the current year the company expects to report profits of between
Pounds 2.75m and Pounds 3m on turnover of about Pounds 6.05m.
As part of the placing the company plans to issue new shares to raise an
additional Pounds 1m after expenses which will be used to fund the future
development of Cfacs, working capital and possible acquisitions.
The vendors, who include Mr Fattal, managing director with a holding of 57.6
per cent, and MrHarry Menasche, sales director with a 10.1 per cent stake,
plan to retain about50 per cent of the enlarged capital after the placing.
The listing particulars will be published on February 18 and the shares are
expected to begin trading on February 24. The placing is sponsored by Greig
Middleton.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Contract changes fail to halt advance at
BAA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Achange to important retail contracts distorted the first set of nine month
figures from BAA, the former British Airports Authority. However, pre-tax
profits inthe period to the end of December were little affected by the
change, rising 13per cent to Pounds 292m.
At the six month stage profits were up from Pounds 218m to Pounds 237m.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the nine month figures 'confirm our
confidence in the prospects for the remainder of the current financial year
and for the long term'. BAA shares fell 26p to Pounds 10.55p.
Two of the company's leading retailers, Allders and Forte, switched to new
contracts last year, under which they are paid a management fee with BAA
taking their total turnover into its revenue figure. This boosted the
revenue figure, but also raised operating costs.
Revenue rose 16 per cent to Pounds 873m, including retail revenue up 51 per
cent to Pounds 366m. Stripping out the effect of the contract changes, the
underlying growth in retail revenue was 8 per cent. Retail income, as at the
six month stage, formed the largest source of revenue.
Passenger numbers rose 5 per cent to 64.5m, but because of the RPI minus 8
per cent pricing formula set by the regulator, total landing charges fell
slightly.
Operating costs rose from Pounds 443m to Pounds 545m, but on a comparable
basis, said Mr Nigel Ellis, finance director, costs were barely changed.
The cost figure includeda property write-down of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 17.8m).
Mr Ellis said that with the propertyrecession now ending he hoped in future
to see property write-backs.
Theinterest charge fell from Pounds 49m to Pounds 36m, with net debt at
Pounds 621m, down from Pounds 748m a year earlier.
Tax of Pounds 77m was provided, based on the estimated rate for the year,
leaving earnings per share up 10 per cent at 42.2p.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti shows improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, soon to be floated on the London and Accra
stock exchanges, yesterday reported record gold production and earnings.
Gold output last year rose 19 per cent from the 1992 level, from 654,298
troy ounces to 770,410 ounces, while pre-tax profits jumped by 18.5 per cent
from Dollars 76.4m to Dollars 90.5m (Pounds 60.3m).
High capital expenditure on Ashanti's expansion programme during the year
reduced the tax charge from Dollars 15.8m to Dollars 300,000 so that profits
after tax accelerated by 49 per cent, from Dollars 60.6m to Dollars 90.2m.
Turnover was up by 15per cent, from Dollars 238.6m to Dollars 275.1m.
Ashanti has adopted the US dollar forfinancial statements, as its revenues
are in dollars and most of its fixed asset purchases and costs are in
currencies related to the dollar.
Ashanti, a45 per cent-owned associate of Lonrho, the international
conglomerate, said that last year proven and probable gold reserves rose
from 16.8m to 18.1m ounces.
The only surprise in the results was that, despite the steady climb in
themarket price of gold last year, the average price Ashanti received for
its output was down from Dollars 365 an ounce in 1992 to Dollars 357.
However, its full operating costs, including depreciation and royalty
payments, fell from Dollars 245 an ounce to Dollars 235.
The company reported excellent progress with its Dollars 300m, four year
expansion programme designed to place it among the few groups producing more
than 1m ounces a year by 1996.
Last year the government of Ghana, which owns 55 per cent of Ashanti, said
it would sell about 25 per cent of the company via a flotation on its local
and on the London stock exchanges. The float, which is expected to value
Ashanti at about Dollars 1bn, is likely to be completed in March.
To reflect the change in status, the name is being changed from Ashanti
Goldfields Corporation (Ghana) to Ashanti Goldfields Company.

FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kalon makes Pounds 6.2m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalon, the paints group, is expanding its penetration of the specialist
decorative products market via the acquisition of the principal assets and
goodwill of Vallance &amp; Co, a subsidiary of Den Braven Sealants, for about
Pounds 6.2m cash, including Pounds 5.2m for tangible assets.
Products within the Vallance range include sealants, putties, fillers, fire
cement, tile adhesive, grouts and liquid nails. This latter has the fastest
growing sales.
Den Braven retains its trade sales of sealants. Because of this, no profits
figure can be attributed to the acquired business, though sales have been
stated as Pounds 12.5m.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Bidders step up Paramount offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom and QVC Network, the protagonists in a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.60bn)
takeover battle for Paramount Communications, last night increased their
bids for the US film and publishing group in a photo-finish finale to the
five-month-long contest.
The complex new offers were not easily comparable, but Viacom's bid was
stronger in several important respects - including its cash element. Traders
were last night scrambling to put firm values on the two bids, which
appeared to be very close.
The new offers came just minutes before a 5pm New York time deadline set by
the Paramount board for final offers.
Shareholders will have until February 14 to consider the offers while the
market's initial verdict will be delivered today in the share prices of the
two bidders.
Viacom left unchanged its previous offer of Dollars 107 a share in cash for
50.1 per cent of the stock while QVC, headed by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent
film industry figure, raised the cash element of its bid from Dollars 92 a
share to Dollars 104 - still Dollars 3 a share below Viacom.
Both companies changed elements of their so-called second step merger - the
package of securities they are offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent of
Paramount's stock.
Viacom increased the value of its offer by several dollars in three ways: It
changed the right to receive Dollars 15.20 of convertible preference stock
yielding 5 per cent to Dollars 17.50 of 8 per cent debentures; it added 0.3
of a five year warrant to buy Viacom B stock at Dollars 70 a share; and it
improved the terms of its so-called contingent value rights (CVR) - an
element of its offer which has been popular with traders and which QVC
lacks. Under the CVR, Viacom guarantees to make up to shareholders the
amount its B shares trade below Dollars 48 in the first year after the
takeover, up to a maximum of Dollars 12. Previously, it had a floor of
Dollars 10.
QVC, by contrast, has increased the cash portion of its bid by Dollars 750m
by decreasing the value of its second-step offer. Paramount shareholders
would now get 1.24 a share of QVC stock, down from 1.43, and .2386 of
preferred stock, down from .32.
QVC said that in addition to increasing the cash portion of its bid, these
changes would reduce pressure on its publicly traded stock by reducing the
number of shares in its second step deal by 13.6 per cent.

FT  02 FEB 94 / FT-SE 100 index reaches a 'real' all-time high: Confidence
on inflation and interest rates helps overhaul 1987 record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 index reached an all-time inflation-adjusted peak of 2,136.91
on Monday. As the chart points out, the previous high point for the index
was reached on July 13 1987, writes Steve Thompson.
The stock market crash, which saw the FT-SE 100 plunge 500 points, or around
20 per cent, in two trading days, took place in October 1987.
Market strategists, while pointing out that current markets are looking
stretched, yesterday highlighted the contrasting outlook for interest rates
and inflation between 1987 and now. Retail investment is focusing on higher
returns from the stock market than are available from building societies.
'Although the comparative price/earnings ratios and yields look similar to
that of 1987 there is a much greater degree of confidence in the current
interest-rate structure in the UK,' said Mr Richard Kersley, UK equity
market strategist at BZW.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Fiat offers new cars as prizes to bondholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, Italy's struggling cars group, which prides itself on being a
trend-setter, has unveiled another financial gimmick.
The group, which this week forecast a L1,800bn (Pounds 705m) net loss for
1993, is issuing a L1,000bn bond to bolster its flagging finances.
The issue follows a L3,300bn cash call last September, which helped keep net
indebtedness down to L5,500bn last December - still well up on the L4,466bn
reported at the end of 1992.
The bond is linked to a 'prize draw'. One hundred lucky bondholders will win
its new sports coupe, while a similar number will be awarded the high
performance version of the new Punto small car.
Offering the prizes, selected on the basis of the serial numbers of the
individual L1m certificates which comprise the issue, is a marketing coup.
It may even overcome doubts about the group's bullish prediction of a return
to break even this year.
Fiat says the draw harks back to a tradition of offering cars as prizes to
bondholders.
The last time that was done was in 1956, when Fiat gave away the curvacious
but tiny 600 saloon. Some competitors have done the same. The IRI state
holding company, which then owned Alfa Romeo, now part of Fiat, offered 50
new 'Giulia TIs' in a mid-60s bond. About a decade earlier, the state-owned
Agip petrol company also gave away 50 Alfas.

FT  02 FEB 94 / M&amp;S enters pensions market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is to offer life and
pensions products from next year in addition to its existing financial
services.
The company said its financial advisers would be salaried and receive no
commission or incentive to sell. It is expecting to recruit about 50
advisers initially.
M&amp;S aims to provide the service in six stores from early next year, rising
to 50 by the end of 1995. The first six sites are intended to be in a mix of
city centres and out-of-town shops.
The Equitable Life Assurance society will provide consultancy and systems
support, and will also be involved in product development and training
plans. M&amp;S has not yet decided who should do its fund management.
Mr Keith Oates, joint managing director, said yesterday that the company
hoped to announce its range of products in the autumn. Its advisers would
recommend only M&amp;S products and would not be able to make a recommendation
where no product appropriate to the customer's needs was available.
M&amp;S entered financial services in 1984 when it launched its chargecard. It
added a unit trust management company in 1988 and also offers personal
loans. In 1992-93, financial services contributed Pounds 24m to pre-tax
profits.
Mr Oates said the new services were planned to be more store-based than the
financial services operation had been so far. Though information about the
new products would be available through stores and direct mail, such
products were less suitable for selling through direct mail since there was
a greater need for advice and assessment of the individual customer's
circumstances, he said.
The company's plans to enter the life and pensions business come as the
financial services sector is going through a period of regulatory change.
The market has become particularly difficult because of public concern about
the mis-selling of products such as pension transfers.
M&amp;S's decision to pay its financial advisers by salary only will fuel the
debate already underway in the life industry over methods of payment,
especially since impending changes in regulation mean that sales agents and
advisers will be required to tell customers the commission they receive for
selling life products.
Some industry experts also believe that by adding to the capacity in an
already over-crowded market, M&amp;S will hasten the prospects of a shake-out in
the life sector.
Mr Oates said the project came after two years of research into the savings
market. The company had identified the surrender values of policies as one
area of customer concern.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Why Rover has had to lead a dog's life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deals versus relationships haslong summed up the contrast in styles between
the Anglo-American corporate culture and the powerful industrial economies
of Germany and Japan. Now, with the global securities markets awash with
American money and Germany and Japan both deep in recession and, arguably,
facing a secular loss of momentum, the dealmakers are coming into their own.
That is one important aspect of the sale of Rover to BMW. Honda's
partnership with Rover has apparently worked amazingly well,enabling the
British company to revolutionise its production facilities and upgrade the
quality of its products almost beyond recognition. But it was always a risky
route for Honda, a second-line Japanese company that could not afford the
direct entry to Europe which Nissan and Toyota preferred.
Now British Aerospace wants to deal its way out of the car industry, for
reasons which seem scarcely more understandable than the motives which
prompted it to deal its way in five years ago. It has made a good profit out
of the trade - no doubt sufficient justification.
Ironically Honda is being supplanted by a company from Germany, from a
corporate culture which, like that of Japan, has relied heavily on
cross-shareholdings and semi-formal relationships. BMW itself insisted in
1990, for instance, on buying a small stake in Rolls-Royce to cement
symbolically the two groups' aero-engine partnership. But Honda's 20 per
cent stake in Rover has given it little security. It could be that BMW is
becoming influenced by its international institutional shareholders, just as
Daimler-Benz, in more straitened financial circumstances, agreed to seek a
New York listing and adopt US accounting standards last year.
Portfolio managers like to have clear-cut investments; messy relationships
and cross-holdings do not fit into this picture at all. This deal will
extend BMW's status as a European motor stock (though its German focus may
be blurred slightly) and will enable BAe to be more clearly positioned as an
arms and aerospace group. The share prices of both BAe and BMW rose sharply.
We can expect many more transactions of this type in future. There are
almost unlimited market funds available to support divisional deals between
companies, although stock market valuations are so high that it is rarely
possible for companies to consider full-scale takeovers - that is, buying
shares directly from investors.
Where Rover itself will come out of this is another matter. The car group
has been financially abused on an amazing scale over thepast 30 years:
pushed by the British government into unworkable mergers, then nationalised,
eventually denationalised into transitory British ownership when anAmerican
deal seemed politically too controversial, but finally sold to a German
company for a quick turnround profit. It's a dog's life, it seems, if you
are called Rover.
Does Rover's exit symbolise the failure of the British system of corporate
ownership and governance? After all, BMW was itself in a desperate state in
the early 1960s, but was transformed. Now it is just one of three big
German-owned motor groups, whereas the UK will in future have none.
Theinstitutionally-owned British stock market simply moved off in a
different direction to the German market, which historically, at least, was
more under the control of industrial interests and banks. The industrial
climate in the UK had to change fundamentally before big motor companies
became easily manageable. However, British shares on average have delivered
exceptional returns over the past 10 or 15 years, better than those of
German companies. Two of those three German car groups have been making big
losses.
Certainly the British corporate culture is open to short-termist criticism:
the British have reasoned that the only way to make money out of cars is to
wheel and deal in the companies that make them. However, the price in
practice has not been the loss of a British car manufacturing industry, just
the loss of control.
As German companies come more and more under the influence of global
investors, the question is where exactly that control is passing to. The
Germans, as well as the Japanese, need to reassess their relationships.

FT  02 FEB 94 / United Newspapers pays Dollars 100m for US periodicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday
expanded its US advertising periodicals business through the acquisition of
Harmon Publishing Company for Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) cash.
The purchase was made by United Advertising Periodicals, United's
Dallas-based subsidiary. Recoverable trade debtors were also purchased.
United Newspapers shares yesterday rose by 17p to 708p.
Harmon, founded in 1988, publishes 216 local advertising periodicals -
mainly covering homes for sale, but some focus on cars - in 99 markets
spread across 31 states. The periodicals contain no editorial and are
distributed free through supermarkets.
Harmon, which employs 900, last year reported a turnover ofDollars 70m and
pre-tax profits of Dollars 6.7m. It had net assets at the end of December of
Dollars 9.8m, of which Dollars 7.6m represented collectable net trade debts
which were paid for in cash at completion.
UAP, founded in 1986, is already a leading US advertising periodical
publisher, with annual turnover of Dollars 100m.
Mr Graham Wilson, United's managing director, said Harmon was a good fit
with the existingbusiness. 'There will be significant merger benefits,' he
said, predicting savings on printing costs and on paper buying, as well as
on joint use of distribution channels and display racks.
Mr Wilson said the key to the US periodicals market was effective
distribution. Harmon will be gradually brought under UAP's distribution
system.
About 30 per cent of United Newspapers' turnover comes from the US, said Mr
Wilson, who expects the acquisition to bolster 1994earnings.
Last summer when it launched a Pounds 190m rights issue, United said that
several opportunities for expanding existing publishing and exhibition
interests were being 'actively pursued in the US and Far East'.
Mr Wilsonsaid yesterday that the purchase of Harmon 'fulfils part of those
plans and isan important step in building a pre-eminent position in the US
advertising periodical market'.
Last December, United raised Pounds 73.5m from the sale of Extel Financial,
the financial information group, to Pearson, publishers of the Financial
Times.

<TEXT>
United Newspapers' shareholders have waited a long time to see how their
company would spend the Pounds 190m raised in last July's rights issue. But
the acquisition of a US periodical publisher is unlikely to disappoint. The
Dollars 100m purchase price may seem a lot to pay for a Dollars 70m-turnover
business. But Harmon will usefully complement United's existing US
periodicals business. There appears scope to double Harmon's current
operating margin of 9.6 per cent.
Moreover, United will be able to exploit a wrinkle in the new US tax code
which should ensure the deal will enhance earnings. By buying Harmon's
assets rather than the outright business, United will be able to amortise
the goodwill over 15 years, writing it off against tax payments. That
effectively gives United some Dollars 6.5m of tax-free income a year
considering that goodwill accounts for some 97 per cent of the purchase
price.
Shareholders may remain puzzled why United was in such a hurry to raise

December added more to the acquisitions pot. But at least they will be
patient in the knowledge that United's shares are now 48 per cent higher

FT  02 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers will doubtless feel safe with a pension from Marks and Spencer,
but whether they will actually go out and buy one is another matter. Given
most people's reluctance, the quip that insurance is sold and not bought
carries a good deal of weight. It is a premise of the life industry that
without a salesman's insistent patter in the family home, clients will not
sign on the dotted line. Getting foot-dragging consumers to trot along to
the local M&amp;S store voluntarily may thus be a tall order.
Marks and Spencer is, however, touching on some important trends. Consumers
are finally catching on to the large commissions paid on life-related
products. Now that these are to be disclosed, pressure will mount to cut
charges. That will require a lower cost base, which M&amp;S is in a better
position to provide than traditional insurance sales forces, independent
advisers or even the banks. The industry may thus move to a much lower cost
base.
The other trend is towards simplicity. Whatever the marketing hype of fund
management groups, there can be little need for almost as many unit trusts
as there are quoted UK companies. Consumers may place a premium on
off-the-peg financial planning and simple products to go with it. This is
classic M&amp;S territory. While purists may quibble, the mass market may be
better served by a standardised M&amp;S financial product than the inappropriate
personal pensions many have thus far been sold. The only consolation for
life companies is that Marks and Spencers' inherent caution leaves a
breathing space for the industry.

The foreign exchange markets seem to be having some difficulty discerning
which way US interest rates and therefore the dollar are heading. On Monday
Mr Alan Greenspan said that the Federal Reserve would have to tighten some
time, but gave no indication of when. That looked initially like a reprieve.
Yesterday the purchasing managers' index for January turned out stronger
than the market expected, especially in the areas of price and delivery
times, both of which suggest capacity is beginning to be stretched. If that
is so, an interest rate level originally set amid fears of a credit crunch
looks less appropriate.
Friday's employment figures may give a better lead, but the balance of
expectation must be that the Fed is unlikely to act quickly. Fourth-quarter
inflation figures showed inflation well under control, while the high rate
of growth is expected to slow. The resignation yesterday of Mr David Mullins
will remove another hawkish member from the Fed Board. It is thus more
likely that when it does eventually tighten, the Fed will simply nudge rates
gently higher.
That is little comfort for those who have been banking on a strong
appreciation of the dollar this year. In the short run they also have to
contend with worries about the looming trade talks between the US and Japan
which may yet see the US side talking the yen up. Expectations of a German
rate cut this week are diminishing. There is a chance that the Bundesbank,
which likes to surprise, may slip in a cut now that the D-Mark has revived.
But there is little longer-term encouragement for the dollar if Germany is
only prepared to cut interest rates when its own currency is strong.

The wise men's report on the European airline industry will bring the day of
reckoning for loss-making national carriers that little bit closer but will
hardly leave them quivering with fear. The recommendation that carriers can
receive one last injection of state aid - so long as it is linked to
restructuring proposals - will defer the most painful decisions. Once that
financial fix has faded, the upswing in the European aviation cycle should
further postpone the crunch.
The report suggests that over the past three years European governments have
spent Dollars 3bn shoring up national airlines. None of the investment could
be justified on purely commercial grounds. That may be true. But whether the
elimination of such subsidies will be sufficient to redress the ills of the
European airline industry is highly questionable. After all, US carriers
receive no state aid yet their industry still loses money. That shows how
hard it is to remove surplus capacity.
Strong European airlines, such as British Airways and KLM, will be delighted
that 'unfair' competition will diminish. But small airlines on Europe's
periphery, such as Olympic or Aer Lingus, will face a highly precarious
future if free market forces are fully unleashed. The regulatory trend will
force them to cut costs, merge or forge closer marketing agreements with
other carriers. But even if they fail to do so, it is hard to see how any
government could ever allow its national carrier to crash. The release of
the aviation report on the same day as the EU commissioner responsible
admitted that European steel talks were on the verge of collapse is not
auspicious for free market champions.

FT  02 FEB 94 / BMW aims to maintain Rover alliance with Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, ROBERT TAYLOR, ROLAND RUDD and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board, is to meet Mr
Nobuhiko Kawamoto, chief executive of Honda in Tokyo next week in a first
round of talks aimed at maintaining the alliance between the Japanese
carmaker and Rover.
BMW stunned Honda on Monday with its Pounds 800m takeover from British
Aerospace of an 80 per cent stake in the UK carmaker. Honda still holds the
remaining 20 per cent of the equity in the Rover and Land Rover vehicle
operations.
Mr Pischetsrieder is anxious to maintain Honda as a partner for Rover in
vehicle production and development, at least in the medium term.
Honda and Rover have forged a close relationship in the past 14 years, and
Mr Kawamoto was quick to express dismay at the entry of BMW. He said the BMW
takeover had 'negated' the long-term efforts of Honda and Rover to establish
a firm future for Rover as 'a British company with its own brand identity'.
Honda's resentment at the way that British Aerospace engineered the move was
also highlighted yesterday when Mr Andrew Jones, the company's UK plant
manager, admitted the company was shocked at the deal.
Speaking at the House of Commons select committee on employment he agreed
with a suggestion from MPs that the decision could deter Japanese investors
from investing in the UK.
While he maintained that Honda would remain committed to its Pounds 370m
investment in the UK at the Swindon Honda plant, he said it was important to
understand the way Japanese companies approached corporate relationships. Mr
Jones said they took a long-term view and liked to build their relations on
'trust and sincerity'. Any sudden deviation would affect their behaviour, he
said.
British union officials, however, reacted favourably yesterday to BMW's
purchase after Mr Pischetsrieder gave them the assurances they had been
seeking on job security and investment plans in the UK.
'We could not have asked for anything more positive,' said Mr John Allen,
the AEEU engineering union official for the auto industry.
Mr Pischetsrieder told them that BMW would guarantee the future of Rover's
plants, maintain the commitment to product development plans and keep
current employment levels.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Government rejects Adams call for Ulster peace deal
clarification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government last night rejected demands in New York by Mr Gerry
Adams, Sinn Fein president, for clarification on the Anglo-Irish joint
declaration and for negotiations on a political settlement in Northern
Ireland.
In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British government's refusal to
embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a political solution until the IRA ended
violence permanently.
With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored another propaganda
victory in Mr Adams' US visit, Sir Patrick's uncompromising position was
endorsed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York,
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been
characterised by 'ambiguity and evasion'.
The US administration also moved quickly to emphasise that its decision to
admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect policy differences with the
British government over Northern Ireland.
President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more US pressure on Britain,
said at a press conference: 'Let's be fair. The people that have to resolve
this are the Irish and the British.' He described the peace initiative taken
by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as
'astonishing' and said Mr Adams should back it.
Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for clarification as delaying
tactics.
After a briefing to members of the congressional committee on Irish affairs,
Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal to put to the IRA to enable
it to end its conflict. 'The ball is firmly in the British court,' he said.
Mr Adams repeated his calls for British government action when he addressed
the national committee on American foreign policy.
But Sir Patrick, who said it was 'a pity' that Mr Adams had been given a
platform in the US, insisted that it was Sinn Fein which had 'the key' to a
peaceful solution. He said: 'The only rational choice for an organisation
that has a political objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence
and make it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what
has been offered. Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their ability to give up
violence.'
Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr Major, Sir
Patrick said that it 'did not seek any clarification or explanation of any
specific matter at all. It is entirely clear that what he wants is a
renegotiation of the declaration.'
He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific meant that there
was no 'genuine request for enlightenment and the most likely candidate for
an alternative explanation is the desire to play for time'.
Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the mechanics of a
negotiated settlements, said: 'Mr Major has talked of a first step in the
peace process. What is the second step and the third step?' He said peace
would be difficult to establish but prospects were better than ever before.
The IRA fired a 150lb mortar bomb at troops close to the Irish border today.
Nobody was hurt.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Brussels steel plan faces collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's steel restructuring plan faced the prospect of
collapse amid clear indications from private steelmakers that they are not
prepared to offer much-needed capacity cuts, Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU
competition commissioner, said yesterday.
Referring to the unwillingness of private steelmakers to cut capacity, Mr
Van Miert conceded: 'We cannot deliver the goods.' .
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Van Miert
said: 'I am very pessimistic about it.' He added that the absence of a
single offer so far had forced 'a reassessment in the commission.'
The commission plan requires cuts of 30m tonnes, about a quarter of EU steel
output, in order to restore prices to economic levels. Under the plan, some
25m tonnes of capacity would be eliminated by private sector producers,
10.5m of them in voluntary cuts to be financed by the EU.
Comm ission officials said last Friday that the European Commission and
steelmakers would meet in Brussels to discuss capacity cuts on February 15.
The deadline forproposals is March 21.
Eurofer, the European steelmakers' lobby group, is scheduled to meet on
February 12 to discuss a common strategy.
Mr Van Miert said the commission had no intention of setting quotas.
Private sectorproducers have complained that they are being asked to
sacrifice more than state-owned producers. The most vocal complaints coming
from the UK, Denmark and Germany.
The German steel industry has indicated that no capacity cuts will be
presented at the Brussels meeting.
Germany's private steelmakers argue that the deal reached in December
between the Commission and state-ownedsteel companies is grossly unfair to
the private sector.
The agreement offers DM11.5bn of subsidies to back 5m tonnes of capacity
cuts at state-owned steel companies in Italy, Spain,Portugal and eastern
Germany.
Steel industry analysts said yesterday that the Italian industry ministry
had only just begun to consider how the 500,000 tonnes of proposedcuts would
come from the Italian private sector.
In Italy, matters have been complicated by the government's decision to
press ahead with the privatisation of Ilva, the state steel group.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Personal View: This way Russian chaos lies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREI OSTALSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old Soviet joke of the 1970s asks: 'What is small, green, rustles at the
touch, but is not money?' Answer: 'A onehundred rouble banknote.' 'But why
do you say, then, that it is not money?' 'Because one hundred roubles isn't
money, it's peanuts.'
At that time, however, the sum of 100 roubles was a lot - for those who had
access to the special network of privileged government and party shops. It
could decently feed an average family for nearly a month. Or buy a quality
western-made suit or a coat.
On the other hand, spent at the rynok - farmer's market - it would have
allowed someone to buy no more than a few kilos of vegetables and fruits,
while in the ordinary shops you had to queue for hours to get anything worth
buying at all. Much stronger than the US dollar in the government shop,
Soviet currency suddenly lost most of its value outside it.
A palatial residence somewhere in the prestigious centre of Moscow would
cost its privileged occupiers not much more than a squalid one-room flat for
an ordinary family in the suburbs. The national currency had little to do
with how wealth was distributed in the Soviet society; no wonder, then, that
a lot of people accustomed to the old ways still find it hard to grasp the
concept of money in a market economy.
So when Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin speaks now of
'non-monetary ways' to curb inflation, he could simply be demonstrating the
traditional, scornful disregard for Russian money, treating it as something
as cheap and unimportant as syemechki (the Russian equivalent of peanuts).
This scorn is part and parcel of the Soviet ideological legacy. After the
highly efficient (and monetarist) New Economic Policy of the early Soviet
days, Stalin destroyed the theory of value and deprived the rouble of its
natural role as a universal equivalent and value store, turning it instead
into an instrument of 'socialist accounting' - an additional certificate of
good behaviour and work attendance.
Since that time, until former first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar's
reforms started in early 1992, real purchasing power was determined by the
place of the purchaser in the hierarchy, rather than by the quantity of the
roubles he possessed.
It worked the same way for enterprises, too. They had to produce what was
deemed necessary by the politicians; the quantity and the quality were both
centrally dictated. Normal money could not serve the purpose of that kind of
regulation, so it had to be abolished.
Today the proponents of the 'non-monetary approach' argue that the way to
curb inflation is to increase the supply of goods against the growing supply
of money. The rouble then would not lose value and there would be more goods
around. Wouldn't that be marvellous? And such a simple solution, too.
The only problem with this scenario is that, in the current sorry state of
Russian industry, easy credits would by no means stimulate increased
productivity. On the contrary, they would keep bankrupt enterprises and
state farms afloat artificially, encouraging them to stick to their old,
wasteful ways.
The other historically proven method to make people work harder and better
in Russia is to start shooting them in sufficiently big numbers. As soon as
the component of fear started to subside in the Soviet society after
Stalin's death, the economy began falling apart.
The extravagantly high oil prices of the 1970s and early 1980s somewhat
slowed the process, allowing Brezhnev's regime to stagnate rather
comfortably. But finally it had to come to an end. When the fear generated
by the KGB largely disappeared (1987-88), the decline in output became
obvious and irreversible. The junta of 1991 wanted to bring fear back into
the system, but it was too late.
If the Soviet experience is any guide, it seems that to make an economy work
coherently in Russia you have to choose what to control: the money supply,
through fiscal and monetary discipline and a normal central bank, or human
minds, through fear, propaganda and the secret police. But if you do
neither, you end up with chaos.
Mr Chernomyrdin's problem is that he is a decent man, not capable of
ordering mass executions, torture and long terms of slave labour. That is
why he will find it hard to switch the Russian economy back to fully
'non-monetary ways'. It will take a much more consistent and ruthless
leader, and probably a civil war, to achieve that.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Leading Article: The politics of local government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the debacle over the poll tax, the government might have been wise to
proceed with caution on further changes in local government. Caution appears
to have been abandoned, however, with plans to replace the two-tier
structure of county and district councils in most of England with
single-tier unitary authorities. Local government reorganisation threatens
to create another political disaster for the Conservatives.
Already, there has been an embarrassing legal setback for the government's
plans. Last week, the High Court ruled that Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, had acted unlawfully by changing the remit of the Local
Government Commission which is in charge of the process. Mr Gummer had told
Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman, that the two-tier structure
should be abandoned in all but exceptional circumstances. Sir John had
become increasingly prone to recommending the status quo after finding
little popular support for reorganisation in many counties.
Now there is the danger of political setbacks. Most Conservative
backbenchers supported the idea of sweeping away the new counties such as
Avon, Cleveland and Humberside. Introduced in the 1974 local government
reorganisation, the newcomers have failed to win popular support. Yet
abolishing even these artificial counties has proved more difficult than
expected. There has been a heated debate among business leaders, MPs and
other local interests over the commission's proposals.
Greater heat
Much greater heat is likely to be generated over the abolition of
traditional shire counties such as Kent and Hampshire. If unitary
authorities are to be introduced across the country, these counties will
disappear in all but name. Abolishing them will be resisted by the
Conservative councillors who have run them - usually moderately efficiently
 -for much of the last 100 years. Grassroots Conservatives are beginning to
lobby against the whole idea.
And it will take only a handful of Conservative rebel MPs to derail the
creation of unitary authorities. The reorganisation plans for each county
must be placed before Parliament, where the government's majority is small
and fractious. The probability is that the votes will become increasingly
acrimonious and unpredictable.
Even where reorganisation goes ahead, the political repercussions will
continue. There will be substantial costs incurred in the transition, with
some staff made redundant or taking early retirement. New offices will be
needed, along with logos, identities, vehicle liveries and all the
paraphernalia of modern organisations. Estimates of the cost vary, but the
bill is likely to be about Pounds 1bn overall - one reason why business
support for reorganisation is ebbing away.
Voters' revenge
Much of the cost, however, will be passed on to the local taxpayer. And
since most of the new local authorities open for business in April 1996, the
higher council tax bills will arrive in the run-up to the next general
election. Voters might blame councils for the higher bills  - but with the
poll tax, they took their revenge on the government.
Small wonder, therefore, that Downing Street is considering a retreat. The
government is already reeling over its tax plans, accusations of public
fraud and corruption and a series of sexual scandals. Ahead lie likely
drubbings for the Conservatives in local authority elections and elections
for the European parliament. The latter also threaten to reopen the gulf
over Europe inside the Tory party. There is no stomach for a long battle
over local government reorganisation, with the likelihood of parliamentary
defeats.
The government missed an opportunity last summer to scale down the extent of
reorganisation. Mr Gummer suggested that the commission should restrict its
efforts to local authorities where there was demonstrable support for it.
Such a solution now offers the best exit route without complete loss of
face. The abolition of Cleveland, Avon and Humberside could then proceed,
preferably without creating unviably small replacements. In the rest of the
country, where some large cities might want unitary status, a petition
signed by a substantial proportion of the population would be needed to call
in the commission.

Winter Olympics by selling them ear-rings made from dried elk excrement.
'They're dark brown, oval-shaped and no two are alike,' he says. 'They don't
smell at all.' He dries the droppings in a microwave; whacks on four coats
of lacquer; fits a silver clasp; and charges Dollars 13. Haugen reckons they
will be especially successful with people 'who come from countries where
there are no elks'. Naturally, Tore, naturally.

Those who hope Algeria's new head of state, General Lamine Zeroual, can
prevent the country sliding into civil war can take comfort from incidents
in his past.
During riots in October 1988 - which broke the power of the ruling Front de
Liberation National Party - one of the towns where no blood was shed was
Constantine, a long-standing hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism and the scene
of violent rioting in November 1986. The commander of the military region
enclosing Constantine was none other than Zeroual; he disobeyed orders and
refused to open fire against the demonstrators. Soon after, he was appointed
head of the land forces but resigned his command a few months later, and in
1989 retired.

Has Ted Turner, the founder of Cable News Network, the world's first 24-hour
news network, joined the establishment at last? The question is raised by
CNN's failure to relay a major scoop - its interview with Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams, on Larry King Live - direct to its European audience.
The interview ran a day later and CNN used an actor to mouth Adams'
comments. So much for the idea that CNN has redefined news from 'something
that has happened to something that is happening'. Hard to believe that CNN,
which put its reputation on the line by reporting from Baghdad at the height
of the Gulf war, was kow-towing to the silly laws which prohibit the BBC and
ITV from broadcasting Adams' comments.
CNN International said yesterday that there was nothing unusual about its
behaviour. It has been based in London since 1985 and is licensed by the
Independent Television Commission, so it has always abided by Britain's
censorship rules. Perhaps. But there must be a sneaking suspicion that a
news network which can be watched by up to 1bn people doesn't want to
jeopardise its chances of increasing the European penetration of lucrative
ventures, such as its cartoon network, by upsetting officialdom.

No one was more surprised at Observer's item, just before Christmas,
suggesting that plans for an NHS Lotto had foundered in 1988, than the staff
of the National Hospital Trust who were completing the 235th weekly draw.
True, the initial draw was halted for three months by the Crown Prosecution
Service which disputed Lovell White Durrant's advice that the lottery was
legal. The CPS eventually gave the go-ahead, much to the relief of Lovell's
Patrick Phillipps. He must be hoping that his latest gamble - advising
Rothschild's bid for the National Lottery - goes more smoothly.
For its part, the National Hospital Trust takes comfort from the new
freedoms allowed to existing lotteries in the National Lottery Act. No doubt
ministers have been reminded of the last time a National Lottery was allowed
to become a monopoly. John Blunt, having set up the first really successful
government lottery in 1710, subsequently devised the 'South Sea Bubble'
scheme to buy up, in part, the government's liability for Pounds 9m worth of
lottery prizes.

The wheel of fate comes full circle, if you give it enough time. Back in the
1950s BMW was in poorer shape than Rover ever was. It so confused its
customers - how could they trust a manufacturer which produced cheap
three-wheel bubble cars and large expensive Grand Tourers - that the
management wanted to put BMW into voluntary liquidation. They put the idea
to shareholders. Bavarian pride took over - the management got the push
instead.
Clearly BMW was fated to become a big name in British motoring terms. Ford
in Britain once produced a television advertisement which was never shown
because it was considered in poor taste. It featured a Spitfire speeding
through blue skies, while a voice-over declared: 'During the second world
war Ford built hundreds of thousands of aircraft engines in Britain. That's
why today the British do not have to say: Vorsprung durch Technik.' How
wrong they were.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Long leash for a runaway economy: China's reforms are
deepening but inflation is a persistent and worrying threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese leaders might have reason for self-congratulation as they prepare
for the annual Spring Festival holiday with a new batch of economic reforms
in place. But worries about inflation, an overheating economy and unrest
among peasants and industrial workers are casting a shadow over the
celebrations.
In the Year of the Dog, which begins on Thursday of next week, the
leadership's greatest challenge will almost certainly be to wring inflation
out of a surging economy while consolidating fiscal and monetary reform.
Failure to counter the prices spiral would risk further social distress,
especially in industrial towns and cities where workers in faltering state
industries are suffering considerable hardship.
For Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, the
Chinese new year brings mixed blessings: financial reform is deepening but
inflation is casting a worrying shadow. He cannot be complacent about
achieving his oft-stated wish of a 'soft landing' for an economy which,
judging by the latest industrial production statistics, is continuing to
defy efforts to rein it in.
Industrial output in December grew by an astonishing 29.8, according to the
State Statistical Bureau, an increase of 11 per cent over November's rate of
growth. This acceleration surprised western economists in Beijing, and
indicates a quicker-than-expected response from industry to an easing of
credit restrictions in the last quarter of 1993.
Accompanying the burst in economic activity has been an increase in prices.
In December, the cost of living rose by an annualised 23.9 per cent in the
leading urban centres, compared with 21.9 per cent for the 12 months to
November.
In response, the leadership gave a clear sign last weekend that it is
anxious to curb a rampant economy. China's state council, or cabinet, said
it would not approve new investments in fixed assets this year beyond
existing projects. More than anything else, the capital spending spree has
contributed to unsustainable economic growth rates.
In 1993, fixed asset investment - in activities such as the construction of
economic development zones - grew by 47 per cent to Yuan115bn (Dollars
13.3bn) compared with the previous year. This year's capital spending target
of Yuan131bn represents a 14 per cent increase on last year, although the
state council decree may herald a lower increase.
But Mr Zhu and his colleagues know they must be careful at a time of
increasing unemployment - particularly in urban areas - not to apply the
brakes too harshly. 'What we want is a soft landing while the growth rate is
gradually lowered. If we drastically reduced the growth rate, we would have
to pay the cost of social stability,' Mr Zhu told Business Week magazine
recently.
Western officials in Beijing are giving the leadership the benefit of the
doubt about gradually bringing the economy under control. 'I do see positive
developments,' said the representative of an international bank. 'There has
been a switch in policy from emphasis on growth at all costs to stability
and consolidation.
'While they are entering the new year on the back of strong economic
activity, the trend for this year as a whole will be towards lower growth,'
he added. Mr Zhu and his colleagues have set a growth target of 9 per cent
for the year, down from 12.8 per cent in 1993. But western economists doubt
this target is attainable.
One worrying development for the leadership is that cost of living increases
in politically sensitive rural areas - peasants are in a sour mood about low
returns and high input costs - are catching up with those in urban centres.
In 1993, the national average increase in the cost of living was 14.5 per
cent: the rise was 15.7 per cent in the 35 main urban centres against 13.3
per cent in the countryside. In the past few years, the difference in the
cost of living between country and city has halved to about 2 per cent.
The authorities cannot afford to ignore threats to public order in a
fractious countryside. Surplus labour among the peasant population is
estimated at between 150m and 200m, and more than 200 incidents of rural
unrest were reported last year. While the grain harvest in 1993 was
bountiful, some hard-pressed farmers witheld grain they were obliged to sell
to the state in protest at low prices and rising seed and fertiliser costs.
These protests, which coincided with reports that the state was about to
raise the price of compulsorily acquired grain, spurred a round of panic
buying by consumers and steep price increases late last year. Local
authorities were obliged to dump government stocks of grain onto the market
and, in some cases, to introduce ceilings to dampen a price spiral.
In light of restiveness over price increases, the authorities have redoubled
efforts to curb monetary growth, with Mr Zhu demanding strict controls on
new credit at a national bankers' conference in Beijing late last month.
'You should not surpass these (loan) limits by even one cent,' said Mr Zhu,
who is also central bank governor.
Money supply figures for the fourth quarter last year have not yet dribbled
out of the Chinese bureaucracy. But they will almost certainly show a sharp
rise over the quarter to the end of September, as a panicky government
loosened the purse strings in response to urgent pleas from state industries
whose supplies of credit had been choked off.
The rate of M1 growth, the broader measure of monetary growth, had fallen
sharply from 34.2 per cent in June last year to 20.4 per cent in September
after a mid-year 16-point austerity programme. Banks were obliged to recall
loans for speculative activities, and new credit was squeezed tight.
Now, the Chinese economic reform programme faces a crucial year, in the view
of western officials. There is no question the leadership has set itself an
extraordinarily ambitious programme. It includes sweeping reforms of
banking, trade and of foreign exchange management. But the most difficult
challenges will be reforms to the tax system and state enterprises.
Tax changes are to include a complex new revenue-sharing arrangement between
Beijing and the provinces, along with a value-added tax (VAT) system that
would challenge the most sophisticated tax authorities. A western banker
said he doubted there were half a dozen officials in the tax bureau who
fully understood the new regime.
But Mr Zhu insists the government will muddle through. Senior officials say
tax reform will probably take about five years to implement and perfect. And
Chinese and foreign businesses would seem to be justified in their
apprehension about dealing with the tax authorities in what promises to be a
chaotic initial phase.
Reform of crumbling state enterprises poses huge problems, and plans to
tackle this vexed issue are murky. Officials have announced 100 enterprises
will be singled out for a process of corporatisation - a Chinese half-way
house to privatisation in which enterprises are detached from state control
 -but results are likely to be patchy, judging by past efforts.
The main question before policymakers this year will be the extent to which
they have to compromise on their central task of fighting inflation. The
views expressed by the World Bank in October hold good today. 'A premature
loosening of monetary policy at the present time could jeopardise the
hard-fought early gains on inflation and trigger a re-emergence of high
inflationary expectations,' wrote the bank's chief economist in Beijing.
Reforms are being implemented rapidly, but in the absence of low inflation,
Mr Zhu and his colleagues are continuing to live dangerously. They cannot
afford to ignore threats posed by inflation or signs of social unrest both
in the countryside and in urban centres. But there is limited room to
manoeuvre between what is politically expedient and the need to maintain
strict controls on monetary growth. Mr Zhu has shown he is prepared to risk
strong opposition to his austerity programme, but he cannot be sure that he
will prevail.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mostly wise on open skies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's report on the European airline industry by a committee of 'wise
men' makes many good points. The committee,set up to advise the European
Commission, rightly points out that the industry's financial crisis is due
to poor productivity as well as the recession. And it argues that the
Commission should press ahead with its open skies policy, which aims to
create a competitive market, despite pressure from some flag-carriers and
their governments to reverse it.
Competition is necessary if flag-carriers are to improve their productivity.
So long as they are able to huddle behindmonopolistic barriers receiving
drip-feeds of state aid, they will have little incentive to cut costs and
restructure. Without a competitive market, Europe's passengers will also
continue to suffer from fares which are higher than prices on comparable
routes in the US.
The wise men also make useful points aboutairport slots and bottlenecks in
the skies. If competitors continue to have difficulty gaining access to
take-off and landing slots, last year's liberalisationof the market will
come to little. Equally damaging are the region's antiquatedand fragmented
air traffic control systems.
So far so good. The snag is that the wise men spoil their overall report by
reluctantly agreeing that further state handouts to financially troubled
flag-carriers will be necessary. This is despite their argument that state
aid distorts competition and that governments should not intervene for
non-commercial reasons in airline operations.
The risk of even such a reluctant endorsement of aid is that it could open
the floodgates to new airline subsidies. The Commission, which is
responsible for policing handouts, is already investigating cases involving
Air France and Portugal's TAP. Greece's Olympic, Italy's Alitalia and
Spain's Iberia could also be in line.
Further disrepute
A new raft of airline subsidies would undermine the Commission's open skies
policy, as unaided rivals would not be willing to compete with aided
flag-carriers. It would also bring Europe's single market, which was badly
damaged by the Commission's approval of Ecu7bn in handouts to steel
companies last December, into further disrepute. If efficient private
enterprises find the playing field tilted against them, they will ask
whether there ismuch point in a single market.
The wise men recognise this danger and try to guard against it by proposing
tough conditions for new subsidies. They say this should be the last time
airlines receive aid and that it should be allowed only as part of
restructuring plans which ultimately lead to privatisation. The committee
also wants the Commission to hire independent analysts to investigate aid
cases and then publish their reports.
Best guarantee
Such conditions ' which many flag-carriers will consider excessively harsh '
are certainlybetter than no conditions. Privatisation would provide the best
guarantee that aid was provided on a last chance basis. Meanwhile,
publication of independent reports would be a welcome step towards greater
transparency. In the past, there have been concerns that the Commission,
working behind closed doors, has approved hand-outs by wrongly categorising
them as rational investments.
But non-aided airlines will ask why the flag-carriers deserve a last chance.
The reason, according to the wise men, is that without aid flag-carriers
could go bankruptand that would not be politically acceptable.
This argument is too defeatist. The banning of aid could be just what is
needed to spur airlines into speedy restructuring programmes - cutting
staff, withdrawing from unprofitable routes and disposing of peripheral
activities. With radical programmes in place, there would be no need for
aid, as financial injections could probably be justifiedon normal investment
criteria.
If the Commission was not willing to oppose aid, it would arguably be in
dereliction of its duty under the Treaty of Rome. This outlaws subsidies
except in narrowly defined circumstances. Liberal-minded member states
should then consider taking legal action to enforce a tougher line.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Global forum idea akin to revamped
OECD plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BARTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ideas for a new global forum put forward by Mr Peter Sutherland in
Davos and reported in your issue of January 29 ('Sutherland urges new global
forum') are not dissimilar to those discussed in September 1992 at a
conferenceentitled 'Building a new democratic order', held at Airlie House,
near Washington DC.
It was then suggested that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development should be revamped around the nucleus of the existing member
countries to bring in fast developing and less developed countries at
different levels as previously proposed by the secretary-general, Mr
Jean-Claude Paye.
Thus the OECD would become the main forum for dialogue between the
industrialised world and other groups such as the newly industrialising
Asean countries and Latin American countries moving towards greater economic
co-operation. TheOECD could also help relations between Europe, North
America and Japan, as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Area
and Asean dev-elop into more cohesive economic areas.
As a first step, the revamped OECD would act as a think-tank or policy unit
subordinate to the Group of Seven, but with its representatives, including
those from the developing world, attending certain sessionsof the annual
economic summit of the Group of Seven. Among the OECD's priorities would be
unemployment among the advanced industrial countries.

<TEXT>
Sir, So Rover is to be sold to BMW, just a few years after it was 'rescued'
by British Aerospace. The statement from BAe, at the time of purchase, that
there was much synergy between aerospace and car manufacture ranghollow then
and subsequent statements that Rover was a core business ring hollow now.
All the talk about BMW investing in Rover and possible resurrection of the
'great names' from the past is probably just that. It is designed to
minimise the outcry. Take Ford and Vauxhall as examples. Gradually, the
engineering and design skills have been moved out of Britain and into
Germany/US leavingBritain as little more than a location for low-cost
assembly. The trouble with low-cost countries is that there is always
another one coming up behind and companies have few qualms about shifting
production elsewhere to remain competitive.
Nobody is denying that the history of Rover/BLMC/BL/BMC is littered
withmistakes and gross negligence, nor that much remains to be done (three
of its models - the 800, the 200/400 and the Metro - are overdue for
replacement). Nevertheless, Rover appears to be sound and worthy of further
investment. That it should be starved of such investment by BAe shows up the
latter's problems more than it does Rover's. I make no apology for saying
that Rover should remain underBritish control.
Once again, the failings of this administration and of the City are shown
up. The mindless pursuit of short-term profit and cash to satisfy the latest
five-year corporate plan and 'vision/mission statement' is distinctly at
odds with managing for the long term. It is left to the Germans, the French
and the south-east Asians not only to have a long-term vision but to holdto
that vision and to ensure that, come the end-game, they will be around.
Regrettably, Britain will not be and I despair of our prospects.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Don't cry over Rover' (February 1), is incredibly
complacent and defeatist. It is complacent because if you had bothered to
read the article, 'A sudden burst of acceleration', adjacent to your
editorial you wouldhave noted that one of the sad conclusions of the writer
is that the replacement for the Rover 800 will be based on a five-series BMW
platform. As a result it is clear that future research and development will
be concentrated in Germany, so Rover car production will inevitably become
an assembly unit. BMW will concentrate resources in Land Rover since it is
clear that it is this aspect of Rover which the German carmaker wants.
You are defeatist in suggesting that Britain does not have a viable future
in important areas of production. I find this a disturbing conclusion and I
would suggest that if, say, General Motors attempted to purchase BMW the
whole of Germany would be up in arms and such a proposed sale would never go
through.
I have purchased Rover cars for the last 10 years; whether I will continue
to buy a German Rover is another matter.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your 'Serious Money' article (January 29) suggested that 'fee-based
advice may be the answer', but this must be a non-starter. Having sung the
praises of fee-based independent financial advisers, you imply that other
IFAs on commission cannot be trusted and point us to your article about
Norton and Partners, headed eye-catchingly 'Bodyguard against sharks'.
This is all verywell for your more affluent readers but someone like me,
with less than Pounds 20,000 to invest, perhaps requiring modest pension
arrangements to be set up, would not get a look in with these advisers -
they will not touch me unless I earn more than Pounds 50,000 per annum and
offer up an investment portfolio of around Pounds 80,000. Even if you feel
that their Pounds 800 fee up front followed by similar amounts each year is
a good deal, what about poor old me and many of your other less fortunate
readers? Surely you do not think that the cut-price brokers who offer
rebates will seriously look after me on an ongoing basis - they will not sit
down with me for long to discuss my more modest investments. In the end it
seems that there will only be financial advice for those who can afford to
buy it.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Better part of valour: Nato should discriminate between
central Europe and central Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago in Brussels the leaders of the Atlantic alliance de-clared
that they 'expect and would welcome Nato expansion that would reach to
democratic states to our east as part of an evolutionary process'. But they
neither set a timetable nor named any potential new members.
Instead the alliance, like some belle dame of Arthurian legend, invited her
suitors to enrol in a new order of knights, to be called 'Partnership for
Peace' (PFP), and to prove themselves by deeds of valour and chivalry.
Each knightmust propose exploits of his own choosing for the alliance's
approval. Some knights will offer to host grand tournaments, or 'exercises',
on their ancestral lands. Others will send young squires to ride behind
Nato's seasoned champions and receive instruction in knightly conduct.
Others, from the far north, will show off their prowess in peacekeeping. And
some will redesign their crossbows and lances to meet Nato specifications.
(Those who offer to re-equip Nato's own arsenals at low cost, however, may
meet a rather cool reception.)
Which of these exploits, if any, will win the lady's fair hand? She is not
saying. In the best traditions of romance, the knight must be sustained in
his ordeal by blind devotion to his chosen damsel, not by any certainty of
reward.
At first sight, the new Partnership is but the old NACC (North Atlantic
Co-operation Council) writ large. One anomaly has been removed, in that PFP
is open to formerly neutral and non-aligned European countries as well as to
Nato's former adversaries. Otherwise it is hard to see what can be done
under the new heading that could not have been done under the old. PFP, for
all the grand rhetoric it has been wrapped in, is transparently a device for
gaining time, for postponing invidious choices.
No doubt it is true that would-be Nato members in central Europe are not yet
'ready' for membership. That is, their forces are not equipped or trained
for service in the integrated Nato command. The political and strategic
implications of stationing allied forces on their territory have not been
fully considered. Their democracy may be in some respects imperfect and
fragile. Some of them have unresolved minority problems, which may render
them vulnerable to subversion or embroil them in conflict with their
neighbours.
But to suggest that all those problems have to be resolved before a
political decision about membership can be taken is to rewrite the history
of Nato itself. Few if any of the present members would have qualified by
those standards in 1949.
The l eaders of that time, infused with a stronger sense of urgency and
purpose than their successors today, took the political decision first. They
resolved, in theNorth Atlantic Treaty, 'to unite their efforts for
collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security'. They
agreed that an armed attack against one of their countries should be
considered an attack against them all, and that if such an attack occurred
each of them would assist the party attacked 'bytaking . . . such action as
it deems necessary, including the use of armed force'.
Only later did they take specific military measures, including the creation
of the integrated command, to deal with what they saw as a specific military
threat. The treaty provided a framework within which to do that.
Similarly if Nato were expanded now there would be time for its members, old
and new, to sit down together and make a cool, rational assessment of the
threats theyface, and to devise an effective strategy for countering those
threats. The newmembers would no longer suspect the old ones of minimising
the threat in order to avoid taking on new commitments; and the old members
would no longer suspect the new ones of maximising it in order to bounce
them into a guarantee, since they would already have given one.
The only serious argument against admitting new members to Nato now is the
one given by US President Bill Clinton in Brussels on January 9. It would be
wrong, he said, 'to draw a new line between east and west that could create
a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation'.
While it might be comforting for those included, it would increase thesense
of isolation or alienation among those excluded. This applies not only
toRussia, but perhaps even more forcefully to other ex-Soviet republics,
which would see themselves thereby consigned to a de facto Russian sphere of
influence. Ukraine in particular, while sharing the strong sense of
insecurity that makes its western neighbours clamour for Nato membership, is
quite explicit about its hopes that they will not succeed, since it knows it
has virtually no chance of following suit.
Certainly 'drawing a line' should not mean renouncing allinterest in the
area beyond it. The principles of the UN charter would still apply, and no
one should imagine that acts of aggression against other ex-Soviet republics
by Russia, or any other power, would not have very serious consequencesfor
that power's relations with the west.
But western determination to defend the new-won freedom of central Europe
should be of a different order. The countries of central Europe have already
been identified, by last year's Copenhagen summit, as future members of the
European Union. It should be clear that those countries are now part of the
west, and that Russia will never again be allowed to turn them into
satellites against their will, no matter how future relations between Russia
and the west turn out.

FT  02 FEB 94 / A tough climb in Silicon Glen: James Buxton asks if the
Scottish electronics industry is equipped for long-term survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elegant electronics factories set in landscaped parkland, producing personal
computers, mobile telephones or microchips, have replaced smokestack
industries such as steel and shipbuilding as the mainstay of Scotland's
manufacturing industry.
For the government, the Scottishelectronics industry is one of its successes
of industrial policy. It accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports.
But questions are being raised about whether Silicon Glen has the resilience
to survive changes sweeping the international electronics industry. Critics
charge that it is an artificial creation, consisting largely of branches of
foreign-owned companies lured in by government grants, and showing little
capacity for spontaneous growth. After expanding by an average of 16.5 per
cent a year in the 1980s, the industry's output hasnot grown since 1989.
Its weaknesses have been crystallised in arecent report by Monitor, the US
management consultancy, which warned that if nothing were done to strengthen
the industry plants would close or contract and employment might, as early
as 1997, fall to about 27,500 from its present 45,300.
The report has produced alarmist headlines, and the gloomy findings were
probably overdone. But Mr Alastair Macpherson, former head of the
electronics division at the now defunct Scottish Development Agency, the
government's economic regeneration organisation, says: 'What the report said
couldn't have come asa surprise to anyone. All that's happened is that it is
no longer taboo to talkabout problems which were recognised in the late
1980s. What's needed is a change in government policy.'
In the past four decades the government's policy has been to encourage
inward investment by global companies such as IBM and Compaq, which make
personal computers, Motorola, which makes mobile telephones and microchips,
Digital (computers and microchips) and NEC (microchips). They have regarded
Scotland as a relatively low-cost manufacturing base for the EuropeanUnion
market.
But few of these multinationals carry out research, development and
marketing in Scotland. The main exceptions are NCR, which makes
cashdispensers in Dundee and markets them worldwide, and Hewlett-Packard,
which develops telecommunications testing equipment in South Queensferry. In
addition, few of them have significant links with indigenous Scottish
suppliers, which have won only 12 per cent of the market for subcontracting
and components.
The Monitor report, commissioned by the SDA's successor, Scottish
Enterprise, says the Scottish electronics 'cluster' is thus weaker than
those of some other countries. Unlike, for example, in Singapore or Ireland,
the UK government has not picked particular sub-sectors, such as software,
and encouraged companies which concentrate on them.
The report adds that companies, universities and investors, such as venture
capitalists, have not been integrated in the typeof network that has
generated innovation in Silicon Valley, California, or Massachusetts. This,
it says, has meant the region has lacked the ability to respondto market
opportunities.
Further, the consultants believe, global trends are working against
Scotland. As product life cycles shorten, software is becoming more
im-portant in product design. But Scottish industry is heavily oriented
towards hardware.
Not only does the Scottish electronics industry have structural weaknesses,
but the report suggests it cannot rely on a fresh influx of investment to
fuel future expansion. It will face strong competition from low-cost
manufacturing bases in eastern Europe, while development of Scotland's
transport and telecommunication links may have lagged behind other parts of
western Europe.
The picture, based on research carried out in 1992 and 1993, may be unduly
pessimistic. Foreign companies are still setting up in Scotland: Exabyte,
which makes computer tape systems, last week announced plans to open a
factory employing 100 in Falkirk, central Scotland. In spite of difficulties
at its parent company, IBM's Greenock plant is not shedding labour; and
Compaqis taking on 250 extra staff at its plant near Glasgow.
Mr John Dolan, Compaq's head of European logistics, says: 'A lot of
multinationals have improved their productivity since Monitor came to
Scotland, and if it came back now, it would revise its opinion.'
A mark of the seriousness with which the Scottish electronics industry views
its problems was an agreement by local branches of multinationals to
co-operate with each other and with indigenous companies in setting up the
Scottish Electronics Forum in October 1992. Their objective isto strengthen
the industry.
Co-operation of this kind is unprecedented in Scotland. But Mr John Ward,
the resident director of IBM in Scotland and chairman of the SEF, says that
intensified global competition means that a multinational plant in Scotland
must compete for survival against other plants in the same group.
'It is in the interests of a plant in Scotland to strengthen its links with
local suppliers and win as much product development work as possible in
order to differentiate itself from the company's other plants,' he says. 'So
anything that can be done to improve the Scottish electronics industry
should help the SEF's individual members.'
The SEF's 30 members include multinationals and smaller local companies. It
is addressing problems common to all members - such as occasional blips in
the local electricity supply. It is also looking at how members could share
training of junior employees to avoid duplication; build better links
between assembly plants and subcontractors; and exploit the research work of
Scottish universities.
But despite the goodwill behind the SEF, it is evident that the
multinationals may go only a little way towards full co-operation in an
attempt to revive the industry. Mr Ward acknowledges that multinationals
will make strategic decisions according to their own interests.
If it is up to the indigenous companies to spur a revival, the record is not
particularly encouraging. Multinationals provide big opportunities for local
companies to assemble products under contract, but only two or three
Scottish companies have exploited this market on a large scale.
Many in the electronics industry believe the government itselfshould do more
to remedy the weaknesses of the electronics industry. One is Mr Martin
Ritchie, who runs Spider Systems, an Edinburgh-based company with Pounds 20m
turnover which designs its own computer networking systems. He says
government policy is skewed towards encouraging foreign companies to set up
new plants.
'I might, with a great deal of effort, be able to get a Pounds 100,000 grant
from the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a new product. But if I
was a foreign company promising to create several hundred jobs in Livingston
I might get Pounds 4m.'
Mr Finlay Mackenzie, a retired manager of Hewlett-Packard's SouthQueensferry
plant, says the government ought to encourage multinationals to putdown
deeper roots by giving them financial incentives for R&amp;D. He says the
Queensferry plant is a good example: 'It is dependent on British brains; it
is not something that can be whisked away at the whim of someone elsewhere
in the company.'
So far there is no sign that the government is planning to change its
approach to inward investment. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, says the
report is 'helpful' but adds that 'better founded predictions can be made'.
He has left it to Scottish Enterprise and the SEF to deal with the specific
threats to the industry.
But warnings about the future of Silicon Glenhave led many in the industry
to believe that the government needs to rethink its attitude to inward
investment, to focus less on job creation in the short term and more on
building a sustainable industry that can prosper in the longer term.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Market fear more likely a phobia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr IVAN COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir,Richard Waters' article on the structure of the US stock market ('The
price ofa share in the cake', January 31) provided an interesting view on
the problemsarising as a result of market fragmentation.
However, I would suggest that 'a far-reaching fear. . .that if the volume of
share trading is divided among an increasing number of arenas, the
efficiency of the market will eventually be undermined' is more truly a
phobia.
Surely if shares in a given company are traded on several arenas then
arbitrage will occur to the extent that all arenas in toto will act as
efficiently as if they were a single market. After all, isn't this what
happens to a large degree with the markets for international currency?

FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: A composer who takes his time - The latest work by
Pierre Boulez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Pierre Boulez, composition has in recent years meant as much
re-composition as brand-new invention. The few works issuing from this most
fastidious of musical pens have all been premiered in a form best described
as provisional - either admittedly incomplete, or else with an attached
health warning to the effect that further elaborations of the same material
should be expected in the future.
There have been two principal ways of viewing this process of slowed-up
creation, in an artist who in his younger days seemed the unstoppable figure
of French music: avant-garde iconoclast and prime minister all in one. The
first is that it stood for a creative impasse - which, along with his
development into one of the world's most sought-after conductors and his
foundation in 1974 of IRCAM (the Paris Beaubourg electro-acoustic
laboratory), Boulez was, with his endless compositional self-examination,
attempting to circumvent.
The second is that it marked for him a way of freeing himself from that very
impasse, itself the product of the avant-garde doctrines, dogmas and
prohibitions of the early postwar years - all self-generated - that had
threatened to land him in a creative dead end.
It would no doubt be highly improper to use the account of . . .
explosante/fixe . . . which this week the Ensemble InterContemporain gave at
the Paris Chatelet - in a form announced as 'derniere' - to produce a final
verdict on the cas Boulez. The temptation is strong, all the same, for the
impact of the music, exquisite, effervescent, and wonderfully beautiful, was
not to be related to any artistic cul-de-sac.
A necessarily simplified history of what is now 30 minutes and three
movements long is in order. The work started life, in 1972, as one of the
tributes to the recently-dead Stravinsky published in Tempo - a page of
instrumental solo-parts which could be put together in various ways.
Initially, Boulez fixed a version for three wind-instruments; soon he put
together longer ones, more fully scored, and electronic means began to enter
into the scheme.
A chain of small pieces composed in the 1980s has now been connected up to
the earlier. . . explosante/fixe . . . material: Memoriale for flute and
small ensemble, Anthemes for solo violin, a piece for vibraphone written for
the 80th birthday of the conductor Paul Sacher. The basic original idea was
that 'explosions' of musical matter, such as the work's 'signature' of
fast-skittering flute above a chattery ensemble, are pinned into shape by
variation-forms within a fixed compass of notes.
Now that the final linkage has been achieved, the artistic seemliness of the
conception can be heard and felt to filter through the whole format. An
exotic, weightlessly sensuous character - which pairs this 'late' Boulez
with an early work like Le Soleil des eaux - shines equally through the
Messiaen-like melodic unisons, with their flicks of oriental decoration, and
the witty spurts of catch-as-catch-can between groups. The electronic
element, whose sudden enlargements of perspective arrive with extraordinary
subtlety, underpins the basic conceptual contrast. The finale, based on
Memoriale, slows for reflection the previous propulsive outpouring.
In sum, the final version of . . . explosante/fixe . . . represents the
fruition of a patiently explored idea making nonsense of any notion of
Boulezian sterility: in the most flattering Mae West sense, this is a
composer who takes his time]
Boulez the conductor, taken ill shortly before the concert, ceded the baton
to the excellent David Robertson, the Ensemble's musical director. The
London South Bank Centre aims to programme the piece in next year's planned
electronic weekend; a long time to wait] I hope those plans also include a
slot for the work filling the first half of this Chatelet concert - La
Partition du ciel et de l'enfer ('The Score of Heaven and Hell') by Philippe
Manoury (b. 1952), a 45-minute voyage between precisely depicted spheres
symbolising Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto.
In a manner very different from Boulez's - bolder in gesture, more grandiose
in instrumental groupings - this piece demonstrated again the best aspect of
IRCAM-devised electronics. Indeed, the textural sheen, wide range and
sophisticated delicacy of Manoury's musical imagination proved light-years
distant from the plink-plonk sounds which too many ordinary music-lovers
still associate with the domain of Electronic Music.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: Schumann and Friends - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mini-festivals are not often so neatly planned as 'Schumann and Friends',
which is the brainchild of Raymond Leppard. Four Barbican concerts with the
English Chamber Orchestra, each including one of Schumann's symphonies,
filled out with less familiar pieces by him and with a wide variety of music
by friends and influential contemporaries: Mendelssohn, Brahms, Weber,
Hummel, Berlioz, Paganini. A judicious banquet, in fact.
On Monday the first concert - also broadcast on Radio 3 - showed him in
characteristic form. Generally brisk, unhesitating tempi, a strong sense of
continuity, a light touch that can become incisive but never strenuous; also
a certain shyness about Romantic expression, except where he has decided to
mould a passage with deliberate art.
He did that, for example, in the Larghetto of the First Symphony, which
sounded unspontaneous and slightly arch. The ECO strings, not at their most
polished here, might have achieved a more natural flow with an extra
rehearsal. On the other hand, his way with the Scherzo was very fetching.
Taking Schumann's 'molto vivace' at full value, he gave the main dance a
headlong sweep, almost falling over itself with excitement (often it seems a
more heavy-booted affair), while the contrasted Trio sections were suddenly
relaxed, cosy, even playful.
As a whole span, the symphony boasted a convincing gleam. So too Brahms's
evergreen 'Haydn' Variations, with any hint of village-band pomposity
scrubbed away, enhanced by an uncommon air of delicate introspection - true
to Brahms, of course, but usually underplayed in this work.
The novelties in the programme both had the American clarinettist Richard
Stolzman as soloist, joined by Thea King's basset horn in Mendelssohn's
indulgent little Konzertstuck. Mendelssohn himself described it as 'noodles
with cream', which is just how it sounded: long, glutinous strands of
duetting in thirds, with conventional roulades assigned to each soloist in
turn. Charmingly played, it fell pleasantly upon the ear, but once was
enough.
Weber's E-flat Concerto offered Stolzman far more opportunities for
deploying his fabulously subtle tone-colours and his genius for imaginative
phrasing - most of all in the Romance, which is really a rich concert-aria,
complete with hushed, dramatic recitative. The concerto also has sustained
bursts of mechanically brilliant virtuosity, in which even Stolzman slipped
twice or thrice in the effort of keeping up. But the heart of the
performance was in his fanciful expressive insights, and those were
breathtaking.
Remaining concerts: February 4, 5 and 8

FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: Some serious questions of taste - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do we like - no, love - the operas of Verdi and Puccini? Because they
convey romantic and engrossing stories at a high emotional pitch, expressed
in a succession of glorious, often unforgettable, tunes; tunes that allow
opera singers to display their talents in a way that we not only admire but
find heart-stoppingly beautiful.
What makes anybody imagine that new operas can reject all this and still be
attractive to opera lovers? Or is it not Channel 4's purpose with its series
of new 60-minute operas, specially commissioned for television, to attract
opera lovers? In which case, who do they want to attract?
The first of these new works on Sunday, The Empress, looked a bit like a pop
video so perhaps the idea was to attract the children who watch the
satellite pop channel, MTV. But even pop songs tend to have memorable
melodies. The colours were of the primary, paintbox, sort that we used to
see on Play-school and the costumes, er, striking. The story, 'based on a
little known 1890 work, The Empress Of Newfoundland, by the German
playwright Frank Wedekind', was pretty weird: a princess gets her rocks off
by watching a Schwarzenegger type lift increasingly heavy weights; he gets
tired of this, steals from her, and flees to a lowlife bar; she pursues him
and then cuts her throat with a meat cleaver.
What was there here to entertain? No tunes, no humour, nobody with whom to
sympathise, nothing even to like, let alone love. It seems from the
promotion that we are supposed to be terrifically impressed with a
television channel that commissions original opera (gosh how highbrow) but
if this is the result, the money might as well be spent on mindless game
shows.
*****
It must be nearly time for this column to take another look at the general
condition of television comedy. Judging from BBC2's sequence of pilots,
Comic Asides, things are in a pretty poor state. Perhaps the creators of The
High Life about stewards on a Scottish airline, Woodcock about life in
Nelson's Royal Navy, The Last Word about an arrogant journalist, and The
Honeymoon's Over about a chronically argumentative couple, all slaved night
and day to polish their scripts and hone their jokes. That is not the way
they seemed, however. Most of them, most of the time, looked like ideas
scribbled down on the back of an envelope in a lunch break and submitted on
the off-chance that somebody would be desperate enough to commission a whole
series.
*****
The comedy that was much admired here and swept the board at last year's
award ceremonies, Absolutely Fabulous, has returned for a second series.
Could it be that because of the huge success and the decision to transfer
from BBC2 to BBC1, the creator of the series, Jennifer Saunders, has been
given bigger budgets, and could that explain the appearance of crowds of
guest 'personalities' in the opening episode of Series 2? The first series
had not led us to expect Helena Bonham Carter, Mandy Rice-Davies and Suzi
Quatro all in one dream sequence. Fashion slave Edi (Saunders herself) and
the gorgeous lush Patsy (Joanna Lumley) are still two of the strongest
characters anywhere in current television comedy, and Lumley's hobbling walk
when welcoming the reporter from Hello] magazine was the funniest sight of
the week. But this episode did seem glossier, less like a self-contained mad
world than before. Perhaps it is just a question of familiarity.
*****
Even a television critic can hardly spend his wife's birthday stuck on the
old green sofa in front of the box, but what is there in the London theatre
that would make a suitable outing? An Absolute Turkey sounds likely: Feydeau
farce directed by Peter Hall, starring Felicity Kendal and Griff Rhys Jones,
recently opened to rave reviews. Sure enough Kendal is simply splendid, and
you can feel the entire male section of the audience falling in love with
her. Moreover, although this is an 18-strong cast (enormous in the West End
these days) there is not a single weak link. The art nouveau sets by Gerald
Scarfe are far more impressive than his cartoons.
We enjoy ourselves. But so we should: our two seats at the back of the
stalls cost Pounds 44, which would pay the television licence fee for more
than six months. The price of two glasses of wine and a programme take the
total above Pounds 50. Furthermore, although there is of course the
matchless atmosphere of live theatre, to habitual viewers of modern
television comedy the plotting here does seem remarkably primitive and the
comedy very basic knockabout stuff. True, this was written 98 years ago, but
we should acknowledge that style and pace have moved on. The gag rate in
Drop The Dead Donkey or Fawlty Towers is much higher than in An Absolute
Turkey.
*****
One of television's most entertaining new series for a long time is not a
situation comedy but an American import on Channel 4 called The Unpleasant
World Of Penn And Teller. Some viewers will loathe this gaff-blowing
conjuring programme: live rats caged over a man's face (a trick known as
'Room 101') and a white rabbit seemingly being fed through an agricultural
shredding machine are not everybody's cup of tea. But if you enjoy American
showbiz chutzpah, and find traditional magic series a bit ponderous, you may
enjoy the almost contemptuous way in which these two men send up their
predecessors and competitors. Last week they showed us how to use a
miniature carton of coffee whitener for an 'exploding eyeball' trick - and
then had the studio audience do it en masse: ghastly, but hilarious.
*****
The trend towards 'infotainment' continues with the launch on BBC1 of How Do
They Do That?, a 45-minute programme on Tuesdays that combines the 'Just
Fancy That]' element of the old tabloid press with the educational instincts
of Victorian boys' books. The opening programme showed us how stunt
arrangers achieved the effect of Desmond Lynam, the main presenter, leaping
out of a helicopter and crashing through the roof of Television Centre into
the studio, how doctors sewed back a policeman's hand after it had been
severed with a sword, and how Australians spent Dollars 7m on an American
lottery to win Dollars 27m. The programme has been greeted with some scorn,
but it is well enough done (though I was more baffled at the end of the
lottery item than at the beginning). Lynam is a pleasant and highly
professional presenter, and - provided the BBC continues to make Newsnight,
Horizon, Assignment and other serious current affairs programmes - it is
difficult to see why they should not do this sort of thing if viewers want
it. Just don't look for any more reviews on this page.
The grammar in television news trailers, especially the way in which tenses
are used, becomes increasingly absurd. Recently Alastair Stewart announced:
'In 50 minutes on London Tonight two children are killed by their mother. We
ask . . .'

Publicise something weird and nasty and some medical and social workers will
promptly diagnose it all over the place. It happened with the sexual abuse
of children and now, it seems, Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy is being made to
look like an epidemic. Dispatches investigates. MSBP means drawing attention
to yourself by lying about or harming the people you look after. The
notorious case of the nurse, Beverley Alitt, who killed or attempted to
kill, the babies in her care has been followed by further diagnoses. Are
they accurate? (9.00 C4).
In Middlemarch on BBC2 the widowed Dorothea is now free to carry on with
hunky chunky Ladislaw, provided she is willing to forfeit the property she
would have inherited from nasty scheming Casaubon (9.30).
When Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) made its 'Wishing Well Appeal' in
1987 it was so successful that it blighted other charities, some of which

FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Profits from preservation - As
many US zoos are privatised, they are beginning to undergo an ecological
awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanging in the personnel offices of the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston is a
poster which reads: 'Extinction is forever.' At the hot dog stand, a message
has been taped to the napkin dispenser: 'Please conserve. Save a tree.' At
the African tropical rain forest exhibit, an entire wall is devoted to
explaining the ecological dangers facing rain forests in the world.
Welcome to the modern zoo, a hotbed of environmental activism.
Zoos and aquariums have come a long way since the dark days of cramped cages
and disregard for animals in the wild. While the image emanating from
Hollywood is still negative - the popular children's film Free Willy, about
a whale, caused an international furore last year when its decrepit
real-life living conditions in Mexico City were discovered - most US zoos
and aquariums today are highly sensitive to environmental concerns.
Zoos in the US are now seeking to redefine their ecological role in the face
of increasing fund shortages. Since many US zoos and aquariums have been
privatised, they are more dependent on their own revenue streams, and are
under pressure to set priorities. The challenge will be to continue
environmental programmes in a cost-effective way.
'Increased co-operation between international zoos will become more
important in the face of severe fund shortages,' says Michael Wallace,
curator of conservation at the Los Angeles Zoo. Animal conservation will
continue to be one of the mainstays of zoos' ecological efforts.
'Zoos went through an awakening on animal conservation,' says John Linehan,
general curator for the Franklin Park Zoo. 'In the past, we'd be happy if
the animals had a few babies now and then, to attract the public, but that
was the extent of our breeding efforts. Then we started noticing that
animals were getting harder to find and more expensive. We realised this
great resource we had, and that we could become a major player in animal
conservation.'
A number of species exist only in captivity, and zoos and aquaria breed
these species to prevent extinction. Reintroduction of the animals into the
wild is the ultimate goal in many cases, and some zoos have chalked up
stunning successes in this area.
The Arabian oryx, a large antelope, for example, was extinct in the wild
until zoos began to reintroduce the animal in the 1970s and 1980s. Today,
several hundred roam the deserts of Oman. Similarly, the black-footed ferret
was successfully reintroduced in Wyoming, and the Sumatra tiger in
Indonesia.
There are numerous pitfalls to reintroduction, however. The programmes are
extremely expensive to administer, so the number of targeted species must be
limited. Moreover, many involved in the industry complain that zoos and
aquariums are too often the last-ditch effort.
'Reintroduction from zoo populations is usually a last resort, an
after-thought,' says Michael Hutchins, director of conservation and science
at the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. 'Releasing
animals back into the wild would be more effective - and less expensive - if
we did it before numbers dwindled to a dangerous level. It's a lot easier to
boost the numbers of existing populations than to create a population from
scratch.'
Zoos hope to correct this problem by becoming increasingly involved in 'in
situ' conservation - that is, conservation in the wild.
Involving local people is the key to an effective reintroduction programme,
say conservationists. Poverty-stricken people understandably see
conservation as a luxury, and will often not hesitate to hunt endangered
species, or log forest areas necessary for the species' survival. Along the
Atlantic coast of Brazil, for instance, locals have been employed as guards
and monitors for the golden-eyed tamarin. 'The people who are dependent on
this animal's survival to make a living become staunch protectionists,' says
Benjamin Beck of the National Zoo.
Zoos and aquariums also see education as a priority in their preservation
efforts. According to AAZPA, whose members had a budget of Dollars 825m
(Pounds 557m) last year, 105m people visited a zoo or aquarium in the US
last year. 'That gives us a tremendous potential to reach the public,' says
Hutchins. As an added advantage, educational programmes are relatively
inexpensive to administer.
In addition, aquariums are especially good at incorporating animals into
their entertainment mix. Marine animal 'acts' often include environmental
messages. A sea lion at the New England Aquarium, for instance, makes a show
of tossing rubbish into the appropriate recycling containers.
While conservation efforts and education will continue, ecological
fund-raising at many zoos is likely to be curtailed over the next few years.
With limited resources, zoos say they cannot afford to raise money for
causes other than their own. So benefits for other wildlife organisations
are likely to be phased out. Research is also controversial, with many
institutions believing funds are too short to stretch themselves far in that
area.
Indeed, the availability of funds over the next few years will help
determine the number of environmental projects zoos and aquariums involve
themselves in. Environmentalism is important, say zoo officials and
managers, but they cannot afford to lose sight of their main function, which
is to provide entertainment.
'If people don't have fun, they will stop coming,' says Ronald Tilson,
director of conservation at the Minnesota Zoo, 'and that will be the end of
our ecological involvement. While we're worrying about environmental issues
we have to make sure that our visitors are having a good time with the
animals. In the end, that may be the most important message of all.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Green space in the Tunisian
desert - British Gas was obliged to ensure minimum pollution from new
projects in Sfax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tourists seeking a sleepy or swinging Mediterranean resort would be
disappointed if they tookthe turning into the southern Tunisian town of
Sfax.
A stinging smog bathes the industrial city, the result of a steady pall of
smoke coming from a nearby phosphate plant. A mountain of gypsum, the waste
product from the process, dominates the skyline. It is also the source of
pollutants which have leached their way through to the nearby sea to kill
much of the local marine life.
The casual visitor might think that a new oil derrick or two sticking up
above thesprawling town and its hundreds of small metal and furniture
workshops and car repair yards would do little to spoil the scenery. Yet
local environmental concerns have been one of the strongest influences on
British Gas's approach to its second-largest foreign project to date.
The need to persuade sceptical Tunisian officials that British Gas's
operations in and around Sfax would not create a new source of pollution to
rival the phosphate plant was a constant theme during years of negotiations,
according to Jack Barnes, the British engineer who oversaw the company's
growing involvement in Tunisia from 1989 until his recent retirement.
British Gas's presence in Tunisia stems from its purchase in 1988 of the
international oil and gas assets of Tenneco, the US company. In 1991,it
discovered the Rhemoura oil field which underlies Sfax. Offshore oil finds
were made in 1992. The company began development work on the Pounds 500m
offshore Miskar gas field south of Sfax late last year, and expects the
first Miskar gas to flow in 1995.
The company's Pounds 40m investment in oil production in the area is much
smaller than the Miskar project, which includes a large land-based
processing plant. But the company knew that the way in which it ran its oil
operations would indicate to sceptical local officials how it might handle
the much larger and more politically sensitive gas field development.
Producing oil in urban areas has long been a practice in the US, where
'nodding donkey' pumpingunits can be seen in settings as varied as
supermarket car parks and behind false building facades in Hollywood.
British Gas engineers studied sites in Texas and Florida to help ensure that
the operations in Sfax caused a minimum of disruption.
In Sfax, as elsewhere, public concerns centred around possible inconvenience
and safety. British Gas held a series of town meetings to explain its
proposals. Gaining the support of the regional governor was also a priority,
according to Barnes, especially as one of the first exploratory wells was
drilled ina field next to his official residence.
The long wires needed for seismic testing were laid along streets and
alleyways at night and had to be picked upbefore dawn to avoid people who
were going to work. 'It was a tedious and cumbersome process,' according to
William Lehmann, general manager of oil operations. 'We had to be
particularly careful when doing the thumping' that sends the seismic waves
into the ground.
The complex geologic structure of the latest exploration well now being
drilled in Sfax required the use of oil-based mudto lubricate drill bits and
to carry rock cuttings back to the surface.
There was no local hazardous waste disposal site, so British Gas had to seek
itsown solution.
The contaminated cuttings are taken to a bio-remediation site the company
built south of Sfax, where Joe Frank Dean, a former rodeo cowboy from New
Mexico, herds millions of bacteria which eat their way through the
toxicparticles. The clean cuttings and nutrient wastes are then tilled into
nearby farm land.
The process of convincing the Tunisians that British Gas intended to follow
the best environmental practices in all its activities extended to arranging
visits by leading Tunisian officials to similar British Gas facilities in
the UK.
The company even looked at ways in which the mountain of gypsum could be
used, going so far as to find a second-hand plant in the US which could be
shipped over to convert the waste into road aggregate. But a shortage of
cash in Tunisia put paid to the scheme.
Company officials were determined that no comparisons could be made between
the much maligned phosphate plant and its own gas processing facility. A
helicopter search of the coast produced a site that promised to be as
inconspicuous as possible. The plant, hidden from themain coastal road by a
small hill and a belt of olive trees, will occupy only 15 ha of the 69 ha
site.
It is at the Hannibal processing site, however, that British Gas's
environmental strategy came unstuck, although ironically in a way which is
unlikely to raise many local concerns.
The 'sour' gas fromthe Miskar field contains large amounts of sulphur,
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and liquid condensates which require lengthy
processing to remove. The extracted sulphur and condensates will be sold
separately from the clean gas.
But B ritish Gas engineers were stumped when they looked for economic ways
in which to dispose of the carbon dioxide, a suspected greenhouse gas.
Re-injection of thegas was considered, but there were serious doubts about
the technology involvedand worries that the cost would make an already
marginal project uneconomic, according to Richard Hart, operations manager.
The result is that 1.10m cu m of carbon dioxide - a 'fair amount' concedes
Hart - will be released into the atmosphere each day.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Recruitment: Cop-out or blow-up, the saga ends - Compared
with the strides made by medicine, training and selection methods have
scarcely stirred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Week by week the mystery mounted as the hooded killer struck again and
again. Most mystified of all were the masked murderer's two prime targets in
the old Eagle comic's serial story, though they were finally saved when he
accidentally topped himself instead. The saga closed as the heroes unmasked
him, revealing a face they had never seen before. 'But who is he, why did he
want to kill us?' gasped one. To which the other replied: 'We shall never
know.'
Of thecountless ways there are to end a story, that example always struck me
as the worst possible cop-out . . . Until now, when the task of winding up
my 21 years of writing Jobs columns has made me see that the Eagle's ending
is the best in the book. For I fear that my only alternative to copping out
in the words that follow, is going to be to blow up.
The reason is that I cannot look back on much progress towards solving the
problem which has been this column's central concern. It is how to ensure
that society's most important jobs are filled with the people best able to
do them.
That is not to say there has been any lack of supposed solutions. On the
contrary, they have come winging in thick and fast. The trouble is that, to
judge by their effect on the British economy at any rate, they don't work.
Indeed, compared with the strides made by medicinein even my adult lifetime,
our skills at equipping and selecting people for theworkplace have hardly
stirred. But that hasn't prodded either governments or managements to seek
different techniques, as opposed to importing essentially similar but more
elaborate methods in the hope of patching over the glaring deficiencies of
those already in use.
The daftest case of such symptom-treating that I've seen happen in Britain
is to my mind the one that will prove most damaging as well. It began with
the big expansion of higher education in the 1960s, which has been made to
look small by the further expansions of recent years.
Even at the outset, however, nobody bothered to work out how the increase
wasto be paid for. The expansionists just assumed that, besides making the
countrymore civilised culturally, the injection of more graduates into the
workforce would somehow generate greater national prosperity to boot.
So political panjandrums and other establishment spokesmen called on
employers to restrict their recruiting for the better-paid career
opportunities to young people with degrees. The employers, after first
responding slowly, have done so with growing bureaucratic vigour ever since.
Although thousands of graduates have been left unemployed by the latest
recession, it has nevertheless boosted their average chances of finding
worthwhile work in preference to young people without degrees. The only real
change is that, instead of just screening out any applicants lacking
graduate status, employers now further screen out many who possess it by the
use of psychometric-type tests.
Meanwhile, of course, the long promisedboosts in productivity and
civilisation remain most noticeable by their absence. Moreover - as I
reported three weeks ago - a researcher called Dr Derek North, who works for
Britain's official employment service, has come up with evidence not merely
that academic qualifications such as degrees are poor predictors
ofjob-performance, but also that using them to screen out applicants may be
illegal under the race-equality act.
Yet a further irony lies in other research by Dr Mark Cook of University
College, Swansea, which indicates that the psychometric testing imported to
patch over the deficiencies of academic credentials is likewise prone to the
same two faults. The reason, which I also reported three weeks back, lies in
the criteria by which such recruitment tests are 'validated' or, in lay
terms, judged to be reliable predictors of success in the type of job for
which the recruiting is being done. And since the issue is at least
asimportant as any other I've seen arise these past two decades, I'm going
to saymore about it albeit at the expense of adding more to some readers' no
doubt already heavy feeling of deja vu.
If a test is to be reliably predictive, by the principles of Britain's
equality laws at least, the criteria by which it assesses candidates need to
be clearly linked with objective measures of good performance in the work
concerned. Examples include value of orders in selling, andvolume of output
in certain production jobs.
The snag is that, in most other types of work, comparably objective measures
of achievement rarely if ever exist. So the bulk of selection tests are
validated on more subjective criteria,the most popular being ratings of
employees' performance by their bosses.
Dr Cook puts the number of tests dependent on such criteria at between 60
and 80 per cent of the total in use. But his research has further weakened
the case for many of them by showing that bosses' ratings of their staff, in
particular, are typically influenced by personal prejudices and political
expedients which have no bearing on the abilities actually needed to do
productive work. In which case, it must be doubtful that such tests would
stand challenge under the equality law.
So what - apart from prematurely joining me in depressed impending
retirement - can the hard-pressed recruiters best do?
Well, for one thing, they might look around for psychometric measures which,
even though bereftof links with objective performance criteria, at least
avoid the pitfall of being validated on bosses' ratings of their staff. One
of the happier innovations of recent years is the notion of 'internal
customers': the people within the same outfit who really know the difference
between good and bad service from a particular employee. An example is
newspaper sub-editors who have to wrestle with the outpourings of writers
like me.
While I'm told that there are at most a very small handful of tests
validated on internal customers' ratings availableas yet, it would surely be
worthwhile to encourage development of more. And since many of you readers
seem to be admirably placed to do the necessary encouraging, I beg you to do
your best to advance the cause.
Unfortunately, the more deeply entrenched stumbling block of over-expanded
academic education will take much greater effort to cut down to size. One
sign of hope, for Britain anyway, is the government's decision that intakes
of new degree students must be cut by 3.5 per cent for 1994-95.
But since some of the necessary measures are radical - including a shift of
emphasis back to apprenticeship-type training from classroom teaching - I
doubt that they will readily be taken by politicians who go around mouthing
slogans about 'back to basics' in the existing schools.
Even so, my final wish as the FT's jobs columnist is that at least some of
you will help to goad mere sloganisers to think a bit instead. One way is by
taking up the cudgels whenever you hear anyone implying nonsenses such as
that an adequate stock of appropriate work-skills can be achieved by having
more youngsters pass academic exams.
Which said, although it may be judged more cop-out than blow-up, like the
old Eagle's pair of heroes, I shall mercifully neverknow. Either way, as
long as I live I'll be grateful to you for reading me, as well as for your
many letters wishing me godspeed. Farewell.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Management: Must try harder - Many companies are having
trouble with performance-related pay schemes / BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance-related pay is by no means a trouble-free method for determining
individual remuneration, as a growing number of UK companies are
discovering.
Recent research carried out by the Institute for Manpower Studies over a
wide range of companies across industrial sectors suggests many PRP schemes
do not motivate workers effectively, fail to reward individual effort and,
above all, do not noticeably improve business efficiency.
The latest example of a PRP scheme in trouble also underlines the dangers of
introducing one in difficult times if it makes no commercial sense.
British Telecommunications, the telecoms group and Britain's largest
private-sector company, last week suspended its 10-month-old PRP scheme for
26,000 managers and professional staff because it threatened to undermine
the pay bill.
Ironically, BT introduced its scheme last year to control labour costs, but
it now finds that the PRP arrangements, if applied, would breach the 2.3 per
cent overall increase for managerial staff that it has set for 1994. 'This
does not provide us with enough money to make our PRP scheme a sensible way
of deciding pay rises this year,' says David Scott, BT's industrial
relations manager.
The company may improve its present overall cash allocation a little in
negotiations with the Society of Telecom Executives (STE), the union
representing its management. But it is determined not to apply the PRP
system it negotiated less than two years ago.
Under the terms of an earlier deal, the company this year intends to reward
only its top 10 per cent of managerial high-flyers with rises of up to 6 per
cent, while others can expect unconsolidated payments. Half its managers
will get no rise in 1994. But Scott argues pay is not the 'main cause for
anxiety' this year among BT's managers. 'Their job security is the more
serious problem,' he adds.
The problem for the company though, is not just the short-term one of
keeping within a budgetary pay allocation. More fundamentally BT's own pay
comparison study, which relates its PRP assessments to outside competitors,
indicates that it is already paying its managerial grades 11-14 per cent
more than their colleagues in broadly similar jobs in other enterprises.
BT's study covers not just its main telecommunications rivals - Mercury in
the UK, Sprint and AT&amp;T in the US - but companies such as Siemens, the
German electronics group; Thorn EMI, the UK leisure and electronics group;
IBM, the international computer group; Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications giant; and Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics group, as
well as TSB and National Westminster, the UK high street banks, and large
retailers like J. Sainsbury.
The basic earnings of the core of BT's managers, the company says, are in
the upper quartile of the market range. Scott says: 'We do not want to be
upper quartile payers for our managers any more. We want to move down the
market.'
BT has, therefore, told the union that it needs to bring its managerial
salaries more into line with those in the rest of the telecommunications
industry if the company hopes to defend its competitive cost base in the
medium to long term.
Scott insists BT has not set itself any precise timetable in which to drive
down the managerial pay bill but BT's intention to do so clearly cuts across
any plan to use PRP to reward improved managerial performance.
He recognises that some of the company's more talented managers might leave
as a result of suspending the PRP scheme, but says BT 'has to lose managers
in the next financial year anyway', as it restructures in the face of
competitive pressures and regulatory changes.
The company's hard-nosed attitude towards its PRP scheme this year has
angered many managers. 'BT's aim through its PRP scheme has been to penalise
managers, not reward them,' claims Leslie Manasseh, the union's national
organiser. 'It took eight months of hard bargaining with BT to reach
agreement on a PRP scheme,' he adds. 'We warned the company not to introduce
the scheme if they could not make enough money available to ensure its
success.'
At the time of its implementation though, the increasingly competitive
climate in telecommunications was driving the company towards the PRP
option. The full story goes back to just after privatisation 10 years ago
when BT took its 7,500 senior managers out of the collective bargaining
system and introduced personal employment contracts.
But it continued to pay other managerial grades a general cost of living pay
rise every spring and, in addition, what BT called a performance-related pay
progression increase in the autumn (to be distinguished from the scheme that
is now in question). 'We had to put a stop to this double hit pay round for
our managers,' explains Scott.
Last year BT negotiated a single salary increase based on performance
assessment, under the new PRP scheme, without a cost of living addition.
This enabled it to halve its managerial pay bill. The size of the PRP rises
was determined through the application of a computer-generated matrix, which
calculated a salary rise for each manager. This was based on assessments by
senior managers using the earlier individual appraisal marking system and a
more specific zero to 100 performance score.
From the start the company's PRP scheme aroused widespread anxiety and
suspicion. The fears were common to those experienced by employees in other
companies in the early stages of a PRP sys-tem.
'It was not applied consistently. People were not told their assessment
score,' says Manasseh. 'Nearly a third raised grievances over this.' In a
recent survey, the union catalogued a litany of complaints from BT managers
about its first year of operation.
Only 6.5 per cent of the union survey respondents said PRP at BT had brought
an improvement in managerial performance, while as many as 63 per cent
believed it had been applied unfairly in practice.
Companies have had trouble with PRP schemes have often refined them to
convince employees of their ultimate fairness and this is what BT may well
have to do. Even the STE wants to see BT continue with some form of PRP.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Management: Shouts are not enough

<TEXT>
UK companies doing business in the emerging market economies of eastern
Europe can now use a service* to help with the languages spoken in many of
the areas, as well as with cultural differences.
The initiative, launched yesterday, is part of a wider government attempt to
encourage more language training for exporters. A report last year showed
that a third of small UK exporting companies had missed opportunities
because of linguistic barriers. In the Netherlands, only 4 per cent of
exporters had experienced the same problem.
Few Slavonic languages are taught in British schools and it is for this
reason that eastern Europe, which has some of the greatest export
opportunities, is now a focus of attention. The new service, backed by the
Department of Trade and Industry, is a joint venture between the School of
Slavonic and East European Studies, a college of London University, and
Communicaid, a corporate trainer. The service offers 'language audits' of a
company's needs for trading in a particular area, followed by tailored,
individual tuition. Seminars on cultural, economic and political
considerations are available, as well as access to an archive of materials
from London University.
'Many British exporters have already realised that shouting loudly in
English is no longer enough,' said Richard Needham, the trade minister.
'They've tackled languages strategically - as part of their business plan -
and they're the ones who are cleaning up. The problem is that many more
still haven't got the message and are actually losing out.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Miller and Timberlake join forces
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Miller, formerly marketing director at unit trust company M&amp;G and before
that, managing director of Framlington Group, plans to make his own foray
into the unit trust business.
He has taken a 52 per cent stake in Portfolio Fund Management whose leading
unit trust is a 'fund of funds' called Portfolio Trust, which invests in
other unit trusts. According to Micropal, which tracks the performance of
unit trusts, Portfolio Trust was the top performer of its type last year,
and for the two-three- and four-year periods since its launch.
It will be relaunched under the name Portfolio Fund of Funds.
Richard Timberlake, former managing director of Fidelity Investment Services
and currently chairman of Fund Research, will retain a 47 per cent stake in
the company and act as investment manager.
Miller, who resigned from the board of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for
the life insurance and unit trust industries over its refusal to force
fuller fee disclosure, says he is instituting a novel fee structure for his
own unit trust. Investors in funds of funds have effectively been
double-charged because they pay fees to their own fund manager and to each
of the managers of the unit trusts they buy.
First, the fund will negotiate reduced fees on the unit trusts it purchases
because it will buy in bulk. Second, Miller says, it will offer a US-style
fee structure that shrinks as the size of the investment rises and investors
buying more than Pounds 100,000 of units will pay no up-front charges.
Third, if assets under management grow substantially, the economies of scale
will be passed on to unitholders.
This is a radical departure from the practice at Miller's former employers
where shareholders are the sole beneficiary of growth.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Management: In search of excellence - TQM is about to gain a
higher profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A UK quality award
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
closely modelled on a scheme that has been running throughout Europe for
three years - will be launched in London today by Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
The initiative - backed to the tune of Pounds 500,000 from the Department of
Trade and Industry plus donations from 70 corporate members of the recently
reborn British Quality Foundation - should further raise the profile of the
business philosophy known as total quality management.
TQM is the gospel of focusing everyone's attention in an organisation on the
customer. It is sometimes criticised for being a complex statement of the
blindingly obvious, but the approach to business that it represents has
taken deep root in the US and Japan and continues to attract interest in the
UK and continental Europe.
In common with the famous US Baldrige Award and the European award
administered by the European Foundation for Quality Management in Brussels,
the new UK scheme has a competitive dimension. But according to Malcolm
Franks, the BQF's chief executive, the establishment of domestic role models
is a more important objective. 'It is our mission to get the message spread
across the UK business community, and right down to small businesses.'
In an important departure from the EFQM model, the UK scheme will have two
distinct categories - one for businesses employing more than 250 people and
one for those with fewer. The European entry criteria have been modified by
the architects of the UK award, while, contrary to the European practice of
having a first prize and runners up, there will be no outright UK winner.
In terms of evaluation, however, the assessment process will be identical to
that developed by the organisers of the European award. Thus companies'
performance will be judged on the basis of nine weighted criteria, divided
into so called 'enablers' (leadership, people management, policy and
strategy, resources, and processes) and 'results' (people satisfaction,
customer satisfaction, impact on society and business results).
Franks admits that most of the evidence for improved bottom-line performance
via TQM is anecdotal. But he believes that even if people argue about the
appropriate weightings it is hard to find a more comprehensive list of
ingredients for potential business excellence.
As part of its plan to propagate TQM the BQF is also publishing a guide*,
which will help organisations assess systematically their key activities and
business results.
To apply for the UK award - open this year to all 'for profit' organisations
in the private and public sectors, UK and foreign owned - companies must
have undertaken at least one self-assessment. The entry for smaller
businesses is Pounds 500, for larger ones Pounds 1,500. Even unsuccessful
competitors will receive a report, prepared by a panel of assessors, which
Franks says should form a useful basis for any future improvement plans.
The final date for registering entries is April 18, the closing date for
submissions June 18.

non-BQF members), contact Kevin Shergold, director of Awards, British

<TEXT>
Stephan Harris, 47, has been appointed group treasurer at National
Westminster bank, though he will also continue in his current position as
managing director, global treasury, for NatWest Markets, responsible for the
global foreign exchange, money markets and currency option businesses.
A US citizen and graduate of the American University, Washington DC, and the
Wharton graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania, Harris started
his banking career in 1973 by joining the First National Bank of Chicago.
There he held a variety of positions, including by 1981 the post of senior
vice-president and head of Asia Pacific, based in Japan. In 1989 he moved to
London, where he was head of international capital markets.
Poached by NatWest in 1992, Harris joined the British clearing bank as
managing director, global treasury, NatWest Markets. His geographical reach
in that role extends across not just Europe but also the US and the
Asia-Pacific region.
Harris says his new role is 'not a completely new function', as Martin Owen,
who tempted Harris to NatWest and is chief executive of NatWest Markets, had
previously absorbed the group treasury responsibilities within his own role.
But with the growth of NatWest Markets' global foreign exchange operations
in the past 18 months - Harris calculates customer volume has increased by
as much as 400 per cent since he joined - it seemed sensible to split the
functions and for Harris to take on a role more widely dedicated to the
bank's expanding global capital markets.

FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Former retailer to sell off BR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sizeable part of BR's turnover comes from activities such as freight,
parcels and maintenance work, but it is the privatisation of British Rail's
passenger services that has attracted most attention.
Responsibility for engineering the sale of BR's non-passenger businesses has
been entrusted to Christopher Campbell, who joined BR yesterday as
vice-chairman.
Campbell, 58, has spent most of his business career in retailing at
Debenhams. But his particular relevance to BR lies in his experience of
handling the break-up of the National Bus Company following the deregulation
of the bus industry in 1985. Campbell was chief negotiator handling the sale
of NBC companies to the private sector.
The government will be hoping that the privatisation of BR does not lead to
the chaos that followed bus deregulation in some provincial cities, where
rival companies swamped popular routes and brought city centres to a
stand-still.
Campbell was educated at Epsom College before qualifying as a chartered
accountant with Spicer &amp; Pegler. After 20 years with Debenhams and a spell
with National Bus in the late 1980s he went to British Shipbuilders in 1989.
He has also been a director of Harrods Bank since 1991.
His spare-time positions include a governorship of the United World College
of the Atlantic, a network of international schools with a strong 'outdoor'
flavour. He is also a council member of the MusicSpace Trust, which has
established a network of music therapy centres.
Long-time students of British Rail might also identify another strand in his
professional career linking him to BR. One of the jobs he held at Debenhams
was that of managing director of Hardy Amies, a name once associated with
the design of uniforms for BR staff.

FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Terry Upsall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Terry Upsall, who has died, apparently from a stroke while on holiday, was
one of the best known figures in the UK housebuilding industry. He was 56
and leaves a wife and two children, both married.
Upsall was one of the principal architects behind the expansion of Beazer
Homes from a small West Country builder to the country's third-largest
housebuilder. He became chief executive of Beazer Homes in 1974 two years
after joining the company, and subsequently he became chief executive, as
well, of Beazer's US housing and and property interests. In 1991 he assumed
additional responsibility for contracting in the UK.
When in that year Beazer decided to float its UK and European operations, it
named Upsall as prospective chief executive of the company - to be named CBH
group. The flotation was aborted after Hanson, the UK and US conglomerate
made an agreed bid for the whole of the Beazer Group. Hanson recently
announced that it intends to float Beazer's UK housebuilding business by the
end of March.
Upsall was highly respected as one of the country's most successful
housebuilders and in 1990 became president of the House Builders'
Federation. He retired from Beazer in 1992 and became a non-executive
director of housebuilders Berkeley Group last year.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Carsberg to investigate island bus war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, is to investigate
claims that a company with a fleet of only two buses is attempting to drive
a much larger company off an island by running services at a loss.
The Office of Fair Trading is to spend six months looking into bus services
on the island of Arran, off the Ayrshire coast, after a complaint by Western
Scottish, a company based on the mainland, that the two buses of Arran
Transport were running services in an anti-competitive manner.
The bus wars on Arran, which has fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, began in 1992
after Western Scottish tendered successfully to operate bus services on the
island with a subsidy from Strathclyde regional council.
It moved on to the island and supplanted Arran Transport, which had operated
bus services there since 1910.
Arran Transport, however, carried on providing its peak-time services,
registering them as unsubsidised services with the regional council and
thereby obliging it to withdraw its subsidy on those services from Western
Scottish.
'We had such a good response from the public that we had to go on running
the services,' said Mr Bob Haddow, Arran Transport's managing director.
'We are not losing money on these services and we welcome the
investigation.'
Mr Alan Wilson, managing director of Western Scottish, says Arran
Transport's buses start five minutes earlier than his own on the two
principal routes, which start at Brodick, the main town and ferry terminal.
Western Scottish has had to abandon some services because of the
competition.
The issue was referred to the OFT by Western Scottish in October 1992.
If the allegations against Arran Transport were sustained and Arran
Transport did not accept recommendations by the OFT, the matter could be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
'What is happening here is what is going on all over Britain but in
microcosm,' said Mr Haddow. 'It's about the threat that big companies can
roll up small ones so that the small firm goes out of business. Then the big
ones put up their fares.'
As for operating buses five minutes ahead of the Western Scottish services,
he says: 'When the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry arrives at the pier in Brodick
and everyone gets off there isn't any point hanging about.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Builders struggle to win work: The industry's emergence from
recession is proving painfully slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction output has started to climb again in the UK after three years
of recession, but the improvement is expected to be slight and contractors
are still charging 'suicidal' prices to win work.
Cement prices, meanwhile, are poised to rise by an average of about 3 1/2
per cent from March 1, the biggest annual increase for two years. This will
further increase the building material costs of struggling construction
companies.
Developments, forecasts and workload studies announced by the industry in
the past few days emphasise the fragile nature of a recovery which companies
say could claim almost as many business failures as during the recession.
The recent collapse of Kentz, the UK subsidiary of Kent Corporation, the
Irish-based mechanical and electrical contractor, may cause yet another
cascade of receiverships as the effects ripple down to sub-contractors and
suppliers.
The problem for contractors is that there are still too many companies
chasing too little work, despite receiverships.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, has upset senior executives in the
industry by criticising banks for propping up weaker rivals which he says
ought to have been allowed to fail to allow much needed rationalisation of
the industry. 'Prices must get back to economic levels,' he said. 'This
cannot happen while there are so many companies competing against each
other. Orders have risen a bit, but nowhere near enough to allow margins to
recover.'
Industry order books are rising for the first time since 1990. The
environment department says the value of construction orders won by
contractors in the UK rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 18.06bn during the first
11 months of last year compared with the corresponding period of 1992.
Sales of ready-mixed concrete, one of the best guides to construction
activity, rose by 12 per cent during the final three months of last year
compared with latter part of 1992, says the British Aggregate Construction
Materials Industries trade association (Bacmi).
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, says too
many contractors are quoting 'suicidal' prices. Work is being won at cost or
even at a loss just to keep cash flowing into weakened businesses.
This could cause serious problems on projects such as the Pounds 1.9bn
Jubilee Underground line extension in London where London Underground is
thought to have negotiated exceptionally keen prices providing little or no
profit for contractors.
Construction companies working at cost or worse often try to improve their
return as work progresses and design changes are required by the client -
particularly if material cost increases mean they face heavy losses on the
original price.
London Underground, to prevent itself from being held to ransom by
contractors, has incorporated strict conciliation procedures in contracts.
It also required 'on demand' performance bonds allowing it to seize up to 10
per cent of the value of a contract without having to prove default by
contractors.
Increasing demands from customers for performance bonds is adding to strains
on contractors' finances.
Companies are also concerned that the rise in orders seen in the second half
of last year may slow as public spending cuts take effect in the spring and
with retailers such as Tesco and Safeway planning to reduce store
developments.
There is also concern that the housing market recovery may be set back when
tax and National Insurance increases start at the end of March.
Construction Forecasting and Research, which previously prepared industry
forecasts for the National Economic Development Office, expects the value of
output in constant 1985 prices to rise only 1 per cent this year and by the
same amount in 1995. Hardly a robust recovery.
A fifth of 600 companies questioned by the Building Employers Confederation
last month expected to reduce their workforces further during the next 12
months. For many, the hard times remain even if the gloom has got a little
lighter.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Old-fashioned gala looks to the future: Broader support may
save a historic event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survival prospects for the Durham Miners' Gala, once one of the biggest
and most evocative annual working class demonstrations, are to be thrashed
out by miners' leaders today.
The demise of the Durham coalfield, which now has no working deep mines, has
forced an examination of the future of the gala.
First held in 1871 as an act of solidarity by the Durham Miners Association,
now responsible for the welfare of retired miners and their widows, the gala
became a focal point for the Labour movement.
The roll-call of speakers at the gala includes Keir Hardie, Ramsay
MacDonald, Ernest Bevin, Clement Attlee, Aneurin Bevan and Harold Wilson.
But with the bitter 1984-85 pit strike and the rightward shift of the Labour
party, the assumption of unity between the Durham miners and the Labour
leadership has been severely shaken.
In 1988 Mr Neil Kinnock broke with tradition by becoming the first Labour
leader not to attend: since then, gala speakers have stood well to the left.
Ironically, it now looks as if the event's survival will depend on whether
the broader Labour movement will offer financial and practical support
without seeking to change the gala's political stance.
Association executive members, meeting today in Durham, are likely to decide
that this July's gala, the 110th, can go ahead only if other unions help
organise and pay for it.
Such a decision would be partly financial - the association's income has
come under pressure as a result of the pit closures, and the National Union
of Mineworkers, which organises the gala, is scaling down to only two
north-east employees. Mr Davy Guy, president of the association and of the
north-east NUM, stresses the need to appeal to a wider audience: 'To get
your message across you need a base, you need somewhere you're coming from.
That's one of the reasons for trying to extend it to the wider movement.'
However, the association is determined that the gala's leftwing radicalism,
its role as a rally for the working class and the involvement of Durham
miners must be protected. Its brass bands and banners winding through
Durham's streets are sacrosanct, too.
And, stresses Mr Guy, its political content must not be interfered with. 'We
don't want to see that tradition diluted at all.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Ferranti-Thomson wins Pounds 180m sonar contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle for dominance in the dwindling UK market for naval sonar equipment
has been won by the Franco-British joint venture Ferranti-Thomson Sonar
Systems with the award of a Pounds 180m contract to equip Royal Navy
submarines.
The decision, announced yesterday in a Commons written answer by Mr Jonathan
Aitken, defence procurement minister, brings to an end a three-year contest
with GEC-Marconi, the other main British company in the sector.
It is likely to accelerate moves towards the reorganisation of the sonar
sector into a larger Franco-British grouping.
The contract covers development of a new sonar system for nuclear-propelled
'hunter-killer' submarines and the supply of equipment for four of the Royal
Navy's Trafalgar class vessels.
The Ministry of Defence has abandoned plans to fit the new sonar on its five
older Swiftsure class submarines.
However, a further order is expected for other Trafalgar class boats. The
navy has seven in total and a decision is awaited on plans to produce more.
The submarines currently rely on a Plessey 'search and attack' sonar.
Plessey's naval business is now part of GEC-Marconi.
Yesterday's decision tilts the balance in a UK market in which
Ferranti-Thomson and GEC-Marconi have had roughly equal shares, and is
expected to herald a merger of the two operations.
Ferranti-Thomson's UK shareholder, Ferranti International, has been in
receivership since December. Negotiations have been under way on a plan to
sell its 50 per cent share to the French partner, Thomson-CSF, which would
then sell the holding to GEC-Marconi.
Ferranti-Thomson's activities could then be pooled with GEC-Marconi's and
with those of Thomson-CSF's French subsidiary Thomson Sintra Activite
Sous-Marines.
Thomson-CSF took its share in Ferranti's sonar business four years ago after
the UK group was rocked by fraud in its US subsidiary International Signal
and Control.
The French company has first refusal on the holding, but the Ministry of
Defence wants to maintain a UK partner.
If the plan goes ahead as expected, GEC-Marconi would in effect recover the
sonar business it has lost in recent years, including the latest submarine
contract, Sonar 2076, and the Sonar 2050 being fitted to Royal Navy
frigates.
GEC-Marconi's expected move closely resembles its takeover in 1990 of
Ferranti's airborne radar division. A Ferranti-led consortium was at that
time on the point of clinching the radar order for the Eurofighter project.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Coal shake-up claims more pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday signalled the closure of two pits as it began the
final phase of a rationalisation programme which will leave the industry
with about 15 working pits for privatisation this year and next.
The pits, Goldthorpe and Silverwood, both in British Coal's northern area,
were among 19 pits previously considered core collieries. They were not
named for closure in October 1992 when the government wanted to close
three-fifths of the industry, but was forced to backtrack by a public
outcry.
British Coal's announcement is the first in a series this week which will
leave the industry with even fewer collieries than it envisaged 15 months
ago.
The announcements will result in about half a dozen closures among the 22
remaining working pits. This will leave about 16 pits in operation excluding
Asfordby in Leicestershire which is due to open this year. The total is
likely to decline by one or two prior to privatisation later this year
because reserves of some pits will become exhausted.
Announcing a review of 12 pits in its northern group, based around the
Yorkshire area, British Coal said yesterday it wanted to close Goldthorpe
colliery, where 410 men are employed, and merge Maltby with Silverwood,
which employ 220 and 550 staff respectively. The merger is seen within the
industry as the closure of Silverwood.
The Maltby-Silverwood merger is to take place once tunnelling works between
the two pits are completed.
British Coal is expected to signal tomorrow the closure of its Manton pit,
near Worksop. Other closure or merger announcements are likely this week as
the corporation reviews the future of its Nottinghamshire coalfield and
various satellite mines including Tower in south Wales and Ellington in
Northumberland.
Tower and Ellington have both been viewed as relatively safe until recently
because they are the only deep mines in their regions.
However, there are concerns in both areas that the two pits could be
mothballed before privatisation and offered in that state to the private
sector as part of the regional packages in which British Coal is being sold
off.
British Coal says closures are necessitated by the size of the market.
Contract sales to electricity generators are expected to fall by 25 per cent
in the year starting April 1994.
Mr Alan Houghton, northern group director, told unions yesterday that the
likelihood of large additional sales to generators was remote. Failure to
reduce the levels of pit-head stocks would threaten the survival of even
some of the best collieries.
Coal Products, British Coal's solid smokeless fuels and coking subsidiary,
yesterday recorded a retained profit after exceptional items and interest of
Pounds 4m on a turnover of Pounds 132m for the year ending last March.
An operating profit of Pounds 8m was reported compared with Pounds 2m the
previous year. The company said that this was its best trading performance
since the 1970s.
Mr Bob Ellis, managing director, said the company was on course for a
further improvement in financial performance this year.
The results confirmed that Coal Products was well placed to compete
successfully in the private sector, he said.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Surveyors' orders point to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence that construction activity is on the brink of recovery
emerged yesterday with the publication of a survey of industry order books.
This showed that order books of quantity surveyors fell 10 per cent last
year although the rate of decline slowed considerably during the final three
months.
Much of the work done by quantity surveyors occurs early in the building
process and so provides a good guide to future construction orders.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which carried out the survey,
said the industry was suffering from overcapacity. This was likely to cause
further job losses 'as it continues to adjust to lower workload levels',
said Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at quantity surveyors EC
Harris and construction spokesman for the institution. He added: 'Intense
competition for work combined with rising material costs will add further
pressure to building firms over the next six to nine months.' The
institution said the workload of surveyors fell 3 per cent in the final
quarter of last year compared with the previous three months.

FT  02 FEB 94 / MMC findings set to be opened up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry and consumer organisations will have more opportunity to comment on
monopoly inquiry findings before the government decides whether to accept
recommendations bythe Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Mr Michael
Heseltine indicated yesterday.
Speaking to the Confederation of British Industry in London, the trade and
industry secretary said that consultation could be a vital step in weighing
policy alternatives.
He said that those involved had the benefit of knowing the full extent of
the commission's analysis and findings. The procedure wasparticularly useful
for reports which might lead to substantial change.
Mr Heseltine said consultation on the recent gas report had proved
invaluable in ensuring that his decisions were taken with the best possible
knowledge of their likely effects. He rejected the recommendation that
British Gas should be required to sell off its trading business by early
1997. Instead he decided that British Gas should operate its pipeline and
trading arms as separate businesses.
Pressure for the commission's broader findings to be opened up to wider
scrutiny has increased in recent years.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Drug 'breakthrough' gives hope to arthritis sufferers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most promising clinical results so far in the search for an effective
arthritis treatment were announced in London yesterday.
Scientistsat the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology spoke of a 'breakthrough'
as they published the results of a trial of an experimental drug on 20
patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis - the most common cause of
severe inflammation ofthe joints.
All 20, who had failed to respond to existing drugs, showed a marked and
long-standing improvement after treatment at Charing Cross Hospital, London,
with the new product, CenTNF. Manufactured by Centocor, a US biotechnology
company, the antibody blocks the action of tumour necrosis factor, a natural
molecule involved in the inflammatory process.
Repeated injections of CenTNF every 10 to 12 weeks appeared to control
arthritis symptoms without side effects, said Prof Marc Feldmann of the
Kennedy Institute.
Centocor, based in Philadelphia, and the Kennedy Institute are now
organising larger-scale clinical trials in Europe. Celltech, a UK
biotechnology company based in Slough, isstarting clinical trials of an
alternative TNF antibody on arthritis patients at two other London
hospitals.
'The consensus in the rheumatology community is that a TNF antibody is the
most exciting lead to a treatment for arthritis,' said Prof Feldmann. 'So
far it is the only new lead in which all the patients have responded.'
If larger scale clinical trials confirm the safety and efficacy of the
anti-TNF drugs, they could be licensed for commercial use within three
years.
However, an antibody drug is likely to cost several thousand pounds a year -
which would make it prohibitively expensive as a general treatment for the
UK's estimated 1m rheumatoid arthritis sufferers.
'We will expect some quite dramatic benefits from the drug to justify its
cost,' said Dr Mark Bodmer, a senior Celltech researcher.

FT  02 FEB 94 / House prices 'up 0.4% in month'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices rose 0.4 per cent last month compared with December,
Nationwide, the country's second-largest building society, said yesterday.
A similar survey due to be published tomorrow by Halifax, the biggest
mortgage lender,is expected to show a small fall in prices in January.
Nationwidesays the price of an average home rose last month to Pounds 53,763
 -up 2.4 per cent on the corresponding month last year.
Mr Brian Davis, the society's operations manager, said the results reflected
'the modest rise in activity in thehousing market in 1993'.
He added: 'Our estate agents are already seeing a large increase in viewing
figures for January, and some locations are reporting the need for more
properties to satisfy potential buyers. We feel that conditions are now in
place to see a sustained improvement in the housing market in 1994.'
It will not be the first time that Halifax and Nationwide have disagreed on
monthly price movements. Halifax's survey, based on a larger sample of
mortgage loans, has indicated a slightly more subdued recovery rate.
Last month Halifax reported that house prices in 1993 rose on average by 1.2
per cent, the first annual increase reported by the society since 1990. This
compared with an annual increase of 3.3 per cent reported by Nationwide.
Halifax is expected to report a similar annual increase of about 1 per cent
in its figures for January. It says occasional month-on-month price falls
may continue to occur, but expects prices on average to rise by about 5
percent this year. Nationwide is forecasting a similar rate of increase for
1994.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Smith pledges not to nationalise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday gave the party's modernisers a
significant boost by ruling out renationalisation and linking improved
social services firmly to economic growth.
In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Smith also gave a clear endorsement of the
profit motive and insisted that Labour could deliver a fairer Britain
without big tax increases.
'I do not believe the government should run industry or own industry. But I
do believe the government has got to work with industry. We have got to
create a partnership,' he told the Daily Mirror.
'I want companies to be prosperous, to make profits, to pay their workers
well. And I want them to be a success story for Britain,' he said.
Mr Smith said a future Labour government would introduce a fairer tax system
which would remove much of the burden from 'ordinary people.'
But he warned that the party would be unable to deliver improvements in
public services unless it succeeded in promoting a sustained economic
recovery.
'If we get good steady economic growth we can afford good social services,'
he said. 'If we don't get good economic growth we can't. It is as simple as
that.'
Mr Smith's comments will give heart to Labour's modernisers, led by Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, who favour undogmatic policies focusing on
good economic management.
However, the interview will dismay leftwing groups, which last week tabled a
Commons motion calling for a commitment to more traditional Labour policies.
Mr Smith was scathing about the Conservative record on taxation, which had
opened up opportunities for Labour to win support for its pro-posals for a
'fairer' tax system.
'It is the Tories who are the dogmatic party now,' he said. 'Privatisation
has gone too far. I cannot find anybody who believes in railway
privatisation. It is almost as if this government is going around saying -
what can we do to annoy you?'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Insurers win hint of concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is prepared to consider 'sympathetically' suggestions by the
insurance industry that it should be given the option of accounting for the
new 3 per cent tax introduced in the Budget on a 'premium-written basis'.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, told the Commons last night that the
use of this procedure would tie in more closely with many of the accounting
arrangements in the industry.
He said the implications, including whether gross premiums rather than net
premiums should be the basis of the tax, required further study by
government and industry.
The new tax, which begins in October, will apply to most general insurance
where the insured risk is in the UK, and is expected to yield Pounds 775m in
its first year of operation.
Sir John, speaking in the committee stage of the finance bill, confirmed
that the insurance element in subscriptions paid to the AA, RAC and other
motoring organisations would be subject to the new tax.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on financial services, warned that
because of the new tax there would be a 'substantial risk' that many people
would under-insure when taking out policies on their homes and possessions.
A Labour attempt to delay the imposition of the insurance premium tax until
a report had been presented to parliament on its effect on policyholders and
the future of the industry was defeated by a government majority of 42
(327-285).
Clauses in the bill authorising the insurance premium tax,and the increase
in income tax arising from the non-indexation of of personal allowances were
approved by government majorities of 37.
The government secured a majority of 27 (315-288) authorising the use of the
parliamentary guillotine to ensure that the committee stage of the bill is
completed by March 29.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, accused the government of
imposing a timetable designed to prevent Labour mounting a new challenge
against the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Dorrell defends taxation reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday tried to
regain the initiative in the debate over Tory taxation policy by arguing
that the government had introduced tax reforms that improve economic
efficiency.
In a speech to the Tory Bow Group, Mr Dorrell attacked opposition criticisms
that the government had harmed the economy by raising taxes. He claimed that
Tory tax policy since 1979 had promoted economic efficiency by sharpening
incentives and rewarding innovation and initiative.
'It is in the interests of all of us to structure the tax system so as to do
minimum damage to the incentives to create wealth,' he said. 'That means
shifting the balance of the tax burden from direct to indirect tax.'
Mr Dorrell's speech follows a prolonged attack by Labour on tax increases
and cuts in public spending announced in the last two Budgets.
He focused on what he saw as three key improvements. He claimed that the
government had sharpened incentives for workers by boosting the amount of
marginal earnings kept after tax. He said an 18 per cent cut in the
corporation tax rate had boosted business.
Finally, he argued that the government had boosted incentives for savers by
cutting marginal rates of tax on savings income and introducing tax
incentives through the Pep and Tessa schemes.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday hinted that the
government's long-term reviews of public spending had not been implemented
rigorously enough.
Mr Lamont said: 'It is extremely important that these long-term reviews are
carried out and are implemented.'
He did not specify what areas of the public spending review he had in mind.
Treasury officials say the review was used to structure spending for the
social security, health and education departments and the Home Office in the
last Budget.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Nissan ousts Rover as top car exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group, about to pass into the ownership of BMW of Germany, was
displaced by Nissan last year as the UK's biggest car exporter.
Nissan shipped 182,207 cars worth nearly Pounds 1bn to 36 countries. Rover
exported 161,932. Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics show
that Vauxhall came in a distant third with 72,090, even including production
from its IBC commercial and utility vehicles ventures.
Nissan's Japanese rivals in the UK, Toyota and Honda, began production only
at the beginning of last year and consequently trailed far behind Nissan.
Toyota exported 27,735 cars and Honda 27,121.
Nissan's exports accounted for some 75 per cent of last year's 246,000 total
output at its plant near Sunderland.
However, Mr Ian Gibson, Nissan's managing director in the UK, warned
yesterday that the company's output this year is unlikely to match 1993
levels because of the continuing deep recession in continental European car
markets. Mr Gibson said Nissan was viewing the current year with caution and
projecting production of between 200,000 and 240,000 units.
The steepness of the decline in continental markets last year was such that
Nissan was obliged to introduce single-shift working in the final quarter as
well as an 'agreed severance' scheme which saw the Sunderland work force
fall from 4,600 to 4,250.
Nevertheless, the plant is to return to two-shift production at the
beginning of next month and Mr Gibson said employment had now stabilised.
That is thanks partly to the strong recovery now being experienced in the UK
new car market. Figures to be released later this week are expected to show
that demand in January was 17 per cent higher than in the corresponding
month a year before.
Nissan, which has won two Queen's Awards for Export Achievement since 1988,
has invested Pounds 900m in its UK manufacturing operations and claims
'local' (European) content of more than 80 per cent in the two models it
produces, the small Micra and upper-medium Primera.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Labour fighter for women dies at 70
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Jo Richardson, the leftwing Labour MP for Barking, best known as a
campaigner for women's rights, diedyesterday after a long illness aged 70.
Her death, which increases the government's Commons majority temporarily to
19, leaves the Conservatives facing the prospect of two by-elections in
quick succession in safe Labour seats. They come in the run-up to this
year's local and European elections.
Mr James Boyce, the Labour MP for Rotherham, died just a week ago.
The Conservative party's low standing in opinion polls and the location of
Ms Richardson's seatin east London may cause concern that the contest could
produce another strong electoral showing by the extreme right.
Last September, the far-right British National party won its first-ever
local authority seat in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets.
Ms Richardson, who entered parliament 20 years ago this month, held her east
London seat in 1992 with an increased majority of 6,268 over the
Conservative candidate. The extreme right did not fight the seat.
A life-long leftwinger, she sat on Labour's national executive committee for
12 years until 1991 and was a member of the shadow cabinet from 1987 to
1992. She would probably have been Britain's first minister for women if
Labour had won the last general election.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday: 'No one in the history of
our party has fought harder or to greater effect on behalf of women.'
In 1986, she opposed the expulsion from the Labour party of alleged members
of Militant in Liverpool City Council.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Howard yields to critics of police reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today announce that it intends to dilute its proposed
police reforms following strong opposition in the Lords last month.
Mr Michael Howard,home secretary, will surrender his right to appoint people
to chair police authorities in England and Wales as part of a package of
changes intend to appease critics and save the police and magistrates courts
bill.
The bill proposedreplacing police authorities - now made up of two-thirds
local councillors andone-third magistrates - with smaller, 16-strong bodies,
each containing eight councillors, three magistrates and five other members
who would be appointed by the home secretary.
Under the changes to be announced today Mr Howard will, as well as
surrendering the right to appoint the nominee for the chair, move away from
the principle that all committees must be 16-strong.
The government now believes that the precise size should be determined by
local conditions, but with councillors always having parity with the other
members. This means that, on authorities with an uneven number of members,
one of the councillors could expect to take the chair.
Without this change, local authorities wouldhave regarded the abandonment of
the right to appoint a chair as meaningless if, after an 8-8 tie, the
decision reverted to the home secretary.
The needto amend the bill on matters of central principle will be an
embarrassment for the government. Senior police officers and local authority
representatives have consistently opposed the changes to police authorities
since they were outlined last March. But ministers did not appear to
recognise the full depth of concern until the bill came under attack from
such heavyweight figures as Lord Whitelaw,the former home secretary and
deputy prime minister.
It remains unclearto what extent today's concessions will eliminate
opposition to the bill. Some critics oppose giving the home secretary any
direct powers of appointment to police authorities. Although an arms-length
selection process is planned, and Mr Howard has stressed that appointees
will not be party-political, there are concerns that it could become a step
towards a national police structure under government control.
The bill also faces attack over proposals which critics say would reduce the
independence of magistrates' clerks.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Unions postpone protest on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union leaders representing Britain's 5.8m public-sector workers decided
yesterday to hold back for the time being from calling any protest action
against the government's three-year freeze on the pay bill.
Instead, they are to wait for the results of the public pay review body
reports, which are due shortly, and the government's response to them.
Union leaders warned thatsupport exists in principle across the public
sector for the calling of a day of action to highlight the threat to the
public services as well as jobs.
A private opinion poll commissioned by the Trades Union Congress found there
was substantial support among both private and public sector workers for
some form of protest against government policy.
'The form a 'public sector day' will take and the most appropriate timing
will be the subject of further discussion between unions,' the TUC said in a
statement. Union leaders, however, dropped the idea of a day of action on
April 11.
Mr AlanJinkinson, general secretary of Unison, Britain's largest
public-service union,and chairman of the TUC public services committee,
warned that 'an explosive cocktail' was mixing in the public sector through
a combination of the pay-bill freeze, cuts in jobs and services, tax
increases and privatisation.
The TUC said it was clear from the responses gathered by the public-service
unions that the government's pay policy combined with tax rises,
market-testing and contracting-out was 'likely to lead to industrial
action'.
Union leaders agreed to hold a special one-day conference on March 3 to
debate the pay-bill freeze. User groups will be invited to take part.
The unions are keen to focus attention on the threat of cuts to the public
services rather than on the need of their members for higher wages.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Accounts code planned for investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment trust industry is to develop its own recommended accounting
practice to guide the future format of company accounts within the sector.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies said yesterday it had received
formal approval to develop guidelines from the Accounting Standards Board.
The aim will be to produce a statement of recommended practice (Sorp) for
member companies for circulation next year.
Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the association, said the move
reflected a desire to record best practice and a recognition that different
companies presented financial information in different ways.
'We want to help shareholders interpret financial information by making it
easier to compare the financial performance of investment trusts. We also
want to help those responsible for preparing financial statements by
agreeing a framework which allows individual companies to provide
informative and complete financial reports,' he said.
He said he expected the association to consider as many as 20 accounting
topics, although he did not want to provide details of the specific issuesto
be examined until they had been discussed by investment trust companies.
However, he said they were likely to include isses related to the
distinction between capital and revenue, and on timing and recognition.
The Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor, the Accounting Standards
Committee, have delegated the development of similar statements to a number
of sectors including oil and banking.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Failures in auditing 'widespread': Profession reports lapses
to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many accountants are failing to meet professional standards when carrying
out audits, says a confidential report sent to the government by chartered
accountancy bodies.
Nearly two-thirds of firms inspected in the year to last September were the
subject of detailed regulatory reports triggered by concerns over issues
such as the quality of auditing or compliance with regulations.
The report, which has been obtained by the FT, covers the second year of the
regime of self-regulation for auditors. It was recently sent to the
Department of Trade and Industry and its findings are due to be made public
soon.
It interprets most of the breaches as relatively minor and applicable
primarily to smaller firms, but the figures raise serious questions about
the quality of auditing conducted by the 10,600 firms registered.
The report says many firms have failed to provide evidence of the work they
have carried out, or have not established procedures designed to assure the
quality of their auditing.
It describes inspections to 312 firms by the Joint Monitoring Unit, which is
controlled by the three chartered accountancy bodies covering England,
Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
So far 263 of these visits have been written up in completed reports to the
profession's regulatory committees, of which 197 are in 'long form'  -
normally meaning that the firms need to take remedial action.
The most common problems identified were with firms' audit procedures,
performance of individual assignments, quality assurance procedures and
independence.
Most of these issues applied to smaller firms and those without listed
clients. For the larger firms, the inspectors concluded that most problems
were human failures rather than deficiencies in systems and procedures.
The report concludes: 'While it is clear that the majority of registered
auditors aretaking the need to comply with the regulations seriously, it is
also clear thatmany firms have not reached the standard of work envisaged by
current auditing standards and guidelines.'
It stresses that the problems identified havenot 'necessarily' affected the
audit opinion, and that in most cases non-compliance 'would not' have
resulted in any interested party suffering loss.
Across mainland Britain since October 1991, 111 firms have had their audit
registration withdrawn or revoked, 15 have been refused registration, 19 are
subject to restrictions on auditing and 1,904 have voluntary withdrawn
applications to be registered.
The report shows that complaints against auditors in England and Wales rose
to 268 in the year to last September, up from 175 in the previous year.
Total regulatory costs for 1993 were Pounds 4.2m, and are projected at
Pounds 4.7m for 1994. Just 147 firms audit all 2,300 listed companies in the
UK, and 18firms audit 2,044 of these.
The report, which will form the basis for a review by the DTI of the
effectiveness of self-regulation, suggests concentrating future inspections
on the issues identified as causing the greatest problems.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Stock exchange urges wider penalty net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange is proposing to start ordering restitution for
victims of misconduct and to start making it easier to penalise wrongdoers
and publish their names.
The proposals appear in a consultation document released yesterday on
changes to the member firms' Rule Book, which has not had any significant
revisions since 1988.
The move came as Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury,
yesterday said that the criminal justice act, which spells out tougher rules
on insider dealing, would take effect on March 1.
Under the stock exchange plans, a rules committee would for the first time
be able to consider breaches of rules and set fines of up to Pounds 25,000
in addition to ordering member firms to repay victims.
Fines for misdeeds over that amount would have to be considered by the
disciplinary committee, and the names of those found to have breached rules
would have be made public. The exchange said it had previously made
disciplinary actions public, but it had no automatic power to do so.
The exchange would also be able to award costs to a complainant or, if the
complaint is deemed frivolous, to a firm. The rules committee would give
automatic decisions for specific breaches of rules.
The exchange said that the proposals would bring it into line with the other
self-regulating bodies authorised to police the financial services industry.
It said the planned revisions to the Rule Book were 'a tidying-up exercise'
because the myriad rules for members are confusing and often overlap.
However, some City officials said the exchange was concerned that it was
sometimes seen as ineffectual in punishing misdeeds and informing the
public. 'Before, the exchange didn't have any teeth to it. Now the board is
trying to give it a few molars,' said one board member.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has also
made tighter supervision of all investment exchanges a priority since
irregularities at the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) were found
last year.
Also among the proposals - to which the exchange is seeking comments by mid
March - are adjustments to rules to take account of the move to 10-day
rolling settlement of transactions from July 18.
The exchange also proposes to tighten rules on market practice. For
instance, in spelling out the obligations of marketmakers, persistent
failure to answer telephones while open for business will be considered a
violation of the obligation to 'actively offer to buy and sell'.
There have been complaints that during volatile trading periods marketmakers
have avoided answering phones.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Gooda Names may face delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's could face long
delays in their legal action due to start in April following an application
for an adjournment by defendants in the case.
More than 3,000 Gooda Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally
backed the Lloyd's insurance market - are taking action against more than 70
agents in an attempt to recover losses of more than Pounds 550m.
The adjournment application, lodged with the courts on Friday by Elborne
Mitchell, the agents' solicitors, comes at a crucial time for the Gooda
Walker Names Action Group, which last month voted by a 5-1 majority to
pursue legal action rather than accept its share of a Pounds 900m
out-of-court settlement offer.
It is understood that the application was made after a potentially vital
witness was advised by his solicitors not to give evidence in the civil
action, while there is a pending investigation by the Serious Fraud Office
into the agency's affairs. News of the SFO probe, which focuses on the use
by Gooda Walker of so-called 'time and distance' reinsurance policies,
emerged last year.
Mr Philip Rocher of Wilde Sapte, the solicitors working with the action
group, said Names would 'strenuously resist' the adjournment application,
which is to be heard on Friday or early next week.
An adjournment would be a blow to Gooda Names because their legal action -
one of the biggest being fought by Names - was one of the first Names'
actions scheduled to come to court. Gooda Names are therefore hoping to have
greater access to the limited pool of errors-and-omissions insurance cover -
which protects agents against negligence awards - than some other
lossmakers.
Insurance market leaders have said that 70 per cent of Names - by value of
the offer - must accept if it is to go ahead. But it appears that Lloyd's
will be unable to persuade enough Names to accept the deal before a deadline
of February 14.
The implementation later this year in the UK of the European Union's third
non-life directive will tighten the solvency regulations faced by UK
insurers and could add to pressures faced by some smaller reinsurers in the
London market, according to Price Waterhouse, the accountants. Under the new
regulations insurers and reinsurers will no longer be able to count premiums
and reinsurance recoveries which are more than three months overdue as
assets for solvency purposes.

The government's legislative programme ran into renewed problems in the
Commons yesterday when Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National party leader,
blocked debate on the Scottish local government bill.
Mr Salmond, who is not a member of the committee, refused to leave the room
in which the bill was being debated. His action was part of a nationalist
campaign for greater Scottish representation on committees debating bills
dealing solely with Scotland.
The delay is a further embarrassment for the government, which was forced
last week to bow to Labour demands for a cut in its majorities on some
committees.

Cambridgeshire councillors' attempts to agree a new local government
structure for the county collapsed in chaos yesterday, John Authers writes.
Five of six districts said that they had agreed to split the county into
four unitary authorities.
However, the leaders of all three political parties on the county council
denounced the proposal as 'a marriage of self-interest'.
Cambridgeshire is the only county so far to recommend its own abolition, but
it has proposed that it should be replaced by only two unitary councils. The
county says this option would be less costly.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Private managers of public services 'surprised at scrutiny'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector managers brought in to run public services often have an
inadequate grasp of the importance of accountability to parliament, Sir John
Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, told a committee of MPs
yesterday.
Sir John, who heads the National Audit Office, the public expenditure
watchdog, said chief executives from the private sector running government
agencies and quangos were often surprised to learn that they were subject to
scrutiny for their handling of public money.
One chief executive had questioned why his organisation's finances were
being investigated by the watchdog and why a report was being sent to
parliament.
Outsiders could bring new management skills into the public services, Sir
John said. But they needed to be briefed on traditional procedures for
handling public money in order to avoid the sort of waste and corruption
revealed in last week's report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
Sir John was giving evidence to the cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee along with Mr Robert Sheldon, the PAC chairman.
Mr Sheldon challenged the prime minister's claim that the PAC report had
contained no evidence of a decline in standards in the public services.
'We would not have published the report if we had not been concerned about
the number of failings we have discovered in recent years,' he said.
There was nothing wrong with the rules on probity and handling public money
which had served Britain well for some 130 years, the PAC chairman said,
adding: 'We need to make sure that they are observed and obeyed.'
Sir John also highlighted failures in setting up agencies and quangos, which
had increased opportunities for fraud and corruption.
'In a period of very considerable change in public administration, new
people, new responsibilities and new systems expose risks of muddle and
confusion,' Sir John said.
In some cases financial control had been concentrated in the hands of
inexperienced junior staff, he said. It was prudent to separate
responsibilities more than was often done. Responsibility for handling money
and letting contracts had been given to staff without the necessary training
or experience.
'You don't have to choose between proper procedures and getting value for
money,' Sir John said. 'But if you don't attend to the procedures for public
business, you won't get value for money.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Barclays offers 2% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank has offered its clerical staff a 2 per cent pay rise. The
offer is the first in this year's bank pay awards and is likely to set the
trend for the sector.
Officials from the Bifu banking union walked out of their first bargaining
meeting with Barclays' management yesterday, claiming the company was
imposing the award and circumventing negotiations.
The pay offer, covering about 60,000 clerical-grade staff, has been linked
to the introduction of flexible working which is already happening
informally in some branches, but which management wants to formalise across
the the bank.
Barclays said: 'We are very conscious of the need to improve customer
service by providing extra opening hours in areas where there is a demand
for it.' The bank said it had no plans to introduce longer opening hours
across the board.
The bank said it thought a 2 per cent pay rise was 'realistic in the present
market conditions'. It added: 'We are very happy to discuss it with the
unions.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Ofgas aims to curb speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, has proposed tough criteria to stop
speculators and independent gas companies abusing the system which allocates
supplies from British Gas reserves to its competitors.
A consultation paper published yesterday proposed two options for the gas
release programme, which was set up in 1992 to stimulate early competition
by selling British Gas supplies to independent gas marketers. They are:
The introduction of stringent eligibility criteria, requiring applicants to
prove they have been active in the market since last October and that they
have customers. They would also have to present proof of access to at least
1.5m therms of gas from sources other than the release programme. In
addition, recipients of release gas could transfer only 20 per cent of their
allocations to other suppliers.
The price would be the weighted average cost of gas purchased from British
Gas plus a wholesaling fee of 0.25 pence per therm.
A postal auction of 200m therms of gas. Companies would bid for packages of
gas, which would vary according to factors such as different entry
terminals. All independent gas marketers who can demonstrate a trading track
record would be eligible, although no single bidder could buy more than 20
per cent of the total.
Ofgas said it had asked British Gas to make more gas available for an
auction-based system to stimulate the development of a spot market in gas
trading, but British Gas declined to do so.
The regulator last year took over control of the release programme from the
Office of Fair Trading after complaints that speculators were dominating the
auctions. In 1992, 32 companies qualified for the programme under rules
which guarantee them access to 300m therms of gas during 1994-95.
But 70 new applicants emerged in last year's auction. Many were speculators
who sold their gas allocations to established companies at inflated prices.
Some marketers also made multiple applications under different names.
The gas release programme was devised as a temporary solution to enable the
marketers to serve industrial and commercial customers while developing
their own sources of offshore gas or entering into long-term contracts with
gas producers.
Ofgas says it is prepared to look at alternative arrangements if there is no
clear sign of support for either of its alternatives.
February 25 is the deadline for submissions to Ofgas.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Shell and Esso look at floating platform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell and Esso are evaluating the use of a floating production and storage
platform to develop small oil reserves in the central North Sea.
It is the first time the two partners have considered using anything other
than conventional fixed platforms in the North Sea.
The floating production and storage platforms are likely to be seen more
frequently in UK waters in future because of their lower capital costs and
greater flexibility.
New technology allows them to maintain precise positions - even in bad
weather.
They figure prominently in plans to exploit smaller reserves which do not
justify the expense of building fixed platforms.
Shell and Esso say the use of a floating system should also cut lead times
in developing the new fields.
A Pounds 12m contract to design a prototype platform has been awarded to a
Swiss company.
The partners will decide later this year whether to go ahead with
construction of the vessel.
It would cost about Pounds 230m and would initially be used to exploit the
Teal discovery, east of Aberdeen.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Police probe British Gas land project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater Manchester Police are investigating a land development by British
Gas. The force has been called in by a government agency which wants the
company torepay Pounds 4.4m of public grants.
Central Manchester Development Corporation, an agency of the Department of
the Environment, agreed a Pounds 5.4m citygrant to British Gas for the
redevelopment of a 7.5-acre site near the city centre.
The grant was based on estimated costs of Pounds 17.8m, but the actual
figure was only about Pounds 12m. Of the Pounds 5.4m total grant, to be paid
in stages, Pounds 4.4m had been handed over before the corporation realised
what had happened.
The redevelopment involved a 110,000 sq ft office block to house the
BritishCouncil, which relocated from London to Manchester last year,
creating 650 jobsin the city.
British Gas yesterday confirmed police were investigating. Ms Dru Vesty,
director of British Gas Land Investments, said: 'We are offering them every
facility.'
The police were brought in because the development corporation is obliged to
use independent means to find out whether or not the law has been broken. A
civil action against British Gas is also likely if there is no agreement
over the return of the money.
At the heart of the dispute is the means by which the government funds inner
city regeneration projects.
Public money is supposed to be used only to reduce the risk of losses to a
level where the private sector can afford a development.
If, for example, a derelict site would be worth only Pounds 16m after
redevelopment, but the work would cost Pounds 20m, a city grant from the
government of Pounds 4m would be used to bridge the gap. This works out at a
four-to-one ratio between private and public sector funding.
But if the cost of the same project worked out at Pounds 18m, the grant
would be only Pounds 2m. In practice, the ratio between developed value and
grant has to be at least two-to-one, but is rarely allowed above
nine-to-one, as this is considered a reasonable threshold for the private
sector to carry all the risk.
In this instance, the development was estimated to be worth about Pounds
12.4m after completion, which would qualify for a Pounds 5.4m government
contribution towards estimated costs of Pounds 17.8m, an acceptable ratio of
3.3-to-one.
Because the costs actually worked out at less than the developed value, the
project would not havequalified at all had initial estimates been more
accurate.
One argument now is likely to centre on whether British Gas believed it was
entitled to government grants worth a third of the costs of the project,
whatever they were.
A secondary issue will be whether the development corporation shouldhave
spotted the discrepancy between estimated and actual costs sooner.
One defence that civil servants may advance is they did not expect to have
to supervise a large quoted public company as closely as they would a
privately owned developer.

FT  02 FEB 94 / BR memos reveal concern over contractor training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail managers have serious concerns about gaps in the training of
staff of private railway contractors, it emerged in BR documents leaked
yesterday.
The letters, obtained by Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman,
reveal what he called 'an alarming level of concern about safety in the
run-up to privatisation'.
In one memo to British Rail managers, MrChris Dickinson, BR's head of safety
audit, warns: 'Many contractors undertaking safety training of would-be
on-track staff have no knowledge of the standardsinvolved and have no
mechanism to obtain them officially.
'The onus should be on the contractor to prove he understands what standards
are required andhow he has trained his staff as part of the contractor
appraisal system.'
Mr Wilson said: 'The clear message is that people with no previous railway
experience are being let loose without adequate checks or training. This is
part of the privatisation process. It must be stopped.'
British Rail confirmed that the documents were genuine but said they merely
showed that the organisation was concerned that contractors' staff must be
properly trained.
In a second document obtained by Mr Wilson, Mr Robert Bartlett, training
manager for InterCity, wrote: 'My concern is the safety of all staff, be it
contractor or BR, who are working on or near the line on the railway. If
these persons receive inaccurate or inadequate training then this could lead
to unnecessary and unacceptable accidents.'
Mr Wilson said the disclosure of these concerns by BRmanagers came shortly
after an incident near Derby, when a privately owned maintenance train
travelled 30 miles in the wrong direction. He added: 'A fragmented railway
is a less safe railway. If private companies employ staff who are
inexperienced and under-trained, then there are going to be incidents and
accidents.'
Railtrack, the company formed to own and manage BR's track, signalling and
stations, will today announce details of a campaign to sign up contractors
and suppliers to the privatised network.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Labour council proposes tax cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham's Labour-controlled city council, the largest metropolitan
authority in Britain, yesterday proposed a cut in the council tax for
1994-95 and contrasted its revenue demands with the government's
introduction of VAT increases.
The cut, of Pounds 17 to Pounds 421 a year in the lowest property valuation
bandand of Pounds 50 to Pounds 1264 a year in the highest band, comes
despite an unsuccessfulattempt by the council to win extra government
funding and before May electionswhere if Labour loses four seats, it loses
control.
The council's total budget for 1994-95 is provisionally set at Pounds
938.86m, compared with the 1992-93 budget of Pounds 901.47m.
In response to criticism that too much has been spent on prestige projects
like the International Convention Centre and not enough on education, the
council is lifting the education budget by Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 448.3m. Of
this total, Pounds 9.6m would be on the capital account - more than double
the 1992-93 budget. On the revenue side there would be an increase of Pounds
30.5m.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Fuel VAT debate 'avoided'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, last night accused the
government of deliberately avoiding a further challenge to the imposition of
value added tax on domestic fuel.
She said the timetable for discussion of the remaining stages of the finance
bill would prevent a vote on an attempt to delay for a year the initial 8
per cent VAT levy, due to take effect in April.
She accused ministers of running away from a further vote because Tory
backbenchers who had reluctantly backed the government were still being
bombarded with criticism from their constituents.
Mrs Beckett said the timetable, imposed by the government through use of the
parliamentary guillotine, meant the report stage would not be dealt with
until after Easter. That would be too late for a new Labour clause on a
delay.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, stressed the exceptional length of
the 417-page bill and said the refusal of Labour to co-operate in drawing up
a voluntary timetable justified the guillotine.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American, European and Japanese pharmaceuticals groups are rushing into
China to exploit what could become the world's largest drugs market and is
already one of the fastest growing.
As growth of the developed world's drugs markets decelerates, the Chinese
market continues to demonstrate healthy rates of expansion. With its massive
population, estimated at more than 1.2bn, and rapid economic growth, the
country is beginning to be able to afford western medicines.
RCI, an affiliate of IMS, the specialist market research company, estimates
the Chinese drugs market, excluding traditional remedies, was worth Yn19.3bn
in 1992, up 92 per cent compared with 1988. The group forecasts the market
will more than double by 1997 in local currency terms, although the
depreciation of the yuan will affect growth in dollar terms.
Most overseas groups are setting up joint ventures with Chinese state-owned
drugs factories which are seeking funding from abroad to improve
manufacturing facilities to international standards.
Initial ventures, such as Merck's giant antibiotics factory opened last
year, concentrated on relatively simple medicines. Similarly, Upjohn of the
US, which formed a joint venture in August last year, will make antibiotics
and steroids in southern China. The company is investing Dollars 30m (Pounds
20m) to build a factory in Suzhou, near Shanghai. Upjohn owns 75 per cent of
the venture, with Suzhou Pharmaceutical Factory No 4 owning the remainder.
However, when Takeda, Japan's largest drugs group, yesterday announced its
first joint venture in China, it revealed the new company will manufacture
not only cardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs, but also
the latest anti-ulcer treatment Takepron, known in Europe as Losec.
Takeda plans to invest Dollars 14.4m to acquire 75 per cent in the joint
venture with Lisheng Pharmaceutical factory, its Chinese partner. The
agreement, which includes marketing and manufacturing, involves the
construction of a plant in Tianjin province. Raw materials will be imported
from Japan. Construction will begin in June and should be completed within
24 months. Takeda expects to generate sales of Y2bn (Pounds 12.2m) by 1997.
Others have already opened plants and are generating sales. Last month,
Ciba, the Swiss group, completed a Dollars 21m joint-venture factory with
Beijing Number 3 Pharmaceutical Factory and Beijing General Pharmaceutical
Corporation. The factory, in which Ciba holds a 60 per cent stake, makes
antidepressants and treatments for epilepsy, rheumatism and cardiovascular
disease. The company is also negotiating a Dollars 100m contract for a
joint-venture plant in Shanghai.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese officials were braced for more pressure from the US over
contentious trade and economic issues with the arrival in Tokyo yesterday of
two senior US government officials.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr W. Bowman Cutter, deputy
presidential assistant for economic policy, arrived in Tokyo yesterday
evening for a series of high-level talks with senior Japanese officials
aimed at breaking the impasse in the bilateral negotiations to open Japan's
markets to foreign goods and services.
They are scheduled to meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and the
heads of the foreign, trade and finance ministries in a search for progress
in trade negotiations which have been hampered by big differences over the
setting of numerical indicators to measure progress in increasing access to
Japan's markets.
That Mr Kantor and Mr Cutter have come to Tokyo with no staff - an unusual
step - also reflects US hopes that an agreement is more likely to be secured
on a political level, rather than through negotiations with the Japanese
bureaucracy, whose staunch resistance to numerical targets has already tried
the patience of the US negotiating team.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said the government should look to the
private sector to break the deadlock in bilateral talks on trade in vehicles
and parts, one of the most contentious issues in the framework negotiations.
The government can only act as a go-between in the car talks, which would
best be resolved through private-sector negotiations, Mr Hata commented.
Meanwhile, Mr Hosokawa met Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, over the
weekend. According to Japanese press reports, he asked Mr Toyoda if there
was anything the industry could do to take the negotiations forward and was
reminded of the private sector's stance against setting numerical
indicators.
Nevertheless, despite reassuring signs from politicians, there is some
concern in the car industry that Mr Hosokawa could cave in to US pressure.
'Politicians look at it from a different perspective from bureaucrats, who
think mainly about what is good for the industry. If the politicians decide
that it is important enough for US-Japan relations,' they might just agree
to US demands, one industry official said.

France yesterday said it had signed contracts with Saudi Arabia worth FFr9bn

and a range of ground-to-air missiles.
Saudi Arabia's cash flow problem had long delayed conclusion of the
contracts, and the breakthrough only came last month when Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur visited Riyadh and agreed that France would accept
staggered payment for the work to be carried out by DCN, the state shipyard
at Toulon, and by Thomson-CSF, Matra, Giat and other French contractors.
Work on Saudi ships and missiles will start 'on payment of the first
instalment' by Saudi Arabia, the French Defence Ministry said yesterday.
This is due by September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai cabinet yesterday approved a plan by Bangkok Land, the country's
biggest property company, to build an elevated passenger railway system
designed to easetraffic congestion in the capital.
Bangkok Land's project, costing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) is the
successor to the ill-fated Skytrain contract won by SNC-Lavalin of Canada.
That deal was cancelled in 1992 by a previous Thai government after 17 years
of deliberations.
Yesterday's announcement gives Bangkok Land a boost in its effort to
implement the project, but the citizens of Bangkok have been disappointed so
often in the past that few will believe in any mass transit system until
they see it under construction.
In approving the project yesterday, the government expressed reservations
about the environmental impact of the elevated railway and suggested an
action plan to reduce environmental damage.
Some politicians, backed by environmentalists, say an underground railway
would be better than an elevated system, and Bangkok Land may be obliged to
run at least part of the 20km line underground if the project goes ahead.
Among the contractors chosen by Bangkok Land are Thai Leighton and Bouygues
Thai, affiliates of the Australian and French groups. Bangkok Land says it
intends to issue Dollars 600m in convertible eurobonds to help fund the
project.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, has been sharply criticised by
his political opponents for failing to tackle Bangkok's traffic jams
decisively. Muchof the blame lies with his predecessors, who ignored the
need for investment in infrastructure.

The Clinton administration yesterday said the open US financial services
market should no longer be 'free' to countries which do not give 'fair
treatment' to US banking and securities firms overseas.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, told a House banking
subcommittee the administration would support the proposed Fair Trade in
Financial Services Act and use it to supplement efforts to open markets in
the Uruguay Round and the Japan negotiating framework talks.
'The US does not intend to target under this legislation existing operations
of foreign companies established within the US,' he said. 'We believe that
any policy should be focused on limiting access to new firms or new
opportunities.'
An opening of the Japanese huge financial services markets is of particular
importance to the expansion and global competitiveness of US firms.
The administration wants the treasury secretary to be able to grant market
access to individual companies. The act will be used to complement US
multilateral, bilateral and regional efforts to gain access to foreign
markets on equal terms with domestic firms.

FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: WWF calls for Gatt green plan
</HEADLINE>

TheWWF-World Wide Fund for Nature today wades into the heated debate over
Gatt's future work on trade and the environment which threatens to dominate
next April'sministerial meeting in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round
global trade accords.
The Swiss-based environmental organisation calls, in a position paper, for
ministers to approve establishment of a permanent committee on trade and
theenvironment within the new World Trade Organisation, and to accept that
Gatt rules will need changing to meet environmental concerns.
These demands are likely to incense many developing countries who regard the
enthusiasm of environmentalists for enforcing 'greenery' though trade
restrictions as opening wide the door to new forms of protectionism.
Rich-country proposals for a trade and environment committee were beaten off
during negotiations on the WTO which ended in December.
Trade negotiators from the 117 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round
did, however, agree to present a trade-environment work programme to
ministers in April, and its terms of reference are now the subject of
intensive discussion inside and outside Gatt.
US and EU trade and environment officials met last weekend in The Hague,
together with a number of non-governmental organisations, to discuss what
the work programme might look like. EU officials meet their counterparts
from the European Free Trade Association in Viennatoday, and a discussion
between ministers from rich and poor countries is scheduled for February 17
in Geneva.
WWF says Gatt should work alongside United Nations bodies concerned with
environment, trade and sustainable development. 'At present, Gatt work fails
to address environmental effects of trade and has not tackled the
interference of trade rules with environmental policies,' says Mr Charles
Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Australia gloom lifts faster than expected: New treasurer is
able to announce a higher growth and lower inflation outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ralph Willis may have waited a political lifetime to get the Australian
treasurer's job, but his timing cannot be faulted.
The Australian economy, which looked lacklustre for much of 1993, has sprung
into life. Mr Willis made the happiest of public debuts yesterday,
announcing a substantial upward revision to the government's numbers.
Australia's gross domestic product, said the treasurer, is now expected to
grow at 3.5 per cent in the 1993-94 fiscal year. This contrasts with 2.75
per cent forecast in the budget in August. For 1994-95, the new estimate is
4 per cent, hinted at by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister,
last week.
Inflation is estimated to be 2 per cent for this year, down from a forecast
of 3.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the current account deficit should be about
ADollars 17bn (Pounds 8bn) this year, or about 4 per cent of GDP, compared
with the earlier forecast of ADollars 18bn. The December balance of payments
data are published today, but if market predictions of a ADollars 1.3bn
deficit on the current account are correct, the slight widening from
November's ADollars 1.16bn figure will give no one cause for concern.
Even Australia's vexatious unemployment position looks a little brighter,
says Mr Willis. While the forecast unemployment rate for June 1994 stays at
10.75 per cent - it was 10.7 per cent in December - the participation rate
is adjusted upwards. This suggests that more people have been drawn into the
work force and the actual number of jobs is growing at about 1.75 per cent,
compared with a previous estimate of 0.75 per cent.
Economists, who generally predicted yesterday's revisions and think Mr
Willis may have erred on the cautious side, have a variety of explanations.
First, it seems the weakness in Australia's private sector capital
investment may not have been quite as pronounced as everyone feared. New
private capital expenditure rose by 3 per cent in the September quarter,
according to figures released earlier this month, and total capital
expenditure for 1993-94 is now forecast to be ADollars 25.7bn.
If this revised forecast is correct, it would suggest that investment has
been flat this year. Previous official estimates suggested a fall of 5 to 6
per cent.
Second, consumer confidence is on the rise. Retail trade rose markedly in
November, and retailers have talked of encouraging Christmas sales. A round
of tax cuts, which affected pay packets in November, has plainly helped, as
has greater stability in the jobs market.
But while the news is encouraging, the treasurer's life is not expected to
be headache-free in the months ahead. In previous cycles, Australia has
tended to face a balance of payments crisis once the good times rolled,
causing the authorities to slam on the monetary brakes. Some economists
think that weak - albeit improving - levels of business investment will
cause the same difficulties.
'It's a real supply side problem,' says BIS Sharpnel, the research and
forecasting group. 'Investment has been down so much that we've barely
covered depreciation. There's 10 to 15 per cent spare capacity to be used,
but after that, the bottlenecks could begin.' Since Australian companies
source a large proportion of their plant and equipment overseas, the
pessimists warn of a current account 'blow-out' by 1995-96.
Whether this happens or not, the strength of Australia's export performance
becomes critical. The optimists hope that enough structural changes have
taken place to make a difference. More of Australia's trade is now within
Asia, where growth is widely expected to remain buoyant for the next few
years.
Some economists, such as Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank,
also argue that Australia's increasingly deregulated labour market will mean
that pay increases - and therefore increases in consumer spending power -
will be aligned to productivity advances. In short, if Australians, as
consumers, demand more imports, they should, as workers, also be
contributing to their companies' sturdiness.
The second problem is unemployment. A figure of 10.7 per cent is way above
the average in the 24 industrial nations of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, and for a Labor party government, which is
still close to the trade union movement, this is doubly damaging.
A prime ministerial committee looking into the issue has estimated that if
economic growth averages 3.5 per cent for the rest of the decade,
unemployment will still be 7 per cent by the year 2000. This would include
about 200,000 'long-term' unemployed.
Last, and partly related to this, there is the question of whether there are
any 'hidden costs' down the road which may push the government's budget
deficit reduction strategy off course. The need to act urgently on the
unemployment issue, for political reasons, is one possible threat. Also
lurking in the background is the as yet unquantified cost of the recent
Aboriginal land rights legislation (which should see state and federal
governments paying some compensation to the displaced indigenous
population).
This leaves economists wondering whether Mr Willis may yet raise indirect
taxes further or whether fellow ministers will be under pressure to find
more revenue sources, from asset sales, for example.
Still, even on this score, Mr Willis's luck seems to be holding - for the
moment.
His predecessor, Mr John Dawkins, encountered scepticism when he outlined a
four-year plan, detailing how the government planned to cut the deficit from
an expected ADollars 16bn in 1993-94 to ADollars 5.8bn by 1996-97. Now the
government is expected within the next week to announce a reduction in the
likely deficit for the current year.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Armed resistance to S Africa poll feared: Without a deal,
right-wingers could turn to force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is an ominous week for South Africa. Within days, the odds are that
conservative Zulus or right-wing Afrikaners, or both, will begin a campaign
to resist April's all-race elections, by force of arms.
In this land of political miracle, where apartheid was ended not through war
but through negotiation, a last-minute deal is still possible. But if there
is no deal, the right-wing Freedom Alliance, including the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom party, the white right Afrikaner Volksfront and other right
wing groups, will almost certainly commit itself to fight. Thus, South
Africa will have taken an irrevocable step to a civil conflict which could
prevent peace for years to come, and bedevil or destroy its nascent
democracy.
South Africans react to the threat variously: some mutter about
Bosnian-style civil wars; others dismiss it with disdain, certain a new
government will crush the right. It is not easy to gauge the exact magnitude
of the threat.
But certain facts are clear: 'We don't have any soldiers,' says a member of
the KwaZulu civil service simply, highlighting the limited military options
available to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the KwaZulu government (he
denies he has any military intentions, but warns transparently of the 'risk'
of civil war).
With no army, no heavy weapons such as armoured cars, artillery and
aircraft, and with KwaZulu's fragmented geography (it is scattered piecemeal
through Natal), it is hard to see Chief Buthelezi fighting an Angolan-style
war, using secure bases and quasi-conventional warfare to control large
areas.
Still, obtaining sophisticated smaller weapons would not be hard, given
Natal's long coastline and the ease with which thousands of automatic
weapons enter from neighbouring Mozambique.
Reports already indicate that missiles and rocket launchers have come in
that way, and small arms are readily available: when supporters of Zulu King
Goodwill Zwelithini opened fire in Pretoria last month, in a spontaneous
show of militancy, hardly a man among the thousands present did not have a
pistol or automatic weapon.
Lack of training would also hamper Inkatha: the 4,000-strong KwaZulu police
force is loyal to Chief Buthelezi, but it is hard to know how many would
leave the force to fight in the hills once the KwaZulu force is reintegrated
into the South African police.
In traditional areas of Zululand, all adult males belong to an 'impi' or war
party, but they fight mainly with assegais (short spears) and knobkerries
(battle mallets).
Though two well-placed sources have confirmed white right-wingers are
training Zulu self-defence units in sabotage and terrorism, this does not
involve large numbers. Funding could prove problematic, though Chief
Buthelezi has several rich backers overseas.
If conventional civil war is unlikely, Inkatha could lead a guerrilla
conflict which would fester for years, undermining stability in Natal. A new
government could probably crush such resistance in the townships around
Johannesburg, where it is confined to migrant workers' hostels which an ANC
government would not hesitate to raze. But in Natal, the already bad
security situation could get worse.
'He's got a formidable support base if they remain firm, and that's a
chilling thought,' one senior Natal provincial official said. 'If he decides
to be a disruptive force he can create a tremendous lot of havoc. The Zulus
potentially have far more destructive force than the white right, because
they can afford to make their people cannon fodder, which the right cannot.'
South Africa's worst nightmare would be joint resistance by the white and
black right, with right-wing whites providing commanders, training,
strategic planning, and perhaps even heavy weaponry from SA Defence Force
armouries, using Inkatha as the 'cannon fodder'. Such a force could disrupt
the crucial rail line to Durban port, the main port for the Johannesburg
area.
No one knows how many trained military men the white right could count on
for such resistance: the top ranks of the SADF are firmly committed to the
new government; but among the various part-time, locally based forces and
reservists, which total up to 450,000 men, support is unclear.
Even if most of the right wing's threats are mere bluster, enough true
militants probably exist to cause considerable disruption, and to prevent
elections altogether in certain areas (the poll will go ahead nonetheless,
and international election observers seem determined to declare the election
'free and fair').
So the ANC's choice will be to split the right now, a strategy they have
pursued for months, or try to crush it after the elections. Either way,
prospects are grim. In the words of the police commander for the Natal
midlands: 'We will have such a mess, if they (the right) do not take part,
then it will be, in the words of (former President) John Vorster, too
ghastly to contemplate.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Battle for top post at OECD intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for succession to the secretary general's post at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris moved up a
gear last night when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the incumbent, reaffirmed his
candidacy in a rare public statement.
The normally reticent Mr Paye took the unusual step of commenting on the
candidacy of Lord Lawson, the former British chancellor, which was announced
on Monday, and that of Mr Donald Johnston, a former middle-ranking Canadian
economics minister.
He concluded that Lord Lawson's move, which is backed by the British
government, was evidence of his own sound stewardship of the OECD over the
past 10 years and therefore justified his seeking a third five-year term of
office after his present contract expires in September.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's economy grew 4.2 per cent in the year to September 30,
pointing to one of the strongest recoveries the country has seen for many
years.
The GDP figure is the highest recorded since March 1985, when rapid growth
followed efforts by the National government to prime the economy in the hope
of winning the 1984 election.
The latest growth figure, far higher than economists predicted, cappeda week
of exceptionally positive economic news which has helped fuel the share
market to levels approaching those of 1987. Last Thursday, Statistics New
Zealand reported a trade surplus of NZDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 646m) for the
year to December 31, a NZDollars 536m improvement on the previous year.
The latest retail figures, released last week, showed a sharp recovery in
this long-depressed sector, with an annual rise of 6.6 per cent, on a
nominal basis, for November. Retailers say the trend was equally strong in
December, with stores extremely busy in Christmas sales.
Statistics from manufacturers showed sales and other income rose 12 per cent
in the year to December, with greatest growth recorded by metal industries,
machinery, construction and primary foods.
Inflation continues at alow level, and the Reserve Bank is closely
monitoring currency movements because of fears that the New Zealand dollar
might get too strong and imperil the 0-2 per cent inflation target. The
central bank worries that the country might see negative inflation, ie,
inflation running below its zero target.
The positive news on the economy has led to substantial foreign investment
in New Zealandand continued appreciation of the NZ dollar, especially
against the US and mostEuropean currencies.
The New Zealand unit climbed to a 28-month high yesterday, ending a busy
session at USDollars 0.5714/21 after trading as high as USDollars 0.5718
from a USDollars 0.5672/79 start.
However, a 3 cent fall in the value against the Australian dollar has been
welcomed bymanufacturers, as most of New Zealand's manufactured goods are
exported to Australia under the Closer Economic Relations pact.
The trade weighted indexcontinues to hover around 57, the top of the Reserve
Bank's 'comfort zone'. Observers believe the bank is unlikely to intervene
soon, as the latest consumer price index showed a rise of 0.2 per cent in
the December quarter, bringing annual inflation for the year to 1.4 per
cent.
The positive economic statistics are bolstering business activity. The
Institute of Economic Research, in its latest quarterly survey, showed
business optimism was the highest in the 26 years since the survey of 1,250
business leaders began.
Businessmen were pleased with the steady drop in interest rates, now at
their lowest since 1971 and forecast to fall further.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's upper house of parliament yesterday rejected a government-backed
bill aimed at curtailing the autonomy of the central bank and reducing
powers of its governor.
The victory of an opposition resolution by 28 votes to 11 in the Senate was
a setback for the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto,the prime minister. Mr
Sartaj Aziz, an opposition senator and former finance minister, later called
on the government 'to show their goodwill now and move towards giving
autonomy to the bank'.
Senior officials said the government could still sponsor a new bill in the
lower house of parliament, but warned that a long controversy would hurt
Islamabad's image in the domestic and international financial community.
The government's bill was intended to replace laws enacted in October by a
caretaker government, giving the central bank freedom to set monetary
policy. Mr Mohammed Yaqub, a former IMF economist with a reputation as a
strict financial disciplinarian, is the bank's governor.
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister, regarded the changes in the
central bank as crucial to his programme of economic reforms. But the
ordinance proposed by Ms Bhutto's government aimed to reduce the governor's
term of office while requiring the bank to establish monetary policy in
consultation with the government.
Western economists had voiced reservationson the Bhutto government's move,
arguing that an independent central bank wouldbe the only solution to
excessive government borrowing and uncontrolled monetary expansion. The
government denies its proposed changes would prevent it from improving
fiscal discipline.
Ms Bhutto yesterday urged the United Nations Human Rights Commission to
investigate human rights abuses by Indian security forces in Kashmir, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva.
She told the commission's 50th session; 'The situation in Kashmir is
intolerable, as is the world's silence.'
Denying that Pakistan was instigating or assisting the 'freedom struggle' in
Kashmir, Ms Bhutto said peaceful resolutionof the Kashmir issue would pave
the way for normalisation of relations between Pakistan and India. She
called on India to implement UN Security Council resolutions calling for a
UN-supervised plebiscite and to accept UN military observers along the
border with Pakistan.

<TEXT>
Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's popularity has rebounded since
his victory on political reform, even though most people think it will
change nothing, writes William Dawkins. Polls by two newspapers yesterday
showed Mr Hosokawa had a 74 per cent support rating, a sharp recovery from
last month's level of about 60 per cent.
One poll confirmed dissatisfaction with the two main parties, the LDP and
Social Democratic party.

FT  02 FEB 94 / HK raises investment in airport project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TheHong Kong government yesterday decided to invest an extra HKDollars 15bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) in the colony's planned new airport and connecting railway in
an attempt to defuse the row with China over financing the project.
China is worried about thelevel of debt the project has to carry. The extra
capital injection takes to HKDollars 60bn the amount of cash the government
is prepared to invest in the HKDollars 85bn combined project. It means the
debt needed to fund the project will fall to about HKDollars 25bn from the
HKDollars 73bn first envisaged at the beginning of 1992.
It was unclear if China would accept the government's fourth and latest
offer, which will be made formally later this week. Relations between
Britain and China are at a low point because of their row over Hong Kong's
political development.
Having seen the Hong Kong government's preparedness to put more money in the
project, Beijing may hold out for more. It claimed only last week there had
been a secret deal to restrict the project's debt to HKDollars 5bn.
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, confirmed the new offer after a
meeting of his executive council, his top advisory body. But he would not
reveal any details except to say it would be put to the Chinese later this
week.
The governor said he believed the new offer would 'address all the expressed
Chinese concerns'. More money had become available for the project because
of Hong Kong's healthy financialposition, he added.
The airport and its railway are the centrepiece of aHKDollars 160bn
integrated transport and urban development project agreed with China in
September 1991. Since that date the Hong Kong government and China have been
in dispute about how to finance the project.
After the government gave itsfirst financial plan to the Chinese in March
1992, Beijing accused it of breaking a 1991 agreement which said the Hong
Kong government's debts could not exceedHKDollars 5bn in 1997, the year of
the Chinese takeover.
The Hong Kong government says that aspect of the agreement was never
intended to apply to the borrowings of the corporations building the railway
and airport.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Consumer confidence at 19-year low in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese consumer confidence ebbed to its lowest level for 19 years in the
final quarter of 1993, it emerged yesterday. Release of the figures
increased the urgency for long-awaited income tax cuts, expected tomorrow.
The seven-party coalition appeared yesterday to have settled an internal row
over how to fund the tax cut, the main point of an economic stimulus package
estimated to be worth at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 83.83bn). Mr Hirohisa
Fujii, finance minister, said ministers had agreed the principle that an
income tax cut must include a commitment toraise consumption tax later, to
compensate for the drop in revenue.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and three senior cabinet ministers hope to
put the finishing touches to the package, at a meeting today with Mr Yohei
Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The meeting is
the first in the coalition's new policy of seeking the LDP's co-operation on
important matters, a consequence of last weekend's compromise on political
reform.
Mr Hosokawaand Mr Kono will also discuss the prime minister's meeting next
week with US President Bill Clinton, at which Mr Hosokawa is under domestic
pressure to defuse US demands for numerically measured increases in the
share of imported goods in the Japanese market.
The problems the government faces in encouraging demand for any kind of
product were underlined yesterday by the Economic Planning Agency's consumer
confidence index for the three months to December. On a scale from zero to
100, the index sank to 35.6, down from 38.4 in the third quarter.
The index is the only official survey of consumers' spending plans on
durables and leisure in the six months ahead; it also covers people's
general feelings about financial security and standard of living. Sentiment
continued to be gloomy in the New Year, on the strength of a 6 per cent fall
in vehicle sales from January 1993 to last month, the tenth monthly fall
running.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Kuwait in plan to sell oil businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait is to consider privatising parts of its downstream petroleumindustry
in an effort to revitalise the economy and boost the private sector,
according to senior Kuwaiti officials.
A draft report proposing limited sales of mainly domestic petroleum
operations has been prepared by a Finance Ministry committee for submission
to the Council of Ministers. According to Kuwait officials, the
recommendations stand a 'good chance' of being enacted.
However, the officials stress that Kuwait has no intention of privatising or
even selling stakes in its upstream oil production and drilling operations,
which thegovernment has considered a strategic asset since Kuwait became the
first Arab state to buy control of its oil operations in 1975.
Officials said the likeliest candidates for privatisation would be Kuwait's
petrol stations, some refineries and other non-core businesses associated
with the national oil industry.' The purpose is that the government's
domestic operations should be given to the private sector in Kuwait,' said
one official.
International oil companies would be particularly interested in the refining
sector. One executive saidwestern companies 'would jump at the opportunity
to get involved' in Kuwaiti refineries, which he said were among the best in
the region despite being damaged during the Iraqi occupation.
The small size of the Kuwaiti economy meansother downstream operations, such
as retailing, are unlikely to attract a greatdeal of interest.
The proposals are the fruit of intensified governmentinterest in
privatisation since the Gulf war, which endowed Kuwait with subsequent high
budget deficits and has left the non-oil economy and private sector largely
moribund. Both the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have in the
past year recommended Kuwait undertake some privatisations to improve
efficiency,maximise government revenues and encourage the private sector.

FT  02 FEB 94 / IMF to hold talks on Brazilian standby loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund arrives in Brazil tomorrow to
begin talks which the government hopes will lead to the granting of the
standby loan it needs to go ahead with a bank debt restructuring agreement,
Stephen Fidler writes.
Mr Pedro Malan, the Brazilian central bank president, said in London
yesterday he was still hopeful an IMF loan could be arranged, despite the
defeat last week of a government plan to increase corporate income tax.
This was in part because there was increased optimism about the current
constitutional revision process. The deadline for the revision may now be
extended one month to April 15.
This is also the deadline for the deal with international banks covering
Dollars 52bn (Pounds 34.6bn) of debt. An IMF deal is needed for the accord.
Although a two-thirds majority of banks could waive this condition, the US
Treasury has said it will only issue a special series of US Treasury
zero-coupon bonds to back the restructuring if an IMF agreement is in place.
Mr Malan is expected in Washington today to see the IMF and to negotiate
terms on these bonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five internationally-led consortia have expressed interest in the
privatisation of Peru's telecommunications industry, the country's biggest
sell-off so far. This month's sale will end 25 years of state control of the
industry.
The possible bidders are:
Southwestern Bell of the US with Korea Telecom and Daewoo of South Korea,
Mexico's Condumex-Carso Group and Peru's Banco de Credito;
GTE of the US with Portugal's Radio Marconi and Empresa Brasileira de
Telecomunicacoes of Brazil;
France Telecom and Stet of Italy, which both pre-qualified separately
earlier but have now joined forces;
AT&amp;T of the US and a local partner;
Telefonica de Espana, also with Peruvian participation.
The eventual purchaser will acquire the state's controlling share in Lima's
telephone company, CPT, and 35 per cent of Entel, a state-owned monopoly
operating national long-distance and international services. It is expected
that the remaining Entel shares will be sold off later, possibly through the
stock exchange.
The level of international interest reflects the industry's growth
potential. Peru has the worst telephone provision in Latin America, with
only 2.6 lines per 100 inhabitants. Purchase of the system - which comes
with a five-year monopoly - will contractually involve the new owner in
installing 638,000 new lines in the capital and 559,000 in the rest of the
country before the end of the century.
Additional conditions require every Peruvian town with more than 500
inhabitants to be provided with telephone communication, and waiting time
for connection to be slashed from the present five years to three days by
the year 2000. Investment of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 670m-Pounds
1bn) is expected.
The five potential bidders will make financial offers on February 28.

<TEXT>
A US federal appeals court has upheld jury awards to three relatives of
people killed aboard PanAm Flight 103, the airliner downed by a terrorist
bomb above Lockerbie, Scotland, AP reports from New York.
The ruling on Monday could result in the bankrupt but insured US airline
paying out hundreds of millions of dollars on 222 other claims.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit voted 2 to 1 to uphold damages
totalling nearly Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.6m), awarded in 1992 by a district
court jury in Brooklyn. The jury found that Pan American World Airways
failed to prevent the bomb from being placed aboard the aircraft.
The 1988 explosion killed 270 people.
The US and Britain are still seeking the extradition of two Libyan
intelligence officials accused of being behind the bombing.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Purchasing index at highest in five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Purchasing Managers' Index rose to its highest level in more than
five years last month, boosted by a rise in new orders and providing the
first clear sign that the robust economic growth of the fourth quarter
carried over into the new year.
Separately the Commerce Department reported a 2.6 per cent increase in
construction spending between November and December, further evidence of the
positive impact of falls in long-term interest rates last year.
The purchasing index - a guide to the health of manufacturing industry  -
registered its fifth consecutive monthly increase, rising from 57.1 per cent
to 57.7 per cent. This was stronger than expected, as Wall Street analysts
feared the arctic weather last month might cause a temporary fall in the
index.
A sub-index measuring new orders rose to 66.2 per cent, against 65.0 per
cent in December, the highest reading since 1983.
The strength of new orders more than offset a slight decline in an index
measuring production which was affected by bad weather.
Analysts were disconcerted by a sharp rise in a sub-index measuring
inflationary pressures, which rose to 59.8 per cent against 51.3 per cent in
December, the highest level since November 1990.
Mr Robert Bretz, for purchasing managers, said the very low level of
inventories and the strength of new orders indicated the economic expansion
would continue.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Greenspan warns on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks must work together to reduce the risk that financial systems
will collapse as result of upsets in the trading of financial derivatives,
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, warned last night.
Mr Greenspan, who argued that central banks should retain responsibility for
banking supervision as well as monetary policy, said derivatives trading by
international banks posed challenges to the stability of financial systems.
Derivatives - financial contracts whose value depends on underlying
instruments such as currency exchange or interest rates - had helped to
heighten the inter-dependence of financial markets and market participants.
'Disturbances in one country or sector are rapidly transmitted throughout
the world economy. They pose challenges to central banks'. . .
responsibility for the stability of the world's interdependent financial
systems,' he said.
Mr Greenspan, addressing the Bankers Club in London, said co-ordination
among central banks had become essential because problems in financial
markets were increasingly likely to have systemic consequences crossing
borders.
His remarks are the latest expression of concern by an international bank
supervisor at the potential risks created by derivatives, which are
predominantly used by companies and financial institutions to hedge risks.
The Fed chairman emphasised that the growth of derivatives reinforced
central banks' mandate 'whether written in law or not' to protect the
integrity of financial systems, as well as overseeing monetary policy and
payment systems.
Last year Mr Greenspan attacked US Treasury plans to consolidate banking
supervision, currently spread among four agencies, including the Fed, into a
single Federal Banking Commission. The Fed would retain its responsibilities
for monetary policy and the payments system under the proposals.
The solving of financial crises often depended on central banks having a
dual role, even if this was de facto, he said yesterday.
'The successful resolution of financial crises often depends upon links
between the insights and expertise gained through banking supervision, and
those gained from the pursuit of macroeconomic stability.'
The development of derivatives and risk management had 'yielded great
benefits' to financial institutions and their customers, but had generated
'an elaborate web of financial interrelationships'.
He said that difficulties at internationally active banks 'could well have
an impact on a wide range of other financial institutions, and through them
on the economy'.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed and other central banks had worked with banks 'to
seek in advance improvements that could mitigate the potential for systemic
disruption without destroying the benefits of these useful instruments'.

Washington has finally agreed to sell Argentina 36 Skyhawk fighter bombers
to replace aircraft shot down in the 1982 Falklands conflict, despite
British opposition.
London opposed transfer of the aircraft, claiming they represented a threat
to the Falklands and would necessitate an expensive upgrading of the
islands' air defences.
However, in a statement Washington said the sale was 'a demonstration of the
excellent ties' with Argentina and its armed forces.
The government of President Carlos Menem has lobbied hard for the aircraft
and made the issue a test of its strongly pro-US foreign policy. Mr Guido di
Tella, foreign minister, said the sale was a clear sign of US confidence in
Argentina. Argentina's claim to the Falklands is a highly emotional domestic
issue.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Fed vice-chairman resigns for private sector: Mullins'
departure gives Clinton chance to increase influence on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, yesterday
announced his resignation with effect from February 14.
His departure gives President Bill Clinton an opportunity to name a second
governor to the Fed's seven-member board and so to wield considerable
indirect influence on monetary policy.
Last month the White House said Mr George Perry, an economist at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, was likely to fill the
vacancy created by the departure of Mr Wayne Angell, a governor appointed by
former President Reagan. Mr Clinton, however, has not yet formally nominated
Mr Perry.
The vacancies arise at a sensitive time. On Monday Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, indicated that the Fed was in the process of deciding when to
begin raising short-term interest rates, which have stood at 3 per cent
since September 1992. Mr Clinton has said he sees no reason for higher rates
because inflation is not rising.
Mr Mullins' departure could lead to Mr Perry's nomination as Fed vice-
chairman. Mr Clinton could then fill the vacant governorship with one of the
candidates considered for Mr Perry's position such as Mr Peter Kenen, an
economist at Princeton University.
Alternatively, Mr Clinton could opt to nominate a heavyweight administration
economist, such as Mr Alan Blinder, deputy to Ms Laura Tyson at the Council
of Economic Advisers, as Fed vice-chairman, with Mr Perry filling the vacant
governorship as originally planned.
Mr Mullins is leaving to become a partner in Long-Term Capital Management, a
recently formed investment management firm based in Connecticut.
Mr Mullins has been a governor since May 1990 and vice-chairman since July
1991.
Before this he served as an assistant Treasury secretary in the Bush
administration, where he helped devise the federal bail-out of the savings
and loan industry.

Ghali, the secretary-general, said yesterday.
At his first press conference in New York for many months, Mr Boutros Ghali
hinted at a possible need for the troops to use force to prevent the
conflict from spreading beyond the borders of former Yugoslavia. However, he
repeatedly invoked the Security Council, stressing that it, and not he, must
decide how to deal with the crisis.
Mr Boutros Ghali did, however, declare his firm opposition to waiving the
arms embargo for Bosnia, as favoured by the US. That would bring a flood of
arms when the important thing was to contain 'the dispute', he maintained.
He said negotiations were still the best way forward, with the despatch to
Moscow of Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN negotiator, coming as part of an
effort to 'obtain a consensus among the major member states to see what
could be done'. This latest move was an outcome of talks with Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, on Monday, he said.
Speaking in Washington yesterday Mr Hurd again stressed the need for
co-operative allied action to bring a negotiated end to the war.
On the question of employing air power, Mr Boutros Ghali said that his
representative Mr Yasushi Akashi was authorised to request Nato air support
for UN troops at Tuzla and Srebrenica at any time.
But even if the UN were to 'ask Nato tomorrow' for pre-emptive air strikes a
further unanimous decision by the North Atlantic council would still be
needed. Carefully differentiating between close air support and air strikes,
he also explained that he would 'still have to give the green light'.

FT  02 FEB 94 / IMF warning on further Russian loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund yesterday promised that its mission to
Moscow would be open-minded in economic policy talks with the government,
but warned that it would not be easy to agree to further loans.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said the mission, which began
work yesterday and is expected to remain in Moscow for two to three weeks,
would listen to the plans of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin's government, and would
'try to be helpful'.
However, the IMF's willingness to release the next Dollars 1.5bn loan for
which Russia could qualify under the fund's special facility for former
Communist countries was 'not a foregone conclusion,' he said.
From what the IMF had heard so far, the new government appeared to be
diverging from the reform path agreed with the previous one.
Mr Camdessus warned that efforts to reduce inflation and stabilise the
rouble would not succeed for long without strong monetary and budget
policies, but he refused to dismiss out of hand Mr Chernomyrdin's suggestion
that the Russian government would try non-monetary ways of controlling
inflation. 'If it means they will be stronger in bringing down the budget
deficit, this is music to our ears.'
But IMF officials said they were concerned that the new government appeared
to be ready to let its inflation target slip back to 18 per cent a month by
the end of 1994, compared with a rate of 12 per cent in December.
They acknowledged, however, that the latter rate had been achieved in part
by limiting the government's borrowing from the central bank by not paying
its bills. Some of the accumulated arrears would have to be paid in the
first quarter, probably bringing inflation back to a monthly rate of near 20
per cent, said the head of the IMF's Russia department.
Mr Camdessus fiercely defended the fund against charges of being too
insensitive in its dealings with Russia or too strict in the conditions it
imposed. 'We are the scapegoat,' he complained, insisting that if the
international community wanted to give unconditional aid to Russia, the
money should come from bilateral grants.
He acknowledged that the IMF had only lent a total of Dollars 2.5bn to
Russia so far, rather than the Dollars 14bn announced in separate packages
by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. 'We were unable to
disburse more because we must respect our rules,' he said.
He pointed out that western donors had delivered Dollars 20bn of the Dollars
21bn promised by the G7, and that official and commercial debt rescheduling,
as well as money provided by Germany to rehouse Russian troops, brought the
total of external financial assistance to Dollars 58bn.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Genial Kohl strikes chord with Clinton: A look at the
chancellor's highly successful recent visit to Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word from London, according to US correspondents dutifully reporting on
British media and political reactions, is that the 'special relationship' is
in poor health, its latest illness brought on by the US decision to grant a
48-hour visa to Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein.
British angst may be understandable, if exaggerated. But it also may be
compounded by the word from Washington, that another US relationship - with
Germany - appears to be blooming. That, at least, is the reasonable
interpretation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's genial performance here over the
past two days.
Mr Kohl's mission may well have been designed to play to his domestic
audience about to enter a ferocious election year cycle. He seemed to have
decided that a young and vigorous President Bill Clinton, fresh from an
impressive European tour and now with an July invitation to Germany, is
company worth keeping.
As if to give the lie to even the vague suggestion that he was offended when
Mr Clinton compared him to a sumo wrestler last month, the chancellor hauled
the hefty president off to his favourite Washington restaurant - a trattoria
totally unfamiliar with the trendy new wave of light and healthy cuisine
(the Clinton appetite, according to the proud restaurateur, was the larger).
More substantively, all Mr Kohl's public comments suggested no daylight
between US and German positions on any number of big issues, while tricky
bilateral subjects, such as aviation and interest rates, were skipped over
lightly.
On the Balkans, the chancellor endorsed the president's reluctance to commit
ground troops. 'After the experience of world war two,' he said, 'I can only
warn that intervention with ground troops won't solve anything but will only
create a more tragic situation.'
Like Mr Clinton, he argued it would be wrong to force the Bosnian government
to the negotiating table, as France has been demanding. 'Violence did not
originate in the Moslem camp,' he said, using words virtually identical to
those of the US administration.
He declined to get involved in the Franco-US dispute. 'I've said time and
again that Bonn should not be involved as an interpreter. The people we are
talking about are grown-ups and they don't need an interpreter.' He had no
problems with the use of air support to protect peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations, as agreed by Nato last month.
But he was prepared to exert pressure on Croatia, should it send its forces
into Bosnia in strength. 'I would disapprove very strongly and I would find
a way of putting my disapproval into practice,' a clear hint that that might
embrace the sort of economic sanctions the US has threatened.
He endorsed Mr Clinton's determination to further Russian reform and said
Russia would be invited to the next G7 finance ministerial meeting. But, he
went on, 'real progress can only be made by Russia itself', with western aid
best directed at Russian self-help.
He denied, as does Mr Clinton, that Russia had acquired a veto power over
Nato's membership. The Partnership for Peace approach made current sense,
though it would be unwise to duck for too long critical decisions on
European economic and military integration, a very Clintonian theme. He
hinted that the Czech Republic might be first in east European to pass the
EU and Nato membership posts.
And, if all this solidarity with the US were not enough, he inserted a
couple of sly digs at Britain, too. On aid to the former eastern bloc, he
smiled and contrasted the German contribution, equivalent to Dollars 485 per
German citizen, to the British (bottom of the western league at a mere
Dollars 10).
The chancellor also went out of his way to praise former President George
Bush and James Baker, his secretary of state, both awarded German medals on
Sunday night, for their unstinting backing of German unification. 'There
were not so many supporters as you might imagine,' he said, presumably a
reference to Lady Thatcher's now well-known opposition.
Clearly Mr John Major, the British prime minister due here at the end of
this month, has a tough act to follow. After all, he can hardly invite the
president to one of Washington's Irish bars.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Italians watch their former rulers 'executed' on TV:
Prosecutors act as the avengers in this armchair revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Televised recordings of corruption trials have become a new genre of popular
entertainment in Italy. On the small screen, the prosecutors have become the
surrogate executioners in an arm-chair revolution. From the comfort of home,
Italians are watching the humiliation of those who until recently ruled
their lives.
There is no better case in point than the trial in Milan of Mr Sergio
Cusani, a financial consultant.
Strictly speaking the trial is to decide whether Mr Cusani is guilty of
corruption and of helping to falsify the accounts of the Ferruzzi-Montedison
group by concealing illicit contributions to political parties. But since it
started in late November, it has broadened into an indictment of a political
system that involved a cynical exchange of favours with the world of
business.
The burly figure of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption
magistrate, has acquired new fame in the black and gold tasselled robes of
the public prosecutor. Mixing humour and homey metaphors with a sharp
temper, he has prodded a string of witnesses into revealing the
extraordinary degree of corruption and arrogance that reigned in Italy under
the old political parties.
Take the case of witness Lorenzo Panzavolta, former head of Calzestruzzi,
Ferruzzi's cement/construction arm, who has already admitted to giving
illicit funds to all the big political parties to win contracts.
Mr Panzavolta: 'Cusani brought me a document case, the type airline pilots
have.'
Mr Di Pietro: 'What was inside?"
'I didn't look.'
Mr Di Pietro throws up his hands. 'No? How's it possible one doesn't know
when there's four billion (lire (Pounds 1.6m)) inside]'
'I didn't open it.'
'I didn't ask whether you had opened the case - I asked what was inside. It
wasn't as if there were chocolates]'
'There was money.'
The transfers of huge sums of money are talked about with breathtaking
casualness and imprecision. Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing director of
Ferruzzi-Montedison who married into the Ferruzzi family, was asked how much
the group had given to Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, for the
1992 general elections.
'If memory serves me, Craxi got five to seven billion. You see for Enimont
(the 1990 restructuring of the chemicals industry) it was decided to give
Craxi seventy billion. But as this amount was all in treasury bills, these
had to be cashed. The IOR (the Vatican bank) was contacted . . . and I know
the operation cost quite a lot.
Mr Di Pietro: 'How much?'
Mr Sama: 'In the range of eight to ten billion.'
Mr Di Pietro: 'This was a bank fee? . . . Couldn't you have gone to another
bank?'
Mr Sama: 'I don't know. I didn't follow the operation.'
Mr Di Pietro: 'Let's get this clear. In 1992 you gave Craxi more, why?'
Mr Sama: 'Because in 1991 he received less than agreed (because of the IOR
cashing operation).'
Mr Di Pietro: 'Was this your decision or was it (the extra money)
requested?'
Mr Sama: 'I don't know. Cusani said it was better to make it up.'
Mr Craxi, when called as a witness, denied ever receiving such money.
However, the former Socialist leader admitted he knew about the illicit
financing of political parties. 'The whole system was corrupt . . . .
Everyone knew the parties' balance sheets presented to parliament each year
were a sham.'
Mr Severino Citaristi, Christian Democrat treasurer from 1986 until forced
to resign earlier this year, admitted normal contributions could not
possibly cover the annual L70bn needed by the Christian Democrats (L90bn in
an election year). He claimed his party boss, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, knew what
was going on, and on occasions put him in touch with 'contributors'. In one
of the most implausible appearances in court, Mr Forlani said he knew
nothing about the party's finances.
Unlike the majority of those involved in the corruption scandals, Mr Cusani
refused to plea bargain when arrested last year and opted for an early
trial.
Mr Di Pietro has gradually built up a picture of Mr Cusani being a key
adviser to the Ferruzzi family as well as being intimately connected both to
Mr Craxi and to the Socialist party's finances. Last week, Mr Di Pietro
secured the surrender of Mr Mauro Giallombardo, a former private secretary
to Mr Craxi, and an official of the Socialist International, who had been
wanted on an international warrant for nearly a year.
This brings the case closer to tracing the fate of the L150bn bribe paid in
the Enimont affair, a large part of which was allegedly handled by Mr
Cusani. Mr Giallombardo admitted he had allowed Mr Cusani to transfer more
than L3bn to one of his own accounts at a Luxembourg bank but denied the
money was for the Socialists. It was for an Arab called Mohammed.
Mr Di Pietro: 'Mohammed . . . are you sure?'
Mr Giallombardo: 'I can't remember his first name. If I'm not mistaken he
was Kuwaiti or Iraqi from Baghdad: he had two or three first names, all very
complicated.'
Mr Giallombardo then explained, amid much laughter in court, that L20bn in
transfers to his Luxembourg account were for Mohammed.
The Milan magistrates have already had the co-operation of the Luxembourg
authorities to inspect this and other accounts relating to Mr Giallombardo
and in the name of Mr Cusani's wife.
Tracing the flows will determine whether the money syphoned out of the
system through bribes and illicit political contributions went to the
parties and whether a large chunk stuck to the hands of middlemen or was
diverted for personal enrichment.

FT  02 FEB 94 / OECD criticises Belgian policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium's economy needs a 'fundamental overhaul' to improve growth prospects
and resolve uncertainties stemming from its high fiscal deficit, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday.
In a bleak assessment of the country's prospects, the Paris-based
organisation called on Belgium to give top priority to redressing public
finances. Unless this was achieved, above all through further cuts in social
spending and greater flexibility on the labour market, the OECD hinted that
the Belgian franc could come under pressure on the foreign exchanges.
The OECD said Belgium's fiscal position was suffering from a 'snowball
effect', with high interest rates causing a self-sustaining rise in public
debt as a proportion of gross domestic product. The OECD gave cautious
support to the Belgian authorities' policy of maintaining a firm link
between the franc and the D-Mark following the widening of ERM fluctuation
bands last August.
A formal Belgian franc devaluation would not solve the country's problems,
as it would lead to higher inflation, little gain in competitiveness, and
higher interest rate differentials compared with other ERM countries.
However, the OECD warned that 'sentiment on the foreign exchange markets can
change abruptly'. Belgium faced the risk that 'a policy of high interest
rates to defend the currency (could become) ineffective'.
The OECD repeated its December forecast that GDP will rise 1 per cent in
1994 after shrinking 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 - more than the European
average. The economy of neighbouring Luxembourg, which has currency parity
with Belgium, was seen faring better. But the OECD warned the authorities to
be careful not to let public spending grow too quickly.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Romania reverses economic decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH

<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher output from privatised farms and new enterprises helped reverse
Romania's steep five-year economic decline last year. But the slow pace of
reform provides a shaky basis for sustained recovery and rising inflation
clouds the future, according to figures released yesterday by the national
statistics commission.
Consumer price inflation jumped to 296 per cent last year from 199 per cent
in 1992, more than four times higher than any other central European country
outside former Yugoslavia. The commission blamed high inflation on
inefficient state monopolies, price liberalisation and the continuing
devaluation of the Leu, the national currency. The Leu closed at an all-time
low of 1,480 to the dollar yesterday, down from 460 in January 1993.
Overall GDP grew by 1 per cent, to the equivalent of Dollars 1,089 (Pounds
726) per head, compared with a drop of 15 percent in 1992. Industrial
production rose by 1.3 per cent, but stocks of unsold goods remained
equivalent to around one month's production.
Agriculture and private sector growth were the main reasons for the increase
in GDP, the commission said. Agricultural production rose by 12.4 per cent
while the private sector increased its share of GDP to 30 per cent, up from
26 per cent in 1992. It accounted for around 80 per cent of agricultural
output and more than half of retail sales and services.
The commission said high inflation meant that real wages dropped by 15 per
cent to around half of 1989 levels.
The government's failure to halt the decline in living standards and speed
up reform hassparked off a growing wave of popular discontent around the
country in recent weeks and increased pressure on the ruling Party of Social
Democracy in Romania (PSDR) to form a broader governing coalition.
Trade unions confirmed yesterday they would go ahead with a one-day strike
on Friday, following last week's one-hour strike in which more than 1m
workers participated.
They say they will launch a general strike later this month if the
government does not agree to accelerate reform and establish a minimum wage
at 60 per cent of the average wage. They say they will not support the
governing coalition while the PSDR is negotiating with former communists and
hardline nationalist parties.
In rural areas, farmers have stepped up their demands for faster
implementation of the land law. Fewer than a fifth of farmers have received
full titles to the property returned to them under the 1991 law.

FT  02 FEB 94 / 'Wise men' of the air see turbulence on the horizon: Their
report calls for further airline restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Governments should stop interfering in the airline industry and let
management take the required steps to restoreprofitability, according to the
'committee of wise men' report published yesterday.
The 56-page report on the future of the European airline industrywas ordered
by the European Commission. It calls for further liberalisation and'ultimate
privatisation' as a solution to the industry's woes. 'There is no way back
to previous era of national protectionism,' it states.
But the report, entitled 'Expanding Horizons', softens its deregulatory
message on thequestion of state aid. It argues that state-owned carriers
should be allowed one last dip into public coffers to help their
restructuring efforts.
Mr Abel Matutes, the outgoing Spanish transport commissioner, appointed the
12-member committee six months ago. Members included Mr Hermann De Croo, a
former Belgian transport minister and panel chairman; Mr Jurgen Weber,
chairman of Lufthansa;Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman of KLM; Mr Rene Valladon,
representative of the trade unions, and the Aga Khan, the billionaire
businessman.
Although the report's recommendations are non-binding, reaction in Brussels
suggested that the committee's calls for liberalisation were bolder than
expected. Even Mr Matutes, who otherwise welcomed the report, distanced
himself yesterday from its decision to lean towards privatisation.
European airlines employ about 400,000 people, while European airports
employ a further 500,000. But the airline sector combines strong growth with
poor profitability. State-controlled flag carriers are steadily losing
market share to independents, particularly charters, the report says.
Moreover, European airlines' operating costs are about 48 per cent higher
than those of their US counterparts, measured per available tonne kilometre
(ATK). Total labour costs per ATK are nearly 37 per cent higher, leading to
much lower productivity than in the US, according to the study.
These structural weaknesses, combined with tough competition inside the
European market, have led to heavy losses since 1990. The report warns that
cash-flow generated by European carriers is becoming increasingly
inadequate, with debt-equity ratio possibly reaching 80/20 by 1995.
Yet 'Expanding Horizons' makes clear that there should be no question of
halting the deregulatory tide. It rejects rolling back the limited
liberalisation agreed under the so-called Third Package, in effect since
January 1, 1993.
On overcapacity, the panel recommendsthat airlines themselves must tackle
the problem.
But the Treaty of Rome's competition rules 'should not unduly inhibit
airlines' efforts to solve their problems by means of voluntary agreements'.
On pricing, it says the European Commission should as a rule refrain from
intervention: 'In present difficult circumstances, the need for increased
revenues should be recognised.' Turning to back-door public subsidies,
capital injections and other forms of stateaid, the panel says that these
have severely contributed to overcapacity and uneconomic pricing.
'Significantly, all the cases submitted during the last three years have
involved carriers that are state-owned.
'This in itself is a potentially significant distortion of competition
between state-owned and privately-owned airlines.'
The committee argues that privatisation is the implicit answer to the
privileged treatment of state carriers; but it agrees that privatisation
'normally needs restructuring'. It calls, therefore, for a transitional
period in which member states could have a 'one time, last time' opportunity
to put carriers on a normal commercial footing. Other conditionsfor state
aid include:
The submission of a restructuring plan leading to economic and commercial
viability within a specified time frame, along with 'significant interest'
from the private sector;
A recommendation for restructuring plans to be scrutinised by independent
professionals working with the European Commission;
An undertaking on the part of the governments to refrainfrom interference in
commercial decision-making of carriers, and a ban on airlines using public
money to buy or take over another air-carrier or extend its owncapacity
beyond normal development.
The committee also recommends the creation of a 'single airspace for Europe'
and the establishment of a separate utility responsible for monitoring a
single air-traffic management system. This would end the current system of
European air-space and national air-traffic controls.
In a concession to the aviation industry, the panel argues that value-added
tax on air transport should be ended and that proposals for a carbon energy
tax should be dropped.
It also recommends that 'member states and the EU should ensure the
competitiveness of the European aeronautical industry by providing the same
level of support available to the US aeronautical industry'.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Heseltine sees case for post sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday there was
a strong economic case for privatising the Royal Mail. But he indicated that
he had been prevented from doing so by political considerations.
Appearing before the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee,
Mr Heseltine disclosed that the government's 19-month-old review of the
corporation favoured privatising the Royal Mail letters division.
He added: 'The steps of doing it are extremely controversial.' Making no
apologies for not concluding the review, he said it would be 'irresponsible'
to rush the decision.
He went on to say that the alternative to privatisation - the 'halfway
house' of giving the Post Office more commercial freedom within the public
sector - was also proving extremely difficult.
'The issue is whether there is a halfway house with a semi-monopoly
competing with the private sector. How do you allow the Post Office to
respond to commercial pressures without an outcry from the private sector?'
the minister asked.
Earlier in the day Mr Mike Heron and Mr Bill Cockburn, chairman and chief
executive respectively of the Post Office, argued that it was 'outrageous'
to prevent the corporation from enjoying the same commercial freedoms as its
European competitors.
But Mr Heseltine said: 'The Post Office has a massive captive market. There
is no way of dealing with this issue.' He had approached the halfway house
measure with less enthusiasm than he had full privatisation.
However, aware of the political difficulties surrounding privatisation, Mr
Heseltine assured the committee that the government had no wish to change
the ownership of Post Office Counters, which runs small post offices.
Many Conservative MPs with rural constituencies oppose privatisation on the
ground that their community sub-post offices, which handle pensions and sell
stationery, might be threatened.
Mr Heseltine said: 'This had nothing to do with rural post offices; there is
no way that we would change the structure of those post offices.'
The minister said he was not surprised that the Post Office management was
so angry about the lack of government decision-making.
But he warned the committee that management were intent on protecting
self-interest. 'Don't have any illusion, management may not like what they
are going to get.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / End to airline subsidies urged: State-owned airlines must
prepare for privatisation, say 'wise men'

State-owned airlines in Europe can no longer expect to be drip-fed on
subsidies and must prepare for eventual privatisation, according to a report
sponsored by the European Commission.
The report, by an independent committee of 'wise men' representing the
European airline industry, rejected any rolling back of the limited
deregulation already under way.
But the committee softened its deregulatory message by offering European
Union states the chance to give a 'one time, last time' dose of aid to
support restructuring in an industry that lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) in
1992. Mr Hermann De Croo, a former Belgian transport minister and the
committee chairman, came out in favour of privatisation as the 'ultimate
solution', but suggested that one last shot of state aid might be needed to
put the industry back on its feet. A sick patient could not be expected to
come off a drip immediately before starting to walk again, he said.
Those seeking to extend the 'open skies' regime welcomed the report, which
was published yesterday, even though the committee had stopped short of
recommending an outright ban on state aid.
Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, said the recommendations on
extending liberalisation and generally eliminating state aid were a 'ringing
endorsement' of British competition policy.
The UK aviation industry - which, unlike some of its competitors, has to
compete without state subsidy - was predictably more enthusiastic than that
of Europe's troubled state carriers.
British Airways - which only last month called on the European Commission to
force Air France to repay a FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital injection from
the French government - called the report a 'victory for the consumer and
for competition'. British Midland called it a 'great step forward.'
State-owned Air France and Alitalia were not ready to offer comment, but
both are thought unlikely to welcome the findings.
Air France has resisted rapid deregulation of the European airline industry,
and is seeking a further FFr5bn state aid as it undergoes restructuring.
Belgium's Sabena said the document was 'interesting' because it offered so
many concrete recommendations.
Because the panel's recommendations are non-binding, much will depend on
political will to implement its findings. That will be tested when
state-owned airlines request additional state aid.
The Commission has already opened infringement proceedings against Air
France, which last year faced French government opposition to its own
efforts to shed labour and stem heavy losses. Other possible state aid
applicants include Alitalia, Olympic Airways of Greece, Sabena, and Iberia
of Spain.
Mr De Croo said in Brussels yesterday that the panel had sought to strike a
balance in the debate between liberalisation and protection, but he added:
'There is no solution to save this sector by going back to the past.'
The committee also recommended that, within the next six months, governments
should set a deadline of June 1995 to establish a common external aviation
policy under the Treaty of Rome.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Sustained recovery foreseen by Bank governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, last night said
prospects for sustained output growth and gradually falling unemployment
were 'better than at any time' in his 31-year professional career.
In a speech to the Bankers Club annual banquet in London's Guildhall, Mr
George backed up this optimistic view with the observation that UK
underlying inflation was lower than for a generation.
But the governor couched his remarks in such a way as to quash any idea that
he might argue for a cut in bank base rates from their current 5.5 per cent
level when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for their monthly
monetary meeting later today.
Instead of discussing the short-term outlook, Mr George spoke of the need to
make 'sustained, non-inflationary growth a reality over the years ahead'. He
recalled that the government had the 'declared longer-term aim of price
stability' and, with the bank, was 'making solid progress towards that
goal'. However, the desired outcome of stable prices, rising output and
falling unemployment was 'not assured', he said.
Mr George said price stability was necessary for avoiding the exaggerated
boom and bust cycles that had caused repeated social and economic damage
since the second world war.
On independence for the bank, he criticised those MPs who last Friday voted
against a private member's bill to give it more autonomy on the grounds that
the government must retain direct control over short-term interest rates.
This stance was hard to understand, given proposals to make the bank more
accountable to parliament.
On the other hand, he would not wish for independence without a broad
consensus in favour of price stability. That would be 'a poisoned chalice
that I would be reluctant to take up even if it were offered', Mr George
said.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Major rebuffs Tory right on cabinet changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major threw out right-wing demands for changes in his cabinet
line-up yesterday in a move calculated to restore some of his authority over
the government.
However, the government's difficulties continued to mount as Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary, prepared for a retreat today on the controversial
police bill and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, admitted that senior
ministers were 'beleaguered'.
It also emerged that the cabinet will rush through approval tomorrow for
reports from five pay review bodies giving 1.5m public sector workers pay
rises of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
Downing Street is understood to be 'relaxed' about the reports, which will
be funded by efficiency savings to circumvent the cash freeze on the
government's pay bill announced in the budget.
Buttressed by support from mainstream Conservative MPs, Mr Major left little
doubt about his anger at the Tory right's demands.
A delegation of MPs from the right-wing 92 Group emerged chastened from Mr
Major's Commons office a few minutes after arriving to demand urgent
changes. The prime minister was particularly angry about publicity given to
the meeting, which suggested that he was being offered terms for his
survival as leader.
Friends of Mr Major said the talks broke up only two minutes after the
arrival of the deputation, led by Sir George Gardiner, the 92 Group
chairman.
The right put a brave face on its defeat, insisting that the meeting lasted
nearly 10 minutes, and claiming it had been 'deferred' by agreement with Mr
Major. 'We did not feel it was a brush off by the prime minister,' Sir
George said.
However, Mr Major's robust response was applauded by centrist and left-wing
supporters. 'This was the prime minister exercising a firm grip on
government,' said one. It was also welcomed by right-wing MPs who believe
that the government's difficulties are rooted in the prime minister's
failure to exercise authority over the Conservative party.
'We have seen another side of the prime minister,' said Mr David Evans, an
independent-minded right-wing member of the executive of the 1922 Committee
of Tory backbenchers.
Mr Major's robust action will quell speculation about an early reshuffle,
which most MPs now believe will be delayed until after the local government
and European parliament elections in May and June.
It will also seriously undermine the influence of Sir George, who was widely
regarded as a right-wing power broker until he lost his place on the 1922
executive last year.
Conservative MPs were heartened by Mr Major's unusually aggressive
performance during Commons question time, when he angrily dismissed
criticism of the sale of Rover to BMW from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
However, senior ministers admit that the government still has a lot to do to
restore its authority. Mr Clarke said on BBC radio that the prime minister
was 'getting criticised very unfairly at the moment'.

FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS underpinned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Christopher Price, Peter John and Joel Kibazo
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several bullish stories underpinned the sharp rise in Great Universal Stores
shares, which closed 20 ahead at 624p.
Most speculative was the suggestion in some market circles that GUS was
preparing plans to float off its property division, an old market story but
one which refuses to fade. GUS's investment properties were valued at Pounds
688m in the last accounts and produced Pounds 26.8m in rental income.
Another suggestion was that GUS was intending to pump Pounds 350m into the
property division, which is thought to have lagged behind its rivals in the
bidding stakes for new developments. A third, more pragmatic, reason for the
share price rise was that Cazenove, the company's broker, had upgraded its
profits forecasts. Cazenove refused to comment.
British Aerospace basked in the glow of the Pounds 800m deal to sell its 80
per cent stake in Rover, announced on Monday. The shares jumped 46 to 545p
in strong turnover of 16m as underweight fund managers previously nervous of
BAe bid for stock. Sentiment was further boosted by more profits upgrades
from brokers.
NatWest Securities increased its current year forecast by Pounds 55m to
Pounds 205m.
The Rover deal also boosted sentiment among motor component suppliers. GKN
bounced 21 to 604p, while Lucas Industries put on 9 at 223p in trade of
4.2m, supported by a weighty recommendation from NatWest Securities.
Further confirmation of the rapid growth in the cellular telephone market
came yesterday with new subscriber figures from Cellnet and Vodafone which
were ahead of market forecasts.
The latter's were marginally more impressive and pushed the shares 12 1/2
higher to 598p. UBS, the company's broker, moved from 'hold' to 'buy' on the
stock, lifting its current year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 355m
and next year's by Pounds 15m to Pounds 405m. BT, co-owner of Cellnet,
slipped 4 1/2 to 470p, having run on strongly on Monday.
Conglomerate Hanson saw unusually heavy volume of more than 25m shares and
rose 4 1/4 to 292 1/2 p after Hoare Govett, the company's broker,
highlighted the benefits from a burgeoning US economy.
Hoare argues that at a time when US gross domestic product is expected to
grow at around 3 per cent the US contribution to Hanson's profits is poised
to increase from 47 per cent to 67 per cent. The house is also said to be
steering investors towards improved performances at Hanson's Quantum,
Suburban Propane, SCM Chemicals and Cavenham subsidiaries.
United Newspapers improved 17 to 708p after announcing that its US
subsidiary had bought Harmon Publishing Company for Dollars 100m. Ms Lorna
Tilbian of SG Warburg liked the deal because it was 'small, a good fit and
earnings enhancing'. Stock market analysts had been slightly concerned that
having got rid of its debts the newspaper group might go for a bigger prize,
such as conference organiser Blenheim, steady at 349p.
Television stocks remained buoyant. Yorkshire Tyne Tees, widely seen as the
next bid target, rose 17 to 258p and Ulster Television jumped 41 to 666p.
News International firmed 5 to 293p. Parent News Corporation is expected to
announce an earnings rise of more than 20 per cent for the six months to
December when it reports tomorrow.
Pharmaceuticals company Medeva rose 8 1/2 to 172p in response to an
announcement that the US Food and Drug Administration had published some
long-awaited guidelines on the selling of a version of inhaled asthma
treatment. Traders said overnight US buying helped fuel the rise. Also,
Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, upgraded its recommendation on the
stock.
Zeneca fell 12 to 794p, with BZW arguing that the shares were up with
events.
HSBC climbed 23 to 1014p on the back of a strong Hong Kong market. Sentiment
was also helped by news that Moody's Investors Services had upgraded the
subordinated debt of HSBC Holdings.
RTZ fell 12 to 883p, with Smith New Court said to be advising clients to
take profits.
Among building materials, BPB Industries added 8 at 359p. BZW upgraded the
group and reiterated its buy stance.
Regional stores group T&amp;S Stores announced strong December trading figures
and a new acquisition. The shares surged 29 to 197p.
Industrial gases group BOC added 9 1/2 at 731p as BZW reiterated its buy
recommendation ahead of first quarter results next week. Specialist paints
group Kalon improved 2 to 175p on the back of a Pounds 6.2m acquisition.
Speculation early in the session that the government was about to announce a
submarine order powered VSEL. The shares raced forward but closed only 27
ahead at 1020p, after it turned out that a Pounds 180m order to re-equip
British Trafalgar submarines had been won by Ferranti-Thomson.
UK airports operator BAA, which reported a 12.7 per cent improvement in
nine-month profits to Pounds 292m, relinquished 26 to 1055p. The shares were
hit by general profit-taking and advice from SG Warburg to switch into
British Airways, a penny easier at 473p.

FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call talk hits Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Christopher Price, Peter John and Joel Kibazo
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of a Pounds 1bn rights issue swirled around Cadbury Schweppes
yesterday. The suggestion was that Cadbury could soon launch a one-for-four
cash call at 480p a share to enable it to buy the 76 per cent of Dr
Pepper/Seven Up, the US's third biggest soft drinks group, it does not
already own.
However, some analysts, while accepting the logic of the move, said that at
480p it would still leave the UK group short of the estimated Pounds 1.4bn
needed. They also pointed out that it is only six months since Cadbury last
asked shareholders for funds - the Pounds 324m used to purchase A &amp; W
Brands, also of the US. Cadbury shares fell back on the speculation and
closed 12 down at 523p - but still well ahead of their recent low of 445p at
the end of November.
Cadbury dramatically increased its stake in Dr Pepper six months ago in a
move which alarmed the fiercely independent US group. The two companies
would have a combined market share of the US soft drinks market of around 14
per cent and would be better able to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the
industry leaders.

FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures selling wipes out initial
market gains - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another powerful early showing by the UK stock marketdrove the FT-SE 100
Index to yet another all-time intraday peak. But it ran outof steam in
midsession when the Footsie future turned sharply lower and, later,Wall
Street succumbed to a bout of profit-taking.
The FT-SE 100 was, however, sprinkled with some big winners, with British
Aerospace turning in anothersparkling performance as the City continued to
register its approval of BMW's purchase of the Rover car manufacturer.
There was also said to have been another significant shift from the FT-SE
100 constituents and into the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks after the recent bout of
underperformance by the latter. Dealers saidmany of the big securities
houses, which have been lining up covered warrants against the second-line
stocks, had moved in to cover short positions on their trading books. The
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange is launching its
FT-SE Mid 250 Index futures contract on February 25.
The sell-off in equities was said to have been triggered largely by an
abrupt turnround in international bond markets and talk of a big seller in
the Footsie future.
Share prices moved ahead strongly at the outset, with the FT-SE 100
Indexreaching an all-time peak of 3,514.3 within an hour of the opening as
the cash market responded to Wall Street's overnight advance to record
levels and the further rise by the Tokyo equity market.
The market suddenly came under pressure, however, as the appearance of a big
seller saw the FT-SE future dive and trade at a discount to the cash market
for much of the rest of the session. What disconcerted other traders in the
Liffe market was that the big seller had only minutes earlier been an
aggressive buyer of the future.
Gilt-edged stocksalso played a big part in the market's retreat. News of the
resignation of the deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve was said to have
unnerved US bonds, whichin turn brought substantial downward pressure to
bear on UK gilts.
At its worst, the FT-SE 100 showed a loss of 20.8 points, before stabilising
in the last hour of the trading session as the second-line stocks continued
to climb.
The FT-SE 100 finished 10.3 off on the day at 3,481.5, while the FT-SE Mid
Cap settled 21.1 higher at 4,105.4. Turnover was a heavy 1.087bn shares,
marginally ahead of Monday's 1.084bn, with activity in second liners
accounting for 699.3m shares, or 64 per cent of the total. The Stock
Exchange said the value of customer business transacted in the market on
Monday was Pounds 1.76bn, below levels reached last week but still well
above usual daily amounts for January.
The mo tor component stocks were said to have attracted extremely heavy
demand and to have played a big part in the strong showing by the Mid 250
Index.
HSBC Holdings was the focus of attention in a busy banks area, with the
shares sprinting ahead amid hints that one of the big securities houses  -
BZW was mentioned - could be about to issue a covered warrant against the
shares. Life stocks were boosted by suggestions of an imminent buy
recommendation for companies such asLloyds Abbey and Legal &amp; General.
The relisting of Berisford saw the shares rocket as the market displayed its
pleasure with the terms of its acquisition of the Magnet business.

FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fading hopes of a reduction in German interest rates this week, together
with active selling from leading securities houses, brought a retreat by
stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Dealers reported an erratic start to the session after the first trade in
the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,512.
The early activity included what initially appeared to be a big buy order,
sending the contract advancing to 3,524. The realisation that it was an
order to sell saw March reverse earlier gains.
A feeling that tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting was unlikely toannounce a
reduction in German rates, weakness in the gilts sector and selling from
some of the big brokers, only served to increase the slide.
After a further retreat in the afternoon brought about by a dull opening on
Wall Street,dealers were suddenly caught short, which led to a squeeze just
ahead of the official close.
March, which traded at a discount to cash for much of the session, ended at
3,481, seven points below its previous close and just ahead of its fair
value premium of about one point. Volume at the official close stood
at15,380 contracts.
In traded options, turnover in the FT-SE 100 option improved to 15,034,
making a significant contribution to the day's total of 43,657 lots.
However, the Euro-FT-SE 100 option performance was below its recent average
and traded a mere 1,533 contracts.
SmithKline Beecham was the most actively dealt stock option, closing with
4,156 contracts, followed by Hanson at 3,334 trades.

FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking follows weaker
bond prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After three consecutive record closes, US stocks paused yesterday as a
sell-off in bonds gave investors an excuse to book profits, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.35 easier at 3,964.01 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.99 at 479.62. The American SE composite
inched 0.31 ahead to 485.99, but the Nasdaq composite receded 3.23 to 797.24
after crossing the 800 threshold for the first time on Monday. New York SE
volume, at 322.5m shares, remained heavy.
The day's economic data was generally positive for stocks. The National
Association of Purchasing Management revealed that its January index of
business conditions rose to 57.7 per cent, from 57.1 per cent in December.
The figure, a little better than expected, showed the economy continued to
expand last month, after an especially robust December.
The overall impression was supported by the Commerce Department, which
reported that December construction spending rose by 2.6 per cent, well
ahead of expectations.
But both sets of data rattled the bond market, and the NAPM report, a better
leading indicator, was particularly unnerving. It included evidence of a
sharp rise in prices paid by manufacturers, rekin-dling the inflationary
fears of fixed-rate investors. As a consequence the price of the benchmark
30-year government bond was down by a point to 99 3/16 late in the session.
After a positive opening, stocks quickly followed the lead of bonds. The
setback included some of the high-flying cyclical issues which have led the
market's recent rally. 3M shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 105 7/8 , United
Technologies Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 5/8 and Bethlehem Steel Dollars  7/8
to Dollars 22 3/4 .
Tenneco, a diversified industrial group, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 in
spite of its announcement of strong fourth-quarter operating results.
However, Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, showed no sign of
flagging. The stock was Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 105 5/8 . Allied
Signal added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 79 3/4 and International Paper Dollars
1 at Dollars 76 1/8 .
Allegheny-Ludlum, a steel products supplier, climbed into the NYSE's most
active list after disappointing investors with its fourth-quarter results.
The issue retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 3/4 , in part because of a
downgrading by JP Morgan.
Retailing shares were mixed after the Johnson Redbook Service said poor
January sales would hurt earnings of some store groups. Sears lost Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 , but JC Penney rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 .
Among regional telephone operators, Bell Atlantic declined Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 55 amid growing concern over its proposed merger with
Tele-Communications, Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 26 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq, technology stocks were generally weaker. Canada
Toronto stocks rose in active trading, hitting a record high for the
eleventh time this year. Precious metal issues were to the fore as Comex
gold rose on fund buying and rallying silver prices.
The TSE 300 index closed 36.4 stronger at 4,591.3 and advances outpaced
falls by 476 to 369 after volume of 96m shares valued at CDollars 1.16bn.
Ten of the 14 stock groups ended higher. The golds and real estate indices
climbed 3.7 and 2.1 per cent respectively, while the energy group gained 1.6
per cent.

FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Bovespa index surges further 11.6%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo saw an influx of foreign money into Brazilian stocks boost the
Bovespa index by 8,630, or 11.6 per cent, to a new high of 82,686 by the
close, after soaring 8 per cent in local currency terms on Monday. Turnover
totalled Cr196.6bn (USDollars 420.6m), the heaviest since December 20.
Investors bought on hopes of rapid congressional approval for a key element
of the government's economic plan. Congress is expected to vote later this
week on the proposal by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister,
calling for a social welfare fund.
Analysts added that stronger demand, stemming from some newly created
emerging market equity funds, has also prompted foreign investors to rush
into the market.
Mexican equities also touched a new record high in early trading to pass the
2,800 level on positive expectations for Telmex earnings due soon, before
turning back on profit-taking to leave the IPC index a net 5.95 up at
2,787.32. This topped Monday's record close of 2,781.37. The index was as
high as 2,810.5 in early trade.
In Venezuela, investors reacted fairly positively to the announcement of a
new cabinet by President-elect Caldera which counter-balanced news of a
slowdown in electricity prices that is likely to have an effect on the
earnings of Electricidad de Caracas. The shares slipped to 284 bolivars
before regaining some lost ground to close at 300 bolivars, down 73
bolivars. The Bursatil index advanced 1.5 per cent.

FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity hopes raised by Lebanon
reawakening - Mark Nicholson hears talk of a bonanza in Beirut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If investments of cash come to match those ofhope in Lebanon's reawakening
capital market, there is a bonanza in store.
Blakeney Management, London-based specialists in Middle East markets, tells
clients in its first-quarter bulletin that 'Beirut has the potential to be
one of the best-performing markets this year'.
Merrill Lynch advised its emerging market watchers late in 1993 that Lebanon
was, with Cuba, Vietnam and Israel, a country where returning expatriate
capital could ignite the local financialmarket.
Mr Riad Salame, governor of Lebanon's central bank, quotes IFC data
forecasting that Lebanon's equity market could reach a capitalisation of
Dollars 25bn within a decade.
Meanwhile, it is early days. Although Lebanon has been at peace for more
than three years and reconstruction is gathering pace, the country's capital
market is presently little more than a twinkle in investors' eyes.
Beirut's stock market has been closed since the middle of the civil war and
the sole negotiable securities at present are Lebanese pound denomination
government treasury bills.
But there are signs of movement. The first was the successful share offering
last month to capitalise Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company which will
manage the reconstruction of downtown Beirut.
Mr Salamesays that a secondary market in the Dollars 100 shares should open
within a few weeks. In the absence of a stock market, he says, the shares
will be quoted and tradeable under the auspices of the Societe Financiere du
Liban, a group jointly ownedby 44 of Lebanon's commercial banks, which will
at the same time centralise allT-Bill trading.
In time, and Mr Salame is reluctant to say how much time, this centralised
market will form the basis for a reopened stock and bond exchange.
Much needs to be done first, including making amendments to capital market
legislation and finding a new building for a fully fledged exchange. But,
with an eye on growing emerging market funds available from London, New York
andelsewhere, Mr Salame says that the market, when it reopens, will be open
to direct foreign investment. 'We have always been an open market, and we
intend to remain such,' he adds.
A number of foreign institutions are, accordingly,starting to position
themselves.
Both Paribas, the French merchant bank, and Saudi American Bank, the Saudi
joint-venture bank - both of which acted as subscription agents in the
Solidere issue - are understood to be setting up localbranches shortly.
Paribas is considering establishing a separate investment company. Merrill
Lynch is also said to be looking to expand its small Beirutoffice; and
Banque Audi, the Beirut-based commercial bank, says it expects thisyear to
establish the first local investment fund.

FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Story-driven stocks active on
easier day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses mostly eased back after Monday's excesses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT lifted BMW by another DM51 to DM790.50 for a two-day gain of 15.7
per cent.
Without this, the Dax index would not have achieved its minimal, 2.22 gain
on the session to 2,179.67, itself a 12.93 drop from Monday's post-bourse
close. Monday's other main story-driven stocks, Degussa and Thyssen, fell
DM10.80 to DM478and DM2.90 to DM259 after US-voiced reservations about
aluminium production cuts late on Monday.
Turnover fell from DM11.2bn to DM10.5bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf noted that January's few gains in Dax stocks came in story-driven
cyclicals as the index itself fell 3.9 per cent on the month. The drop would
have been 10 per cent if the count had stopped at the low of 2,035.76 of
January 24.
PARIS edged lower but there were some wide fluctuationsas the CAC-40 index
slipped 3.07 to 2,331.29.
Euro Disney came back intofavour, rising FFr2.20 to FFr37.75 ahead of
today's meeting by creditor banks on hopes that a resolution might be found
to the theme park's cash crisis. Suez, too, defied the downtrend, FFr5.50
higher at FFr361.00 on news that it might be close to concluding the sale of
its Groupe Victoire division.
Paribas advanced FFr22 or 4 per cent to FFr563 ahead of tomorrow's full year
results, whileLVMH lost FFr28 to FFr3,962 in spite of reporting an
improvement in sales.
AMSTERDAM saw a number of the heavily weighted stocks succumb to a
combination of profit-taking, the weaker dollar and technical selling.
The AEX index lost 2.97 to 435.74 after moving higher early in the session
to set an intraday record high of 440.69.
KLM fell back Fl 1.00 to Fl 46.40 ahead tomorrow's quarterly results. Hoare
Govett maintained its buy recommendation for the airline earlier this week,
noting that it has enhanced its competitive position in the sector through
cost savings in recent years. The broker forecast a net profit of Fl 9m
after a net loss of Fl 438m in the same period last year.
Fokker continued to dip after the sudden resignation of its chairman, the
shares losing Fl 1.00 at Fl 22.90 on worries that the boardroom shake-up
might have an impact on restructuring proposals.
MADRID dropped nearly 2 per cent, dragged down by the Banesto requotation
which accounted for half the index fall, saidMr Chris Cooper at James Capel.
The general index tumbled 7.04 to 351.27 as turnover rose from Pta47.7bn to
Pta49.5bn.
Banesto closed at Pta855 against a pre-suspension level of nearly Pta2,000,
and a high and low yesterday of Pta895 and Pta850 respectively as it traded
in 3.8m shares. One of the few winners was Telefonica, upgraded from hold to
buy by Prudential Securities in the US, and Pta35 higher at Pta2,030.
MILAN's Comit index, still encouraged by the calmer political outlook, rose
3.63 to a fourth consecutive high of 665.75 in spite of some profit-taking
in blue chips.
The market has risen by 4.7 per cent since last Thursday and Actinvest, an
independent research group which does not believe that the left can win a
majority in elections at the end of March, is forecasting that the Comit
could reach 700 before the poll and rise to around 750 later.
In banks, San Paolo fell L268 or 4.3 per cent to L10,400 after its results.
Elsewhere, Benetton shed L1,358 or 4.9 per cent to L26,644 as it priced a
placing of shares for foreign markets at L26,500 and Burgo, the papermaker,
fell L558 or 5.1 per cent to L10,339 as its board approved a one for
fiverights issue.
ZURICH hit profit-taking after its five day rally and the SMIindex, which
peaked at 3,181.7, finished 29.7 lower at 3,148.7 in active trading.
HELSINKI continued higher, the HEX index adding 33.8 or 1.8 percent to a
record 1,929.5, helped ahead by lower domestic interest rates. COPENHAGEN
was also at an all time high, the KFX index adding 1.45 to 117.38, its
advance attributed to lower interest rates and expectations of strong
economic growth and increased corporate profitability.
WARSAW dropped 9.8 per cent, the WIG index losing 1,653 at 15,227.9
following warnings by several politicians that the exchange was a
speculative 'bubble'. Turnover fell by almost 60 per cent to 1,900bn zlotys
as the bourse scaled-down most sell offers and suspended trade in five
stocks because of waning demand.
ATHENS rallied after five consecutive losses, the general index closing
28.79, or 2.7 per cent higher at 1,083.96. Trading was heavy with more than
4m shares changing hands.
ISTANBUL climbed 4.35 per cent but the lira swayed as Turkish monetary
officials tried to soothe markets after the central bank governor quit on
Monday. The composite index rose 873.97 to 20,978.8 on news of a decree to
be issued today allowingequity-fund certificates to back repurchase
agreement transactions.

Monday's sharp rise attracted active trading, and the Nikkei average closed
moderately higher as volume jumped to 950m shares, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 187.22 at 20,416.34 as corporate investors sold
into strength, supported by buying by overseas investors and domestic
individuals. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 13.88 at
1,643.10, but inLondon the ISE/Nikkei 50 index retreated 12.61 to 1,346.17.
The Nikkei fell to the day's low of 20,237.52 in the morning, and peaked at
20,509.95 inthe afternoon, rising above 20,500 for the first time since
October 26 last year. Selling pressure from institutional investors, who had
bought shares in orderto support the Nikkei index last year, was especially
strong at those levels.
Traders said the Nikkei's recovery past the 20,000 level had boosted
investor confidence. 'Monday's rise was more effective in supporting the
market than an income tax cut, since it increased the Tokyo market's
capitalisation by Y20,000bn,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Buying ahead of Thursday's announcement of the government's economic
stimulus package may drive the index above the next resistance line of
21,148 reached in September.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone put on Y32,000 at Y1.01m, recovering the Y1m
level for the first time since April 19 last year. Other telecommunication
and multimedia related issues were also higher, with Fujitsu rising Y20 to
Y1,040 and Fujikura, a cable maker, gaining Y21 at Y1,010.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded lower yesterday following Monday's testimony by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, indicating that no tightening
of monetary policy was imminent, writes Philip Gawith.
This represented a continuation of the fairly bearish sentiment seen towards
the dollar in recent days. The currency has also come under pressure against
the yen, which strengthened in anticipation of the Japanese government
announcing a large fiscal boost to the economy later this week.
With most of the important data bunched towards the end of the week,
analysts said most of the main currencies had been range trading.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.727, down from DM1.7444 on Monday. It
also finished lower against the yen, at Y107.640 from Y109.005, and was
weaker against sterling. It ended New York trading at DM1.7310 and Y107.64.
Commenting on the dollar's weakness, Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical
Bank, said: 'The market has discounted the strong growth story. That is
unlikely to give any further momentum to the dollar.'
Although Mr Greenspan's comments were seen as giving dollar bulls reason to
pause, there was little support for yen strength lasting much longer. This
view was shared in the US, where the chairman's speech was seen by some as
preparing congress for a tightening of policy.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, said the
market's initial focus had been on Mr Greenspan's comments about the
favourable inflation outlook. He predicted, however, that the most durable
remark would be that which suggested policy was currently too accommodating.
The market appeared to take the resignation of Mr David Mullins,
vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, in its stride. 'His departure seems to
be a political move and not a consequence of any policy rift within the Fed
governors or the (policy-making) Federal Open Market Committee,' said Mr
Barrow. Mr Mullins, who was appointed by President Bush, was regarded as a
hawk within the Fed and his replacement by a Clinton appointee could have
been seen as heralding a looser monetary policy.
The recent strength of the yen reflects market optimism that a
Y11-15trillion (million million) fiscal package, expected to be announced
later this week, will be good for the Japanese economy.
But Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, argues that in the longer
term it will be the behaviour of Japanese investors, rather than foreigners,
which will determine the value of the yen. He believes low bond yields will
probably cause a large outflow of capital, thus weakening the currency.
One possible casualty of yen strength has been the Canadian dollar, which
closed yesterday at CDollars 1.3315 to the US dollar compared to CDollars
1.3263 on Monday. Some analysts attribute part of the curr-ency's recent
weakness to seasonal capital repatriation by Japanese investors who, inter
alia, have large holdings in Canada.
Another factor is that short rates have, unprecedentedly, fallen close to US
levels. Mr Turner notes that three-month rates have dropped to 3.6 per cent,
from almost 8 per cent at the end of 1992. The gap with US short rates has
fallen to 30-40 basis points, from 300 basis points a year ago.
Although the Canadian dollar is regarded as cheap at current levels, there
is nervousness about buying the curr-ency until rates have stabilised. With
little inflationary pressure now, or likely in the near future, there
remains further scope to cut rates.
Sterling fell against the D-Mark, ending in London at DM2.6028 compared to
Monday's close of DM2.6145.
The weakening reflects a slight shift in sentiment away from the Bundesbank
council cutting rates at tomorrow's meeting. Today the market will be
watching the monthly monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, for any clues about rate movements. The pound closed almost a cent
higher against the weak dollar at Dollars 1.5071.
The market remains unsure what to expect from the Bundesbank. The D-Mark's
recent stabilisation against the dollar will have eased the central bank's
fears of cutting rates against the backdrop of a weak currency.
Many analysts, however, argued that the anticipated poor money supply
figures for December would cause the Bundesbank to hold off, even though the
Bank has made it clear that these will be treated as aberrant. Others warned
that the greatest risk for a weaker D-Mark would be further delays in easing
rates.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'If
the market perceives that the authorities are deliberately postponing an
easing of monetary policy in order to support the D-Mark, recent history
tends to show that this generally leads to further currency weakness.'
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with a further Pounds 200m
assistance yesterday afternoon, bringing total help for the day to Pounds
1bn. This compared with its forecast of a Pounds 1bn liquidity shortage,
revised upwards from an earlier Pounds 950m estimate.

Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices continued to benefit yesterday from
the positive sentiment fostered by the draft agreement on cutting global
production. Speculative investment fund buying lifted the three-months price
to Dollars 1,265 a tonne, a Dollars 33 gain from Monday, with the rise also
fuelled by fresh buying of March and April Dollars 1,300 call options.
The COPPER market, although remaining nervous about the implications of huge
losses in futures trading suffered by Codelco, the Chilean state producer,
was some Dollars 20 higher in the three months position and trying to erode
chart-based resistance around Dollars 1,890 a tonne.
The London GOLD was again led higher by SILVER, which gained 17 cents to
Dollars 5.21 1/2 cents a troy ounce and looked like testing resistance at
Dollars 5.25, traders said. The yellow metal closed at Dollars 384.75 an
ounce, up Dollars 6.50 on the day.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME zinc stocks surge
highlights need for cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The urgent need for zinc production cuts was emphasised yesterday when the
London Metal Exchange reported that stocks of the metal in its warehouses
had for the first time moved above 1m tonnes.
Prices responded in early LME trading by dropping below the psychologically
important Dollars 1,000-a-tonne level to touch Dollars 993. But hopes that
relief might soon be on the way spurred a strong recovery and metal for
delivery in three months closed last night at Dollars 1,015.50 up Dollars 8.
European producers are at present considering a so-called smelter shut-down
agreement, worked out at recent meetings. They are widely expected to give
their approval before the end of this month.
The arrangement would involve one or two European smelters being closed and
the expense being shared by the industry as a whole. The producers argue
that there has been structural overcapacity in the European zinc industry
for 20 years, stemming from over-optimistic predictions about demand growth
made in the 1970s. For some years pressure for closures was eased by demand
from the former Soviet Union, which was taking 100,000 tonnes a year. Now
that region is exporting 100,000 tonnes a year.
Mr Jacques Spaas, secretary-general of Eurometaux, the Brussels-based
organisation that has provided a forum for the shut-down talks, said
yesterday there was no need for further meetings because a formula had been
worked out and producers now only had to agree to support it. At that point
the European Commission's approval would be sought and, if obtained, the
cuts could begin.
Some analysts anticipated that the financial problems of two big European
groups - Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which owns the Rhurzink smelter, and
the Spanish banking combine Banesto, which controls 58 per cent of Asturiana
de Zinc - would prolong negotiations. But Mr Spaas said this turmoil had
caused no undue delay.
The producers are giving no hints about which smelters may close but
analysts suggest four have recently been removed from the list of
candidates. Avonmouth in the UK and Berzelius in Germany were both recently
acquired by MIM of Australia. Both use ISP (Imperial Smelting Process)
technology capable of treating the complex lead-zinc concentrate
(intermediate material) MIM will be producing at its McArthur River project
in Australia's Northern Territory, due on stream in 1995.
The Budel smelter in the Netherlands, jointly owned by Pasminco, the
Australian resources company, and Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell
group, recently satisfactorily ended negotiations with the Dutch authorities
about the storage of the toxic waste it produces. And Union Miniere's Balan
smelter in Belgium is also thought to be secure because UM took a big
financial charge when it closed capacity at nearby Overpelt.
On the other hand Metaleurop has said it will probably temporarily close its
zinc plant at Noyelles-Godault in France while it investigates an explosion
 -the second in a few weeks - which destroyed part of its refining capacity
there.
The other big zinc smelters within the EU are Pertusola's Crotone plant
(100,000 tonnes capacity) and Nuova Samim' Porto Vesme plants (160,000
tonnes) in Italy; and Metaleurop's Nordenham smelter (130,000 tonnes) in
Germany.
Analysts suggest the zinc market can expect no help on the demand side until
at least the second half of 1994 when the world's general economic health
might improve. Without capacity cuts, they say, zinc stocks are likely to
remain high and prices low.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices tumble to 4-month
lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa futures tumbled to their lowest levels for over four months in London
yesterday, spurred by heavy selling by funds in New York the previous night.
The second position futures contract dropped to a low of Pounds 857 a tonne
before edging up to end Pounds 45 lower at Pounds 859. The trend continued
in New York, with the May position down Dollars 27 at Dollars 1,096 in
afternoon trading after losing Dollars 43 on Monday.
Traders and analysts said the sharp fall was largely technical, with no news
to alter the fundamentally bullish outlook of a third consecutive shortfall
in cocoa supplies in the 1993-94 season. London trader ED &amp; F. Man is
forecasting a deficit the following year too.
However, investment funds appeared anxious to move out of long positions
held while the market has traded sideways over the past six weeks, and the
sell-off in New York provided the trigger. Computer-generated sell
programmes and a lack of trade buying exacerbated the slide.
The market continued trading under London Commodity Exchange rules
introduced at the start of the year, despite a fall of more than Pounds 40,
the previous daily limit before trading was halted.
'There's been a bit of a shake-out of some of the speculators,' said one
analyst. 'But we're still Pounds 200 higher than the lows of last year and
that probably reflects the fact that stocks are declining.'
Cocoa prices have been hovering around Pounds 900 a tonne since the sharp
fall from a peak of Pounds 1,066 in December. This was sparked by news of
high arrivals of cocoa from Ivory Coast, the world's main producer.
'The trade has pulled out and been waiting for lower prices,' said Mr
Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers. 'There's no real
support until they decide prices are cheap. They could drop as low as Pounds
800.'

FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise in non-member output adds
to Opec woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil production in countries outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is likely to continue to undercut Opec's market share and pricing
strategy in the next two years, according to a report issued yesterday.
The London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies estimated that total
non-Opec production would rise by 2m barrels a day by the end of 1995. Also,
it expected independent producers to capture 0.8m d of the 1.2m b/d
estimated increase in world oil demand this year.
It suggested that the best way for Opec members to defend their market share
would be to bring additional reserves into production. But that would
require private capital, as the governments of most Opec countries are under
severe financial pressure.
The strength of the surge in non-Opec production was highlighted by another
report report released yesterday in which Edinburgh consultants Wood
Mackenzie predicted that UK North Sea oil output would rise by 30 per cent
this year.
Recent attempts to secure the co-operation of independent producers in a
co-ordinated cut in output to prop up prices have so far failed. Yesterday
Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil minister, was quoted as saying that 'the
main producing countries did not express readiness to co-operate, especially
Britain and Norway, while Russia, Syria and Egypt expressed some readiness
to respond to the Opec demand in reducing their production levels'.
He told the al-Watan newspaper that there was little likelihood of an early
Opec meeting to cut production.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan aims to boost gold
output by at least 200 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, expects a substantial
increase in gold output over the next three or four years, according to Mr
Abdrakhman Begalinov, president of Altynalmas, the organisation responsible
for the republic's precious metals and precious stones production.
Last year the republic produced about 14 tonnes of gold, he says, and the
government wants this lifted to between 42 and 56 tonnes very quickly to
build reserves to back the country's new currency.
Mr Begalinov admits that Kazakhstan will have difficulty raising funds for
such a fast expansion but he has high hopes of attracting more foreign
investors. At present Altynalmas, which encompasses 21 enterprises employing
5,000 people. is discussing specific projects with more than 10 foreign
mining companies, he says.
Kazakhstan's need to build gold reserves means that, during its transition
to a market economy, all gold must be sold to the government - which also
insists on keeping majority control of each joint venture. However, Mr
Begalinov says the central bank will pay in US dollars for the gold at the
world market price.
He says Kazakhstan faces a huge task of reconstruction and its mining
industry, which has a long tradition and is well-developed, will play a very
important role. The country is very rich in minerals - more than 60
different minerals are produced - and the republic accounted for more than
half of all the lead, zinc and copper produced by the Soviet Union.
Mr Begalinov is in London for discussions with Bakyrchik Gold, the
London-quoted company involved in one of Kazakhstan's biggest gold projects.
The UK company has 40 per cent of a joint venture with Altynalmas to develop
the Bakyrchik mine, located in an arid region of the north-eastern steppes
of Kazakhstan. The mine is on one of the world's biggest gold deposits,
containing about 8m troy ounces, but the ore is very complex and difficult
to process.
Mr Bill Hussey, Bakyrchik's operations director, says that the partnership
is on schedule to lift gold production to an annual rate of 36,000 troy
ounces by June. It has yet to be decided when Bakyrchik will approach its
300 shareholders - many of them blue-chip institutions - for part of the
Pounds 75m needed for a second phase to lift output to 250,000 ounces.
Meanwhile, 'our relationship with the local people is getting stronger every
day'.

The sharp rise in the free market price of cobalt - it has doubled since
December to about Dollars 22 a pound - has caused Zambia and Zaire, the two
biggest western producers, to back away from setting a producer price for
the metal. Instead they have set a 'reference' price of Dollars 18 for the
next three months. unchanged from their previous producer price.
Some traders suggested yesterday that consumers would be lucky to obtain
high-grade cobalt - a hard metal used in superalloys in such things as
cutting tools, high-strength magnets andjet engines, as a powder in
catalysts for the oil and man-made fibre industriesand in radial tyres - at
the reference price. The producers would probably charge a premium for
better-quality material, they said.
On the other hand, some consumers thought the recent sharp price rise had
more to do with trader 'hype' than any fundamental shortage of metal. 'The
traders were determined to push the price up to Dollars 30 before letting it
fall back,' said one.
However, statistics from the Cobalt Development Institute, whose members
produce about 97 per cent of western world cobalt, suggest the market was
about in balance last year. A fall from about 18,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes
in western cobalt production was probably compensated for by an increase in
imports from Russia and by stocks left over from late-1992 production.
Meanwhile, demand is estimated by the institute to have remained at about
19,000 tonnes.
This year, the CDI suggests, demand is likely to remain stable while western
production may fall again. Even if Russian exports remain at about 2,000
tonnes and the US authorities go ahead with the planned release of another
2,500 tonnes from their strategic stockpile, supply will do well to keep up
with demand.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply amid rumours of
Fed move

US Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday amid growing suspicions that
the Federal Reserve would boost short-term interest rates this week or next.
By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  31/32 lower at 99 7/32
, with the yield rising about 7 basis points to 6.304 per cent. On the short
end, the two-year note was down  1/8 to 99 5/8 , to yield 4.181 per cent.
Longer-dated securities were hit hard by a double shot of unfavourable news
from the National Association of Purchasing Management.
Its January index of business conditions, a closely watched leading
indicator, came in at 57.7 per cent, against 57.1 per cent in December,
suggesting the economy was still gathering pace.
But traders were even more troubled by a sharp increase in the prices-paid
portion on the report, which appeared to confirm fears of higher inflation.
The Commerce Department further dampened spirits by reporting December
construction spending had risen 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the
consensus forecast of a 1.5 per cent gain.
Against this backdrop, the unexpected resignation of Mr David Mullins, the
Fed's vice-chairman, caused concern. Traders were worried that President
Bill Clinton would replace him with someone less oriented to fighting
inflation, a prospect that was even more disconcerting than early action by
the Fed.
The sell-off in New York spilled over into Europe yesterday, prompting most
government bond markets to give up the gains they had made earlier in the
day.
Some traders also attributed the afternoon decline in the UK government bond
market to rumours that a large line of stock, unrelated to last week's
auction, had come on the market.
The March long gilt future broke through several chart support levels as it
fell from the day's high of 119 3/8 to trade at 118 5/8 in the late
afternoon, down  19/32 on the day.
By contrast, short-dated gilts were mostly unchanged on continued hopes of
an early interest rate cut.
However, few traders expected any hints to emerge from today's monthly
meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the
Bank of England governor, Mr Eddie George.
German government bonds and futures traded in a fairly narrow range as the
market trod water before the Bundesbank's regular council meeting tomorrow
and the impending release of M3 data for December.
The March bund future on Liffe came off an intraday high of 100.63 to stand
at 100.42 in the late afternoon, down 0.09 on the day.
Traders said that activity was fairly limited although they reported some
buying of seven and eight-year paper which had underperformed the rest of
the market recently.
Ecu bonds and futures lost less ground than many European markets as the
Republic of Portugal's new Ecu750m 10-year global bond provided the market
with fresh liquidity.
Dealers reported some switching out of the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004 into
the new Portuguese bond by investors who were not put off by the tight
pricing.
The Ecu OAT due 2004 was quoted at 100.17, down 0.09 point from Monday's
closing price while the March Ecu bond future settled 0.08 point lower at
121.46.
Japanese government bonds and futures were boosted in Tokyo trading after
comments by finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii calmed market worries about
oversupply. He said the government should avoid issuing deficit-financing
bonds to fund its economic package.
The key March contract rose 0.85 point to 114.10 in Tokyo and firmed further
in London trading to 114.53.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB eased to 3.47 per cent in Tokyo, 0.065
lower than its Monday close, and touched 3.42 per cent in London.
Mr Graham Turner, at Sumitomo Finance in London, said that although Mr Fujii
had reassured the market that it would not all be 'spend, spend, spend' he
warned that the recent rally had all the hallmarks of a bear market
correction.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Bonds: VW's DM500m issue likely to attract
investors on Continent

<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German car manufacturer, provided the highlight of the
international bond market yesterday with the launch of a DM500m five-year
Eurobond.
The issue from Volkswagen International Finance, which has an A1/AA- credit
rating, is expected to attract interest from continental European investors,
particularly in the retail sector where Volkswagen is a household name.
However, some market participants were surprised by the choice of
book-runner, CSFB, which succeeded in getting in ahead of the two German
joint leads - Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. It is unusual for a
non-German house to act as book-runner in a deal for a German borrower, and
there was a fair amount of speculation in the market that CSFB had won the
mandate on the grounds of aggressive pricing.
The bonds, which have a 5 3/8 per cent coupon, were priced to yield 32 basis
points over the 5 per cent government bond due 1999. The deal will break
syndicate today.
The other main feature of the Eurobond market yesterday was the burst of
activity in the Swiss franc sector, where borrowers launched a flood of
mainly equity-linked deals.
With Swiss franc interest rates at their current low levels, specialists in
the sector point out that the only way to stimulate any investor interest is
with the addition of an equity kicker, either using a convertible bond
structure or by attaching warrants.
Among the other deals of the day, the Republic of Portugal's Ecu750m,
10-year issue was priced to yield 28 basis points over the 6 per cent Ecu
OAT due 2004. Morgan Stanley, one of the joint lead managers, said the bonds
were still trading at the issue price of 98.325 by late afternoon.
Meanwhile, the People's Republic of China is expected to launch its
long-awaited Dollars 1bn bond issue shortly, dealers said.
The Philippine central bank imposed limits on the amount that public and
private institutions will be allowed to raise in the international bond
market to prevent a recurrence of the debt crisis of the 1980s, Reuter
reports from Manila.
Mr Gabriel Singson, central bank governor, said the 1994 limit would be
Dollars 2.5bn for long-term bond issues and Dollars 300m for short-term
issues.
To keep within the target, Mr Singson said President Fidel Ramos had ordered
state agencies and corporations to have their borrowing plans approved by
the central bank before issuing bonds.
Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, has raised the
subordinated debt rating of HSBC Holdings to A3 from Baa1. The rating for
long-term deposits for Midland Bank, the UK banking subsidiary of HSBC
Holdings, was also raised, to Aa3 from A1.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Canada turns in top
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canad a was the top performing government bond market last month, as a
combination oflow inflation, high unemployment and an easing in short-term
interest rates prompted a rally and provided investors with a return of 2.05
per cent in local currency terms.
'Investors' appetites for Canadian fixed-income securities have been whetted
by widespread expectations that Canadian bonds would continue to outperform
their US counterparts . . . these expectations have been reinforced by
better inflation performance and persistent high unemployment levels in
Canada, along with further gradual easing of short rates by the Bank of
Canada,' says J. P. Morgan Securities in its monthly report on government
bond performance.
Spanish government bonds ranked second with a return of 1.88 per cent in
January, helped by an improving inflation picture and a 25 basis point cut
in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate.
In general, the higher-yielding European government bond markets remained
firm at the start of the year, while thecore European government bond
markets showed only small gains, as market participants became less
optimistic about the prospects of a near-term easing by the Bundesbank.
Japan was the worst performing government bond market, showinga fall of 3.34
per cent in local currency terms. The strong performance of bond markets
last year boosted turnover on Euroclear, the world's largest international
securities clearing house, to a record Dollars 17,300bn, up 77 per cent on
1992, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Euroclear is expected to have increased its shareof the market with rival
Cedel to more than 70 per cent. Average daily turnoverrose from Dollars 37bn
to Dollars 66bn.
Euroclear gave rebates totalling Dollars 12m to the market, since it does
not retain profits except for further investment in development.

250 futures contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) will
introduce an FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on February 25, three weeks
after the launch of rival instruments on OMLX, the London-based equity
derivatives exchange.
Last November, the London Stock Exchange awarded licencesto trade
derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies to Liffe and OMLX.
Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, said that there were no plansto
introduce options at this stage. 'If the contract is successful, we would
look to introduce options at an early date, but the principal interest is in
the futures,' he said.
'We think that will give us enough time to get a considerable slice of the
business,' said Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of OMLX.
'There is a lot of business that is being done by fund managers over the
counter, on the understanding that it will be transferred on to the exchange
(when the contracts are launched).'

A small Vancouver-based exploration company fighting a hostile takeover bid
from Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's
Metallgesellschaft, has alleged that a Canadian securities firm unlawfully
supplied information to Metall.
International Musto Explorations is seeking damages and a permanent
injunction to prevent Metall receiving any further allegedly confidential
information from McLean McCarthy, the Toronto-based securities dealer.
Musto alleges that Metall has used information supplied by McLean McCarthy
to canvass support for its proposed CDollars 232m (USDollars 175m) bid for
Musto. The securities firm, which is wholly-owned by Deutsche Bank,
previously acted as an adviser to Musto, but is now retained by Metall.
Metall has offered to buy all Musto's outstanding shares as a way of gaining
control of Bajo de la Alumbrera, a copper and gold deposit in Argentina.
Besides controlling McLean, Deutsche Bank is the biggest single shareholder
in Metallgesellschaft.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Israelis open tender for bank
sale

Israel yesterday opened the tender for the sale of 20 to 40 per cent of the
shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second-largest banking group, marking a
critical turning point in the government's plans to sell off the banks.
The move came as four international and local consortia met a government
deadline to submit plans to participate in the sale of United Mizrahi Bank.
MI Holdings, the Israeli body charged with selling off the country's banks
which were taken into public ownership after a share manipulation scandal in
1983,said local and foreign investors interested in buying Bank Leumi would
have to submit proposals by the middle of April and deposit Dollars 20m.
In 1992, Bank Leumi reported consolidated net profits of Dollars 76m from
total consolidated assets of Dollars 28bn.
Last year the government began selling off shares in Leumi and other banks.
The government still owns 73 per cent of the shares, with the publicand
Leumi employees holding almost 23 per cent and the original owners, the
Jewish Colonial Trust, almost 5 per cent.
The government says it welcomes bids from single investors, holding groups
and foreign banks and will follow the Leumi offer with the sale of a
controlling stake in Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank. The
investors will have to be approved by banking authorities in the US, UK,
Switzerland and other countries in which Leumi has operations.
In the Mizrahi sale, four groups are bidding to buy between 25.1 and 51 per
cent of the share in a sale expected to be completed by April. The leading
group isbelieved to be the La Nationale Insurance consortium which includes
prominent Israeli businessmen, a Swiss bank and Swiss mutual fund and Israel
Aircraft Industries. In 1992 Mizrahi reported profits of Dollars 40m.

bank

National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), Kuwait's biggest commercial bank, has
reported a 22.3 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to KD52m (Dollars
175m) from KD42.5m in 1992.
The bank ascribed its strong performance in an otherwise flat banking sector
to expanded portfolio management services and good returns from its
international activities. NBK retains the biggestinternational presence of
any of Kuwait's six commercial banks.
Total assets grew by 28.4 per cent to KD3.3bn, while customers' deposits
increased by 13.6 per cent to KD1.95bn. NBK already holds more than 40 per
cent of Kuwait's total bank deposits.
An NBK statement said shareholders' funds increased toKD326m. The board
approved a 23 per cent cash and 10 per cent stock dividend.
The bank maintained a capital to risk ratio of more that 20 per cent and has
consolidated its position as Kuwait's most soundly based bank, according to
analysts.
NBK was the sole Kuwaiti commercial bank to avoid serious damage from the
collapse in 1982 of the unofficial Souq al-Manakh stock market. It managed
to continue operations during the Gulf war through its London office.
A new and complex law aimed at resolving the legacy of debt left by that
crash, along with new debts created by the country's occupation by Iraq,
overhang Kuwait's banking sector. The sector has also been subdued by the
flat non-oil economy since the end of the Gulf war.
NBK is to expand further its international network with a representative
office in Vietnam, for which the bank won approval in September.
Meanwhile, Dubai-based Mashreq Bank, the sole commercial bank free of
government control, announced a 21 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to
Dh250.5m (Dollars 68.6m) from Dh207m in 1992. Operating income increased
last year by 6.1 per cent to Dh624.8m. Pre-tax profit after provisions was
up 17.5 per cent to Dh27.51m (Dollars 72.4m).
Total assets increased 8 per cent to Dh11bn, while customer deposits were up
13 per cent to Dh7.4bn.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Benetton may diversify after
move to raise L265bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Benetton, the Italian clothing group, may be gearing up for a big
acquisition outside its traditional activities.
Mr Aldo Palmeri, managing director, said the company had not entered
negotiations. However, he indicated it was looking for substantial
acquisitions to 'accelerate ourcapacity to develop'.
The comment came against the announcement of a L265bn (Dollars 156m)
cash-raising exercise to broaden the appeal of the group's shares.
Benetton will sell 10m new shares, priced at L26,500 each, to international
investors, notably in the US, in an attempt to broaden its shareholding
base.
'Our shareholders are now concentrated in Europe, especially Italy,' said Mr
Palmeri. 'We want to attract new investors from the US, the Far East and
Europe.'
The issue will also increase Benetton's float to about 30 per cent of the
total capital from about 25 per cent at present. The remaining stock is
controlled by the Benetton family.
Mr Palmeri said the decision to increase the float was taken partly in
response to big investors, who had called for a more liquid market in the
group's stock.
Some potential investors had been prevented from buying stock because of
internal rules prohibiting share purchases in companies with a limited
float.
The additional cash raised, along with last year's strong internal cash
flow, would leave Benetton poised to take advantage of takeover
opportunities, said Mr Palmeri. 'We have nothing planned today, but we want
to be able to negotiate from a strongposition,' he said.
Possible purchases could include other well-known brands, or companies which
could help to lift Benetton's sales in parts of the world where it is not
yet fully developed.
Analysts expect the group, which will report its 1993 results in March, to
announce a sales increase of about 10 per cent to L2,512bn.
Net profits are expected to increase by more than 10 per cent from the
L184.7bn made in 1992.

is pitched at ADollars 2.50, compared with Monday's closing price of
ADollars 2.78. Westfield said that the funds would be used to finance the
expansion and redevelopment of Westfield shopping centres.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daewoo Motor drives into
untapped markets - The South Korean carmaker is focusing on the Third World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daewoo Motor's recent purchase of the Romanian car company Oltcit is the
latest step in its strategy to operate assembly plants and establish
distribution networks in developing countries.
South Korea's third-largest car company, which had a 1993 turnover of
Dollars 2.7bn, is gambling that it can achieve higher sales and earnings in
the relatively untapped markets of the Third World rather than in advanced
industrial countries, where competition among carmakers is fierce.
It is a strategy that has also guided its parent Daewoo group, which built
an industrial empire in Korea by taking over and reviving bankrupt
companies, and aggressivelymoving into emerging foreign markets from Burma
to Sudan.
Mr Kim Woo-choong, the founder and chairman of the Daewoo group, announced
last year that he wanted to transform the unprofitable and unlisted Daewoo
Motor into one of the group's main companies.
The group, Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, already owns leading
shipbuilding, electronics and financial services companies.
He plans to quadruple Daewoo Motor's output from 550,000 to 2.2m vehicles by
2000, with almost half the production located over-seas.
Daewoo Motor's purchase last month of 51 per cent of Oltcit, Romania's
second-largest motor company, for Dollars 156m provides it with its first
production base in eastern Europe. The region is already emerging as one of
Daewoo's biggest overseas markets, accounting for 15 per cent of car exports
last year.
This follows the signingof several other contracts for joint venture car
plants abroad last year. They include a Dollars 630m project in Uzbekistan
to produce 200,000 vehicles beginning in 1996, and a Dollars 600m assembly
plant in Iran that will start operation in late 1995. Daewoo also expects to
begin assembling cars in the Philippines and Vietnam. Other projects are
being negotiated in Libya, Peru, Pakistan and Tatarstan, Russia.
In China, considered its biggest potential market, Daewoo has established a
joint venture factory for bus production, but Chinese officials have
indicated that they will not allow new foreign car joint ventures until
1996.
Daewoo Motor's export drive follows the collapse of its eight-year-old 50-50
partnership with General Motors in 1992. Daewoo supplied the LeMans, the US
version of the Opel Kadett, to GM on an original equipment manufacturing
basis, but is now barred from exporting cars to western Europe and the US
until 1995 under its divorce agreement with GM.
Daewoo plans to use the Oltcit plant as a springboard into western Europe,
with production expected to reach 200,000 vehicles by 1998.
But there are other advantages in using developing countries for production.
It is able to acquire existing factories at a relatively cheap price, and
marketing costs in these countries are low.
'It's probably their best option,' said Mr Don Lee, motor analyst for BZW
Securities in Seoul. 'They don't have a product that is really competitive
at home. Markets in the developing world are less demanding than in Korea.'
Although Daewoo car sales in Korea rose by 47 per cent to 210,000 vehicles
last year, this wasprimarily due to extremely favourable consumer financing
being offered by the company. Daewoo cars still suffer a quality image
problem and the company lacks the up-market models being produced by its
bigger Korean rivals, Hyundai and Kia. Exports increased by 83 per cent to
100,000 vehicles.
But other analysts believe that Daewoo is making a mistake in expanding too
quickly abroad. 'Themoney would be better spent in investing at home,
because they need to improve their product quality to compete against
Hyundai and Kia. If they perform poorlyin Korea, export sales will not save
them,' said Mr Chung Tae, vehicle analystat Jardine Fleming Securities in
Seoul.

subsidiary to black grouping

<TEXT>
Southern Life, one of South Africa's biggest life assurers, has sold a
controlling stake in subsidiary African Life to a consortium of prominent
black businessmen for R160m (Dollars 47m) in a significant move towards
black economic empowerment.
Control in African Life, which has assets of R313m, will pass to a new
company - it now has a working name of Newco - to be owned by the consortium
and a number of black organisations ranging from trade union federation
Cosatu to church groups, the National Association of Stokvels -
community-based savings organisations - and provident and pension funds.
This aspect of the deal sets it apart from earlier moves towardsblack
economic empowerment. Newly-formed black-owned companies, without such
diverse community shareholders, gained an important stake in Metropolitan
Life, a middle-ranking life assurer, and took control of the Sowetan, the
leading black newspaper, in the past year.
Mr Don Ncube, leader of the consortium and an alternate director of Anglo
American, which controls Southern Life, said African Life would be 'a mirror
of South African society' with Newco well-placed tobecome a vehicle for
foreign investment.
Newco would acquire 51 per centof African Life from Southern Life but the
company's management would remain inplace. The consortium had 120 days in
which to raise the money to conclude the deal but had commitments in
principle from the community and other groups to buyshares in Newco.
Mr Ncube said the acquisition was settled only after exhaustive talks with
community groups and Southern Life, and a due diligence study of African
Life by accountants Arthur Andersen, paid for by the Black Integrated
Commercial Support Network.

<TEXT>
Cominco, the Canadian base metals group, suffered another large loss last
year, but reported improvements in production and cost controls in the
fourth quarter.
The net loss, including gains on disposals, was CDollars 113.2m (USDollars
85.7m), or CDollars 1.46 a share, compared with CDollars 30.2m, or 42 cents,
in 1992. Revenues dipped to CDollars 982m from CDollars 1.47bn, due largely
to the spin-off of the fertiliser division.
While the operating loss for the year widened to CDollars 129m from CDollars
62.5m, it narrowed in the fourth quarter to CDollars 4.4m from CDollars
43.7m. The last figure included a CDollars 30m inventory write-down, but
metal prices last year were below 1992.
Cominco said output of its Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska climbed by 63 per
cent in the fourth quarter to 126,000 tonnes of concentrate. Two mills came
on stream in mid-January, and improvements in production and ore yields were
expected this year.
The troubled Trail smelter in British Columbia broke even on an operating
basis in the final three months, in spite of the slide in metal prices. The
smelter's lead and zinc output last year was about 95 per cent of 1993
levels. The Quebrada Blanca project in Chile is to produce cathode copper in
the second quarter of 1994.

<TEXT>
Euro Disney's creditor banks will meet today in Paris to map out their
strategy for the final stage of negotiations over a rescue package for the
ailing leisure group.
The banks, which include J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National
Westminster, had hoped to discuss an audit of Euro Disney they have
commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy company.
However, KPMG has been unable to finalise its audit allegedly because of
Euro Disney's reluctance to release information. It has prepared a
preliminary report. The final audit is due for completion in two weeks.
The banks have asked KPMG to analyse Euro Disney's financial position and
its future requirements to verify information given to them by Disney at a
meeting in November. The US group has tabled proposals to halve Euro
Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.4bn) debt by raising FFr10bn through a rights
issue and debt-for-equity swap.
Meanwhile, Adam, a French pressure group that represents minority
shareholders, is lobbying for the convertible bond holders (who hold FFr4bn
of Euro Disney's debt) to see the KPMG report and to be represented in the
negotiations.

<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, saw operating income double
in the fourth quarter as its J. I. Case farm equipment division continued to
improve.
Mr Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chairman, projected Case's worldwide production
would rise 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1994.
The group's natural gas division put in a strong performance but the
packaging and automotive parts businesses saw income and revenues tumble
during the quarter.
For the quarter, Tenneco reported net income from continuing operations,
excluding restructuring charges, of Dollars 150m, or 83 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 29m, or 17 cents, in the fourth quarter a year ago.
Sales were Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.31bn a year ago. Operating
income jumped to Dollars 317m, from Dollars 160m in last year's fourth
quarter.
For the year, Tenneco reported income from continuing operations, before
special charges, of Dollars 451m, or Dollars 2.59, up from Dollars 160m, or
Dollars 1.00, in 1992.
Sales were Dollars 13.3bn, up slightly from Dollars 13.1bn.
Case reported an operating profit of Dollars 82m for the year, compared with
a loss of Dollars 260m in 1992. It also reduced its inventories by Dollars
400m during the year. However, sales dipped to Dollars 3.7bn for the year,
from Dollars 3.8bn in 1992, but improved in the fourth quarter as US demand
strengthened. In the fourth quarter, Case had sales of Dollars 1bn, up from
Dollars 966m a year ago.
Tenneco Gas recorded operating earnings of Dollars 120m in the quarter and
Dollars 411m for the year, up from Dollars 111m and Dollars 360m
respectively.
Natural gas sales rose to Dollars 689m in the fourth quarter, from Dollars
685m a year ago, while for the year, sales increased to Dollars 2.9bn, from
Dollars 2.1bn last year. Operating income from the automotive parts division
fell to Dollars 29m, from Dollars 54m in the quarter, and to Dollars 215m
from Dollars 230m for the year. The packaging side saw fourth-quarter
operating income drop to Dollars 21m from Dollars 64m and to Dollars 139m
from Dollars 221m for the year.
Tenneco president Mr Dana Mead, responding to speculation that Tenneco
wished to sell J. I. Case, said that the unit was not on the block, Reuter
adds.
'We haven't put it on the block. We haven't gone out peddling it,' Mr Mead
told a media teleconference in reply to speculation that Tenneco was
interested in divesting Case. 'Yet we've always said we are opportunistic.
We're interested in building shareholder value,' Mr Mead added.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Nabisco slumps to Dollars 496m
net deficit
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US cigarette and food group, continued to show the effects
of the price war in its domestic cigarette market by slumping into net
losses of Dollars 496m for the fourth quarter.
Last week, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco's biggest rival, reported a 72 per
cent fall in fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 339m. Both companies have
suffered from price cuts introduced last year in a bid to regain US market
share - though prices have started to creep back up.
A large part of the losses were caused by a Dollars 467m charge for
restructuring and the results were in line with expectations. The shares
closed unchanged at Dollars 7 1/2 .
The Dollars 496m loss compared with a net profit of Dollars 37m last time.
RJR Nabisco said both figures included unusual charges, which if stripped
out, would have resulted in a fourth-quarter net profit of Dollars 38m,
compared with Dollars 207m in the comparable period.
RJR Nabisco reported yesterday that fourth-quarter cigarette sales volumes
were down 9 per cent in the US compared with the previous year, and lower
prices reduced the value of sales by 26 per cent. The result was a 72 per
cent fall in the division's operating profits to Dollars 130m.
International tobacco sales were up 25 per cent, due in part to Russia and
the Middle East, and operating profits rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 158m.
Nabisco Foods saw a 12 per cent increase in worldwide sales and lifted
operating profits by 16 per cent to Dollars 308m.
In December, RJR Nabisco announced it was cutting 6,000 jobs from its
workforce of 63,000. Although this hit 1993 profits, it said it would
enhance future net earnings by Dollars 250m a year.
Fourth-quarter losses per share, fully diluted and including all charges,
were 35 cents, compared with earnings of 4 cents last time. For the full
year, turnover fell to Dollars 15.1bn from Dollars 15.7bn and net profits of
Dollars 299m turned into net losses of Dollars 145m - though the company
said if unusual charges were stripped out, the figures would have shown net
profits of Dollars 464m, compared with profits of Dollars 812m last time.
Losses per share, fully diluted and including all charges, were 12 cents
compared with earnings of 24 cents last time.

<TEXT>
Reebok International, the US sports shoemaker, yesterday reported net income
of Dollars 50.7m from continuing operations, little changed from Dollars
49.8m last time. Poor sales of its athletic shoes were largely to blame:
Reebok footwear sales in the US were nearly 23 per cent lower than in the
previous year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, Reebok appeared to show a sharp improvement from net
income of Dollars 114.4m, to Dollars 223.4m. However, it said profits from
continuing operations were virtually flat at Dollars 230.4m compared with
Dollars 232.3m last time.
Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company was
disappointed by the decline in US footwear sales in the second half, but the
year had ended with orders up 14.4 per cent on last time. There had been
good performances from the US apparel business, Reebok's international
business, and Rockport's international, outdoor and women's footwear
businesses.

Amgen, the US's biggest biotech company, reported that sales of Neupogen,
its biggest selling drug, remained static in the final three months of last
year, as a squeeze on costs in the US took effect.
Sales of Neupogen, a stimulant for the immune system, reached Dollars
186.9m, 15 per cent up on a year before but almost in line with the third
quarter of 1993.
The company's shares plunged last February when it announced that Neupogen
sales would be lower for the first quarter of 1993, although sales rallied
during the second and third quarters.
For the year, sales of Neupogen reached Dollars 719m, up 32 per cent from
1992. Sales of Epogen, a treatment for kidney failure, rose 16 per cent to
Dollars 587m.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 91m, or 64 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 134m, or 91 cents, the year before.

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has announced a higher performance version
of its widely-used AS/400 minicomputer.
The aim is to stem declining revenues in one of its most critical business
segments.
Last week, IBM acknowledged that AS/400 revenue fell in the fourth quarter
of 1993, mainly because of sluggish European demand.
It added that a 3.8 per cent drop in software revenues was 'largely due to a
decline in sales of AS/400 software'.
More than 250,000 AS/400 systems are installed worldwide, running more than
20,000 software applications.
The AS/400 'mid-range' product line is IBM's principal offering for large
companies that are reducing the size of their computer systems or switching
to departmental networked 'client-server' computing systems, and for smaller
companies upgrading from personal computer networks.
However, IBM faces intense competition from Hewlett-Packard and other
companies offering lower-priced, mid-range systems based on reduced
instruction set computing (Risc) technology.
The new IBM model, called the 9406 Model F97, will support 4,800
workstations, twice as many as the current top-of-the-line Model F95. Priced
at about Dollars 1.2m, it provides 20 per cent more power and can support up
to 30 per cent more disk storage.
Next year, IBM is expected to announce another significant upgrade of the
AS/400 family based on the PowerPC chip - a new Risc microprocessor
co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer.

Sextant Avionique of France and Allied Signal of the US yesterday announced
that they had abandoned plans to form a joint venture in avionics which
would have created one of the world's largest aircraft electronics groups.
The companies said they were 'well positioned in their markets but that they
were unable to find a mutually satisfactory way to integrate Allied Signal's
commercial avionics and Sextant's commercial and military avionics
businesses in a satisfactory way'.
The problem appeared to involve Sextant's desire to guarantee the
confidentiality of its defence-related activities. Sextant, which is
controlled by Thomson-CSF, the French state-owned defence and civil
electronics group, derives just under half of its sales from military
activities.
When Sextant announced last year that it was negotiating to form a joint
venture with Allied, the French company estimated that combined sales could
total more than FFr1bn (Dollars 170m).
In spite of the failure of the joint venture, the two companies said that
they would continue to explore areas of co-operation in the commercial
avionics market.

Molson, the international brewing and retailing group, said third-quarter
profits held up well and most sectors turned in better performances.
Net income was flat at CDollars 25.4m (USDollars 19.2m), or 43 cents a
share, against CDollars 25.3m, or 42 cents, a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 748m, against CDollars 770m.
Nine-month earnings were CDollars 99.3m, or CDollars 1.68, against CDollars
100.1m, or CDollars 1.68, on revenues of CDollars 1.83bn against CDollars
1.85bn.
A 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, a subsidiary, was sold to Miller of
the US last April. This saw Molson's share of the brewing results fall to 40
per cent from 50 per cent. Its share of brewing profits in the nine months
dipped 25 per cent to CDollars 102m.
Beer exports to the US were up 22 per cent, mainly due to successful new
products.
New beers were introduced in Canada, the UK and Australia, although domestic
market share slipped slightly.
Diversey, the special chemicals unit, improved sales and operating profit in
North America, Europe, Japan and Latin America, but suffered from currency
fluctuations. Profitability still lags in the US cleaning business.
The Malsham hardware retailing unit forged ahead in Canada with volume up 16
per cent and higher operating profit. Sports and entertainment improved
profits sharply, mainly because of special factors.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Partnership with Intel is
updated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel and IBM have updated their long-standing technology partnership which
established Intel microprocessors as the standard for personal computers,
writes Louise Kehoe.
Under the new agreement, IBM will expand its own production of
Intel-designed 486 microprocessors, the 'brains' of most PCs. However, IBM
has elected not to manufacture Pentium, Intel's latest microprocessor.
The companies also extended a patent cross-licensing agreement that expired
last year.
Intel will pay an undisclosed 'non-material' sum to IBM 'to regain exclusive
manufacturing rights for Pentium and subsequent microprocessors,' Intel
said.
IBM's decision not to make the Pentium chip raises questions about its
commitment to the Intel microprocessor technology. IBM is about to launch a
new generation of computers based on PowerPC microprocessors, co-developed
with Motorola and Apple Computer.
'There is no question that PowerPC will compete directly with Pentium,'
acknowledged Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president.
However, he stressed that IBM plans to continue to develop products based on
Intel chips and said the timing of the announcement, coming shortly before
the expected introduction of PowerPC computers, was coincidental.
Intel is 'a vital IBM partner and supplier of technologies that fuel a
significant part of IBM's business,' said Mr Cannavino. 'We have a very
large and growing business in Intel-based computers.'
Mr Cannavino said IBM would have had to invest 'hundreds of millions of
dollars' in new production technology to produce the Pentium chip.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Polaroid improves to Dollars
39.2m in fourth term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polaroid, the US photography group, increased fourth-quarter net profits to
Dollars 39.2m from Dollars 29.6m in the previous year.
However, the group warned that the first half of the current year would show
the adverse effects of slow economic growth in Europe, the stronger US
dollar and start-up costs on a coating facility.
For the full year, it reported net losses of Dollars 51.3m compared with
profits of Dollars 99m last time, partly because of the adverse effect of
severence payments and accounting changes.
Operating profits, excluding the unusual items, would have been Dollars 208m
compared with Dollars 214m last time, the company said.
The fourth-quarter profits growth was caused partly by a strong response
from US consumers to a new instant camera system called Captiva.
The system helped the company reach its largest number of camera shipments
in 10 years.
Polaroid said it expected to increase operating profits significantly in the
current year in spite of weakness in the first half.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo lifted by US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US soft drink, snacks and fast-food restaurant group, suffered
poor results from its international businesses. However, strong growth in
the US helped the group report a 12 per cent increase in net income to
Dollars 442.5m for its fourth quarter, excluding unusual items.
The comparable quarter's net profit of Dollars 265.6m included a
restructuring charge, and PepsiCo said the figure of Dollars 394.1m,
excluding the charge, was a better comparison. On that basis, earnings per
share rose to 55 cents from 32 cents.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive, said the strong volume
growth in most of PepsiCo's operations indicated the fundamental vitality of
its businesses.
International beverage profits fell by 65 per cent to Dollars 5.1m,
reflecting a combination of expansion costs, seasonal losses at
newly-acquired businesses, the strength of the US dollar, and higher
concentrate pricing in several countries.
Profits from international snack foods rose 7 per cent to Dollars 102.5m,
but international restaurant profits fell 41 per cent to Dollars 23.2m
because of increases in development spending and poor results from
Australia.
Domestic beverage profits rose 15 per cent to Dollars 227.7m through a
combination of volume growth, lower packaging and ingredient costs, and an
favourable adjustment to prior years' acquisition-related reserves.
Domestic snack food profits rose 14 per cent to Dollars 283.9m and domestic
restaurant profits 20 per cent to Dollars 221.4m.
For the year, sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 25bn. Net income was Dollars
1.59bn, compared with Dollars 374.3m last time, but PepsiCo said the
increase would have been 16 per cent without the previous year's charges.
On that basis, earnings per share rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 2.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks call meeting
on rescue deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney's creditor banks will meet today in Paris for a special summit
meeting to map out their strategy for the final stage ofnegotiations over a
financial rescue package for the ailing leisure group.
The banks, which include J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National
Westminster, had originally hoped at the meeting to discuss an investigative
audit of Euro Disney that they have commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy company.
However, KPMG has been unable to finalise its audit allegedly becauseof Euro
Disney's reluctance to release information. It has instead prepared a
preliminary report. The final audit is scheduled for completion in two
weeks.
The banks have asked KPMG to analyse Euro Disney's financial position and
its future requirements to verify information given to them by Disney at a
meetingin November. Banking sources suggest that so far KPMG's findings do
not differ greatly from the Disney figures.
This means that the banks are likely to press for a swift resumption of
negotiations with Disney.
The US group has already tabled proposals to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
(Dollars 3.4bn) debt by raising FFr10bn through a rights issue and
debt-for-equity swap.
However, the banks are keen that Disney should share the burden of the
rescue. They will today discuss plans to reduce its entitlement to royalties
from Euro Disney and possibly to inject capital by purchasing assets. The
banks will also be briefed ontheir legal position by Gide-Loyrette-Nouelle,
their lawyers.
Meanwhile Adam, a French pressure group that represents minority
shareholders, is lobbyingfor the convertible bond holders (who hold FFr4bn
of Euro Disney's debt) to seethe KPMG report and to be represented in the
negotiations.
The talks could be further complicated by continuing sales of Euro Disney
debt on the US second-hand loans market. Midland Bank last month sold a
FFr130m portion of debt for60 per cent of its original value and a second
sale is now nearing completion.
Another sale, planned for last week, collapsed at the eleventh hour
following a dispute over the entitlement to voting rights.

Taiwan may issue bonds overseas denominated in foreign currencies, Reuter
reports from Taipei. The issues could go ahead next year and would be the
first of their kind since 1949.
A finance ministry official said the ministry still needed to discuss the
proposal with the central bank, which has recently acted to curb fund
inflows into Taiwan to reducepressure for appreciation of the Taiwan dollar.
However, the lifting of curbs on fund inflows is seen as inevitable given
Taiwan's hopes of entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this
year, the official said.
Taiwan's foreign debt is less than Dollars 1bn but private Taiwanese
companies have been flockingto issue convertible bonds abroad.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Equity Issues: No change in prospects for
conversion in Taiwan - The government is divided over the pace and scope of
financial liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than four years after Yuen Foong Yu Paper became the first Taiwanese
company to tap the Euromarket in convertible bonds - via a Dollars 100m,
10-year issue - prospects for conversion into equity appear as dim as ever.
This has not dissuaded international investors, keen for any sort of
exposure to Taiwan's fast-growing economy.
So difficult is it to buy into Taiwan'sequity market that even the vaguest
promises of direct access is enough to tempt fund managers.
Neither has it kept Taiwan companies from raising convertible debt.
Since YFY's issue in 1989, local companies have issued Dollars 515m and
SFr210m in 'convertible' Eurobonds. Three Euroconvertible issues were
launched in last month alone. At least 10 other companies have applications
pending.
Last October, Taiwan's central bank agreed to allow the conversion of
convertible bonds issued overseas, provided the cabinet approved the plan.
Themeasure was also subject to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's
revision of regulations related to overseas issuance of corporate bonds.
Analysts say that given the web of controls surrounding foreign investment
in Taiwan's stock market, the subject of convertibility poses a myriad trick
questions for regulators.
To begin with, only foreign institutional investors (FIIs) approved by the
central bank may invest directly in local shares: foreign individuals are
not allowed to buy Taiwan shares. As Euroconvertibles are traded
over-the-counter in the Eurobond market, the central bank has no control
over who owns them.
The central bank's October statement suggested that bonds held by foreign
individuals could be converted into global depository receipts.
However, todate just four Taiwan firms have issued GDRs, certificates listed
on overseas stock exchanges equivalent to shares in the issuing company.
None of the Euroconvertible issuers has done so.
Conversion also comes into conflict with restrictions on foreign ownership
of local shares.
The government imposes an overall ceiling of Dollars 5bn on total foreign
funds which may be brought into the country to invest in Taiwan shares.
There is also a Dollars 200m ceiling per approved FII, a limit of 10 per
cent on total foreign ownership in the shares in issue of a particular stock
and a 5 per cent limit on ownership by any individual FII.
Deep discord within the government over the pace and scope of financial
liberalisation ensures that in spite longstanding promises to loosen
significantly restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan's bourse, in line
with plans to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such measures
are unlikely to happen soon.
Meanwhile, investors can either hold bonds for the fixed return or profit by
trading them. Taiwan share prices are currently viewed as undervalued
relative to other regional equity markets.
For issuers, Euroconvertibles represent cheaper financing than they could
obtain at home. Last month's issues carried coupons of 2 per cent, compared
with rates of around 8 per cent in the domestic market. Taiwan's lack of an
established rating system for corporatedebt has made it difficult for all
but big companies to raise funds locally.
This appears to be a concern for investors in Taiwanese Euroconvertibles, in
spite of the fact that the local companies are largely unknown quantities
abroad.
Even medium-sized companies are considering issuing overseas - especially in
Switzerland, where rates and costs associated with issuance are lowest.
Given the plethora of issues set to enter the Eurobond markets and the
snail-like pace of reform, Taiwan's curious unconvertible convertible bonds
are likely to remain a fixture of the financial landscape for some time to
come.

<TEXT>
MIM, the Australian metals group which is competing with Canada's Metall
Mining for the Bajo de la Alumbrera project in north-west Argentina,
yesterday released further details of its agreement with International Musto
Explorations, the small Canadian group whose main asset is the rich
Argentine copper-gold deposit.
MIM said that, of its proposed USDollars 130m payment to Musto for a50 per
cent interest in the project, Dollars 10m represents repayment of Musto's
investment in to date. The remainding Dollars 120m would cover Musto's
half-share of the costs of putting the mine into production.
Total development costs are put at Dollars 600m, but about Dollars 360m is
expected to come from project finance.
The deal between MIM and Musto comes on the heels of a hostile CDollars
232m(USDollars 175m) bid by Metall Mining, the international arm of
Germany's Metallgesellschaft, for Musto. This, however, is conditional on
Musto not signing a legally-binding joint venture agreement to dispose of a
substantial part of its 100 per cent interest in Alumbrera.

FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chubb premiums continue to rise

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chubb, the US property/casualty insurer, recorded a further advance in
premium income in the final quarter of last year, although after-tax profits
fell on lower investment gains.
The growth in premiums for the year as a whole was driven by a 10 per cent
advance in specialty commercial insurance, while personal and standard
commercial lines grew at a slower pace.
Net income for the latest quarter dropped to Dollars 160.5m, or Dollars
1.80, a share from Dollars 197.5m, or Dollars 2.21, the year before, as
investment gains dropped sharply to Dollars 25.4m from Dollars 77.4m.
Chubb further improved its underlying business, with net premiums up at
Dollars 895m from Dollars 799m the year before. For the year, premiums rose
8 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn, or 12 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn, after a
one-off item.
Lower catastrophe losses contributed to improved underwriting performance
for the quarter. The company's combined loss ratio for the three months was
99.9 per cent, down from104.7 per cent.
For the year, the underwriting results were hit by a Dollars 357.5m
after-tax charge, announced in the third quarter, to cover
asbestos-relatedclaims.
As a result, the combined ratio for the year rose to 114.8 per cent (99 per
cent before the asbestos charge) from 101.1 per cent the year before.
The asbestos charge reduced net income for the year to Dollars 324.2m, or
Dollars 3.69, or Dollars 344.2m before accounting changes, from Dollars
617.1m the year before. This included total post-tax investment gains of
Dollars 151.6m for 1993, up from Dollars 123.6m in 1992.
American General, the consumer finance and life insurance group, recorded a
net loss of Dollars 164m for the last three months of 1993 as it wrote off
Dollars 300m of acquired goodwill on two life insurance subsidiaries it
plans to sell.
The loss, equivalent to 76 cents a share, compares with a profit of Dollars
134m, or62 cents, the year before. Of the group's three divisions,
retirement annuitiesand consumer finance saw increases in their earnings in
the period, to Dollars 37m andDollars 50m respectively, while life insurance
earnings dropped to Dollars 72m from Dollars 82m on lower investment yields
and a higher tax charge.
For the year, net income was Dollars 204m, or 94 cents, down from Dollars
533m, or Dollars 2.45, in 1992.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Profits rich in culture -
A man who exemplifies the Mittelstand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business school academics have found at least 200 ways of defining the
German Mittelstand, the broad swathe of medium-sized, privately-owned
companies which dominate corporate Germany.
Size - in terms of turnover and the number of employees - is the obvious
yardstick but not the best way of defining a Mittelstand company, says
Berthold Leibinger, the 63-year-old chief executive and majority shareholder
in Trumpf, a machine-tools company based in Ditzingen near Stuttgart in
south-west Germany.
Better, the machine-tools entrepreneur contends, is to think in terms of a
philosophy of management, a network of distinct values shared by thousands
of small, medium-sized and large German companies. At the core of this
cluster of values are two qualities: a passionate desire for independence
and a fascination with technology. Coupled together, these qualities lead to
strong emotional ties between the entrepreneur and the products which his
company makes, Leibinger argues.
These values have deep cultural roots, explains Leibinger, the son of an
oriental art-dealer from the small village of Muhlheim-bei-Tuttlingen in the
heart of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
Leibinger cites a law dating back to 1548 which saw to it that family
fortunes in the south-west of Germany had to be divided equally between all
children, including daughters. The very opposite of primogeniture - the
system whereby family wealth was passed from father to eldest son  - the
system of 'realteilung' prevented the accumulation of wealth. Families were
obliged to set up small businesses in order to enhance meagre living
standards. These were the forerunners of some of Germany's most successful
industrial companies.
Baden-Wurttemberg is still known for its 'tuftlers', amateur engineers who
while away winter evenings working in their shops, attempting to solve
apparently unsolvable technical problems.
'Go up to the Schwabische Alb (a range of hills near Stuttgart) and you'll
still find hundreds of these workshops,' says Leibinger. The modern-day
mechanics working away at weekends and evenings in cellars and garages are
the successors of 'tuftlers' such as Robert Bosch or Karl Benz,
Baden-Wurttemberg entrepreneurs whose businesses evolved into some of
Europe's biggest industrial groups.
Leibinger contends that the relationship between the technician and his
invention is far closer than that of the financier investing money into a
business in a dispassionate way in the hope of making a profit.
This distinction, he believes, helps explain the difference between the
nature of Anglo-American capitalism and the German version. In the UK or the
US, the bulk of industrial activity is conducted by stock-market-quoted
companies, financed by profit-oriented investors; by contrast in Germany the
stock-market plays a limited role in the country's economic life.
Even those German companies which are stock-market listed (664 in total
compared with about 3,000 in the UK) tend to be majority-owned by families,
other companies and by financial institutions - with the result that the
management priorities of quoted companies tend to be little different from
those of private ones.
The insulation from the pressure to generate short-term profits is one
factor behind Germany's post-war success, Leibinger argues. It is also a
reason why he is reluctant to bring Trumpf to the stock-market, even though
with turnover of DM620m last year he could easily consider such a move.
Leibinger, who points to his son-in-law (currently production director) as a
potential successor, conforms exactly to his own definition of a
'Mittelstandler'. A practising protestant and a self-confessed 'tuftler', he
comes from a family of surgical instrument makers which has lived in the
same village for generations.
He has 20 patents outstanding for machine-tools and when still at university
he invented the 'copy nibbling' process which became a standard throughout
the industry. The income from this and other inventions helped him raise the
finance to buy out the Trumpf family in 1973.
Under Leibinger's direction, the company grew rapidly to become one of the
world's largest manufacturers of machines for punching, nibbling, bending
and forming sheet-metal. But the growth has, come to a halt: so severe is
the recession afflicting the sector that Trumpf made a loss last year for
the first time in 40 years. The group lost DM48.9m on turnover down 9 per
cent to DM620m in the year to July.
Other companies have fared far worse under the dismal combination of falling
demand and high costs, their problems exacerbated by the strength of the
D-Mark. Critics have looked at sectors of the economy such as the
machine-tool industry and suggested that traditional Mittelstand virtues
have now become a handicap.
They argue that the love of independence has blinded company managers to the
need for strategic mergers and that the obsession with technology helped
Mittelstand companies fall into the trap of making sophisticated products
for their own sake, without taking account of customers' needs.
By implication Leibinger accepts one aspect of this criticism: part of his
response to the recession has been to put a new emphasis on
'value-for-money' manufacturing. 'We are trying to introduce new machines
with the same or improved technical features as the old ones but with a 20
to 25 per cent cost reduction,' he says.
But he rejects the other element of the critique: that Mittelstand companies
need to merge with one another to survive. 'If the German machine-tool
industry consisted of six to eight big conglomerates, rather than hundreds
of independent companies, the impact of the current recession on the labour
market would be far worse than it has been,' Leibinger says, true to his
deeply-rooted Mittelstandler values. 'Independent family-owned businesses
add stability to the business community, especially in difficult times.'

Russia's privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the only leading
liberal left in the Moscow cabinet, yesterday said he was sure he could
defend reform against opponents in and outside the government, Reuter
reports from Davos.
But he cautioned that the drive to build a stable market economy would be
wrecked unless inflation was brought firmly under control. He also expressed
regret that the central bank chief, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, had not been
sacked. 'I will fight against any attempt to change the essence of the
reforms in Russia,' he told a news conference at the annual Davos gathering
of business and political leaders. 'I have no doubt we will be able to
finish our privatisation programme by June 30.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / IMF in Moscow visit: Western delegation fails to raise loan
hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A mission from the International Monetary Fund flew into Moscow yesterday
amid fading prospects of quickly unblocking a new Dollars 1.5bn loan and of
forging a new type of IMF support package for Russia.
Despite announcing that the new government planned to use 'non-monetary'
methods to fight inflation, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, has still talked of continuing market reform and of expecting
western financial support for his efforts. He was expected, however, to be
out of Moscow for most of this week.
'It's very difficult to tell what will happen, whether the delegation will
spend most of its time visiting museums or whether we will find a new
language of mutual understanding,' said one western official.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the new economics minister, has called on the IMF to
help the government draw up a budget for 1994, and to help it design
industrial and social security policies.
The IMF has been berated by Professor Jeffrey Sachs for not providing enough
money when the radical reformers he used to advise were still in power. It
is now anxious to 'show the flag' so that it is not accused of indifference
and a lack of understanding of Russian problems. However, it has clearly
left its most powerful shareholders - the world's seven richest nations who
make up the G7 - to decide whether it should abandon demands for progress on
Russia's inflation and budget deficits as a condition for financial support.
'What will we give Russia in March if we give the Dollars 1.5bn now?' asked
a western official, referring to the second tranche of a special loan
designed to help countries move from communism to capitalism - which Mr
Chernomyrdin wanted to receive this month.
'We seem to have to give Russia money periodically. It's like breathing. Now
they're going to say they have to pay the bills left behind by Gaidar and
Fyodorov (the radicals attacked for not honouring spending commitments made
by the state in order to keep down inflation),' he said.
'The injection of money into the economy will create a sense of normalcy but
then there will be new inflation and they will tighten up again. It depends
on how deeply they breathe. If they are very careful, the same person who
does the expiring will also do the inspiring.'
But the western official added that the IMF and the G7 seemed happy to agree
on a 'wait and see approach' until the new government's reform policies
became clearer.
He pointed out that the G7 was expected to discuss Russia in detail at the
end of February.

US-funded Radio Free Europe yesterday started a news service to former
Yugoslavia intended to counter what it called ethnic hatred and biased
reporting in the state-run local media, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The hour-long daily broadcasts would try to provide balanced news about
former Yugoslavia and encourage a public discussion of peace and
reconciliation, an RFE spokeswoman said.
Munich-based RFE and its sister station Radio Liberty have broadcast to
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union since the early 1950s but never
had a service for the Yugoslav federation.

Slovenia and Croatia, the ex-Yugoslav neighbours at loggerheads over issues
ranging from borders to banking, look set to establish normal ties, Reuter
reports from Davos. Slovenia's prime minister, Mr Janez Drnovsek, said
yesterday: 'We will sign a trade agreement next week with Croatia. It seems
we will normalise relations.'
Mr Drnovsek, in Davos for the World Economic Forum of business and political
leaders, had talks last week with his Croatian counterpart, Mr Nikica
Valentic, in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital. These covered a jointly-owned
nuclear power station in Slovenian Krsko, a dispute about the operations of
Slovenia's biggest bank in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, and disagreements
about the common border.
Mr Drnovsek said the border disputes had not been settled and would have to
be examined by an inter-state commission. But there were signs of a
resolution to the other issues.

FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in international conglomerate BTR rose to 22m, making it the third
most active trade of the day, on a combination of switching between the
ordinary shares and the warrants, and a broker's recommendation.
The shares climbed 19 to 390p, with Salomon Brothers said to have carried
out much of the switching during the session. Sentiment was further boosted
by a recommendation from Smith New Court. Analysts at Smith said: 'The stock
has underperformed, it has become cheaply rated, the company is well run, it
is a diverse international, and looks like a good opportunity to us.'
The recommendation from Smith followed a similar move from UBS at the end of
last week. Suggestions in the market that broker Colin Stewart, a well known
bear of the stock, had turned more positive were denied.
The fall-out from J. Sainsbury's trading statement at the end of last week
settled on the supermarket sector's suppliers and saw both Unigate and the
paper and packaging group Bowater suffer.
There is a belief that suppliers, particularly those who provide 'own-label'
products, will come under pressure from the supermarket chain following its
statement that margins were being squeezed by the actions of cut-price
retailers.
Bowater was further affected by a sell note from agency broker James Capel.
The shares fell 15 to 487p, while Unigate slipped 6 1/2 to 386p. Sainsbury
lost a further 9 to 384p.
Wellcome shares tumbled 13 to 662p as the company confirmed Sunday newspaper
reports that sales of its Aids drug Retrovir had fallen by about 25 per cent
following reaction to a study into the effectiveness of the drug on some HIV
patients.
Christian Salvesen, the business and food services group, dropped 62 to
314p, making it the day's biggest retreat, after the company issued a
profits warning saying this year's profits would be below last year's Pounds
74.8m.
Conglomerate Trafalgar House gained 5 at 109p in strong volume of 13m shares
after announcing a 91.5 per cent take-up of its Pounds 355m convertible
preference rights issue. The group said the rump of the issue is to be
auctioned at a minimum tender price of 100p a share.
The strong market trend helped English China Clays recover from an earlier
retreat that followed cautious comments from Hoare Govett. The shares closed
3 ahead at 505p.
Airports operator BAA was in demand ahead of third-quarter figures due today
and the shares put on 31 at 1081p on volume of 1.1m.
Oil major BP benefited from encouraging research from two securities houses.
Following publication of a review of the sector last week, Lehman Brothers
upgraded its recommendation to 'outperform' from 'underperform'. The house
argues that investors are taking a more long term view on stock valuation
and, reaching out to 1998, BP offers stronger dividend growth than its UK
rival Shell Transport.
Meanwhile, NatWest Securities published a hefty overview which concluded
that BP will produce average annual earnings growth of 24 per cent over the
next five years. BP shares rose 11 1/2 to 378 1/2 p, while Shell gained 9 at
734p.
BT made good progress as Hoare Govett turned a trading buyer of the stock.
The fully-paid shares put on 7 at 474 1/2 p in turnover of 4.5m, with
dealers attributing some of the rise to weekend media reports of the
company's cable video plans.
Eleswhere, Vodafone firmed 3 1/2 to 585 1/2 p ahead of new subscriber
figures due today.
Stores stocks were a big beneficiary of the new account, with rises being
seen across a wide spectrum.
Among the majors, Marks and Spencer climbed 7 1/2 to 444p, Kingfisher 11 to
639p, Boots 9 1/2 to 552 1/2 p and GUS 16 to 604p. Dixons slipped 2 to 215p
as a weekend press report highlighted continued worries over extended
warranties. Regional retailer Upton and Southern edged up to 4 1/2 p on talk
of an imminent deal.
Positive comments accompanying fourth-quarter figures from Xerox Corporation
in the US helped Rank Organisation shares rise 24 to a record 1098p. The two
companies' joint venture, Rank Xerox, contributes around half of the UK
group's pre-tax profits.
The buying pressure seen on Friday in Forte, following meetings in the City,
continued and the shares added 4 at 269 1/2 p. Analysts said that Forte was
confident of a successful outcome to its bid for the Ciga hotel group in
Italy within the next two weeks.
The day's biggest volume was recorded in British Steel, which saw 36m shares
traded as overseas buying continued in the stock. The shares improved 4 to
143p.
Engineering group Vickers eased 6 to 178p after suggestions that BMW may buy
its Rolls-Royce Motor Car subsidiary appeared to be dashed by BMW's decision
to buy Rover.
The Rover deal cheered the motor distributors and Lex Service jumped 20 to
549p, while Lookers moved 19 ahead to 259p.

FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares soar on BAe deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market spotlight inevitably fell on British Aerospace yesterday, with
the surprise announcement that the company is to sell its 80 per cent stake
in Rover cars to German group BMW.
BAe shares initially jumped 30 to 474p as dealers appreciated the Pounds
800m cash boost to the accounts. The stock shot further ahead to end 55 up
at 499p on heavy trading of 18m shares after the realisation that the deal
included Pounds 200m of debt and the freeing off of Pounds 700m of balance
sheet borrowing for BAe.
Analysts moved quickly to upgrade current year profits expectations, ahead
of BAe's results scheduled for later this month.
With the range having been around Pounds 170m, James Capel was said to be
now forecasting Pounds 189m, while Hoare Govett, BAe's broker, was reported
to be predicting Pounds 180m. At the top end of the range, Smith New Court
raised its estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 210m, while Strauss Turnbull is
predicting Pounds 250m.
Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said the sale 'removes the
financial worries on reorganisation and gives the company scope to tackle
the problems in the turbo props and regional jets'.
There was talk that Arlington, the group's property division, may also be
put up for sale. Other speculation included the resumption of interest from
GEC in BAe. GEC added 3 1/2 at 340p.

FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong international markets, combined with renewed hopes of a cut in
interest rates in the UK, boosted derivatives and pushed the March Footsie
future above 3,500, writes Joel Kibazo.
On the first day of the new equity account the March contract on the FT-SE
100 opened at 3,477. But for a brief retreat which saw the contract dip to
3,475 in the first half-hour of trading, there was strong upward momentum
for most of the session, with the big US houses making the running.
Traders reflected on the overnight strength of the Tokyo market and the US
market later in the day, but renewed talk on interest rates was also heard,
bringing a large premium to March for most of the day.
The advance in the market gave dealers the opportunity to arbitrage
positions between the cash and the futures market. Further strength in the
afternoon ensured that March broke through the 3,500 mark to finish at 3,502
in after-hours' dealing, around 18 points above its estimated fair value,
which has fallen to zero this account. However, volume, at 8,994 lots, was
below average.
Traded options were active but the final volume of 47,110 was down from
Friday's end of the account figure of 54,074 lots. Among the Index options,
the FT-SE 100 option traded 11,984 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE 100
option attracted business of 4,854 lots.
HSBC was the most active stock option with a total of 3,200 trades. This was
followed by Hillsdown at 3,000 contracts. J. Sainsbury, BTR, and British
Aerospace were also actively traded.

FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 races ahead to all-time
closing high - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of sharply higher international stock markets, increased hopes
of UK interest rate cuts, and news of a big corporate deal, saw London share
prices race ahead to record levels yesterday. And there were strong
indications from traders that this morning could see the FT-SE 100 Index
penetrate the 3,500 level.
At the close of one of the busiest trading sessions in the past few weeks,
the FT-SE 100 stood 44.4 higher at a peak 3,491.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
underperformed the senior FT-SE 100, however, registering an 18.5 gain at
4,084.3, as the big institutions shifted their focus to the market's more
liquid heavyweight stocks.
The London market was in a confident mood from the outset of trading, as
Wall Street's move to an historic high last Friday and the Tokyo market's
near 8 per cent leap yesterday set the scene for a buoyant opening. European
stock markets advanced strongly as dealers pinned their hopes on a German
interest rate cut on Thursday when the Bundesbank council meets.
And news that BMW, the German car manufacturer, is buying British
Aerospace's Rover car company, for Pounds 800m in cash, put the seal on a
strong opening to the London stock market.
Helping to fuel the early push by share prices were the MO money supply
figures, which came in below market expectations and reinforced a growing
market view that weak money supply numbers would increase the chances of an
early reduction in UK interest rates. The market got very excited about
possible rate cuts in the UK following the monthly monetary policy meeting
between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Ken
Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer.
There was some scepticism, however. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull
described the market's enthusiasm for the rate cut story as a 'dangerous
argument', and highlighted the risks of a big setback.
Opening around 10 points ahead, the FT-SE 100 drove forward throughout the
day, eventually settling at an all-time closing peak. The FT-SE 100's
intraday record high is 3,496.1, registered on January 21.
Volume in the market was a hefty 992.8m shares and was boosted by a
medium-sized trading programme executed in the morning session and some
hectic business said to have been triggered by a number of options expiries.
These were said to have represented expiries of various OTC instruments,
large tailor-made options featuring many FT-SE 100 stocks. Significantly,
the Footsie bounded ahead after the options market closed and as Wall Street
moved up to post a 30-point advance on the Dow Industrial Average.
A senior marketmaker at one of the big UK securities houses noted the
absence of any real selling pressure in London. Mr Richard Jeffrey, market
strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, described the underlying
mood in London as 'very confident', and said it would take 'a brave investor
to take a contrary view'. He added that the biggest threat was likely to
come from the political arena.
There were some big casualties in the market, with Wellcome, the drugs
group, damaged by adverse comment on its Aids drug, and Christian Salvesen,
the transport to food company, savaged after a profits warning. Royal
Insurance delivered another good performance amid hints of renewed big
buying via the inter-dealer broker system.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mr Greenspan helps lift Dow
to new heights
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks again surged into record territory yesterday after remarks by the
Federal Reserve Board chairman reassured investors wary of inflation, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 32.93 ahead at 3,978.36, a third
consecutive all-time high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 2.91 at 481.61,
while the American SE composite climbed 2.46 to 485.68 and the Nasdaq
composite advanced 3.94 to 800.47, surpassing the 800 mark for the first
time. Volume on the New York SE was heavy, with 322.9m shares changing
hands.
Stocks had several developments working in their favour. The powerful
advance staged by the Nikkei index overnight, after passage of a Japanese
political reform package, set an upbeat tone for the session's opening.
The positive sentiment was reinforced by Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman,
who told a congressional committee that the central bank was committed to
stamping out inflationary pressures in the economy.
The vigilant tone of his remarks brought firmer prices to longer-dated US
Treasury bonds, which are particularly sensitive to inflation. In the
afternoon, however, the 30-year benchmark bond retraced its gains as
commodity prices rebounded, and ended the session in negative ground.
Higher commodity prices proved to be a favourable development for some
stocks. An agreement by the world's leading aluminium-producing countries to
cut global production gave a strong lift to the share prices of US suppliers
of the basic metal.
Alcoa, a component of the Dow Industrial index, surged Dollars 2 7/8 to
Dollars 79 1/8 , a 52-week high. Reynolds climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
53 3/8 , Alcan Aluminum Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 and Phelps Dodge
Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 1/4 .
The market received at least one piece of unwelcome news. The Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago revealed a modest downturn in its January
index of economic activity, possibly a preview of today's national survey.
In spite of the indication of a slowdown, stocks closely linked to broad
economic trends continued to gather strength. Investors showed particular
interest in automobile issues. General Motors rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
61 3/8 , Ford Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 67 and Chrysler Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 61 1/2 .
Xerox impressed the market with better than expected earnings from its core
processing activities. The stock jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 98 1/8 ,
well above its previous 52-week high of Dollars 93 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto surged in active dealings, in line with large increases on other
major world stock markets. The TSE 300 index ended 62.6 up at 4,554.8, some
eight points shy of the record high of 4,562.9 set on January 19.
Rises led declines by 507 to 339 after volume of 79.6m shares valued at
CDollars 1.1bn. Mining and conglomerates led the advance, jumping 2.93 and
2.74 per cent respectively. Golds climbed 2.32 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): BMW in the lead as automotive
stocks climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good day for several car stocks took in the Rover/BMW deal, bullishness in
France after weekend measures to boost consumption, specific hopes for Fiat
in 1994 and a new high in Volvo, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, excited by interest rate hopes and the BMW/Rover deal, saw the
Dax index rise 43.98 to 2,177.45 on the session and threaten 2,200 in the
post bourse, closing another 15.15 higher at 2,192.60.
In financials, Allianz rose DM72 to DM2,829 on talk of US buying and, in a
generally lucrative banking sector, Bavernverein emerged from its rights
issue complications with a rise of DM23.50, or 4.5 per cent to DM546.
These gains were dwarfed by BMW's DM56.50, or 8.3 per cent rise to DM739.50,
with a further climb to DM748 after hours. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf said that BMW had paid a relatively keen price for a
deal which nearly doubles its car production capacity.
Aluminium production cuts led to above-average markups in Degussa, DM16.80
higher at DM488.80, and Thyssen, DM7.40 better at DM261.90. Mr Greven said
that the implications of the news had not been thought through and that
Viag, with big production capacity in the metal, looked the prime
beneficiary; Viag shares rose DM10.50 to DM485.50.
PARIS swept through its previous record close as the market took heart from
the government's announcement at the weekend of measures to boost the
economy. The CAC-40 index closed 21.19 ahead at 2,334.36 as turnover hit
FFr6.5bn.
Turnover in the market has been consistently high over January - averaging
about FFr5bn a day - driven largely by inflows of foreign money.
The car sector outperformed the market, helped by proposals outlined by
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Sunday to assist new car sales. Peugeot,
up FFr19 or 2 per cent to FFr874, also said that it would issue ADR's in the
US.
MILAN continued to power ahead, in the lull after recent political storms.
The Comit index rose 20.28 or 3.2 per cent to a third consecutive high of
662.11. Turnover swelled to a record L1,420bn: at one stage, screen based
trading was halted when the system became overloaded.
Fiat surged L242 or 5.3 per cent to L4,843 as the market awaited the annual
letter to shareholders from the chairman, Mr Giovanni Agnelli. UBS, an
aggressive buyer, forecast that the group's competitive position was set to
improve strongly, following the lira devaluation and the introduction of new
models.
Sip, a recent underperformer, added L362 or 9.1 per cent to L4,353, helped
by a government ruling that the winner of the country's second cellular
telephone licence would have to use Sip's ground-based network.
AMSTERDAM's AEX index closed 8.93 or 2 per cent higher at 438.71. A notable
exception to the positive trend was Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, which
slipped 80 cents to Fl 23.90 following the resignation of the chairman.
While the news was something of a surprise to the market, some analysts
commented that in the long term it could benefit the troubled group as it
wrestles with a rationalisation programme.
Among financials, ING added Fl 2.50 to Fl 90.30 as the insurer improved
after a recent period of underperformance.
Some of the day's biggest gains were recorded by Elsevier, up Fl 5.80 at Fl
193.80 and Nedlloyd, Fl 4.50 higher at Fl 72.60. Polygram added Fl 2.50 to
Fl 81.70 as it announced a new joint venture in the US.
ZURICH finished at a fifth consecutive all time high, amid strong demand for
Nestle and the banking sector which is expected to report sparkling results
in the coming month. The SMI index added 37.7 or 1.2 per cent to 3,178.4.
Nestle added SFr21 to SFr1,426 while among the banks, CS Holding rose SFr13
to SFr754.
Roche began quietly but the certificates later put on SFr40 to SFr7,140
after news that the US Food and Drug Administration had authorised third
phase clinical trials of a new anti-Aids treatment.
MADRID hit another new high, the general index putting on 15.97 to 358.31 as
it waited for Banesto to resume trading today. STOCKHOLM's domestic and
foreign supporters took the Affarsvarlden General index 29.3 or 1.9 per cent
higher to a new peak of 1,603.9. Volvo B shares rose SKr13 to SKr695 amid
expectations of strong US sales in January.
ISTANBUL rose by more than 8 per cent as investors were encouraged by
reports that the capital markets board was to allow mutual funds, which keep
at least 25 per cent of their portfolio in stocks, to trade on the stock
exchange.
The composite index closed up 1,542.86 at 20,104.84 while turnover dipped to
TL1,640bn after Friday's TL2,150bn.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei powers 7.8% ahead
after reform agreement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices soared on the passage of the political reform bills through
parliament over the weekend, and the Nikkei average jumped 7.8 per cent,
rising above 20,000 for the first time in three months, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 1,471.24, the third largest gain on record, to finish at the
day's peak of 20,229.12. The index opened at the day's low of 18,790.78,
with many shares failing to trade until the afternoon session because of a
flood of buying orders from overseas and domestic investors.
The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 101.40 to 1,629.22, its
fifth biggest single day's rise. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved
ahead 18.08 to 1,373.12 as strategists said that this year's rally had much
further to go.
Investors were cheered by prospects of the imminent announcement of an
economic stimulus package and an income tax cut now that the government has
political reform out of the way. The announcement of a package of tax cuts
and fiscal stimulus, estimated at around Y13,000bn is expected on Thursday.
Volume was 800m shares, against 237m, with foreign and domestic individual
investors actively buying shares. Almost all listed issues posted gains,
with 1,109 advances, three declines and seven unchanged.
A sharp fall in the bond market also supported sentiment, raising hopes that
it would cause a shift in funds to equities. The yield on the No 157 10-year
benchmark rose 5 basis points to 3.54 per cent, the highest since last
November.
Some domestic and foreign brokers believe that yesterday was a turning point
for the market and the country's economy, but others have doubts. Many
investors are still wary of corporate profit-taking ahead of the March book
closing, and point out that buying by foreigners, who have been the main
driving force for the market since the start of the year, has started to
slow down.
'Economic fundamentals have not drastically changed,' said Mr Jason James,
strategist at James Capel, adding that he had not revised his year-end
target of 22,000 for the Nikkei.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained by its day's limit of Y100,000 to
Y978,000, while East Japan Railway climbed Y38,000 to Y516,000. Brokers were
also supported, with Nomura adding Y250 at Y2,320.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 1,255.67 to 21,864.83 in volume of 41.8m
shares.
Roundup
The region did not emulate Tokyo, but its equity markets were mostly on the
upgrade.
AUSTRALIA set a record high, helped mainly by overseas news. The All
Ordinaries index rose 50.9, or 2.25 per cent, to 2,310.8 in ADollars 1.0bn
turnover.
One dealer said the March share price index futures contract contributed to
the surge, with the contract jumping 44 to 2,328.0 after an intraday high of
2,346.0.
Coles Myer appreciated 12 cents to ADollars 5.47 after announcing a 2.9 per
cent rise in half-year sales to ADollars 8.16bn.
HONG KONG overcame some midsession selling, prompted by worries about
tougher mortgage policies, to finish almost 1 per cent higher. The Hang Seng
index added 109.19 at 11,487.02 in prelim-inary turnover down from HKDollars
8.57bn to HKDollars 6.28bn.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and Hang Seng Bank said late on Friday that
they would lower the amount of financing available for mortgages and
increase the lending rate for flats worth more than HKDollars 5m. HSBC
advanced HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 115 and its Hang Seng unit climbed
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 75.50 amid expectations of positive corporate
results in the banking sector.
SINGAPORE continued to recover from the sharp losses experienced in the
second week of January, on selective domestic and European institutional
demand. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 39.03, or 1.7 per cent, to
2,339.10. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher, led by further institutional buying of
selected blue chips. The composite index gained 16.93, or 1.6 per cent, at
1,106.99, but trading was subdued ahead of a market holiday today.
MANILA ended lower as investors sold heavily to cut losses, although the
fall was cushioned by renewed interest in Manila Electric and its
affiliates, which are expected to benefit from a fuel and electricity price
rise. The composite index fell 54.94, or 1.9 per cent, to 2,874.56. Manila
Electric 'B' put on 15 pesos at 445 pesos.
KARACHI resumed its uptrend after a three-day correction, on support from
local institutions and renewed jobbers' interest. The KSE 100 index rose
18.78 to 2,244.78.
SHANGHAI's 'B' share index drifted back on a disappointing debut by Shanghai
Shangling Electric Appliances, the first 'B' share not to show a gain on its
issue price on the first day of trading.
The 'B' index fell 4.21 to 81.07 in volume of 15m shares. Shanghai Shangling
opened at 78 US cents, but closed at its issue price of 75 US cents.
NEW ZEALAND advanced 2.5 per cent, led by a 6.5 per cent gain in Telecom, up
30 cents at NZDollars 4.90. The NZSE-40 index rose 59.64 to 2,397.92 in
turnover of NZDollars 78m.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: London signposts high hopes for Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations and events have moved out of alignment in Japan, but recently
international investors have had a chance to get ahead of the game.
For example, last Friday the London ISE/Nikkei 50 index of Japanese stocks
rose 3.3 per cent after a drop on the week in Tokyo's domestic equity
market. UK-based investors were able to move on news of the government's
deal on political reform, signposting the exceptional gains in Tokyo
yesterday.
A week earlier the situation was reversed, Tokyo's Nikkei index taking a
Monday fall of 4.9 per cent after a bullish week in the domestic market was
followed by the rejection of the government's reform bill in the upper
house. Again, London was able to signal the drop in Friday trading.
Last week, Mr Nicholas Knight and Ms Allison Southey, Nomura's global
strategy team, told investors not to panic, saying the Monday fall had
provided a 'poten-tially brief' window of opportunity and that the Nikkei, a
little above 18,000 at the time, could push through 24,000 in 1994.
Yesterday, they put their target in a bracket between 24,000 - 'and the 20
per cent possibility that the market might go straight to 28,000'.
In Europe, the strategists last week were underweighting Germany, expecting
that it would produce a positive capital return this year but that there
would be more to go for elsewhere. Mr Oliver Kamm, James Capel's European
strategist, liked France, Sweden and Spain in particular.
In the event, the European markets which moved most were Spain and Italy,
the latter leading the Continental pack with a rise of 5.9 per cent on the
week. Merrill Lynch's latest European equity monitor picks out two senior
European bourses, Milan, in Italy, and Stockholm, in Sweden, which are
expected to receive huge earnings boosts from devaluation in 1994 and 1995.
Italy's new alliance in the political centre has boosted market sentiment
further, writes UBS Global Research, the volume of trading hitting record
highs, with the greatest interest in industrial stocks.
Spain set all-time peaks last week due to a number of factors, says the
Swiss group. The unexpected cut in the intervention rate, the strength of
the peseta and further declines in bond yields contributed to the rally, but
it was the excellent performance of bank shares that really pushed the
market ahead in big turnover.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Yen rises against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen yesterday gained ground on the back of a strong surge in Japanese
equity markets following the passage over the weekend of a compromise
package of political reforms, writes Philip Gawith.
With the political impasse of recent weeks now removed, the Japanese
government is expected by the end of the week to announce a large fiscal
stimulus of Y11-15trillion (million million). Anticipation of the benefits
of this package caused the Nikkei to rise nearly 8 per cent, with the
benefits spilling over into a stronger yen.
The state of US-Japanese trade talks overshadowed the appearance of Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress yesterday.
The yen closed at Y109.005 to the dollar in London, up about  1/2 yen. It
finished in New York at Y108.55. Although the dominant view in the market is
that the large fiscal package will be good for the Japanese economy, many
observers believe the implications for the currency are less obvious.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said the
fiscal package could be a 'double-edged sword'. On the one hand, it will be
good for the Nikkei, and hence for the yen. On the other, it should diminish
any inclination on the part of the US to talk up the yen as a means of
trying to curb the trade gap between the two countries.
Analysts said there was quite a lot of positive market sentiment towards the
yen. This creates the ironic situation that only now, when the US
administration has less reason to talk up the yen, has the market decided to
move the Japanese currency higher.
Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, said two
other seasonal factors lent strength to the yen: the large current account
surpluses which normally occur in February and March; and the substantial
capital repatriation which, for the past four years, has tended to take
place at this time.
He predicts that when these factors disappear in April/May the yen will
weaken and this will be a truer measure of the currency's position.
With the political reforms now passed, the focus has turned to the fiscal
package and trade talks. 'The reason Mr Hosokawa was so desperate to get the
package through was the trade talks' said Mr Hawkins. 'There would have been
a lot of flak if he had gone to the talks without an economic package to
show.'
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said the reform package would have a
'very positive' impact on US trade with Japan.
The importance the US attaches to the trade issue was illustrated when
President Clinton yesterday dispatched US trade representative Mr Mickey
Kantor to Japan in an effort to hasten progress in the framework trade
talks.
Mr Greenspan's testimony yesterday had a mixed effect on the dollar. His
observations that he considered real interest rates to be abnormally low,
implying a likely tightening of policy, caused the currency to rise
initially.
When it became clear, however, that no early rate increase was imminent, the
dollar lost ground. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase
Manhattan, said the message of Mr Greenspan's appearance was that, although
the Fed 'has its finger on the trigger' to raise rates, inflation is the key
indicator being watched and recent data show it is currently well contained.
Mr Gunner said sentiment towards the dollar was 'pretty sour now'. Another
observer noted: 'If I was a dollar bull I would be worried now.' Mr Gunner
said that from a technical perspective the dollar had reached a point where
investors were saying that, if it was unable to move higher on good news,
then it had to move lower. Accordingly, the currency was being sold.
After rising above DM1.7440 during the afternoon, the dollar slipped to
DM1.7360 by the evening. Mr Gunner said the dollar had 'hit a brick wall'
and needed something beyond the string of recent strong data to take it
higher. It ended in New York at DM1.7341.
Sterling had a quiet day, underpinned by expectations of a possible German
rate cut later this week. There was little reaction to the release of M0
money supply figures, which rose a lower than expected 5.3 per cent in the
year to January. The pound finished in London at DM2.6145, nearly two
pfennigs up from Friday's close of DM2.5971.
Analysts said the pound was trading surprisingly well considering the
political pressure the government was under. One observer commented: 'It is
almost as if the market is trying to say the quicker we get rid of John
Major, the better.' A different gloss on the political angle is that
international investors are unconcerned by the current squabbles.
The Belgian franc breached its central ERM rate of BFr20.6255 to the D-Mark
in a positive reaction to rate cuts announced earlier. Mr Hawkins said the
currency's response to the rate cut confirmed the view that, 'at the moment,
investors see interest rate cuts within the EMS as being bullish for growth
and for the currency.'
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 295m of late
liquidity at unspecified rates yesterday. This took total assistance for the
day to Pounds 669m, compared with its final estimate of an Pounds 800m
liquidity shortage.

widened to include companies in Australasia and North America as well as
Africa - the previous index, which will be published for at least another
year, was based entirely on South African stocks. The present 34
constituents of the index account for about 53 per cent of western gold
output. There is no set number of constituents and the eligibility of each
company will be reviewed four times a year. The Mining Journal is helping
with monitoring.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers' Viewpoint): Subsidised
salmon puts Scots on the rocks - Efficient sea loch producers cannot compete
with cut-price Norwegian supplies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Flying conditions were near perfect. A few high cumulus clouds skittered
across a blue sky, occasionally obscuring the sun. While stags and hinds
grazing on tufts of ground vegetation protruding above snow-covered high
moors glanced incuriously up at the helicopter as we passed over. White
mountain hares, almost invisible in their pure white environment, frolicked
beneath us. Flocks of sheep dotted the lower hills as they searched for
sustenance among the heather.
It would have been all too easy just to sit back and enjoy the view. But
this was strictly business. I was flying to western Scotland on my way to
look at the Atlantic salmon farming industry; controlled mainly by a small
number of big businesses but which employs, directly or indirectly, some
6,000 people.
As the helicopter came into land beside a sea loch on the east coast of the
Isle of Skye I saw a bank of steel cages moored a hundred or so metres from
the shore. Each 16m-square cage, I was told, contained 14,000 salmon and as
I watched some of the ten men who worked at the salmon farm scattered
pellets of high protein feed across the water. As each scoopful hit the
surface the water boiled briefly as the shiny, hungry fish took as many
pellets as possible before they sank towards the bottom.
Few if any pellets are wasted, I was assured. Indeed the salmon have an
incredible conversion rate, of feed into meat, which can be better than one
to one - a ratio which is, of course, helped by the fact that the fish also
ingest water.
There could be little doubt that this was an efficient industry conducted
among some of the most spectacular scenery in Britain. But it was not happy
one. For although the 90 or so Atlantic salmon farmers in Scotland,
operating between them some 250 sites, claim to have a significant lead over
their competitors in terms of production efficiency and costs, they cannot,
they say, compete with the dumping of salmon at prices well below the cost
of anybody's production.
The guilty party is Norway, where the 600 or so salmon farming companies
have virtually doubled their production to about 220,000 tonnes a year since
1989, without any regard to the level of demand. Scottish production over
the same period has also increased, but by a more modest 25 per cent to
about 50,000 tonnes. Norway's expansion, the Scottish farmers allege, has
been subsidised by the Norwegian government and by the writing off of bank
debt to the tune of some Pounds 150m.
Meanwhile, and this is the real problem, excessive supplies have caused the
price of salmon on European wholesale markets virtually to halve over four
years and are now causing the UK salmon farming industry to lose about
Pounds 1m of revenue a week.
Needless to say the Scottish Salmon Farmers' Organisation has made
representations to the European Union and the British government. These
resulted last November in the introduction of a minimum import price for
salmon coming into the EU. But at only Pounds 2.64 a kilogram it was,
Scottish salmon farmers say, still well below the cost of production.
Furthermore, by setting such a low minimum import price the EU dragged down
the price in France, previously a lucrative market, to that level.
There have been recent debates on the crisis in both UK houses of
parliament, so far without much effect. Salmon farmers are beginning to
wonder if government reluctance to help has anything to do with the fact
that there are few Conservative MPs in Scotland and none in the areas where
salmon farms are situated.
Meanwhile the salmon industry itself has come up with a proposal to try to
deal with the overproduction - a proposal which, it is claimed, has the
blessing of the European Commission. If approved by all parties, it would
operate through the recently-formed European Salmon Industry Forum, which
would appointed consultants to advise on the appropriate number of young
salmon (smolts) that should be 'put to sea' - that is, into the loch cages
for feeding and finishing each year.
Each producing country would form a producers' organisation whose job it
would be to ensure that its members followed the ruling to expand or
contract production and to police the scheme by appointing and funding
inspectors. Even if an individual salmon farmer did not join he could still
be subject to the ruling through an EC-approved device entitled 'extension
of discipline'.
Clearly it would be vital that all Atlantic-farmed salmon producing
countries participated and informed opinion suggests that Norway would join
the scheme. For the moment, however, the UK government seems reluctant to
give the go ahead for something that would cost it nothing but could bring
some stability to a high risk industry and save the jobs of thousands of
people who have few other employment opportunities.
Scottish salmon farmers cannot understand the reason why.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Confidence grows in plan for
aluminium output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was growing confidence in the aluminium industry yesterday that output
cuts of about 1.5m tonnes, representing 10 per cent of global production,
were achievable following the unprecedented international trade deal agreed
at the weekend between the world's leading aluminium-producing countries.
Two European aluminium producers, Hoogovens of the Netherlands and Norsk
Hydro of Norway, yesterday indicated they were prepared to make cuts to
bring the market back into balance. In the US, Southwire said it would
immediately cut by 10 per cent output at its 170,000-tonnes-a-year
Hawesville smelter in Kentucky.
Scepticism about the potential success of the agreement voiced by some
analysts was reflected on the London Metal Exchange where the price of
aluminium for delivery in three months slipped by Dollars 4.25 a tonne to
Dollars 1,233.25. However, aluminium prices already had perked up at the
prospect of a deal and last week reached the best levels for 6 1/2 months.
The price has risen about 12 per cent in January to stand 21 per cent above
the eight-year lows touched in 1993.
Mr Stewart Spector, who produces the Spector Report on the industry, said he
believed producers would make cuts because it was the industry that had
pleaded with governments to negotiate to stem the rising tide of aluminium
from Russia. 'They will simply be doing what they should have done before,
or what the market would force them to do it they do not make more cuts,' he
said. Mr Spector estimated that a cut to global supply of 1.5m tonnes would
bring the market back into balance within a year.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at the GNI international trade house, also
pointed out in his latest metals monthly that the deal would need to hold
for only one year for it to make a substantial impact 'and two years to
place the market in a very healthy state for the rest of the decade'.
However, if the deal broke down 'the market will not see a price revival
until the end of the century'.
Various aspects of the deal, enshrined in a 'memorandum of understanding,'
agreed by trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the European Union,
Norway, Russia and the US, became clearer yesterday. Among the main points
are:
Russia will cut its output by 300,000 tonnes in the next three months and by
further 200,000 tonnes in the following three months. Delegates said the
two-tranches approach would enable the Russians to make sure that their
initial cuts were being matched by western producers before moving on to
deeper ones.
There is no mention in the memorandum of specific targets for individual
western countries because of anti-trust problems. Neither is there a global
target mentioned, but the trade delegates agreed at previous meeting that
cuts of 1.5m to 2m tonnes were necessary.
Cuts dating back to November last year, after the first contacts between the
trade delegates, count towards the global total. Delegates pointed out this
would enable Reynolds Metals of the US and Alcan of Canada, which are in the
process of implementing cuts totalling about 250,000 tonnes, to claim they
have already made contributions.
The cuts should last no longer than two years.
It says unilateral trade measures would be inconsistent with the agreement.
Delegates suggested that this indicates the EU will drop its restrictions on
aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, first imposed
last August to 'safeguard' the European industry, when they end on February
28 and that the US industry would not press claims that the Russians have
been dumping the metal in their market.
There is nothing specific offered in financial assistance from the west for
the Russian industry but the western nations have indicated that they will
help the Russians implement their reconstruction plan. Help from the EU will
be provided from the TACES (Technical Assistance to the CIS) programme,
which is spending about 500,000 Ecus a year.
Production cuts will be monitored by the International Primary Aluminium
Institute, a London-based data collecting organisation, to which the Russian
smelters will now start providing information. Two Russian officials will
meet the IPAI secretariat on February 16 and 17 to pave the way for their
country's eventual membership.
There is to be another meeting between the trade delegates in Canada on
February 28 to assess whether the scheme is working properly.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN's small farmer aid agency
seeks new means of funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Governing Council of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural
Development ended a three-day meeting last week by deciding to look for new
ways of funding Ifad's work because the present method has broken down.
Since 1977, western and oil exporting countries belonging to the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have contributed a certain
percentage of Ifad funds. These are loaned to projects to help small farmers
in developing countries. But the Opec countries now want to contribute less
because of declining oil prices.
Western governments will tell a committee that is examining improved ways of
funding Ifad, that they will contribute more if they have more voting
rights. At present, the three blocs that make up the fund's membership, the
West, Opec and the developing countries, each have one third of the votes.
The West seems prepared to take over some of Opec's contribution, if it also
takes over some of its votes.
Mr Ruud Treffers of the Netherlands told the council that Ifad's present
structure gave 'very few incentives for countries to increase their
contributions'. He said that the Netherlands would increase its contribution
if voting rights were linked more closely to contributions.
While Ifad has enough money to support its work in 1994 and 1995, it will
face a crisis if funds are not replenished next year. It has so far lent
about Dollars 4bn for nearly 400 projects, mostly to help the poorest and
most vulnerable farmers, and claims that these projects are helping farmers
to grow an extra 42m tons of food a year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee and cocoa prices in late
dive - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE and COCOA futures prices both took a dive at the London Commodity
Exchange yesterday afternoon but still were unable to arouse much interest
from buyers.
May delivery cocoa ended Pounds 11 down at Pounds 904 a tonne, while March
coffee lost Dollars 7 to Dollars 1,165 a tonne.
At the London Metal Exchange ZINC prices tumbled in after-hours 'kerb'
trading under largely technical liquidation prompted by a move below Dollars
1,010 a tonne for three months metal. The market ended at Dollars 1,002,
down Dollars 12 from Friday, but above a chart-support line near Dollars
995. News that an announcement on cutting European zinc producing capacity
could be made in February cut little ice with the market.

traded at 100.53 in moderate volume in the late afternoon, up 0.16 points on
the day.
The Bundesbank said that the data would not be ready until later this week
due to technical difficulties caused by changes in their compilation.
Mr Klaus Baader, senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in
London, said that the delay had lessened the impact of a poor December
figure and was encouraging the market to focus on the M3 data for January,
which is expected to show an improvement.
The delay in the December number also prompted market participants to cast
their bets on whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at its
fortnightly council meeting on Thursday.
Dealers said that last week's favourable inflation data and the likelihood
of weak industrial production data for the fourth quarter had raised hopes
that the Bundesbank would cut rates by between a  1/4 and  1/2 point.
Some dealers said they believed that there was a 50 per cent to 70 per cent
chance of a cut on Thursday. However, some economists said that the
Bundesbank would be reluctant to cut rates during the current round of wage
talks in Germany.
UK government bonds rose by up to  1/2 point at the long end as the release
of a lower than expected M0 money supply figure for January revived hopes of
an early cut in UK interest rates.
'The soft M0 number showed that the economy is moving ahead rather than
flying ahead,' said Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg Securities. He added that
the recent media reports highlighting the competition in food prices gave
further support to the favourable outlook for inflation.
The market also appeared to be more comfortable now that most of the
unwanted supply from last week's gilts auction had found a home, Mr Juckes
said. The March long gilt future on Liffe traded at 119 1/4 in the late
afternoon, up  7/16 on the day.
Italian government bonds and futures held their ground as the market awaited
the results of 10 and 30-year bond auctions which were released just after
the market closed. The auction results showed net yields easing on both
issues. The March Liffe contract rose 0.33 on the day to 118.75.
Japanese government bonds and futures recovered their poise in London
trading after tumbling in Tokyo in reaction to the surge in the Japanese
stock market.
Expectations that the long-awaited fiscal stimulus package would be
announced this week had also contributed to the fall in Tokyo. Market
forecasts for the overall size of the fiscal stimulus range from Y14,000bn
to Y16,000bn.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB rose by 10 basis points to 3.55 per
cent at the close in Tokyo but fell back to 3.53 per cent in London. The
March futures contract went as low as 112.74 in Tokyo before closing at
113.25, down 0.65 from Friday's closing level. However, it clawed back to
113.43 in London.
Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in
London, said he believed that the yield on the No 157 would not breach 3.6
per cent since the market was now looking cheap.
The prospect of a  1/2 point cut in the discount rate at the beginning of
March could help the yield to go back below 3 per cent, he added.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday after a firming trend in
commodities undercut the reassuring effect of comments by the Federal
Reserve Board chairman.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 down at
100 1/16 , with the yield rising to 6.238 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note edged  3/32 lower to 99 23/32 , to yield 4.132 per cent.
The market was pleased, but not surprised, by the testimony of Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, before the joint economic committee to
Congress.
In discussing the US economic outlook, he stressed the difficulty facing the
central bank in detecting latent inflationary pressures in time to contain
them. He cited data distortions arising from the recent cold weather, the
Los Angeles earthquake and modifications in methods used in compiling
employment figures.
But he emphasised that monetary policy 'must not over-stay accommodation',
which was taken as a signal that the Fed may soon move towards a more
restrictive bias.
The vigilant tone of his remarks, just ahead of the Fed's policy session
later this week, brought a modest improvement to the long end, which is most
sensitive to signs of higher inflation. At the short end, prices softened on
the prospects of a move to boost short-term rates.
In the afternoon, traders turned their attention to the commodity markets,
where prices for oil and basic metals were rebounding from earlier lows. In
response, the long bond retraced its earlier gains amid profit-taking and
slipped into negative territory.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Portugal launches Ecu750m global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal yesterday launched the first ever global Ecu bond, which benefited
from scarcity of 10-year supply in the Ecu market combined with strong
investor appetite for sovereign global debt.
'The issue was oversubscribed - we were sold out even before we issued
invitations to co-managers,' said one of the lead managers, reporting strong
demand from European and US accounts.
The Republic of Portugal issued Ecu750m of global bonds due February 2004
via joint lead managers Dresdner Bank, Morgan Stanley International and
Paribas Capital Markets. The bonds will be priced today at an indicated
spread of 28 - 30 basis points over the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004.
'Given the strong demand for the issue, I suspect that the spread will be at
the low end of that range,' said one trader.
While many participants felt that the pricing was aggressive, they said it
was justified by the scarcity of long-dated supply in Ecu sector. It is also
hoped that the issue will breathe new life into the slowly reviving Ecu bond
market.
According to Mr Manuel Pinho, director general at the Portuguese Treasury,
favourable market conditions and Portugal's commitment to a single European
currency prompted it to issue Ecu bonds.
Investor demand for the issue was further boosted by talk that it could be
Portugal's last foray into the international bond market this year.
According to Mr Pinho, Portugal will not tap the Eurobond market as heavily
this year as it did in 1993, when it issued three international bonds in
yen, D-Marks and US dollars totalling the equivalent of Dollars 2.1bn.
In 1994, it can borrow the equivalent of some Dollars 2.2bn on the
international market, but according to Mr Pinho, 'our main priority now will
be developing the domestic market - external borrowing will be marginal'.
Among other domestic market reforms, Portugal plans to abolish withholding
tax on non-residents this year.
Elsewhere, Rabobank Nederland issued Dollars 100m of the first
foreign-exchange range floating-rate note via Samuel Montagu. The one-year
notes pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 50 basis points, but interest
accrues only on days when the spot D-Mark/dollar exchange rate lies between
DM1.6200 and DM1.8800.
The notes work on the same principle as the recent interest rate range
floaters, where interest accrues only on days when the Libor fixing falls in
a specific interest rate corridor.
Other structured deals included Dollars 100m of one-year range floaters for
the Council of Europe via Salomon Brothers and CDollars 150m of 10-year
floored FRNs for Goldman Sachs Group.
In the Yankee market, the Province of Quebec launched Dollars 1bn of 30-year
bonds via Merrill Lynch, due to be priced at a spread of 81 - 83 basis
points over the old long bond.
The Republic of Italy expects to issue bonds on foreign markets worth the
equivalent of Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn this year, according to a Treasury
statement, Reuters reports.
Issues in 1994 would be in the major international currencies and would be
fixed or floating rate, according to market requirements and investors'
preferences, the Treasury said. In 1993, the Treasury returned to
non-domestic markets after a two-year break and issued some Dollars 12bn of
Eurobonds, samurai bonds and dollar-denominated global bonds.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Triple-A derivatives vehicle
for Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers has set up a triple A-rated derivatives unit with an
innovative structure designed to allay concerns about such vehicles and
reduce the cost to the parent.
Half a dozen banks have so far established separately capitalised units for
trading derivative products, in order to offer credit-sensitive clients a
triple-A rated counterparty.
Unlike existing derivatives units, trades executed to hedge derivatives
exposure will be contained within the Lehman vehicle, Lehman Brothers
Financial Products (LBFP).
Mr Jim Vinci, managing director in charge of LBFP, said it seemed 'unnatural
to separate the hedges from the swap book, so we decided to bring the hedges
within the vehicle to make it more sustainable'.
As a result, the rating agencies are accepting a lower level of collateral.
If the company runs into problems, a contingent manager will continue to run
the existing swaps book. In some other structures, such as Salomon Brothers'
Swapco, certain predetermined events trigger the termination of contracts.
This technically complex innovation could be replicated by other banks. 'It
could be grafted on to existing structures,' said Mr Jeremy Gluck, a senior
analyst at Moody's.
In 1993, Lehman Brothers executed a notional Dollars 360bn of business on
its global fixed income swaps book, about 38 per cent outside the US.
'We think that we will experience a substantial increase in business,' said
Mr Vinci.
LBFP will initially have Dollars 200m in capital.

fee income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, yesterday announced a 31.9 per cent
rise in net profit to Bt13.90bn (Dollars 546m) last year from Bt10.54bn in
1992.
Pre-tax profit increased 31.7 per cent to Bt21.35bn from Bt16.21bn, while
assets rose 17 per cent to Bt782.87bn from Bt666.01bn.
Thailand's commercial banks have all profited from wide spreads between
lending and deposit rates, but Bangkok Bank executives yesterday attributed
much of last year's improvement to higher fee income from value-added
services.
Siam Commercial Bank, meanwhile, said its 1993 net profit rose 16 per cent
to Bt4.85bn from Bt4.18bn in 1992, while pre-tax profit was up 15 per cent
to Bt6.70bn. Assets rose 18 per cent to Bt325.08bn.
Some stockbrokers said the fourth-quarter results of the two banks were
slightly below expectations. Thai Farmers Bank last week announced that its
1993 net profits had risen 52 per cent to Bt7.94bn, although the bank later
disclosed that Bt1.5bn of that came from the sale of shares in finance and
securities companies; excluding share sales, TFB net profit was up only 23
per cent.
Bangkok Bank's management was described by one stockbroker yesterday as 'a
little bit directionless' following the departure last month of Mr Vichit
Suraphongchai, the bank's president.
Bangkok Bank is planning to issue Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m of
convertible, 10-year Eurobonds, the largest such issue to date by a Thai
company, in order to strengthen its capital base.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: A deluge of paper threatens
investment in India - A flood of money has exposed faults in the antiquated
stock settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rush of foreign portfolio investment into India is threatening to
overwhelm the country's primitive stock settlement system.
The investments, more than Dollars 1bn, are generating so much paperwork
that the Bombay-based foreign banks - which handle the transactions as
custodians for foreign investors - are being buried in an avalanche of
transfer forms, share certificates, cheques and revenue stamps.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has stopped servicing new
customers - including clients who have already opened accounts but not yet
used them - and asked existing customers to limit trading volumes. Citibank
of the US, Hongkong Bank's main competitor, has stopped taking on new
business. Standard Chartered Bank, the third in the market, has only a small
custody service in India - it says it has no backlog, but refuses to take on
more work than it can handle.
The bankers' informal ban on new clients mean that some of the India country
funds launched in recent weeks will be unable to invest until the backlog of
paperwork is cleared - which could take three months, according to Hongkong
Bank officials.
'This is the world's largest paperchase,' says Mr GC Dobby, Hongkong Bank's
chief executive officer for India. 'The three banks are struggling to cope
with a tidal wave of paper which threatens to overwhelm us.' Some fund
managers have postponed planned Indian investments until settlement
procedures improve.
Few people in India were prepared for the flood of foreign funds. The
government, which is orchestrating radical economic reforms, opened the
stock market to foreign portfolio investment only in late 1992 and, since
foreign fund management companies had to register before being permitted to
trade, it was not until the middle of last year that the first were ready to
invest. Accumulated foreign portfolio investment soared from under Dollars
50m at the end of June 1993 to more than Dollars 1bn by the end of the year.
The Indian settlement system dates back to the Victorian era. Procedures are
designed for the country's millions of small private investors, some of them
buying as few as 10 or 100 shares, not institutions wanting to buy 100,000.
Even under normal conditions, 10 to 20 days elapse between placing an order
with a broker and payment/receipt of shares. The investor or his custodian
(if he has one), then has to examine the share certificates to see if they
tally with the transfer deeds; Standard Chartered officials say 121 items
must be individually checked, including dates, signatures and no less than
four sets of serial numbers. Over a quarter of transactions contain errors.
Once the mistakes are corrected, the custodians must stick revenue stamps to
each transfer deed and send off the papers to specialist registration
companies which, despite being required by law to complete the registration
of shares in the new owner's name in two months, often take three or four.
None of this is unique to India; practices in some other developing
countries are similarly cumbersome. What compounds the problem in India is
the country's size and the complexity of its stock market, which has 22
separate exchanges and about 6,500 listed companies. Shares are commonly
traded in lots of 10, 50 or 100, a practice geared to the small investor. So
a fund manager who wishes to buy 10,000 must purchase thousands of separate
lots. The bundles of paper in Hongkong Bank's Bombay offices bear witness to
the enormous workload - scores of clerks work at desks piled with
certificates and transfer deeds bound together with string, surrounded by
tin boxes containing yet more certificates and deeds.
To help cope with work, the bank has rapidly expanded its custody staff from
30 at the end of October to 120 plus another 100 temporary clerks, working
in two shifts six days a week. Citibank, with 70 people in custody services
and Standard Chartered with 12 are also expanding. All three are trying to
streamline their procedures and to secure more vault space.
Foreign fund managers have generally avoided Indian banks because they lack
experience in international custody work and often do not have the capital
to meet minimum, internationally acceptable standards for custody work.
However, the State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial bank -
which does meet the capital requirements - is preparing to enter the market.
In response to lobbying from the Hongkong Bank, the Indian finance ministry
and the Securities and Exchange Board of India last month approved
procedural improvements. These include the introduction of 'Jumbo' transfer
deeds, which will allow the custodian to use one transfer deed for the whole
order instead of one per lot of shares; 'Jumbo' share certificates, for lots
of 1,000 shares or more; and the payment of stamp duty by cheques instead of
revenue stamps.
However, it could take months before these procedures are accepted by the
whole market, including private investors, brokers and registrars as well as
custodians. Eventually, the system will be replaced by computerised
scripless trading and settlement. But this is unlikely to be introduced in
India for at least two years and will at first be limited to leading shares.
Even though the paperchase should steadily become less frustrating, it will
remain part of the price paid for doing business in India for a long time to
come.

Simsmetal, the Australian scrap metal and recycling group which was relisted
in 1991 and has been actively expanding into North America, yesterday
reported first-half profits of ADollars 23.5m (USDollars 16.6m) after tax,
up sharply from the ADollars 7.33m seen in the same period of 1992-1993,
writes Nikki Tait. Revenues for the six months to end-December rose to
ADollars 363.2m from ADollars 275.1m a year ago.
Simsmetal said that strong ferrous scrap prices, higher volumes and the
weakness of the Australian dollar against the US currency helped produce the
improved figures. It added that it is still negotiating to acquire interests
in related businesses in both the US and the UK.

South China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading
English language newspaper, yesterday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in net
profits to HKDollars 258.36m (USDollars 33.45m) for the six months to
December 31. The dividend is being maintained at 6 cents, writes Louise
Lucas in Hong Kong.
The results, the first to be reported since Malaysian millionaire Mr Robert
Kuok paid USDollars 349m to Mr Rupert Murdoch for control of the Post, show
earnings per share have risen to 17.22 HK cents from 16.92 cents a year ago.
Last month, the group sold its loss-making Chinese language newspaper Wah
Kiu Yat Po, two years after buying it, for HKDollars 20m. It retains a 19.8
per cent 'strategic interest'.
The Post's impressive margins are likely to come under pressure with today's
launch of the Eastern Express, the first new English language newspaper for
more than a decade.
Spawned by Oriental Press, the most profitable Chinese language publisher in
Hong Kong, the Eastern Express has already hired a number of former Post
editorial staff and undercut advertising rates.

Air India, India's state-owned international airline, and Indian Airlines,

institutions into limited liability companies as a first step towards their
partial privatisation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi.
The government has formally approved the reorganisation plans, which form
part of its economic reforms and include measures to promote greater
commercial efficiency in state-owned enterprises.
Air India and Indian Airlines will now be free to raise funds in the capital
markets and sell equity to private investors, though the government will
retain at least 51 per cent holdings. The size, timing and conditions of
share issues have yet to be determined.
Legislation agreed at the weekend also gives formal recognition to private
airlines which have been operating in India for more than a year. They will

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bid battle for mining deposit in
Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two former allies in the international mining industry, both with links to
Germany's Metallgesellschaft, have emerged as rivals in a hotly-contested
bid for a rich copper-gold deposit in Argentina.
MIM Holdings of Australia signed an agreement in principle last weekend to
participate in the development of the Bajo de la Alumbrera project,
alongside International Musto Explorations, a small Vancouver-based group.
The Australian company said that negotiations towards a final agreement were
'ongoing'. It plans to pay USDollars 130m for a 50 per cent stake in the
venture and would be the operator of the project. The deal is due to close
around February 17.
MIM's announcement comes on the heels of a CDollars 332m (USDollars 251m)
hostile bid by Toronto-based Metall Mining for all Musto's outstanding
shares. Metall's offer is conditional, however, on Musto not signing a
legally-binding joint venture agreement, or other arrangement to dispose of
any substantial part of its 100 per cent interest in Alumbrera.
Metallgesellschaft (MG), MIM and Metall were the pillars of what was
designed in the mid-1980s to be a powerful mining alliance. The three
companies forged a close relationship, including cross-shareholdings, board
directorships and joint ventures.
However, as the rivalry for control of Alumbrera shows, they have begun to
move apart. Metall, which is 50.1 per cent owned by MG, recently sold its
minority stake in MIM, and Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall's chief executive
officer, left the Australian company's board. MG is expected to dispose of
its Metall shares as part of its financial restructuring. MIM retains a 3.5
per cent interest in MG.
Metall said that it would formally launch its tender offer this week. It
maintains that a decision on the project should be taken by Musto's
shareholders, not its management.

half-year

Rustenburg Platinum (Rusplat), the world's largest producer of platinum
group metals, reported a 9.5 per cent advance in pre-tax profit to R184.7m
(USDollars 54m) in the half-year to December 31 against R168.7m a year ago.
The flagship of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group's platinum
division staved off sluggish metal prices by increasing platinum output by
more than 3 per cent and cutting costs, with some help from the rand's loss
in value against the US dollar.
However, the interim dividend is held at 62.5 cents a share. Mr Barry
Davison, managing director, said the improvement in the period was off a low
base and Rusplat would no more than match 1992-1993 distributable profit of
R281.4m in the current year.
Mr Davison said the small recovery in interim platinum and palladium prices
to Dollars 379 and Dollars 129 an ounce from an average of Dollars 365 and
Dollars 103 in 1992-1993 contrasted with the slide in rhodium and nickel
prices. In the same periods, they averaged Dollars 929 an ounce and Dollars
2.19 a pound, against Dollars 1,807 and Dollars 2.84 respectively.
He said the balance of supply and demand in the platinum market would not
justify any significant improvement in prices in 1994 without solid economic
recovery in Europe and Japan where demand for platinum-based catalytic
converters was affected by falling car sales.
Interim net sales improved to R1.37bn from R1.34bn with cost of sales higher
at R1.07bn compared with R1.05bn. A rise in total on-mine costs as output
rose was mostly offset by lower refining costs associated with an increase
in material being toll-refined on behalf of Rusplat's sister platinum mining
companies.
Distributable profit stood at R133m against R110.1m after a gain in
operating profit to R314.6m from R310.8m. Lebowa Platinum turned in pre-tax
profit of R1.7m against a R9.4m loss.

Canadian Pacific Forest Products, the pulp and paper group, reduced its
operating loss to CDollars 143m (USDollars 109m) in 1993 from CDollars 190m
in 1992.
After special items the loss widened to CDollars 286m or CDollars 4.88 a
share, compared with a deficit of CDollars 248m or CDollars 4.82 in 1992.
Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.8bn.
The fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 160.5m after special items, against a
loss of CDollars 59.5m a year earlier on sales little changed at CDollars
466m.
The group is spinning off its paperboard business into a new company, St
Laurent Paperboard, with annual sales of more than CDollars 300m.
CPFP will get CDollars 240m from a recent financing in February. Dominion
Textiles, a Canadian-based international textile producer, turned in net
profit of CDollars 7.8m or 13 cents a share after special items in the six
months ended December 31. This compared with CDollars 10m or 21 cents a year
earlier, on sales of CDollars 624m, against CDollars 631m.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dow Corning slips deeper into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Corning fell deeper into the red in the fourth quarter after taking a
pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m to cover the cost of litigation related to
breast implants manufactured by the company.
The company, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning,
yesterday announced a net loss of Dollars 384.2m in the final three months
of 1993, compared with Dollars 5.5m in the year-earlier period.
Excluding the provision, which was disclosed earlier this month, net profits
improved by 48 per cent to Dollars 30.8m, against an operating profit of
Dollars 20.9m in the final three months of 1992.
The special charge represents the company's best estimate of its potential
costs under a proposed Dollars 4.75bn settlement of thousands of lawsuits
brought by women who claimed to be harmed by leaking implants.
Its total liability was estimated at Dollars 1.24bn, but insurance payments
were expected to reduce the figure by Dollars 600m.
Dow Corning was once the world's largest manufacturer of breast implants. In
1992, the US Food and Drug Administration banned their use in cosmetic
surgery amid mounting concern over their safety.
Its continuing operations remain on sound footing.
The company, a leading supplier of silicone used in the manufacture of
aerospace, vehicle and construction products, showed a 7.9 per cent increase
in revenues to Dollars 521m in the quarter. Sales growth was particularly
strong in the US, while some recovery was evident in Europe.
Mr Richard Hazleton, president and chief executive, said he was satisfied by
the company's performance and credited a cost-control programme begun
earlier in the year for the profits growth.
He said a highly competitive trading environment had limited the company's
ability to recoup cost increases through higher prices, although prices were
up modestly in the US.
For the full year, sales reached a record Dollars 2.04bn, up 4.5 per cent
from Dollars 1.96bn in 1992, but the bottom line suffered from the impact of
the breast-implant provision.
A net loss of Dollars 287m in 1993 was set against a net deficit of Dollars
72m a year earlier. Excluding special charges, net profits advanced 27.6 per
cent to Dollars 128m.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lagardere launches
Matra-Hachette offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere yesterday launched his long-mooted shares exchange
offer to absorb Matra-Hachette, the missiles-to-magazine group, into his own
Lagardere group.
Under the offer, which closes on March 12, holders of some 58m
Matra-Hachette shares which are not already held by Mr Lagardere and his
industrial and financial partners would receive Lagardere group shares on a
one-for-one basis, plus a warrant convertible at a rate of five for two
Lagardere shares.
The Lagardere group said it would only go through with the share swap if it
gained at least 65 per cent of Matra-Hachette's capital. At present it holds
37.6 per cent of Matra-Hachette's capital and 51.2 per cent of its voting
rights.
Mr Lagardere said the deal was designed to merge Matra-Hachette, which
represents 90 per cent of the Lagardere group assets, into a simpler and
more transparent structure, and allow Matra-Hachette to grow without the
constraint imposed by the Lagardere group's need to preserve its present
controlling 51 per cent stake.
In fact, the issue of warrants to tempt Matra-Hachette shareholders could
bring the Lagardere group FFr4.3bn (Dollars 731m) if all the shares were
exchanged and all the accompanying warrants were exercised by mid-1997, Mr
Philippe Camus, the Lagardere group finance director, estimated yesterday.
Financial rather than industrial considerations lie behind the plan, which
Mr Lagardere said was motivated by the fact that on the Paris bourse the
shares of the holding company that bears his name were considerably
under-valued in relation to its underlying assets, and in particular to the
share price of Matra-Hachette.
Trading in the two shares was suspended on yesterday's announcement, but on
Friday Lagardere closed at FFr160 and Matra-Hachette at FFr165.80.
Mr Lagardere compared Matra-Hachette to 'a fast train' which he said would
show nearly a doubling of earnings in 1993 to FFr600m. But he likened his
Lagardere group to a high-speed 'TGV train'.
'We are proposing that Matra-Hachette shareholders step on to the TGV, and
that not only will they suffer no risk and pay no extra charge but they will
be rewarded in switching,' he claimed.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc unit misses target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals division of Rhone-Poulenc, the
French chemicals group, yesterday announced net profits of Dollars 408.7m
for last year, a fall of about 5 per cent compared with the Dollars 428.2m
reported in 1992.
Mr Robert Cawthorn, chairman and chief executive, said the results were
'below what we had planned'.
He said the environment facing the industry had been more difficult than
expected, particularly in Germany and Italy, where pharmaceuticals companies
have been hit by government healthcare reforms and reduced prices.
Sales held fairly constant at Dollars 4.02bn, while earnings per share
slipped to Dollars 2.96 from Dollars 3.10.
Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share rose slightly to Dollars
2.92 from Dollars 2.82.
In spite of the fall in profits and earnings per share, Mr Cawthorn cited
several encouraging factors.
He said sales growth in Japan, the US and France, the world's three largest
pharmaceuticals markets, exceeded the market average. In the US, sales of
both prescription and over-the-counter drugs posted double digit gains.
The company is developing products, such as Zagam, an antibiotic and
Taxotere, an anti-cancer agent which was described as the company's number
one research priority.
RPR said it was planning to file Taxotere for registration in North America,
Japan and Europe in the third quarter of this year.
In the longer term, RPR said it was investing in new technologies,
particularly in cell and gene therapy.
Mr Cawthorn said 1994 was a transitional year, which would see increased
investment in new products and an increase in its cost-cutting efforts.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: GE Capital buys car leasing
group

GE Capital, the US financial services group, has expanded its international
fleet management business by acquiring Triathalon Leasing, Canada's biggest
vehicle leasing company.
GE will pay CDollars 225m (USDollars 170m) for Triathalon, which is owned by
Trilon, a holding company controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman
family.
The Triathalon sale is the latest in a string of divestitures over the past
year by the hard-pressed Bronfman empire. Trilon said it would use the
proceeds to repay debt, and expected to post a small gain on the deal.
Triathalon has 47,000 vehicles under lease or management to 1,600 corporate
customers. GE Capital, wholly-owned by General Electric, has a large
presence in Canada, with about 27,000 vehicles on its books.
The combined fleets will make up about 12 per cent of GE's worldwide
business.
GE named Mr Rolf Rueqq as president of its enlarged Canadian operation. Mr
Rueqq is general manager of Avis Fleet Services, GE's European
vehicle-services arm.
CT Financial Services, which own Canada's biggest trust company, posted a 66
per cent gain in fourth-quarter net profits to CDollars 45m or 32 cents a
share, but profit for all of 1993 was down 14 per cent to CDollars 166m or
CDollars 1.22, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The fourth-quarter upturn was due to lower loss provisions and strong mutual
funds sales. CT is controlled by Imasco, the tobacco, fast food and
retailing giant, which is in turn 40 per cent held by Britain's BAT
Industries.
Canada Trust, with CDollars 38bn of assets, is one of two surviving
independent trust companies and is not for sale, Imasco says. It increased
market share 1 per cent last year and the company said its performance in
1994 will depend on recovery in Canada and the US, where the company
controls a large savings and loan unit.

music video channel

<TEXT>
Four of the world's largest record companies - Warner Music, PolyGram, EMI
Music and Sony Software - yesterday announced plans to launch a cable
television music video channel in the US. It could provide the first serious
competition to MTV Networks, the pop music service owned by US cable group
Viacom.
The partners are thought to be considering launching local language services
outside the US in some countries where MTV has been growing rapidly. MTV's
programmes are broadcast in English.
The four companies, together with Ticketmaster, the US entertainment
ticketing group, said they were forming a partnership to operate an
advertiser-supported, 24-hour channel which would be offered as a basic
cable service in the US and launched in the fourth quarter of this year.
They would seek additional partners, including cable television operators.
Warner Music is a subsidiary of Time Warner, the entertainment group which
runs the second-largest cable television service in the US.
EMI Music belongs to Britain's Thorn EMI, while PolyGram is a subsidiary of
Philips Electronics of Holland, and Sony Software is part of Japan's Sony
group.
The four companies launched a forerunner to the US service in Germany last
month, in conjunction with Mr Frank Otto, a Hamburg radio executive. The
German-language service, called VIVA, is in 90 per cent of the country's 13m
cable homes.
The US venture could have a tough time wooing cable companies and
advertisers away from MTV and its sister channel, VH-1, which is aimed at
the baby boom generation.
MTV, which began operations in 1981, has built up a powerful brand name in
North America - and increasingly around the world - with an unpredictable,
iconoclastic style and original programming which goes beyond the simple
transmission of pop videos. It is received in 57m homes in the US.
The record companies yesterday gave few details of their programming plans,
but indicated the channel would consist mainly of pop video transmissions,
possibly accom-panied by retailing of music-related merchandise.
The partners said they would continue to licence their own videos to other
entities, which presumably means MTV will be assured a supply.
Bertelsmann, the West German record company, and Tele-Communications Inc,
the largest cable system operator in the US, announced plans last September
to launch a cable channel in the US which would allow viewers to choose the
pop videos they want to watch, as well as buying music-related products from
home. However, this idea may take a considerable time to reach the market.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's 'big four' commercial
banks, is to open branches in Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, writes Tony
Walker.
The establishment of overseas branch offices will coincide with reforms of
the bank's operations at home to divide its commercial business from its
policy-lending responsibilities to a struggling rural sector.
The bank will be split into two institutions to be known as the Agricultural
Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank. The latter will provide soft
loans to farmers.
The Agricultural Bank will be expected to compete more effectively in a
commercial environment under new banking laws that are expected this year.
A Central Bank Law and Banking Law are aimed at defining more clearly the
responsibilities of China's banks, and opening the way for further reforms
of an antiquated banking sector.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Xerox shares lifted by strong
final term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Xerox rose sharply on Wall Street yesterday after the company
announced net income from its core document processing business rose 9 per
cent in the final quarter of 1993 to Dollars 236m.
Although part of the growth was due to favourable movements in foreign
exchange markets - Xerox said processing income was up only 5 per cent in
the fourth quarter if the effect of foreign currency translation was
excluded - the improvement cheered investors who until recently had been
disappointed by the company's earnings performance.
By late morning, Xerox shares were up Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 97 1/4 , a
52-week high.
The company has been restructuring. Further job cuts are planned as part of
the programme, aimed at reducing Xerox's payroll by 10,000 jobs, or 10 per
cent, over the next two years.
Xerox's solid final quarter took the company's full-year 1993 earnings from
its document processing business to Dollars 620m, up from Dollars 562m in
1992. That gain was wiped out by a previously announced fourth-quarter
charge of Dollars 813m which was taken to cover the cost of a big
restructuring programme and to settle a 1992 anti-trust lawsuit.
Revenue for the quarter was almost unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn. For the year,
revenue was static at Dollars 14.6bn against Dollars 14.7bn.
Mr Paul Allair, Xerox's chairman and chief executive, said that pre-charge
profits were up over the year in spite of lower-than-expected revenue growth
because of the company's restructuring.
During 1993, Xerox's worldwide document processing workforce was cut by
2,300. The reductions, combined with expense controls, helped improve the
company's ratio of expenses-to-revenue ratio by 1.1 per cent.

<TEXT>
Upjohn, the US pharmaceutical company which is trying to respond to series
of patent expiries on some of its most important drugs, reported a 6 per
cent increase in net income to Dollars 163.7m in its fourth quarter.
The result left it with full-year net income 21 per cent ahead at Dollars
392.4m, but the company said if all unusual items and the previous year's
Dollars 222.9m charge for accounting changes were excluded, net income from
continuing operations would have been 5 per cent ahead at Dollars 585m.
Mr John Zabriskie, the newly-appointed chairman and chief executive, said
Upjohn's respectable performance in 1993 showed the company's concerted
efforts to meet short-term challenges were working.
'Our human healthcare products showed volume growth worldwide, and products
we have introduced in the US since 1992 achieved excellent market
penetration,' he said.
Mr Zabriskie acknowledged Upjohn was seeing the effects of the loss of US
patent protection on several important products, but said it had limited the
effects through careful planning of its generic strategy. 'We expect this
strategy to help mitigate the negative effects of generic competition in
1994,' he said.
Worldwide sales of human health care products increased 2 per cent for the
year but decreased 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. Worldwide agricultural
sales decreased 2 per cent for the year but increased 10 per cent in the
fourth quarter.
Total sales for the full year were Dollars 3.61bn, against Dollars 3.55bn
last time, while fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 926.3m, down from Dollars
967.1m. Earnings per share, undiluted, were up to Dollars 2.18 from Dollars
1.78 for the year and to 92 cents from 86 cents for the quarter.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fiat sees recovery after record
L1,800bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the vehicle and industrial group, yesterday issued preliminary figures
for 1993 pointing to one of the biggest annual losses in Italian corporate
history.
However, Mr Gianni Agnelli, the chairman forecast that the group would break
even in the current year.
Buffeted by the steep decline in demand for cars and the heavy costs of
servicing its growing borrowings, the company is set to report a net loss of
about L1,800bn (Dollars 1.06bn) when full figures are released in May.
The scale of the setback, marking the first consolidated loss for the group
in its 95-year history, virtually rules out a dividend payment on its
ordinary shares. In an interview late last year, Mr Agnelli, chairman, said
he hoped it would be possible to pay holders of the group's non-voting
savings stock, but indicated he would not recommend a dividend for ordinary
shares.
Fiat's pre-tax loss would have been about L2,000bn but for the sale of its
47 per cent stake in La Rinascente, the big retailing group. The disposal
created a gain of L500bn, reducing the loss to about L1,500bn. However,
after taxation on profitable operations, the net group loss will be about
L1,800bn for 1993. In spite of being 'at the lowest point of the crisis,
both for the company and the country', the chairman forecast the recovery.
The bullish prediction has been based partly on strong demand for its new
Punto small car, unveiled in November. About 200,000 Puntos have been
ordered so far, with about a third of the demand coming from abroad.
Fiat confirmed its commitment to its ambitious investment programme, noting
that about L9,000bn - 16.8 per cent of sales - had been spent on fixed
assets and research and development in 1993. Overall sales, adjusted for the
Rinascente disposal, fell by 1.7 per cent to L53,700bn.
Group debt rose to about L5,500bn on December 31, from L4,466bn at the end
of 1992. However, the total would have been far higher had it not been for
the group's big rights issue announced in September.
Fiat gave no breakdown for losses in individual sectors, which will not be
revealed until later this year. In making the bullish forecast, the group
indicated there would be no large asset disposals, implying that the
recovery would come from the group's core car and truck operations,
currently its heaviest loss-makers.
Turnover in cars, Fiat's biggest single source of revenue, fell by 11.3 per
cent to L24,350bn last year, while sales of trucks dropped by 11.5 per cent
to L7,120bn.
Fiat SpA, the parent company, which derives its income from dividend
payments from its subsidiaries, is expected to report a modest profit of
between L50bn and L100bn for 1993, against earnings of L507bn in 1992.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: LVMH may seek control at
Guerlain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, is considering taking full
control of Guerlain, one of France's most famous fragrance houses, according
to Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman.
Mr Arnault said in an interview with yesterday's Les Echos, the French
financial newspaper, that LVMH planned to increase its minority stake in
Guerlain as part of its plans to expand its luxury interests following last
month's deal to restructure its cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness,
the UK drinks group,
LVMH, already one of the largest perfume companies with brands such as
Christian Dior's Dune and Givenchy's Amarige, has held a 15 per cent stake
in Guerlain since 1987. It is believed to have considered taking a larger
holding at the time of the original acquisition, but finally decided against
doing so.
However, Mr Arnault said he wanted to be 'more than just a minority
investor' in Guerlain. LVMH confirmed that the group did hope to raise its
stake, but said it had not yet begun negotiations with the Guerlain family
which controls the remaining 85 per cent of the business.
Guerlain is one of France's oldest and most prestigious fragrance houses
with annual sales of over FFr2bn (Dollars 330m). Its best known perfumes,
Shalimar and Samsara, are among the top 20 best selling upmarket scents. The
acquisition of Guerlain would make perfect sense for LVMH, which has thrived
in the fragrance market by applying its marketing and distribution resources
to a wide range of brand names.

sale of stake in components unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and industrial group,
is in talks with 'at least two' potential buyers for its 47 per cent stake
in Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle components company which has been part of the
group since the beginning of the century.
Mr Heinrich Binder, Kolbenschmidt chief executive, said yesterday that a
transaction could be concluded reasonably quickly although it was too early
to comment on the identity of interested parties. He said it was likely that
the buyer would purchase a further 4 per cent of the company's shares to
obtain control.
Kolbenschmidt has in recent years been a severe financial burden to its
Frankfurt-based parent company, losing DM123m (Dollars 70.20m) in the year
to last September and DM90m in 1991-92. Mr Kajo Neukirchen made it clear
soon after he succeeded Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch as chief executive of
Metallgesellschaft in December that the stake in Kolbenschmidt would be put
up for sale.
Mr Binder said the company, which produces pistons, cylinder heads, oil
pumps and other components used by vehicle makers, had broken even in the
first quarter of the current financial year and was likely to in the year as
a whole, despite poor market conditions. He predicted further improvements
as rationalisation measures took effect, saying the company would make a
profit in the next financial year.
The poor performance reflects the state of the German vehicle components
sector where suppliers have been forced to bear the brunt of cost-cutting by
the manufacturers as well as the impact of the strong D-Mark on exports.
Kolbenschmidt has responded by reducing capital expenditure and implementing
a cost-cutting plan as a result of which the workforce shrunk by 763 to
9,314 people last year.
Extraordinary costs of DM44.9m associated with the restructuring were
included in last year's losses.
Mr Binder said the Metallgesellschaft crisis had not caused any direct
problems for Kolbenschmidt, although the projected sale had caused
uncertainty for staff and customers. Metallgesellschaft sold a 12.5 per cent
parcel of shares in the company last September to Magna International, a
Canadian company which is thought to be a potential purchaser of the
remaining 47 per cent holding.
Magna recently bought a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt's
airbag-manufacturing subsidiary.

Credit Local de France (CLF), the specialist French banking group, yesterday
reported an 8.5 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.29bn (Dollars 210m)
for 1993 from FFr1.19bn in 1992 despite the general downturn in the French
banking sector.
The French banks have had a tough time in the past two years due to the
sluggish state of the credit market and the impact of the economic recession
on corporate loans and property holdings. However, CLF has remained
unscathed due to its specialist niche in the local authority loans market.
Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, said that the group, which last summer became
the first candidate for the Balladur government's privatisation programme
when the state sold a 30.5 per cent tranche of its equity, managed to beat
its original profit targets for last year.
Net banking income rose by 8.8 per cent to FFr3.08bn in 1993 from FFr2.83bn
the previous year. However, operating costs increased by 14 per cent to
FFr653m from FFr574.4m over the same period and gross operating profits rose
by 5.5 per cent to FFr2.32bn from FFr2.19bn.
CLF is raising its dividend for 1993 to FFr16.50 a share, which represents
an increase of 17 per cent over 1992.
On the trading front CLF managed to raise the value of its total loans by 8
per cent to FFr277bn during the year, partly due to an increase in new
loans. Mr Richard said that, despite the recession, French local authorities
had maintained relatively high levels of investment.
However, CLF, which expanded rapidly during the late 1980s due to the impact
of the socialist government's decentralisation policy that gave French local
authorities greater power over expenditure, is proceeding with its long-term
policy of international expansion to reduce its reliance on the French
market. The group last year opened a new business based in Madrid.

5.9%

BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, yesterday announced net profits of
FFr3.42bn (Dollars 570m) for last year, a fall of 5.9 per cent compared with
1992. Sales rose by just under 2 per cent to FFr70.1bn.
Mr Antoine Riboud, group chairman, said the results, which were in line with
analysts' forecasts, reflected the resilience of the group in the face of
recession in some of its principal markets. In a newspaper interview he said
the performance demonstrated the strength of the company's brands, which
include Danone yogurts, Lea &amp; Perrins sauces and Jacobs crackers.
According to Mr Riboud, the group's principal brands had maintained their
market share over the past few years, despite the rise of distributors'
brands and discount brands during the period.
'It has become fashionable to attack brands, to say that they only exist in
advertising and publicity. But the success of our brands shows this is not
so,' said Mr Riboud.
BSN said the impact of recession had also been offset by its cost-cutting
programme. Eleven industrial and commercial sites were closed during the
year, while staff numbers were reduced in its beer and packaging divisions.
Charges for restructuring had been taken in previous years and did not
affect the 1993 results, the company said.
During 1993, the group said that it had invested FFr7.5bn in developing its
mineral water and fresh produce branches and in expanding its presence in
central Europe and Asia. Mr Riboud outlined a strategy of continued
expansion, particularly in these geographical areas.
'In the 1970s we became the leader in France, in the 1980s concentrated our
efforts on the EC and for the next 10 years we have fixed as our objective
to become a world group,' said Mr Riboud.
He said that the group already achieved annual sales of FFr6bn in the region
spanning from eastern Europe to east Asia and that this figure could be
doubled every five years through acquisitions and alliances.
In terms of products, the company said that its fresh produce division
remained the largest last year, reporting sales of FFr25.9bn, compared with
FFr26.1bn in 1992. The groceries and pasta division achieved sales of
FFr13.1bn, slightly more than the biscuits division. Beers and mineral
waters recorded sales of about FFr6.3bn each, with the packaging division
slightly higher at FFr6.6bn.

The chairman of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer which is 51 per

dispute over his plans for a 30 per cent reduction in the price of Fokker's
aircraft.
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn is to be replaced temporarily by Mr Reinder van
Duinen, vice-chairman of the management board, until a new chairman drawn
from outside the company can be found.
Fokker said he had resigned for personal reasons but declined to give
details.
The cost-cutting plans, unveiled by Mr Nederkoorn in late December, also
called for the elimination of around 1,000 jobs. The plans met with
opposition from fellow members of the management board as well as Dutch
members of the supervisory board, who argued that the cuts were
unnecessarily drastic.
Dasa, which is reported to have wanted even stiffer cuts, declined to use
its majority on the supervisory board to back Mr Nederkoorn in the face of
Dutch opposition.
Mr Nederkoorn's resignation is unexpected and ironic because he was the
driving force behind last year's sale of Fokker to Dasa, a subsidiary of
Daimler-Benz.

FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Value boost for investors in
Hungarian hotels group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three US institutions which bought into Hungary's Danubius Hotels on Friday
in Budapest's biggest stock-market transaction doubled the paper value of
their investment yesterday as share prices leapt forward.
Kingdon Capital Market Corporation, Indian Harbor Holdings and an anonymous
investment fund paid Dollars 23.6m for 29 per cent of Danubius, the hotel
and spa group, which is being privatised by the state property agency.
In hectic trading yesterday Danubius shares moved beyond the Ft1,000
transaction price to end the day on Ft2,200. However, Creditanstalt
Securities, the lead manager to the deal, warned that in this volatile
market the group's share price might ease.
The closing price values the US investors' shareholdings at Dollars 50m and
the whole of Danubius at Dollars 173m, giving the hotel group the second
highest market capitalisation of the 28 companies listed on the Budapest
Stock Exchange. Danubius's performance helped push the BSE index up 7.1 per
cent to 1,942.
Danubius was originally earmarked for sale in Hungary's first privatisation
programme in September 1990 but the recession in central eastern Europe
forced its delay.
In 1991 a planned public offering was cancelled at the last minute and
unprecedentedly generous incentives were needed to make a success of the
1992 sale of 25 per cent of the company to domestic investors.
Danubius yesterday announced that preliminary pre-tax profits rose 7.7 per
cent to Ft882m (Dollars 8.6m) in 1993, on revenue of Ft5.1bn.
The rise in Danubius reflects the growing fashion for emerging markets and a
central European stockmarket boom which began last year in Warsaw and has
spread to Budapest, taking the index up 58 per cent in January alone.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Slimma flotation will raise less than
expected Pounds 2.65m - Issue News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slimma, the women's clothing and outsize garments manufacturer, said
yesterday that its forthcoming flotation would raise a lower than expected
total of Pounds 2.65m for the company.
When the Staffordshire-based group announced it was coming to the market
last December, it expected to raise about Pounds 5m from the placing of
4.54m new shares.
Mr Stephen Thwaite, chief executive, said the discrepancy arose because
venture capital investors had decided to sell Pounds 1.5m of shares at the
placing price of 120p.
Existing directors intended to realise Pounds 750,000 from the flotation, he
added.
The placing - involving 48.1 per cent of the ordinary share capital - values
the company at Pounds 11.4m, but leaves the management and Yorkshire Bank
Development Capital, Slimma's venture capital backer, with a majority stake.
Nevertheless, the company said the flotation would enable it to increase
output and reduce gearing.
Mr Thwaite, who led a Pounds 3.3m management buy-out from Tootal in 1991,
said funds would also be used to redeem preference shares and 'continue
Slimma's strategy or organic growth'.
The board had decided to seek a listing - sponsored and brokered by Henry
Cooke Lumsden - following a 'significant increase in profits', he added.
In the 53 weeks to October 1, pre-tax profits reached Pounds 1.15m (Pounds
545,000) on turnover of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 13.5m).
Pro-forma earnings per share were 9.5p, putting the shares on p/e of 12.6 at
the placing price.
Dealings in the enlarged group are expected to start next Monday.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Taiwan Trust lifts capital - Issue News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan Investment Trust, which is to be launched today with Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, as chairman, has increased its capital from a
planned Pounds 30m to Pounds 45m because of interest from institutions.
The trust, which will be the only London-listed vehicle specialising in
Taiwan, is to be managed from Hong Kong by Jupiter Tyndall (Asia).
Among the directors are Mr Julian Seymour, who heads the private office of
Lady Thatcher, and Mr Geoffrey Howard-Spink, director of Lowe Howard-Spink.
Investing in Taiwan's stock market is problematic for foreigners because of
restrictions placed on the amount to be invested.
In addition, the central bank limits the amount of foreign currency which
can flow into the island because it is concerned about appreciation of the
local currency.
Though the central bank recently acted again to limit inflows following a
sharp stock market rally at the end of 1993, Jupiter Tyndall had already
been authorised by the Taiwan authorities to invest a total of Dollars 200m
(Pounds 133m).
Of Taiwan's total market capitalisation of Dollars 183bn (Pounds 122bn) at
mid-January, only about 2 per cent was held by foreigners.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tring strengthens board ahead of placing
this month - Issue News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the budget recording company, yesterday announced plans
for its stock market flotation. It said that Mr Joseph Bollom, a director of
First Leisure, and Mr Robert Leigh, chairman of Electron House, the
electronic components distributor, had joined the board.
The flotation will be by way of a placing by UBS, with dealings expected to
start on February 23.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, says that Tring faces legal
claims over the rights to some of the music on its products. It adds,
however, that the claims will not have a significant effect on its financial
position.
The company says it has paid out only Pounds 50,000, including costs, to
other companies over disputed music rights since 1990. Last month Tring paid
Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music to settle two breaches of copyright actions.
Among actions still outstanding are claims from music groups PolyGram and
MCA.
Tring's pathfinder prospectus says it can be difficult to trace ownership of
music rights, particularly of older material. It adds: 'Many factors
contribute to this problem, including poorly documented agreements with
artists, a multiplicity of recordings of certain old popular hits and the
absence of any comprehensive central register of rights.'
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1993 were Pounds 3.3m on turnover
of Pounds 16.5m. Tring is forecasting profits for the current year of Pounds
5.1m.
It sells compact discs for Pounds 2.99 or Pounds 3.99 and cassettes for
Pounds 1.99 or Pounds 2.99 through supermarkets, petrol stations and duty
free shops. It also sells through Virgin and Our Price.
Last year, agreement was reached with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to
make 50 classical recordings.

The period was one of restricted activity, directors said, while

The negotiations led to a capital reorganisation, acquisition of development

However, interest charges of Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 811,000) pushed the

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Nottingham coming to market with Pounds 80m
tag - Issue News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottingham Group, which under its NES Arnold trade name claims to be the
UK's largest educational supplier, is expected to be valued at over Pounds
80m when it comes to the market in the spring.
Goldman Sachs, arranging and underwriting its first UK flotation, and James
Capel, the stockbroker, will seek to place and sell through intermediaries
shares worth at least Pounds 14m.
Flotation terms are still under discussion but Nottingham needs Pounds 14m
to redeem preference shares, issued to 3i and Citicorp Capital Investors
Europe, its venture capital backers. Whether they will retain equity is not
yet clear. Management, led by Mr David Mansfield, holds about 20 per cent of
the equity. How much new capital will be sought from the market depends on
whether Nottingham decides to clear all its debt, currently about Pounds 3m,
and on whether it wants funds for expansion.
The decision to seek a market flotation springs out of studies on the way in
which a Pounds 36.8m management buy-out from Coats Viyella in 1989 might be
refinanced. 'There is no pressure from the venture capitalists, but their
dividend demands get more painful as time goes on', said Mr Mansfield.
Pre-tax profits have been rising steadily, reaching Pounds 7.1m on sales of
Pounds 48.3m in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. Profits
for 1993 are likely to be higher.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Motor World advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer floated last
February, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.65m, against Pounds 2.29m,
for the year to October 31. On a pro forma basis profits rose by 17 per
cent, from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 3.9m.
Motor World's shares, which rose sharply after being floated at 210p,
yesterday closed 8p higher at 373p.
Group sales grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 39.4m although the packaging and
distribution division's turnover was flat at Pounds 9.8m.
The retail division's sales at Pounds 29.6m were ahead 21 per cent, and
operating profits rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 2.9m. This reflected
increased customer spend per visit through intensive sales training, a full
contribution from 34 branches acquired during the previous financial year,
and sales from 28 branches bought during the period.
Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, said the group was operating 201
stores by the end of October, and was on target to have 224 by the end of
the current year, not including possible acquisitions. He looked forward to
the coming year with 'quiet confidence'.
Mr Kershaw saw good opportunities for growth of the group's core business by
expanding into the south of England and Scotland, as well as further
infilling its network in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales.
Operating profits in the packaging and division slipped from Pounds 1.3m to
Pounds 1.2m as a result of poor demand from fast-fit retailers, the
division's largest customers, but there was an increase in orders at the end
of 1993. The group said marketing improvements and cost-savings should bear
fruit in future years.
Gearing at the year-end stood at 13 per cent, and is not expected to rise
above 20 per cent.
Pro forma earnings per share were 19.7p compared with 16p. A final dividend
of 4.7p gives a total for the year of 7p.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sinclair buys Zeneca peat bog business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
William Sinclair Holdings, a supplier of a range of products to the
gardening and horticulture markets, has acquired Zeneca's compost business
for Pounds 2.76m.
Net assets involved are Pounds 2.4m. Turnover for the business for the year
ended December 31 1993 is estimated at Pounds 3.7m with profits before tax
and interest of Pounds 436,000.
The purchase will add about 1,850 acres of peat bogs to Sinclair's peat
reserves.
Included in the deal is a modern compost production plant near Carlise. This
should enable Sinclair to process certain products in their range near to
the raw material production source.
Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of William Sinclair, said the acquisition was
strategically important for the company.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Restatement cuts Embassy to Pounds 1.25m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Embassy Property Group, the development and construction company, has
published restated figures for the year to end-March 1993.
The outcome is a reduction in the previously reported pre-tax figure from
Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.25m and a drop in earnings per share from 3.03p to
2.3p.
In September last year, when reporting its results, the USM-quoted group
announced it was examining ways to refinance part of its debt and to raise
additional funds. The shares were temporarily suspended pending details of
the refinancing.
As part of the negotiations, the company considered it appropriate to have a
formal valuation on some of its properties.
The valuation highlighted reduced net realisable values, and the resulting
deficit has been incorporated in the 1993 accounts.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Berisford shareholders give go-ahead for
Magnet takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Berisford International, the former commodity and property
group, voted in favour of the Pounds 56m reverse takeover of Magnet, the
kitchen and joinery manufacturer and retailer, at a special meeting
yesterday.
The meeting also approved the increase in share capital necessary for the
1-for-2 rights issue at 120p which is financing the purchase.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the acquisition was 'an ideal first step in
Berisford's growth strategy'. He said it was 'the best news' he had been
able to announce since becoming chairman in 1990 and was the 'first step in
building a successful conglomerate'.
One shareholder suggested the rights price was at too small a discount to
the 128p suspension price. Mr Sclater said that when the shares resumed
trading - this morning - he had 'a suspicion you may have a nice surprise'.
Brokers expect the shares to open at a significant premium to the suspension
price.
The same shareholder was concerned that the move represented a
diversification from Berisford's old core business. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief
executive, said he was pleased to say that 'no-one on your board has
experience of the old core business'. He said Berisford was 'a new company
going forward in a new business'.
The EGM was preceded by the AGM, when Mr Sclater said that trading was in
line with budget. Ketlon, the automotive components subsidiary had 'just
received a large inaugural order from Honda'.
The recent earthquake in Los Angeles had not injured employees or damaged
Berisford's property there. However, 'it is clear there will be some
disruption to business over the coming months'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed three-way merger between Europa Minerals, a small UK-quoted
mining finance house, and two Australian groups with which it is already
closely associated - Burmine and Austmin Gold - was thrown into further
confusion yesterday when the Supreme Court of Western Australia granted an
injunction preventing the formal offer being made until at least February 9,
writes Kenneth Gooding.
Mount Edon, another small Australian gold producer which has made a counter
offer for Burmine, obtained the injunction by claiming that the proposed
Pounds 15m offer by Burmine for Europa would be in breach of Australian
Corporations Law and incapable of being implemented in its present form.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Biotechnology, jute and oil in a jam jar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An oil slick in a jam jar was yesterday used to demonstrate plans by
Titaghur, the owner of six jute mills in Calcutta, to move into
biotechnology.
The crowded annual meeting approved the delayed accounts showing that
Titaghur had incurred a loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 4.3m on
turnover of Pounds 29m in the year to end-March 1993, taking the accumulated
deficit to Pounds 61m.
Mr Reg Brealey, chairman, attributed the latest loss to inconsistent
supplies of raw jute. He apologised to shareholders at London's Charing
Cross Hotel for the delay in presenting the accounts, blaming problems in
Calcutta. Accounting there was not computerised, but was all done by hand,
he explained.
Since last March the group has made two acquisitions - West Midlands
Surfacing, a road maintenance company, and Knoydart Peninsula, a Scottish
estate to be used for youth training.
Mr Joseph Lowe, head of the new Titaghur Environmental offshoot, said the
group was planning two areas of development in biotechnology.
The first involves organic material that soaks up oil but rejects water. It
will be put into jute bags and held in place over oil and other spillages by
jute booms. The absorbed pollutant can then be disposed of safely.
The second involves the commercial production of spirulina platensis, a
blue-green algae which has existed for 3 1/2 bn years and contains three
times the protein in soya.
The algae, which in its dried form smells like seaweed and sells at Pounds
186 a kilo, can be grown in open ponds, but Titaghur claims to be the first
company to produce it in a closed circuit system, guaranteeing purity.

Corporation of Canada, the rapidly expanding North American soft drinks
company.
Last week Cott entered the European market through a five-year agreement
with Cadbury Schweppes under which Cadbury bottling plants will produce
drinks for a newly-formed Cott subsidiary in Europe.
Cott is the leading producer of the private-label colas which are making big
inroads into the US market. It has grown rapidly by supplying North American
supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart with own-label colas. Profits at the
nine-month stage to end-October last year were more than doubled to CDollars
26.2m (Pounds 13.2m) on turnover that also more than doubled to CDollars
502m.
Mr Gerald Pencer, chief executive of Cott, said that the acquisition marked
Cott's move into the UK market and was part of its wider strategy of
developing into Europe.
The Canadian company is initially paying Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of Ben
Shaw's Pontefract canning line operation, which had a turnover of Pounds 40m
in the 11 months to the end of December last year.
Last August, Rutland paid Pounds 5.7m for 84 per cent of Ben Shaw's, a
family-owned firm that ran into trouble through over ambitious expansion.
Mr Michael Langdon, chairman of Rutland, said Cott had the option to buy a
further 31.5 per cent of the Pontefract operation in 12 months time for a
minimum of a further Pounds 5m and a maximum of Pounds 7.5m, depending on
1994 earnings. Rutland would retain 17.5 per cent.
Mr Langdon, who is also chairman of Ben Shaw's and will be joining the board
of Cott in the UK, said the company had rationalised its canning operations
and aggressively pursued sales to the big UK supermarkets.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: One investor buys rump of Trafalgar rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rump of Trafalgar House's Pounds 404m rights issue was bought entirely
by one investor, believed to be a Scottish institution, in an auction
arranged by the underwriters yesterday.
The 1-for-3 rights issue of convertible preference shares, offered at 100p,
was taken up by 91.5 per cent of shareholders.
That left 30.2m shares for which the underwriters had to find subscribers.
The proceeds from selling these shares goes to shareholders who did not take
up their rights.
The attraction to the buyer was said to be the yield on the shares. They
offer a 6 per cent net rate of interest, but to a non-taxpaying investor,
and at the 141 1/4 p bid price, the yield is about 5.3 per cent.
Instead of taking the usual route of placing the shares, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Robert Fleming auctioned them at 4.30pm yesterday. The
winning bid came from one institution which put in an 'all or nothing' bid
at 141 1/4 p. Another institution was a close second with a bid for the lot
at 141p.
The price compares with a closing price of 139 1/2 p to 140 1/2 p for the
convertibles. Trafalgar House shares rose 5p to 109p.
Although there was a higher bid for a smaller amount, at 141 1/2 p, the
average of bids, excluding the two 'all or nothing' offers, was 140.316p.
SBC said that the auction had produced a better price for shareholders than
the usual placing method. The auction was brought to the UK equity market
last year when a number of companies offered enhanced scrip dividends with a
cash alternative provided through selling unwanted shares.
However, the use of the auction in a rights issue has ruffled some feathers.
One institutional investor which did not bid in the auction said yesterday,
'usually if you underwrite an issue you expect to get a chance at the rump'.
Brokers involved played down suggestions of a row, saying everyone's first
concern was to get the best price for shareholders.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Haynes Publishing shows 40% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Max Pearce, chief executive of Haynes Publishing Group, said that the
company's profits for the six months to November 30 marked the
near-completion of the turnaround in its fortunes following a difficult few
years.
Pre-tax profits of the publisher of car and motorcycle maintenance manuals
advanced 40 per cent from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.11m pre-tax on turnover
up 12 per cent at Pounds 12.4m, against Pounds 11.1m. Earnings per share
rose from a restated 5.9p to 8.1p and the directors declared an interim
dividend of 4p (2.3p restated for November's 1-for-2 scrip).
The improved profits performance derived equally from UK and US operations.
The UK trading companies saw operating profits rise 34 per cent to Pounds
1.11m on turnover up just 2 per cent to Pounds 6.47m. Mr Pearce said
substantial efficiency gains and continuing retrenchment in lossmaking
general publishing activities had helped profitability. In the past three
years the company's payroll has fallen by a third to 200.
US sales continued to grow and, at Pounds 5.94m (Pounds 4.77m), now account
for nearly half the company's total. Higher turnover represented both
improved trading conditions and continuing gains in market share. US
operating profits - at Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 1.23m) - rose 13 per cent in
dollar terms but were 30 per cent higher when measured in sterling owing to
favourable exchange rate movements. Mr Pearce said that the completion in
November of a new printing facility would yield further advances in the US.
The company's cash position also improved sharply. Borrowings were
eliminated in August, having peaked at Pounds 5.2m in December 1990. By
November 30 the company had Pounds 2.4m on deposit.
Mr John Haynes, chairman, said the company's fortunes were closely linked to
new car sales, and the recent upturn in the US and UK would further assist
recovery. The shares closed down 8p at 490p.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Interest income helps ML halve loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in interest income helped ML Laboratories, the pharmaceutical
research company which recently won UK approval for its kidney drug
Icodextrin, to halve pre-tax losses from Pounds 887,000 to Pounds 453,000 in
the year to September 30.
Interest earnings on its Pounds 13.6m cash balances, the product of a Pounds
15.8m rights issue in 1992, pushed investment income up from Pounds 420,000
to Pounds 1.3m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 118,000).
The group said yesterday that it was at an advanced stage in negotiations
with international companies over marketing and distributing the renal
dialysis drug which was approved in January. Mr Stuart Sim, finance
director, said that in the event the negotiations failed, ML was running its
own parallel distribution programme to about 100 renal units in the UK. ML
was prepared to 'go it alone' if it could not reach satisfactory
arrangements with other companies, he said.
ML, which has not made an annual profit since its 1987 flotation, is
expected to receive an income for the first time this year from sales of the
drug. It has applied for approval of Icodextrin in the rest of Europe and
expects licensing by the middle of the year. Mr Sim said the group would
then seek licences in the US and Japan.
ML estimates that there are about 500,000 dialysis patients worldwide, and
that the market would grow by a compound annual rate of 9 per cent. In the
past Mr Sim has estimated the market for Icodextrin - which makes it
possible for patients to go longer between fluid changes and has fewer side
effects than other drugs - is about Pounds 487m a year.
ML said it planned to apply for approval of its respiratory drug this year,
and expected approval in 1995. However, discussions were already under way
on a commercial distribution agreement and it was possible that an advance
payment might be made as part of an agreement.
ML's sales, the result of consultancy work, rose from Pounds 604,000 to
Pounds 823,000. Losses per share fell from 3.5p to 0.3p. There is no
dividend.
ML spent about Pounds 2.2m on research and development, similar to last
year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glimmer of hope over Richmond Oil relisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, the natural resources company which has lost or sold
virtually all of its original assets over the past two years, yesterday
offered shareholders a glimmer of hope by suggesting that its shares might
resume trading in the next few weeks.
Long-suffering investors, who have watched the share price fall from a peak
of 173p to September's suspension price of 4 1/2 p, were told at the annual
meeting that Richmond was in negotiations which could lead to a relisting.
Richmond is understood to be in talks with its joint venture partner,
Northstar Energy, a Panamanian company owned by Annum International, a
Luxembourg vehicle for Lithuanian and US interests. Northstar last year
bought 85 per cent of Richmond's interest in a Russian joint venture to
enhance production in a Siberian oil field. It is understood that this
interest, along with some other properties, may be sold back to Richmond in
return for shares.
Northstar is also understood to be seeking board representation. Richmond
has just four directors, three of whom are non-executive, following the
resignations last month of its chairman and managing director. Discussions
with Northstar are expected to be concluded within the next six weeks.
Richmond also unveiled a sharp jump in interim losses from Pounds 386,000 to
Pounds 963,000 for the six months to September 30. Turnover fell from Pounds
1.5m to Pounds 34,000.
The company also stated that it had agreed a revised price for the sale of
its coalbed methane properties, which have been the subject of protracted
disputes. Richmond had received Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m), instead of Dollars
6.2m, in return for enhanced repurchase options. There is the possibility of
up to a further Dollars 1.1m, depending on the resolution of the disputes.
The directors stated in the 1993 results, published last month, that the
company's commercial future depended on receiving a minimum consideration of
Dollars 5.5m.

Standard Life is cutting interim bonus rates for 1994 on with-profits
endowment policies and unitised with-profits policies. The company said
lower interest rates had reduced its expectations of future returns on its
investments.
Values of longer-term policies maturing this year are slightly higher, due
to good investment returns over the life of the policy, but payouts on
shorter term policies have been reduced.
The value of a 25 year with-profits endowment maturing this month, taken out
by a man aged 29, is Pounds 63,832, up 0.7 per cent from last year, while a
10-year policy would pay Pounds 6,472, down 5.4 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pioneering package from Reuters -
Institutions study pay performance scheme for executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the international financial information and news group, is
pioneering a form of executive remuneration which links rewards of senior
executives directly to the group's future returns to shareholders.
The scheme is being studied by investment institutions and other FT-SE 100
companies, which must decide soon how to replace the executive share option
schemes which many companies adopted 10 years ago following changes in UK
tax law.
Institutions have made it clear they will support only share option schemes
which are performance-related, but there is still widespread debate over
which indicators best reflect executive achievement.
Reuters has decided that instead of conventional share options, it will
offer senior executives a long-term incentive scheme, in addition to their
base salary and annual cash bonus.
The scheme yields benefits worth up to or more than annual salary if
Reuters' longer-term performance is rated good or outstanding, but nothing
if it is inadequate. Performance is measured by comparing the cash return to
a shareholder, including dividends, from investing in Reuters with that from
other companies in the FT-SE 100, over three to five years.
Executives are awarded restricted shares at the beginning of the performance
period, which are released at the end of five years, subject to performance
criteria. No shares are released if Reuters is ranked in the last 25
companies, but all are released if it is in the top 40, with a graduated
release between these two points.
The driving force behind the new approach is Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman
of Reuters, who is one of the UK's most respected managers and an adviser to
the Cadbury committee on corporate governance.
Sir Christopher said the main weakness in current share option schemes was
that they assumed a tight linkage between management performance and share
price. This was fallacious, because other factors could be influential, and
there could be time-lags between management actions and their impact on
results.
He said: 'Shareholders can, on occasion, feel that managers have been
excessively rewarded by share option schemes. Managers, on the other hand,
can view option schemes as a bit of a lottery - and unfair as well in that
background conditions can vary uncontrollably . . .
'In particular, managers can do very well out of a strong stock market, even
though their own company's results - and share price performance - may have
been relatively poor. Conversely, an excellent set of company results may
produce little or no stock option benefits if the stock market has fallen
significantly during the option period.'
Reuters considered measuring management performance by other criteria - such
as return on assets, cashflow or profit margins.
The chairman said: 'The trouble is that they all measure past performance
only - and that only in accounting terms. Furthermore, they are best
measured as different parts of a total approach, since none of them provides
a satisfactory total view.
'Earnings per share comes nearest, but is still limited in what it actually
measures and is also open to material variation, both as between companies
and from one period to another, by virtue of different accounting
treatments.'
Sir Christopher hoped the Reuters scheme - which initially covers 17
executives - would contribute to the looming UK debate on executive
remuneration.
Boston Consultancy Group, the strategic management consultant which helped
to develop the scheme, calculated the return from Reuters would have been in
the top 40 of FT-SE 100 companies in five of the past six years.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Suppliers adopt relaxed stance -
Suppliers' Opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bigger players in the UK motor components industry were taking a relaxed
view of the takeover last night.
Companies like T&amp;N and Lucas have a manufacturing presence in most
car-producing nations of what has become a global industry.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N's chairman and a past president of the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'From our point of view it's neither
negative nor positive. As a first-tier supplier, with plants in both
countries, we have always assumed that a continuing rationalisation of the
car industry would take place. So there is nothing dramatic about this when
it involves the linkage of two of our customers who are already well
established'.
However, the deal was seen as enhancing the prospects of smaller UK-based
suppliers which do not have any significant overseas presence.
Many such suppliers have improved their efficiency and productivity as a
result of their links with best-practice Japanese 'transplant' car factories
in the UK. This, coupled with low labour and other costs in the UK, compared
with Germany, is likely to prompt BMW to scour the UK more rigorously for
cheaper alternatives to German parts.
So far, however, BMW has been slower than other German car makers to
increase components purchases in the UK. Whereas Volkswagen expects to spend
about Pounds 400m on UK components this year - double 1992 levels - there
has been little increase on BMW's 1992 total UK spend of some Pounds 120m -
a figure that includes purchase of all goods and services.
Mr Graham Perkins, motor industry specialist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountant, noted that 'already UK suppliers are being inundated with German
estimate requests'.
With cost considerations pushing the German car manufacturers to widen their
sources of components, Mr Joe Gormezano of Knibb, Gormezano, the motor
industry consultants, said: 'Going in with Rover will give BMW access to a
number of component suppliers'.
Against such a background, there are two niggling fears. First, that BMW
might use its new position as an opportunity to help their established
German suppliers, desperate for work.
Second, that BMW might take back to Germany the research and development
work Rover is doing with its systems suppliers.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Rich British ancestry fails to provide
independent future - End of an era
</HEADLINE>

Three men in particular dominate the tortuous recent history of what has
become the Rover Group: Donald Stokes, Michael Edwardes and Graham Day.
Stokes, who started his working life as an apprentice at the Leyland truck
company in the 1930s and rose to become its chairman, was persuaded in 1968
by Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, to run the British-owned
vehicle industry.
Wilson's policy was to encourage the UK's chief strategic industries to
become more internationally competitive via mergers and then to select the
best management available to run them.
When the British Motor Corporation and Leyland merged in 1968, Stokes was
responsible for a group making more than 1m vehicles a year, with 40 per
cent of the UK new car market, 30 factories and about 200,000 employees.
BMC could trace its origins back to the early days of the motor industry;
the first Rover was a bicycle made by the Starley company in 1884.
Companies encompassed by Stokes's new British Leyland Motor Corporation, was
enviable: apart from Rover it included Austin, Jaguar, Land Rover, MG,
Morris, Standard, Triumph, and Wolseley.
Stokes made his reputation selling British trucks worldwide and he and his
team were out of their depth managing a huge business still suffering from
years of under-investment.
British Leyland also faced increasingly fierce competition as the UK began
opening up to rival European manufacturers and had to deal with powerful
trade unions which almost invariably used strikes to resist any attempt to
reform outdated working practices.
When the world motor industry was sent reeling by the oil supply crises,
which started in 1973, British Leyland's finances were already fragile.
Even the successful truck operations were suffering: they had been drained
of investment funds used to subsidise the lossmaking car businesses.
In 1975 the Labour government bought out British Leyland's private
shareholders. Two years later Michael Edwardes, a South African who had made
his name as chief executive of the Chloride batteries group, became
chairman.
He persuaded first the Labour government, and then the Conservatives, to
provide British Leyland with funds to revamp its range of cars, and made the
first contacts with Honda to share costs through co-operative ventures.
But Edwardes will mainly be remembered for his determined and successful
efforts to break the power of the unions within the car plants and to reform
work practices.
Edwardes succeeded where Stokes failed partly because he could threaten the
ultimate sanction - to close down the company permanently.
During his time with British Leyland, which he renamed BL, it absorbed
Pounds 2bn of state aid but still accumulated losses of Pounds 2.6bn.
Edwardes found himself increasingly at odds with Margaret Thatcher after she
became prime minister. She pointed out that the aid to BL represented Pounds
200 for every man, woman and child in the UK. She wanted the group broken up
and sold off. Edwardes moved out in 1982.
The management team he left behind were hamstrung by Thatcher's refusal to
provide BL with more money. They sold Jaguar in 1984 via a stock market
flotation (it was subsequently bought by Ford) but in 1986 Thatcher lost
patience and sent in Graham Day, fresh from rationalising British
Shipbuilders, to sort out BL.
Early on, Day came close to selling the whole business in two chunks to the
two biggest US vehicle groups - trucks to General Motors and cars to Ford -
but that fell through because Thatcher feared a political backlash.
Day continued to reshape the car business, cutting production to viable
levels while moving the range upmarket with the help of Honda, now the
dominant partner in the engineering-design co-operation arrangements.
BL was sliced up and sold off: trucks to DAF of the Netherlands; buses to a
management group which sold on to Volvo of Sweden; Unipart, the spare parts
operations, to a group of financial institutions, and finally BL, renamed
yet again Rover, to British Aerospace.
That controversial deal was heralded by Thatcher's government as one which
kept Rover 'British' by putting it safely into the hands of the UK's biggest
engineering group.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Emotion versus analysis - Midlands Pride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emotion went one way and commercial analysis another as Rover, the icon of
West Midlands industry, slid into German hands yesterday.
The change in ownership struck different chords throughout the region but
nowhere was it a matter of indifference.
The proportion of the regional workforce engaged in manufacturing remains
higher than the national average. 'One in six jobs is dependent on the
vehicles and vehicle components sector, and Rover is the largest single
player in that,' said Mr Chris Tillett, economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountant.
At its Longbridge car plant and at its Solihull Land-Rover and Range Rover
plant, the group employs 22,000 out of its total workforce of 33,000. Also,
Rover is spending Pounds 2bn a year on components. 'The group is heavily
tied into local suppliers,' noted Mr Tillett.
'It is leading the West Midlands out of recession,' according to Mr John
Gunn, director of the regional Confederation of British Industry.
'It has come to symbolise the recovery of West Midlands industry with its
attention to quality and paying attention to what the customer wants.'
Yet Rover's role as a source of jobs has diminished. Even after the
convulsions in the group during the late 1970s and the early 1980s, it had,
in 1984, a payroll of 96,000. Since Rover and its predecessor companies
account for a large slice of Midlands industrial and social history, its
future is a matter not just of economic interest but of emotional concern.
Last Friday, at the annual banquet of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce,
mention of Rover's recovery in recent years drew the most animated response
to any remark made in the speeches.
Yesterday, after the announcement, Radio WM, the BBC's local radio station,
was hit by an avalanche of calls.
Mr Tony Butler, host of the station's morning show, said 30 calls had been
broadcast. 'At least half the calls were anti-German and 85 to 90 per cent
were against the sale.' Callers suggested a Land-Rover management buy-out
would be better. 'There was a feeling British Aerospace had sold them
short,' said Mr Butler.
Chauvinism was at large, with evocations of the bombing of Longbridge. 'I
understand the emotional reaction - it's one we can all share, but I see
more upside potential than downside,' said Mr Bob Moore, chief executive of
the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.
'Anybody with red, white and blue in his heart will feel it's a pity,' said
Mr Joe Gormezano, of Knibb, Gormezano, the motor industry consultant. 'But
Rover is not viable on its own from a European point of view.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Foothold in a low-cost manufacturing
base - German Message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High up in the company's cylindrical tower block on the outskirts of Munich
a few months ago, a BMW board member gazed wistfully in the direction of the
Czech border. 'They work there for a whole day for the wages we pay a German
worker for one hour,' - adding that BMW's largest challenge was to reduce
costs.
One important aspect of the Rover takeover is that it gives BMW a high-level
industrial foothold in a country now generally recognised as one of western
Europe's lowest-cost manufacturing bases.
The deal extends a long list of German investments in Britain in recent
years - underlining Britain's accelerated economic integration with the rest
of the Continent.
The sale of a prestigious manufacturing name will be labelled by some
British industrialists as an unsatisfactory 'sell-out' to foreign interests.
Negative effects on employment would certainly result from any transfer
abroad of headquarters' functions such as marketing and development
activities. However, the deal marks further public recognition by a large
German company that the UK is an effective place to do business - a step
that should be positive for jobs and investment.
The deal sends a message to German workers about the need to keep costs down
as German motor and engineering groups signal their desire to shift some
production abroad.
Coincidentally, the takeover was announced on a day of warning strikes by
the IG Metall trade union to press home demands for a pay rise of up to 6
per cent. One German investment banker said yesterday the acquisition would
provide BMW with a 'useful yardstick' to help press for more streamlined and
lower-cost production at home. He said BMW could now effectively put its
workers into competition with Rover employees on productivity and quality
standards.
According to the German-British Chamber of Commerce, the value of German
investments in the UK rose to DM26.1bn at the end of 1992 compared with
DM22.1bn at end-1990 and only DM8.7bn at end-1985. British investments in
west Germany have risen far more slowly, to DM13.6bn at end-1992 against
DM10.7bn at end-1985.
A survey by the chamber at the beginning of the 1990s cited good labour
relations and high productivity as main factors encouraging German companies
to boost UK investments.
At current exchange rates, British manufacturing wages are 65 to 75 per cent
of German levels, although the differential can be smaller in high
technology sectors such as chemicals. More importantly, British non-wage
charges - primarily social security levies - are only about 40 per cent of
wage costs, compared with 85 to 100 per cent in Germany.
Heading the league table of German takeovers in the UK have been the
acquisitions in 1989 by Deutsche Bank of Morgan Grenfell, which cost Pounds
950m, and by Siemens and GEC of Plessey, valued at Pounds 2bn.
Although German groups have largely been satisfied with their UK
experiences, not all German takeovers have been success stories. In the late
1980s, Hochtief, the construction group, bought a 25 per cent stake in Rush
&amp; Tompkins, but the deal turned sour when the UK contractor went into
receivership in 1990.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Unions seek jobs reassurance - Workers
react
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union leaders yesterday sought reassurances from Rover that workers at the
group's seven sites would not face cutbacks or involuntary redundancies
following the BMW acquisition.
The deal, however, appeared to enjoy support from workers on the Rover
factory floor in contrast to the more cautious approach of union leaders.
Rover directors, expected to address workforce meetings today, are also
being urged to give undertakings that the deal will not mean plant closures.
Calls to protect working practices for more than 30,000 members of the TGWU
general, AEEU engineering and MSF white-collar unions were led by the Trades
Union Congress.
Mr John Monks, general secretary, said: 'The TUC will be supporting the
unions in Rover in securing real guarantees from BMW that jobs will not be
threatened and that research and development and component supply will
remain in the UK.'
His comment followed warnings from the International Metalworkers Federation
that BMW could try to impose new practices on Rover workers.
The Zurich-based federation, whose members include IG Metall, the union at
BMW, said the company had good relations with its German workforce but had
taken an anti-union stance in the US.
The federation's warning prompted calls for further safeguards from the
AEEU, which represents some 6,000 Rover workers.
Mr John Allen, the union's chief negotiator at Rover, said: 'Our first
priority must be the workforce, and we would like some assurances as to
long-term job security.'
Yesterday, however, workers coming off shift at Rover's Solihull plant -
home to Land-Rover production - did not appear as concerned as their union
leaders.
Those prepared to comment expressed no hostility to the new holding company.
Mr Dale Clarke, a maintenance supervisor, described BMW's planned
acquisition as 'a good move forward for us.' He said: 'It's also good we're
keeping the links with Honda. So the future looks rosy.'
Mr Steve Pitchford, a setter operator for 25 years, was more equivocal. 'I
want to know more facts. But BMW is a good company which makes good models.
The announcement could be for the best. As long as it keeps me in
employment, I don't mind.'
That pragmatic approach was not universal. Mr John Doyle, an assembly fitter
for 15 years, branded the deal 'a bit of a sell-out. I think BMW is after
this place; they're not interested in the cars.'
Union negotiators are expected to seek comparable conditions with workers at
BMW's Munich and Regensburg plants, where working hours and annual leave are
more favourable.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: A quick route into new market segments -
BMW Attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   BMW has chosen the short route
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the cheapest - to fulfil its long-term aim of expanding its core car
business into new market segments.
As Mr Volker Doppelfeld, finance director, explained yesterday in Munich,
the long route would be to move step by step from its upmarket saloon-based
range.
In the event, the Pounds 800m bill for Rover is the amount the German
carmaker would normally spend on developing a single new model.
Included in the price, he added, were 17 brands, including the Land-Rover,
Range Rover, and derivatives which came equipped with 'the most interesting,
the best, and the longest heritage in off-the-road vehicles'.
'It was our aim for a long time to move into new business segments and new
markets. This agreement paves the way for the next 20 or 30 years of BMW's
development,' Mr Doppelfeld said.
The way to the Rover takeover was prepared when the company took a hard look
at itself and its markets two years ago. That was when management saw -
through the fog of recession - that it was losing the battle in the US.
BMW sales had tumbled, and although no-one was having an easy time in the
world's biggest and most competitive market, the Japanese were gaining
share.
As others, notably Mr Ferdinand Piech (e umlaut), head of Volkswagen, have
since agreed, BMW had convinced itself that the carmaker which loses the US
market also loses the global battle.
BMW cut its prices in the US to stabilise a situation in which sales were
falling close to 50,000 a year in 1991 compared with almost 100,000 in 1988.
With registrations of 73,000 cars last year, BMW now claims more than 7 per
cent of the US trade in quality motors.
Mercedes-Benz, lagging with 62,000 registrations last year, has been pushed
into an unaccustomed secondary role.
Part of BMW's success has to be attributed to the introduction in the late
1980s of cost-cutting programmes and new working practices to enhance
productivity, which are only now becoming common elsewhere in German
manufacturing.
Although it has made more progress on costs than its domestic rivals, BMW
still suffers from the problems of all German car makers, including the
highest wage rates and almost the shorter working weeks of any of its global
competitors.
BMW has also been bolstered by the internationally-successful launch of its
revamped entry level 3-S series, which reminded the company - and its rivals
 -of the value of innovation and keeping interest alive. Now, while Mercedes
is aiming to regain its crown with the help of its new C-class cars, BMW is
pressing on with a new wave of variations on its classic theme.
This spring sees the launch of a shortened, 2-door version of the acclaimed
3-series, to be followed later this year with a new 7-series car. Just in
time for the start of the expected international recovery from recession,
this is the model on which BMW is pinning most hopes for further and more
profitable advances in the US. end As a first step, the purchase will double
the group's 3 per cent share of the European car market.
The purchase of Rover will inject new models, expertise and opportunities
into BMW. But, in fact, both companies are bound to benefit from
cross-fertilisation of ideas and improved market penetration.
While Rover was the only important European vehicle maker to increase sales
last year, only 11,000 of its cars were registered in Germany, Mr Doppelfeld
said. And of 70,000 off-the-road vehicles sold, only 1,300 were bought by
Germans.
Although BMW officials stressed that managements, development programmes and
sales networks would be kept separate, there were obvious gains to be made
from selling the Range Rover and other four-wheel drive vehicles through
BMW's domestic distribution chain.
There were also distinct possibilities for returning the British group's
cars to the long abandoned US market.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Rover ownership contentious to the end -
BAe Liberated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace's ownership of Rover is proving contentious to the last.
When the merger was first announced, six years ago today, the air was thick
with accusations about state assets being sold for a song. Now, it seems,
comes the proof.
BAe paid Pounds 150m and is getting Pounds 800m. It will book a profit of
some Pounds 400m on the deal. Its shares rose 12 per cent yesterday. The UK
car industry is being sold down the river, and the UK taxpayer loses again,
charge critics of the deal .
Not at all, says BAe. 'It's totally unrealistic to draw a direct comparison
between the Pounds 150m and the Pounds 800m,' Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief
executive said. 'Our total investment is many, many times Pounds 150m.'
The point is reiterated by Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director.
'I'm not sure we're ahead on the deal at all,' he said. 'It's quite
difficult to get a handle on it. We invested the original money, then we had
to pay back the sweeteners (Pounds 57m BAe had to repay the UK government)
and then we invested between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m of capital
expenditure a year. During that time, we got almost nothing out.'
There is room for scepticism here. First, the Pounds 1bn-plus of capital
expenditure was largely financed by Rover itself. Second, BAe extracted a
large but unspecified amount of land and property from Rover over the years,
and will hold on to it after the BMW deal goes through.
The cynic might say that Rover was merely parked with BAe by the UK
government for six years, until its sale to a foreign owner became
politically acceptable. If so, Mr Lapthorne insists, BAe did no more than
break even on the parking fee.
However, he adds, 'we enjoyed living in a house with a posh car outside it.
It made us look wealthier than we were.' In other words, he says, Rover's
assets inflated BAe's balance sheet. 'With that assistance, we were able to
carry through some quite difficult decisions.'
The Pounds 400m profit due in the 1994 accounts, says Mr Lapthorne, is a
pure book-keeping item. For the technically minded, it goes as follows. When
Rover was acquired, BAe wrote its assets up by Pounds 850m. Under new
accounting rules on disposals, this must be written back as negative
goodwill, giving rise to an Pounds 850m profit. But Rover is being sold for
Pounds 450m below book value, so the resulting profit is only Pounds 400m.
But the benefits of the deal are by no means illusory, says Mr Lapthorne.
'You have to get clear the distinction between book-keeping and banking.' At
present, BAe has a daily average of Pounds 200m debt on its balance sheet
attributable to Rover, and another Pounds 700m off balance sheet tied up in
working capital. Add to that the Pounds 800m proceeds of the deal and BAe
will save or receive interest on a total of Pounds 1.7bn. Thus, says Mr
Lapthorne, his interest bill drops by Pounds 120m a year.
So what will BAe do with the difference? Mr Evans was coy about this
yesterday, beyond saying BAe would use it to strengthen its defence and
aerospace businesses. However, the general thinking is clear enough. 'Having
cars and aerospace together is financially daft,' Mr Lapthorne says. 'Both
of them are financially intensive, and both need a strong balance sheet.
That can be seen as a source of weakness if people know you can't afford to
go both ways. Now, we can sit round any table in the world in the aerospace
industry, and we're strong.'
The inference is plain. In the defence business particularly, the up-front
costs of development can be formidable, and not all customers can afford
them. Now, BAe is in a position to offer more financial help to customers as
a means of clinching the contract.
This also offers a clue to why BAe was so adamant that it wanted an assured
exit route from Rover, and indeed why it was prepared to sell at a low point
in the cycle. Financing stocks in the car industry is hugely expensive, even
in a downturn. In an upturn it could become prohibitive.
'The problem would always be', says Mr Lapthorne, 'that if the thing went
marvellously well, would we have the clout to back it fully? And what if it
coincided with something big in the rest of the business?'
But if BAe is now clear from its adventures in the car trade, it still has
plenty of problems on its plate: for instance, in its regional aircraft and
turboprop businesses. In both, Mr Evans said yesterday, the aim is still to
reduce BAe's involvement.
For many months, it has been struggling to clinch a deal with Taiwan on
setting up a joint venture in regional aircraft production. 'The ball is
firmly in Taiwan's court,' Mr Evans says. 'It they want to do a deal, it
will have to be on the basis of the existing agreement. Progressively, we'll
have to talk to other parties, and I guess that eventually we'll have to
talk to Fokker' (the Dutch manufacturer, now controlled by Deutsche
Aerospace).
In both regional jets and turboprops, Mr Evans says, the aim is for BAe to
end up with 20-25 per cent of world class businesses. Given that BAe is also
a minority stakeholder in the Airbus project, that leaves defence as its
only wholly-owned activity.
In that respect, it bears a curious resemblance to Britain's other big
defence contractor, GEC. There have been rumours of talks between the two,
with Lord Weinstock of GEC reportedly keen to merge the two businesses and
BAe reluctant. Where do matters stand now?
'There is nothing going on at the moment,' Mr Evans says, 'except that
they're keen to buy our space business. But there are a lot of other areas
where there are opportunities and connections between us, both horizontal
and vertical. The question is whether we should concentrate on horizontal
links, which are much more manageable, rather than bringing two bloody great
businesses together in a nuclear explosion.'
That apart, BAe insists on the vital importance of yesterday's announcement.
'It's pivotal,' Mr Lapthorne says. 'It gives us positive options,' adds Mr
Evans. 'Before, everything was a fire fight.'
Before this is accepted uncritically, one nagging question remains. BAe has
worked hard to return to its core in defence and aerospace, shedding
businesses as diverse as cars, property development and civil engineering on
the way. But those core businesses were what it started with a decade ago.
Both markets have become progressively less attractive in the interim. If
leaving them made sense then, what makes returning so wonderful now?

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Government shaken by backbench concern -
Political Storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was taken aback yesterday at the scale of concern expressed
by its own backbenchers over the loss of ownership of Britain's last big
volume car manufacturer.
Although many Conservative MPs welcomed the fact that BMW was prepared to
pay Pounds 800m for Rover when it was sold to British Aerospace five years
ago for just Pounds 150m, there was deep unease that no British buyer could
be found.
Mr Simon Coombs (Swindon) urged Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, 'to
learn a lesson from the fact that there is no potential British purchaser of
this excellent company'.
He urged the Department of Trade and Industry 'to try to work out why that
is the case?'.
His view was echoed by Mr John Butcher, (Coventry South West) who warned
that many people in the Midlands were 'anxious about the sale' and wanted
reassurances about the deal.
Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East) said it was regrettable that the sale was
completed without the consent of Honda, which still controls 20 per cent of
Rover.
He asked Mr Sainsbury to ensure that the link between Honda and Rover was
maintained.
While Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) raised the possibility that BMW may
want to build BMW cars in Rover plants.
However, MPs on both side of the House were privately resigned to Britain
losing ownership of Rover.
Mr Sainsbury said ownership of Rover was a very low priority compared to the
profitability of the company. He was supported by many on his own side when
he argued that the real damage done to Rover was by bad industrial relations
when the taxpayer had to spend billions of pounds on a loss making
state-owned enterprise.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow industry spokesman, singled out the sale
price as confirmation that the government had sold the company off too
cheaply to BAe five years ago.
'What is quite clear from today's purchase price is BMW has paid more than
five times the amount for which this Government sold Rover group only five
years ago.
'That clearly confirms the Audit Office's view that the price they got for
it was a rip-off of the public sector and the taxpayer.''
A number of Labour MPs attacked the government for allowing Rover to be
taken over by a big competitor.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the all-party Commons trade and
industry select committee, asked whether the government was concerned that
the lack of finance going into British manufacturing 'is forcing our best
companies to sell sectors off'.
Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, said he was not
against 'sensible partnerships' but takeovers like this had got to be bad
news.
'I think it is very sad after the way management and workforce at Rover
worked their socks off that British Aerospace can simply chuck them
overboard because they are a bit short of money.'
Pressed further by Robert Ainsworth (Coventry North East) on what guarantees
BMW had given on jobs, the minister insisted: 'No company is going to invest
Pounds 800m to bring a business to an end.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Ideas man emerges from the shadows -
Pischetsrieder Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more than relative youth to help distinguish the 45-year-old
chairman of BMW from his peers in the top ranks of German industry. More
than most, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder has shown himself to be receptive to new
ideas.
He says: 'Anyone who is unable to break away from our way of thinking - a
specialist mentality, moulded by education and upbringing - will not be
capable of making our industry more efficient.'
Mr Pischetsrieder has shown himself capable of putting new ideas into
practice. In a 20-year series of production-related jobs he has been
instrumental in implementing 'new' ideas such as team working, flexible
manufacturing systems and working hours, and the demolition of leadership
hierarchies, which are only now being introduced elsewhere in German
industry.
Following his appointment as chairman in May of last year, BP - as he has
come to be known - has also been responsible for the project to build BMW's
first US plant in North Carolina.
The Spartanburg factory - which is to build a new car for the international
market - was not his idea. The project was developed under Mr Eberhard von
Kuenheim, his predecessor, who ran BMW for more than 20 years.
It was also Mr von Kuenheim who had posted a watch on Rover with a mind to
buying it. But he had also been observing Mr Pischetsrieder especially
closely since 1985, when the Munich-born mechanical engineer returned from a
South African posting to take charge of quality control group-wide.
BP, then 37, had other options, but the quality control post meant that he
would be reporting directly to and working closely with the chairman,
popularly known as Mr BMW.
A BMW man since joining as a production planning engineer in 1973, BP had
been on the main board as head of production for less than two years when
his moment came.
He emerged unexpectedly, and unknown outside the motor business, at the
moment when BMW's star was shining at its brightest. The marque had
overtaken Mercedes-Benz as the biggest selling German quality car for the
first time. BMW, by its own account, was the only domestic automotive group
which last year did not slash its workforce or work short-time. Most
important, it was the only one to make a profit.
Against such a glittering background, and still in the shadow of Mr von
Kuenheim, Mr Pischetsrieder had not achieved a high public profile until
yesterday.
After he had stepped into the limelight in his own right, his colleagues
were at pains to stress that he is his own man, who will stand or fall by
the results of the deal to buy Rover. 'He steered all the talks,' one said.
'I would like to make clear that our success is his personal achievement.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Quotes of the day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The fact that BMW are prepared to pay Pounds 800m is a tribute to what BAe
have achieved and a tribute to the whole British vehicle industry and its
workforce.'
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister
'Isn't today's deal the proof Rover was sold at a knockdown price to BAe and
at a rip-off to the British taxpayer?'
Robin Cook, Labour trade and industry spokesman
'It is our objective to guide two independent and powerful automobile
manufacturers on a common route through the future in a competitive world
market.'
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman
'The decision of BAe to sell its Rover shares to BMW negates Honda and
Rover's long term efforts to establish a firm future for Rover as a British
company with its own brand identity.'
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda
'Some people would think that Rover had a better future linked to Honda than
to an ailing German giant.'
Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP
'It's very difficult to be efficient in our business if you take a
nationalistic approach to operating in that environment.'
Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman
'The fact we cannot keep home ownership of a real jewel in the crown of
British industry reflects the weakness of British manufacturing and the
absence of long-term commitment to it on the part of the government.'
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary
'The partnership with BMW will strengthen the Rover business and provide a
secure future for the company and its employees.'
Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman
'Britain no longer owns its own motor industry. Considering we were once
supreme in Europe, it has come to a sorry state.'
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU
'Anybody with red, white and blue in his heart will feel it's a pity. But
Rover is not viable on its own from a European point of view.'
Mr Joe Gormezano, motor industry consultant at Knibb, Gormezano
'We are determined to safeguard the interests of the Rover workforce. We are
being assured it will not affect the present workforce or plants.'
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU chief motor industry negotiator
'BMW is a good company which makes good models. The announcement could be
for the best. As long as it keeps me in employment, I don't mind.'
Mr Steve Pitchford, setter operator at Land Rover

FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Honda's European strategy wrecked -
Honda ditched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda's long-term European strategy yesterday lay in tatters. The group's
bruised management admitted its chances of being able to develop further its
15-year relationship with Rover appeared remote.
But while Mr Shojiro Miyake, president of Honda Motor Europe, said yesterday
that it was 'too early' to make decisions about future strategy - requiring
also talks with BMW - commercial realities make it highly unlikely that it
would seek to pull the plug on the ongoing collaborative projects with
Rover.
Most important of this is a replacement for the current Honda Concerto and
Rover 200/400 models, expected in 1995.
Even at this relatively late stage, Honda indicated yesterday that it could
'go it alone' if necessary and build its version at Swindon without supplies
from Rover, which will build its version separately at Longbridge. But at a
time when Honda itself is under fierce financial pressures, it would make no
commercial sense for it to forego the economies of scale arising from
Rover's supply of body panels for it and the Honda Accord also being built
at Swindon.
The belief of Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman - shortly to depart to
become chief executive of Lucas Industries - is that collaboration will be
wound down gradually, a process likely to take up to 10 years.
All sides accept that a period of tension is now an inevitability. But BMW
yesterday was giving every sign that, for its part, it had no wish to change
any of the projects currently under way.
The speed at which Honda's strategy unravelled left managers at its
headquarters in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district clearly bewildered and
resentful.
Mr Kiyoshi Ikemi, adviser to Honda's president, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto,
explained: 'We did not want to make Rover Japanese. We wanted to increase
Rover's Roverness. We wanted it to be more British - that was the way the
collaboration would work best.'
Although Honda management yesterday did not talk about betrayal, the company
dryly commented that successful partnerships should be based on trust as
well as synergy.
'Now our partner has been acquired by a competitor we must start to reassess
our entire operations in Europe,' said Mr Ikemi.
'Mr Kawamoto has made it quite clear that he has no intention of
collaborating with BMW in the UK. We did not want to collaborate with Rover
through BMW. Such a collaboration was not called for - we had nothing to
gain from it,' he said.
Although nothing had been decided, it would be wrong to jump to the
conclusion that Honda would break its existing agreements with Rover, said
Mr Ikemi.
The collapse of Honda's European alliance could not have come at a worse
time for the company.
Management attention was already fully focused on problems in the domestic
and US markets.
Whatever European strategy Honda adopts, it will take far more time to draw
up than it took for the previous one to unravel.

Many Conservative backbenchers voiced concern at the sale of Rover to BMW.

Mr Sainsbury said ownership of Rover was a low priority compared to the

However, worries over the foreign ownership of the last big British car
company were taken up by Labour.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the all-party Commons trade and

Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, said he was not

Rover worked their socks off that British Aerospace can simply chuck them
overboard because they are a bit short of money.' But MP Dennis Skinner,
(Bolsover) described the deal as an outrage which would finish off the
British motor industry.
The government should step in and stop it, he said, adding: 'There will be
no guarantees for these jobs once the Germans take over. There will be no
guarantees about the Rover marque. And in a few years' time the British car
industry will be gone, like the motor-cycle industry.'
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow industry spokesman, said: 'What is quite
clear from today's purchase price is BMW has paid four times the amount for
which this government sold Rover group only five years ago.
'That clearly confirms the Audit Office's view that the price they got for
it was a rip-off of the public sector and the taxpayer.''
Mr John Carlisle (C Luton North) declared an interest in that he had sold
Rover cars through his company to both sides of the House 'and indeed taken
inquiries for BMW from the other side on frequent occasions'. He asked if
BMW would preserve the Rover dealer network 'and make sure therefore that
the excellent deals Rover have offered to members of this House and outside
are still available'.
Mr Sainsbury replied: 'I can assure you it is the intention of BMW that
Rover will continue to offer excellent deals to all its customers, whether
in this House or outside.'
Pressed further by Robert Ainsworth (Coventry North East) on what guarantees
BMW had given on jobs, the minister insisted: 'No company is going to invest
Pounds 800m to bring a business to an end.
