FT  01 FEB 94 / Fund managers still investing in recovery stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest institutional fund managers still believe share prices do
not reflect the full benefits of recovery, an analysis of their portfolios
suggests.
Of the UK's 12 largest fund managers, which own 23 per cent of the domestic
stock market, eight own shares which they expect to benefit from a pick-up
in consumer spending and increased economic activity, according to
Citywatch, the research firm.
Citywatch compiled the data by analysing shareholding records of all the
companies in the FT-Actuaries Index and identifying the end-investor behind
nominee companies. While fund managers say the data are distorted - for
instance when clients dictate the investment strategy - they concede the
Citywatch figures are broadly accurate.
The data show that most fund managers are weighting their portfolios towards
building and construction stocks, property, retailing, banking, leisure and
hotels and media. Gartmore has high concentrations in the building sector
and double the market average holding in engineering. 'Britain has lower
unit labour costs than the rest of Europe and the manufacturing base is
likely to recover relative to consumer stocks,' said Mr Vivian Bazalgette,
managing director of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers.
Mercury Asset Management is positive about prospects for recovery. It has a
much heavier than average holding in the building materials and hotels and
leisure sectors, is modestly overweight in banks and is underweight in food
retailing.
However, some fund managers, PDFM in particular, believe share prices for
recovery stocks are too high and reflect over-optimism about economic
growth. 'We think the market is overvalued and cyclical stocks tend to be
more overvalued than most,' said Mr Richard West, a director at PDFM, part
of investment bank UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'We have been selling cyclical
stocks and investing in less favoured consumer sectors.'
Citywatch's data show that PDFM is overweight in breweries, tobacco,
chemicals and engineering. 'A year ago we were heavy in building, property
and leisure stocks,' said Mr West.
Scottish Widows, the Edinburgh-based life insurer, reflects some of PDFM's
bias, holding relatively low positions in the building sectors but high
weightings in breweries and tobacco.
Mr Mark O'Hare, managing director at Citywatch, said that some fund
managers' holdings in key sectors were distorted by a single large holding.
For instance, he said, his research showed that MAM, 75 per cent owned by
merchant bank SG Warburg, is most overweight in merchant banking stocks.
This was because MAM holds 20 per cent of Warburg's shares, Mr O'Hare said.

FT  01 FEB 94 / BAe flies away from Rover with a sackful of cash: How BMW
snatched the prize from Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Pounds 800m on the table from BMW, it took the British Aerospace board
less than five hours last Thursday to decide that it would quit the car
industry and put an end to its five-year relationship with Honda.
Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman and the man who believed the
relationship with Honda to be 'the natural path', was told to take the next
flight to Tokyo to face a company which had thought its offer was a fait
accompli. Six days earlier Honda had agreed to increase its stake from 20 to
47.5 per cent, pumping Pounds 165m into BAe and valuing Rover at Pounds 600m
 -40 per cent less than the eventual winner.
Honda had started from a seemingly unassailable position, given its 20 per
cent stake and its 14-year relationship with Rover. But ultimately, it was
BAe's desire to find an exit from its five-year-old investment that proved
the key.
BMW's assault started last September, when it identified Rover as a target
that would extend its car range and achieve economies of scale in
distribution, component sourcing and R&amp;D.
Its initial offer to BAe was repulsed because of Rover's relationship with
Honda. Dr Hagen Luderitz, director of corporate planning at BMW, says BMW
delivered a letter to Honda chief executive Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, stating
its interest in Rover. No response was received.
Mr Kiyoshi Ikemi, councillor to Honda's president, denies any direct
approach, claiming Honda received only indirect hints of BMW's intentions.
'We weren't informed properly until Friday last week,' he protested.
Unperturbed by the original rebuff, BMW went ahead with its scrutiny of
Rover. Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's research and development director,
unobtrusively visited the UK plants. Back in Germany he test drove the
entire fleet. After two months, he was convinced.
On January 19, a special meeting of BMW's supervisory board discussed the
prospect of making an offer for Rover. They decided unanimously to go ahead
and informal negotiations were opened with the target.
Having been informed of outside interest in Rover, Honda was under pressure
to act. 'If we took a larger percentage, BAe said it would be a clear signal
that the rest of the company was not for sale,' said Mr Ikemi.
On January 21, Honda agreed to increase its stake to 47.5 per cent. Rover
had become core to Honda's strategy for Europe, and the relationship had
been of mutual benefit. Honda had been the key to turning round Rover's car
business, providing technology and saving large amounts in R&amp;D. This offer
was also before the BAe board on the Thursday morning.
It was a fierce race to the finish. Mr Luderitz admits the speed of the deal
limited BMW's ability to perform due diligence, although he was confident
the synergies justified the Pounds 800m price tag - valuing Rover at Pounds
1bn. He delivered the formal offer personally last Wednesday.
At 9.15 on the following morning, the British Aerospace board of directors
sat down to decide. Before them was the prospect of selling a business which
was non-core and required substantial capital spending. The BMW offer had a
deadline of midnight last night. The BAe board decided it wanted out - and
Mr Simpson was sent to Tokyo to see if Honda would make a better offer.
According to Mr Ikemi, it was made clear that an increased offer might be
acceptable to BAe. The board of Honda decided it was not interested in
control.
'If they'd committed to 49 per cent and floating in five years we would have
done it', said Mr Simpson.
On Saturday BMW discussed its proposals with the British government, which
had expressed concern over the impact of the deal on jobs, and about the
relationship between Rover and Honda. BMW cleared the move at a meeting with
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister.
The final decision by BAe was made on the same day. The board had left this
in the hands of Mr Richard Evans, chief executive, Mr Richard Lapthorne,
finance director, Lord Hollick, non-executive director and Mr Simon
Robertson, deputy chairman of the company's merchant banker Kleinwort
Benson.
They met on Saturday, but with an unequivocal 'no' from Honda, it was a
relatively straightforward decision. Neither BAe nor Honda wanted control of
the British carmaker. So BMW had won.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Lockhart to lead MasterCard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MasterCard International, the second-largest US credit card association,
yesterday appointed former top Midland Bank executive Mr Eugene Lockhart as
its new chief executive, just seven days after his predecessor unexpectedly
resigned.
Mr Lockhart, who has worked at the US bank consulting group First Manhattan
since he left Midland in 1992, will take over in March from Mr Alex Hart,
who announced last week that he was joining the financial services company
Advanta.
Mr Lockhart has been a member of MasterCard's board since 1990, and has
acted as an adviser to the company's US operations for the past year. His
experience in the credit card industry includes overseeing Midland Bank's
large credit card business while he was chief executive of its UK
operations, and working more recently with bank clients of First Manhattan
on their credit card strategy.
Mr Norman Tice, chairman of MasterCard's board of directors, said yesterday:
'In Gene we saw someone who had an unusual combination of line retail
banking experience as well as experience in international consumer payments
and technology.'
The rapid appointment of a new chief executive at MasterCard will help
reassure Wall Street. Mr Hart served as the company's chief executive for
five years, and was widely credited with helping turn MasterCard's fortunes
around after the company had lost market share throughout most of the 1980s.
Mr Lockhart said yesterday that his main role will be to ensure that
MasterCard continues to win a greater share of the US credit card market.
Thanks primarily to the success of 'co-branded' cards - launched with
non-bank partners like General Motors and AT&amp;T and which offer users
discounts on those company's products - MasterCard's share of the volume of
general-purpose card charges in the US has grown from 26.3 per cent in 1991
to 27.6 per cent last year. Visa International is the industry leader with
44.9 per cent of the market.
Mr Lockhart said that he also would concentrate on building MasterCard's
share of the debit card business.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Hire business drags down Christian Salvesen profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen shares fell 62p to 314p after the UK distribution,
specialist hire and food services group issued a profits warning.
The Edinburgh-based group said Aggreko - its specialist hire business, which
has been a star performer in recent years - was suffering from increasing
competition in the US and Europe.
Salvesen warned that pre-tax profits for the year to March would be below
market expectations and 'slightly lower than the Pounds 74.8m reported last
year'. Analysts, who had been expecting around Pounds 80m, reduced their
forecasts to between Pounds 70m-Pounds 72m.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, identified four other factors hitting
profits: Unacceptable losses in Spain had led to the withdrawal of the
Aggreko business, with consequent redundancy costs and provisions for
possible bad debts;
The unexpected termination of a hire contract in Croatia, which was
producing all the electrical power for the town of Split;
A Pounds 1m stock write-down at Light and Sound Design, which the group
bought in 1991 and has since restructured after losses caused by a downturn
in the number of pop concerts;
Reduced volume in the group's vegetable processing activities because of
poor weather.
Mr Masters said most of the problems were one-offs, but Aggreko faced
continuing margin pressure in North America. Small operators had begun to
challenge at the bottom end of the hire plant market in power generators. At
the top end, competition was 'aggressive' from Caterpillar, the US plant
manufacturer.
Mr Masters said steps have been taken to reduce Aggreko's cost base, cutting
the US workforce of 350 by about 10 per cent. Sales were being refocused
towards bigger, higher-value contracts such as the US Superbowl, for which
Aggreko supplied the power at the weekend, and temperature control.
Salvesen said: 'By contrast, the group's distribution businesses around the
world, which comprise 45 per cent of trading profits, continue to make good
progress.' Mr Masters said Swift Distribution, acquired in October for
Pounds 84m, was performing ahead of expectations and Salvesen Brick was
continuing to experience increased demand and firmer prices.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Japanese market buoyed by accord on reform

The Tokyo stock market yesterday posted its third largest daily rise as
investor confidence was boosted by the parliamentary agreement on political
reform.
The weekend compromise reached by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, with
the opposition Liberal Democratic party on changes to the country's
scandal-prone electoral system will enable him to concentrate on stimulating
the economy, including a much-awaited income tax cut. The Nikkei average
soared 1,471.24 points, or 7.8 per cent, to 20,229.12, rising above 20,000
for the first time in three months. The momentum carried through to trading
today with the average up about 220 points to just over 20,450 at
mid-morning.
The parliamentary passage of the reform bills before Mr Hosokawa's meeting
with US president Bill Clinton next week will give the Japanese premier room
to take a political initiative on trade. But no sooner was the accord on
political reform completed than Japan's seven-party coalition was plunged
into an internal row on economic policy.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, hit back against a suggestion by Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, that the government should cut
income taxes in its next economic stimulus package, expected on Thursday,
while deferring a decision on a rise in sales taxes. The government hopes to
make an income tax cut the centrepiece of the package.
Mr Fujii said Mr Takemura's remark made it hard for him to fulfil his
responsibilities and complained to Mr Hosokawa. The finance ministry
believes an income tax cut and a sales tax increase should be decided in
tandem, because it does not wish to raise government debt by issuing deficit
bonds.
Mr Hosokowa has sided with the finance ministry and early today it appeared
that Mr Fujii was winning the argument. He told a press conference that
there had been 'no objections' in a cabinet meeting to his proposal that the
two issues be handled together.
Coalition members will meet tomorrow to try to settle tax policy, to allow
the package to be launched a day later.
Data released yesterday, meanwhile, painted a mixed picture of the economy.
The construction ministry said housing starts in December rose 4.9 per cent
from a year before. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, on the
other hand, said sales by wholesalers and retailers in 1993 fell 4
percentage points from the previous year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Mirror group pension scheme receives Pounds 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme has received Pounds 32m from three
securities houses in an out-of-court settlement to their legal dispute over
assets lost in the Maxwell scandal, it was announced yesterday.
The last-minute agreement is the third in recent weeks in which financial
institutions have agreed to return assets to pension schemes formerly
controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. It raises hopes that a large
portion of the Pounds 440m missing from all the schemes will be returned.
The settlement, following a week of negotiations, avoided a complex and
expensive High Court trial that had been due to begin yesterday.
Invesco Asset Management and Capel-Cure Myers of the UK, and US-based Lehman
Brothers agreed to settle with the trustees, but did not admit liability.
All parties signed a secrecy agreement preventing publication of details of
the settlements. But it emerged later that Lehman Brothers had paid the
trustees Pounds 15m, Invesco Pounds 11m and Capel-Cure Myers Pounds 6m.
Trustees of the Mirror group pension scheme had filed a writ seeking Pounds
88.7m from the three securities firms, along with Bank of America and Credit
Suisse. It later filed a writ seeking an additional Pounds 150m from the
firms for damages. Last month, Bank of America paid Pounds 25m into the
pension scheme to settle claims against it, and the case against Credit
Suisse for most of the Pounds 31m outstanding is due to come to court in
October.
Invesco and Capel-Cure Myers both acted as fund mangers for the Mirror group
scheme's assets before the death in November 1991 of Mr Maxwell, while
Lehman Brothers received assets as security for stock lending transactions
with some of Mr Maxwell's private companies.
The deal also allows the pension scheme to receive Pounds 8m in cash from
liquidators for Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), the Maxwell-owned
fund management company that handled the bulk of the combined Maxwell
company pension scheme assets. BIM had been in dispute with Invesco over
ownership of a securities portfolio.
So far, the Mirror group scheme has recovered Pounds 65m for pensioners. The
sum will reduce the amount that Mirror Group Newspapers will have to pay
into its pension scheme over time. In its interim results last summer, the
group set aside roughly Pounds 174m to meet long-term pension liabilities.
Mr Colin Cornwall, chairman of the trustees, said the actual shortfall could
not be determined until after an actuarial valuation.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, the late publisher's
sons, and four other former senior Maxwell employees all pleaded not guilty
to criminal charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Government close to retreat on plans for single-tier
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is preparing a retreat from its insistence that reform of
local government should lead to the virtual abolition of the present
two-tier system.
Amid growing Tory unrest over plans for a radical reshaping of the local
government map by setting up single all-purpose authorities, ministers are
considering a more pragmatic approach to the proposals being drawn up by a
commission headed by Sir John Banham.
The government may decide also not to appeal against a High Court ruling
last week which said that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had
acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of county and
district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional' circumstances.
Ministers said that even if an appeal was lodged - and proved successful -
the lesson of the past few weeks was that the government would have to take
a more flexible approach.
When Mr Gummer moved to the environment department last July he proposed
privately that the government should slow down local government changes.
But Mr John Major, on the advice of the Downing Street policy unit, insisted
that the government should press ahead with the drive for unitary
authorities. Mr Gummer then gave new guidance to the commission, saying the
preservation of the two-tier structure should be 'the exception', stressing
he wanted a substantial increase in the number of unitary authorities in
urban and rural areas.
The present review aims to produce plans for restructuring all
non-metropolitan England by the end of this year. But ministers now believe
that fierce opposition from many Conservative authorities and concern among
Tory MPs will persuade the prime minister that the political costs of
radical change are too high.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BSN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Branded consumer products companies face two chief challenges - to fight off
hostile retailers and private label imitators in mature markets and to
exploit growth opportunities in the developing world. On both fronts, BSN is
making only patchy progress, as its 1993 results make clear. In Europe,
which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of sales, BSN has been hit
hard by recession. Operating margins have slid by almost one percentage
point as BSN cut prices and increased promotional spending to defend market
share.
But the Paris bourse has been seduced by BSN's recovery appeal, pushing its
shares 16 per cent higher over the past two months. BSN's restructuring
efforts should bear fruit this year and consumer spending can only recover.
Like many other French companies, BSN has swallowed big provisions which
will help the earnings upturn when it comes.
In the longer term, BSN aims to milk strong positions in EU markets to fund
expansion in central Europe and the Far East. BSN's visionary chairman, Mr
Antoine Riboud, promises to double its business in emerging markets every
five years. But BSN is starting the game late from a comparatively low base
and has its work cut out meshing its European acquisitions. Besides, there
remain considerable doubts about who can succeed Mr Riboud and fulfil his
dreams. At current ratings, both Nestle and Unilever look more certain bets.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems an accepted fact of life these days that top managers need more
special incentives to perform than lesser mortals among a workforce. That
being so, shareholders have an interest in the incentives really being a
reward for added value. Reuters' new executive remuneration scheme, which
uses as a criterion the relative performance of its shares over a protracted
period of time, is a welcome contribution to the debate.
It avoids the pitfall of option schemes, which, as M&amp;G has embarrassingly
discovered, are now a trap for the unwary. Such schemes may reward managers
on the general strength of the market rather than individual company
performance. Equally Reuters eschews such accounting yardsticks as stated
earnings per share or return on assets, which might be open to manipulation.
Yet relative share price performance is also a natural indicator for a
company with a habitual tendency to beat the index. Reuters has
out-performed the FT-SE 100 by nearly 300 per cent since its flotation in
1984.
Indeed the scheme would have paid out maximum bonuses in five of the last
six years. There may be no harm in that, since few investors will quibble
with Reuters' impressive profit growth over that period. Less clear is
whether its executives will be quite so happy when the company eventually
stops growing, as it surely must. Its share price will hardly out-perform
then and the bonuses will diminish. But, as the supermarkets are now
finding, that is also a time when management is really required to perform.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Christian Salvesen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The small worry about Christian Salvesen is that its chapter of accidents is
beginning to look like bad judgment. It entered both the rock concert
business and the Spanish market at the wrong time. Now it has also
mistakenly counted a contract to supply power to the town of Split as a
long-term one even though it requires the Croatians to put up precious
foreign exchange. Such fumbling does not help when the big worry, revealed
in yesterday's profits warning, is a vital strategic one; Aggreko, its
contract hire division, seems unable to deliver the growth on which the
company had depended. The problem is easy to diagnose, harder to solve.
Aggreko faces severe competition from Caterpillar in its big ticket US
business and from independent operators in small generator supply. Curiously
the squeeze developed when the US economy was supposed to be recovering, but
Salvesen appears to have been living off unsustainable margins. Its finance
director properly waited until December's gloomy interim statement to unload
his options. With hindsight, his timing may look fortunate too.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rover unleashed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even five years ago the idea that Rover and BMW were complementary marques
would have been laughable. Yet now BMW's purchase of Rover looks like a very
smart deal. The Bavarian carmaker gets the four-wheel drive technology it
lacks and the most famous off-road brand name in the world. Once Land and
Range Rovers start selling through BMW's North American dealerships, the
volumes generated should test the capacity of the Solihull plant. While the
main Rover and BMW brands will be managed separately, savings in buying and
development and the sharing of overheads in the distribution network should
make Rover very attractive.
From British Aerospace's standpoint, the Pounds 800m sale price is higher
than could have been achieved through a flotation. It also frees Pounds 900m
of working capital which gives BAe plenty of options. The stronger balance
sheet reinforces its position as a prime contractor in defence. Writing off
around Pounds 200m of leases on its turbo-prop aircraft seems now almost
certain, which will in turn will make it easier to find a joint venture
partner for the business. Talks with Fokker on merging regional jet
businesses could also get under way. Rationalisation of the defence business
to increase margins - so far not even mooted - becomes possible.
But for all the increased flexibility, did BAe get full value for Rover? The
price of around 0.2 times sales is in line with the quoted price of many
large carmakers, but no premium is being paid for control. Perhaps BAe might
have kept a minority equity stake to get the benefit of any success Rover
and BMW enjoy.
Still, the certainty of a deal done is worth a lot, as Vickers found out
when it tried and failed to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. BAe's new management
has made good use of the opportunities it has found for itself, so the
flexibility should not be squandered. And at last we know why Mr George
Simpson, Rover's chairman, decided to stay on at BAe for six months before
taking the helm at Lucas in April.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Don't cry over Rover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many Britons will see the sale of Rover to Germany's BMW as a defeat. It
marks the end of an independent and indigenous car industry. The deal may
also seem like another step in the inexorable decline of British
manufacturing.
But, while such sentiments are understandable, there is no reason to feel
defeated. The damage done, largely by poor industrial relations, to
Britain's car industry occurred years ago ' both before and while Rover and
British Leyland were state-owned. Yesterday's deal is a sign that much of
that damage has been repaired.
Since Rover was sold to British Aerospace, it has improved productivity,
reversed its long-term erosion of market share and taken its product range
up-market. BMW's willingness to pay Pounds 800m in what its executives see
as the boldest strategic move in the car group's history is testimony to the
strides that have been made since privatisation.
Retreating into a narrow nationalism is not an attractive option for British
industry. The country's openness to foreign investment is one of its
principal attractions, which has produced not only a valuable flow of
finance but enabled British industry to acquire new skills.
In the motor industry, there have been large investments by Japanese groups
such as Nissan and Toyota, and German groups such as Bosch. Rover itself has
already learned Japanese lean production methods through its association
with Honda.
Britain's openness to foreign investment has also brought rewards in other
sectors. For example, the sale of ICL, the country's premier computer group,
to Japan's Fujitsu has led to a revitalised corporate strategy and helped
ICL to emerge as the most profitable large computer company in Europe.
Practical question
Some will be tempted to argue that Rover should have kept its independence
either within the BAe group or as a stand-alone business. Such a strategy
might have secured its survival but it would not have provided a platform
from which to grow and flourish. The high costs of research, development and
distribution mean that Rover's future was best secured as part of a
partnership with another car manufacturer. Since no such British partner was
available, the practical question was whether to link with BMW or Honda.
Honda had attractions. Rover might have learned more from the Japanese
company given its superior productivity record by comparison with BMW. Set
against this is the fact that Honda's own models are in direct competition
with Rover's. In the end, the decisive factor was that BAe wanted to sell
out completely to concentrate on its core aerospace and defence businesses.
Honda was not prepared to buy the whole company.
Initial ideas
BMW's plans for Rover are not yet fully formed, but the initial ideas are
encouraging. The German group wants to broaden Rover's production range,
perhaps updating the Mini - something Rover could not have done on its own.
There is also talk about giving the British group access to BMW's
distribution channels and engineering expertise, while gaining economies of
scale from joint component purchasing. In the long run, BMW sees Rover as
central to its strategy of providing a full range of models.
Questions, of course, remain. The most important is whether BMW can, indeed,
turn itself from a successful maker of luxury cars based in Germany into an
international group manufacturing less expensive cars as well. Can the
company's core competences be successfully applied to a higher-volume part
of the car market? On the answer to this question Rover's future will
largely hang.
There are also doubts over what will happen to Rover's existing relationship
with Honda. At some point, it will probably have to be unwound. But Rover is
currently so dependent on Honda that a hasty divorce could be damaging.
The world's motor industry remains highly competitive. The imperative to
innovate, enhance productivity and fight for markets will not go away. There
is no guarantee of success. But in BMW, Rover has found a first-class
partner that gives it a good chance of doing so.

FT  01 FEB 94 / A sudden burst of acceleration: BMW's acquisition of Rover
Group will realign the world auto industry and has benefits for both
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW's takeover of Rover Group has stunned its competitors and sent
shockwaves through the world auto industry. The German carmaker,
traditionally a byword for fierce independence, has until now remained aloof
from the waves of restructuring that have swept over global manufacturers.
Now, at a stroke, the Munich-based producer has outflanked Mercedes-Benz and
devised an expansion strategy that is indelibly different to the one chosen
by its arch domestic rival in Stuttgart.
It has stolen Rover from under the nose of Honda, the Japanese carmaker and
Rover's alliance partner for more than a decade, leaving an air of betrayal
in Tokyo.
Overnight it has become one of the world's leading players in
four-wheel-drive vehicles, through Land Rover, and it has pulled out of the
hat a strategy for moving into small cars without the danger of diluting its
highly prized brand image.
The opportunities for such significant takeovers in the world auto industry
are dwindling. Most of the smaller players have been swallowed up, and BMW
has had to move fast to ensure that it was not left on the starting grid.
With the marketplace fragmenting, BMW has accepted that it must move into
new segments to add to its niche of high-performance executive and luxury
cars. It could have continued to go it alone and develop the necessary
products itself, but that would have taken time and would have been
expensive.
Instead, it has chosen the riskier fast track of acquisition. Even before
the dust has settled over the wreckage of the attempted Renault/Volvo
merger, which collapsed in December, BMW has stepped forward with its Pounds
800m purchase of British Aerospace's 80 per cent stake in Rover and Land
Rover, the last UK-owned, medium-sized vehicle maker.
Honda could hardly have been reassured by the mollifying words yesterday of
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman, who said that he
wanted the Honda/Rover relationship to continue.
In the short term that must be so: the links between Rover and Honda are too
close to be unpicked overnight, but in the longer term there is a new master
in the Rover house, and Honda is left with its European strategy in tatters.
For BMW the immediate attractions of the takeover are clear. They mark out a
different expansion strategy to that of Mercedes-Benz. BMW now gains:
Control of Europe's only credible manufacturer of four-wheel-drive
sports/utility vehicles in the shape of Land Rover. Long the jewel in the
Rover crown, Land Rover operates in one of the fastest-growing segments of
the world market.
A viable way of entering the small car market without diluting its own
precious brand image.
Access to a low-cost European production base and control of the European
carmaker that has probably learned most in recent years about Japanese
production and engineering methods.
A novel way of developing a presence in some of the fastest-growing auto
markets in the Far East and in Latin America, where BMW's traditional
products largely price it out of the markets.
BMW has been studying whether it should make an independent entry into the
four-wheel-drive sports/utility market, currently dominated by makers such
as Chrysler of the US, with its Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Ford, with the
Explorer, or Japanese competitors such as Mitsubishi, Toyota and Isuzu.
It is a critical market. One of the fastest-growing sectors, with consumers
increasingly switching over from traditional passenger cars, it already
accounts for sales of more than 1m vehicles in the US alone.
Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW research and development director, said yesterday
that BMW had developed a vehicle concept for a sport/utility that it could
have brought to market in about three years, but the takeover of Land Rover
placed it immediately in the forefront of the sector.
Land Rover's fortunes have been blossoming in recent years and it is
undoubtedly the main centre of excellence in Europe for sport/utilities with
an unrivalled brand image. With the Range Rover it has developed alone the
luxury end of the market, and the launch of the higher-volume Discovery at
the end of the 1980s has provided it with a mainstream world competitor.
Land Rover is poised to launch the Discovery shortly in the US, where it is
expected to quadruple overall Land Rover sales volumes there. Access to the
much stronger BMW dealer network, where it will not compete with any
existing BMW products, will allow it to expand its presence in North America
much more rapidly.
BMW's competitors have been forced to take less attractive routes to enter
this market. Mercedes-Benz, which long has struggled with its antiquated
small-volume G-Wagen, has decided to develop its own mainstream
sport/utility, which will be made at a new plant in Alabama in the US. The
vehicle will not be ready for launch before 1997, however, and Mercedes-Benz
must shoulder the development costs alone. For all the vaunted prestige of
the Mercedes-Benz name, it has no pedigree in all-terrain four-wheel-drive
vehicles, where Land Rover is a world leader.
Land Rover has long been coveted by rival carmakers, but they have been
unable to unlock the key, because British Leyland and, more recently,
British Aerospace have been unwilling to separate it from the previously
chronically loss-making Rover car operations.
This is where the BMW deal breaks new ground. It is willing to take on the
car operations as well. BMW has studied intensively in recent years how it
should take account of the increasing trend towards the use of smaller cars,
especially in densely populated and congested urban areas.
Almost in step with Mercedes-Benz, it has presented concept studies for a
future small car at the world's leading motor shows in the past two years.
The design exercises were to assess whether the two luxury/executive
carmakers could risk going downmarket into small cars.
The answers are now clear: for Mercedes-Benz, yes, but for BMW, a resounding
no, at least under its own name.
Mercedes-Benz has decided recently to build its own small car for sale under
the Mercedes star. The car will be built at a volume of at least 200,000 a
year - at least that is Mercedes-Benz's aspiration - at a plant in Germany.
The size of the concept car was smaller than a Ford Fiesta, but in the
marketplace the small cars will carry the Mercedes name and compete at
Volkswagen Golf prices.
As of yesterday it became official that BMW will not build a small car for
sale under the BMW badge. Rover in the UK and and the Rover brand will
become its centre for small car development. This would ensure BMW a
presence in this marketplace but would not put at risk the BMW brandname,
said Mr Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman yesterday.
'There will be no smaller BMW car than the 3-Series,' he said. 'You must not
over-stretch the core brand values of BMW. A small BMW would not comply with
the hard core BMW image, that we have worked for 20 years to achieve.'
Mr Pischetsrieder declared that he had told Mr Helmut Werner, chief
executive of Mercedes-Benz, that the Stuttgart group was misguided with its
small car strategy. 'I told Werner he was wrong. Clearly he does not think
so.'
Instead BMW is now intent on developing Rover as its maker of small and
medium-sized front-wheel-drive cars. All BMW's existing executive and luxury
cars are rear-wheel-drive cars. With the takeover of Rover it buys in
front-wheel-drive technology and, crucially, it also buys in one of the most
competitive small engines in Europe in the shape of Rover's K-Series engine.
Mr Pischetsrieder was at pains to insist that under BMW rule Rover will
continue its present car lines but with increased resources and with the
potential for creating new car ranges. These include a replacement for the
30-year-old Mini, which has never featured in Rover's own more financially
stretched product plans.
Rover already has under way a development programme for a replacement for
the Metro small car due in 1995-96. This will remain in place, but the
development phase will now benefit from the much greater engineering
resources of BMW, which will be put at Rover's disposal. The Metro
replacement was being developed alone by Rover without the involvement of
Honda.
Moving up through the Rover model range, BMW will meet its most immediately
sensitive challenge with Honda over the replacement car for the Rover
200/400 and its sister car, the Honda Concerto.
These existing cars were jointly developed. In Europe both Honda and Rover
versions are produced at Rover's Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Under a
current agreement, the new generation cars - codenamed Theta - will appear
in 1995. The Rover versions will still be produced at Longbridge, but the
the Honda version is due to be produced at its new plant at Swindon.
Mr Pischetsrieder made clear that BMW expects Honda to remain in this
crucial joint development programme, as the Japanese carmaker would lose
financially by pulling out. Rover and Honda have a joint purchasing base,
many of the sheet metal panels are provided from Rover's main stamping plant
at Swindon, and the joint development programme allows Honda to spread its
risk over a bigger production volume with Rover involvement.
Whatever the ultimate impact of the BMW takeover, this programme appears to
ensure that Honda and Rover will continue to work closely together on a
project basis at least to the end of the decade.
The same can be said for the Rover 600 and the sister car the Honda Accord.
These were only launched last year with production of the Accord at Honda's
Swindon plant and the 600 at Rover's Cowley plant in Oxford.
Beyond these product generations it may suit Honda and Rover/BMW to go their
separate ways, but economies of scale may still dictate further co-operation
into the next decade.
At the top of the Rover range, the 800 is a different story. The present
ageing Rover product was derived from a Honda - the old Legend executive car
 -but there is no joint replacement programme. Mr Pischetsrieder said
yesterday that work would start immediately on a replacement. It would be
likely, he said, that it would be based on the new 5-Series BMW platform and
would share several important components with the new generation BMW
executive car. It would also become rear-wheel-drive.
BMW wanted, too, to promote the revival of some of the Rover Group's old
British makes that had fallen on hard times, said Mr Pischetsrieder. Top of
the list is the plan for the reintroduction of the MG sports car marque.
Rover has a small affordable MG roadster under development for launch in
1995-96, but under BMW management this programme is expected to be given
extra momentum.
Even before the Rover takeover BMW had earmarked sports cars as a niche for
accelerated development. Yesterday, top BMW executives confirmed industry
speculation that the 'secret' car it planned to build in the US at its new
plant in South Carolina would also be a small roadster. Mr Pischetsrieder
said that for future products there would clearly be potential for the
sharing of components between their planned sports cars.
He promised that no Rover cars would be built in Germany and that no BMWs
would be built in the UK. While dealer networks would not be merged, the
distribution systems would eventually be merged, said Mr Pischetsrieder,
with common logistics and parts supply. Single dealers may sell both marques
but from separate showrooms. Certainly, for Rover, access to the BMW dealer
network in Germany will give its fortunes a massive boost in a tough market.
The big success of Rover management in the past seven years has been to
rescue the old British Leyland car operations from the threat of extinction
and create a viable business based on the relationship with Honda.
Under BAe its long-term ownership was always uncertain, however. Honda
provided the crutch during the long recovery from intensive care, but BMW
can provide the long-term home it has long needed in the hostile environment
of the world auto industry.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Leading Article: After Hanoi, Havana
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration deserves applause for its efforts to lift
sanctions against Vietnam and should move rapidly to take the final steps to
end its embargo. It needs now to turn its attention to another legacy of the
cold war: Cuba.
If the US can resolve its differences with a country with which it was at
war two decades ago, it seems strange that the normalising of relations with
Cuba is hardly discussed in Washington.
There are several reasons for this. Vietnam did not, at least initially,
present such a challenge to America's way of life as Cuba, the former ally
on its doorstep that joined the Soviet bloc.
Unlike in the case of Vietnam, there has been no important group of US
companies arguing for the lifting of sanctions. Businesses have argued
forcefully that non-US companies in Vietnam have been the chief
beneficiaries of the US embargo, and have wanted equal treatment. There is
evidence that some US businesses are becoming concerned about losing out in
the Cuban market, but their worries have not been sufficiently developed to
bring any pressure on policymakers.
Above all, domestic US policy considerations - and in particular the
importance of the state of Florida where most Cuban exiles are based - have
given the vociferous hardline opponents of the Cuban regime a near veto on
the issue.
Tied hands
These groups may over time be becoming less representative of Cuban opinion
in the US. But they have been skilful, winning during the 1992 election
campaign the backing of both presidential candidates for the Cuban Democracy
Act. This tightened the sanctions against Havana - including extending the
embargo to subsidiaries of US companies based outside the US - and tied the
hands of any administration to do anything about it.
The main objective of the act was 'to seek a peaceful transition to
democracy and a resumption of economic growth in Cuba' through the careful
application of sanctions. The ultimate objective - to secure a soft landing
for a Cuban transition to democracy - is indeed the correct one. The problem
is that the embargo is increasing the likelihood that eventual change in
Havana will be violent.
The embargo is one of Fidel Castro's greatest allies in his struggle to
remain in power. It allows him to blame many of the country's economic
problems on Washington - blame which should lie squarely on his own
shoulders. It permits his regime to charac-terise any opposition as akin to
treason.
Exile groups
The embargo plays into the hands of hardliners on both sides: to those in
Cuba who want to avoid democracy at all costs and to those exile groups in
the US whose desire for revenge against Castro overcomes all other
objectives.
The consequences of violence in Cuba will thrust itself on to the US policy
agenda. Yet there is no evidence that Washington has a policy prescription
to help manage the transition in Cuba. It should begin now to map out in
public the process whereby it aims to provide incentives for a return to
democracy and the rule of law in Cuba.
A policy change is justified by the fact that some of the economic measures
already taken by the Cuban government - the partial legalisation of the
dollar and the granting of permission for (limited) self-employment - imply
political changes. These in turn support a modest relaxation in the embargo.
Those parts of the embargo that deal with communications should be ended -
allowing the Cuban people to gain some sense of what is going on in the
outside world. Restrictions covering basic food and medicines should be
lifted - helping to deprive Castro of the charge that the US is either
trying to starve Cuba or leave it without the ability to tackle disease.
Then Washington should make it clear that - if Cuba complies with the
economic conditions for joining the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank - it will not object to Cuban membership of those two
institutions. This would provide incentive to change economic policies:
political changes in Cuba's overarching state are then almost bound to
follow.

The government's tortuous review of local government in England and Wales
had further hiccups yesterday at London's High Court.
Cleveland and Avon county councils were seeking leave for a judicial review
of the Local Government Commission's proposals for their areas. But as
proceedings began, Mr Justice Harrison, due to hear the application, said he
felt he should not, as he is a friend of Sir John Banham, the LGC's
chairman, and has discussed local government reorganisation with him on
numerous occasions. The next judge pencilled in, Mr Justice Pill, also
stepped down, because of his role as vice-chairman of the Welsh Boundary
Commission. Mr Justice Potts came to the rescue after lunch; and granted the
councils' wish.

In the best traditions of pre-fight hype the union says the sponsors wish to

Not that Andreas Schoeler, the main foreign guest at the dinner, was

Britain has had one and so has Canada. Could a traditionally male preserve
like Australia be the next English-speaking country to flirt with the idea
of a woman as prime minister? True, Australia's elections are not due until
1996 but women have become hot political properties down under.
Carmen Lawrence, former premier of Western Australia, threw her hat in the
ring yesterday. She is quitting state politics and wants to take over the
relatively safe federal seat of Fremantle being vacated by John Dawkins, 46,
the former treasurer. She is already tipped for a job in the government.
Lawrence has been urged to make the transition by Prime Minister Paul
Keating's advisers, increasingly concerned at the growing popularity of
Bronwyn Bishop, an ambitious Liberal party senator from Sydney's North
Shore, recently promoted to the opposition's shadow cabinet. Bishop has a
gift for offering no-nonsense commentary on the affairs of the day, causing
fans and foes alike to draw comparisons with Britain's Baroness Thatcher and
even Madonna.
Nevertheless, she regularly outpolls her colleagues. With the opposition in
some disarray, 'Bronnie' has been tipped to become its next leader. When
pressed to explain what she stands for, one old political hand could only
mutter: 'Naked ambition'.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Only answer in Bosnia is to establish
right balance of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G D REDFEARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The uncharacteristic stridency of Mr Ian Davidson's article ('Least bad
option', January 26) betrays the feebleness of his case against arming
Bosnian government forces. He objects that: one could not calculate in
advance exactly how much help they should have or exactly who should provide
it; 'the only certain result . . . is that Russia and other Slav states
would step up their help to the Serbs'; and the most likely threat to peace
is of open conflict with Russia.
How unconvincing each of these is. Since when was support for a good cause
made conditional on exact advance costing? Remembering the continual flow of
arms from Serbia to Bosnia which was reported all last year, whence comes Mr
Davidson's 'certainty' that it would increase? And a Russia on the brink of
social collapse can hardly be capable of 'open conflict' with the west.
But the main point, which Mr Davidson entirely misses, is that only a
balance of power in Bosnia can lead to a peace settlement, and the only way
to establish a balance of power is to arm the government forces. Obviously
Serbs and Croats will only agree acceptable peace terms if they realise that
they cannot win. Had that situation confronted them two years ago the war
would have been over long ago.

FT  01 FEB 94 / The decision is in the post: The uncertain future of the UK
Post Office poses a dilemma for the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the government's review of the Post Office is prolonged, the service will
still be in the public sector when Prince Charles' head is on the stamps.'
The comment of a Tory backbench MP representing a rural constituency
underlines the government's confusion over its plans for what remains the
UK's biggest public sector corporation. Today Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, gives evidence to an inquiry by the all-party
Commons trade and industry committee on the future service of the Post
Office.
The Commons investigation was prompted, in part, by fears that the
corporation's profitability was threatened by uncertainty about the
government plans.
Ministers' indecision is baffling given that Mr Heseltine chose to put
privatisation back on the agenda by announcing in 1992 a review of the Post
Office's status. He is personally in favour of its sale.
Adding to government discomfort, Post Office executives are increasingly
vociferous in their criticism of the government's inaction.
Mr Edward Leigh, the former DTI minister responsible for the corporation,
says the review process has gone 'horribly wrong'. Back in 1992 he felt the
case for ending the corporation's monopoly on letter deliveries costing less
than Pounds 1 was overwhelming.
His view that state ownership could no longer be justified was backed by the
government's own adviser, Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, which last
year recommended privatisation of the Royal Mail, the letters division. It
suggested leaving the post offices in the public sector. (The government is
already looking for a buyer for the parcels division.)
After the Kleinwort Benson report was completed, Mr Leigh was sacked by Mr
John Major, the prime minister, because of his views on European policy, and
Mr Heseltine had a heart attack, from which he only fully recovered at the
end of last year.
But such events go only a little way towards explaining the delay. More
significant has been the scale of opposition to privatisation, which has
surprised Mr Heseltine.
Many Conservative backbenchers - particularly those threatened by Liberal
Democrats in the south west of England - are worried about the impact of
privatisation on the rural postal service. Although the operation of 19,000
sub-post offices, has been contracted out by the Post Office - meaning that
they are in effect already privatised - many in rural communities rely on a
subsidy from the central Post Office. That support - which for the smallest
rural post offices is worth Pounds 2,500 a year - allows them to continue
acting as agents for the government in, for instance, paying state benefits.
One senior Tory backbencher reports an 'alarming increase' in the number of
constituents complaining to him about the future of community post offices.
Ministers privately credit the Union of Communication Workers - the Post
Office workers' union - for waging an effective 'scare campaign' against
privatisation.
Enough Tory MPs have passed on their concerns to the whips office, or to Mr
Major, for the DTI to realise privatisation has receded as a politically
feasible option, given the government's 18-strong Commons majority.
Instead Mr Heseltine has embarked on a new approach, drawing up proposals
for what some in the DTI sees as a 'half-way house', whereby the Post Office
would remain in the public sector but have more commercial freedom. One
proposal is that the government should agree to the Post Office's demands
for a relaxation of the restrictions preventing it from forming
international joint ventures.
The corporation wants to be on a par with the Dutch post office, being
privatised early this year, and the German and French post offices, which
are allowed alliances with companies in the private sector. International
expansion in, for instance, the courier business, could increase
profitability by expanding the range of services the Post Office sells.
But even such unambitious plans are likely to face resistance. The Treasury
is opposed to state-owned companies using surplus cash to invest in
alliances with private companies, arguing the money could be better used
helping bring down the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, complains the
corporation is being used as a 'milch cow' to raise cash for the Treasury.
The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay
the government each year - has risen to Pounds 230m in 1994-95 and is set at
Pounds 210m for the following year. The Post Office has said it can meet the
targets, but only at the expense of capital expenditure and investment. If
the curbs are not loosened, Mr Cockburn says they may mean higher stamp
prices and could threaten the corporation's 15-year history of
profitability.
Mr Heseltine thus finds his options limited. Yet a number of options remain
that would allow the Post Office to make more use of its assets while
remaining within the constraints imposed by the PSBR:
First, the DTI could extend the government's efforts to attract private
finance into public sector projects. The Treasury's objection to the Post
Office using surplus cash for new business could be circumvented if the
investment in joint ventures came from the private sector.
Second, the DTI could propose relaxing limits on the services post offices
can offer, which are intended to prevent unfair cross-subsidisation.
Thirdly, the Royal Mail could be allowed to deliver a wider range of
products, including newspapers.
Such proposals might prove both politically expedient and appealing to the
Treasury because the more Post Office shops can sell, the more profitable
they could be, and the less likely they are to close. The subsidy for rural
post offices would continue.
Such an approach is believed to be gathering support in the DTI. It would
address Post Office management's concerns. In the longer term it would leave
open the option of the Post Office shops being separated from the Royal Mail
and put privatisation of the latter back on to the agenda.

Sir, Mr John Newman (Letters, January 19) asks whether only he is

I am more than disillusioned not only by the government ignoring completely
your excellent leading article of December 13 on the removal of indexation
on capital losses ('Trickery with capital gains'), but also by the way the
one-phrase comment on this subject in the chancellor's Budget speech has
been turned into almost four pages of incomprehensible verbiage in the
Finance Bill.
Let us hope that the House of Commons will take a first step in the
direction desired by Mr Newman by throwing out this clause and its
effectively retrospective impact.

to be at the cutting edge of contemporary art and who might be chewing over
the purchase of a piece of choc art. Here in Belgium, eating chocolate is
thought to provide a more satisfying experience than daubing it on one's
walls, but this may simply be a reflection on the relative merits of British
and Belgian chocolate.
Some time ago, I conceived the idea of painting the walls of my living room,
not with chocolate, but with white paint, applied with a roller in three
layers.
May I, through the good offices of your letters column, inform your readers
that as an incentive to buying my artwork rather then Mr Schubert's, I am
prepared to allow readers of the FT to acquire my latest ouevre for only
Pounds 4,999. While I fear that some of your more hard-headed readers will
be aware of the old copyright lawyer's adage that there is no copyright in
ideas, only in the form in which they are expressed, I believe that the Cork
Street area contains a gratifying number of people who have white painted
gallery walls and who possess money and credulity in equal quantities.
I would be grateful if you would forward any cheques received.

<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams is
unhelpful. At the worst it might destabilise the Anglo-Irish strategy for
managing the conflict in Northern Ireland. I say 'managing the conflict'
rather than 'peace initiative' because it is prudent to keep the small print
pessimistic.
The overall strategy remains in place. It was worked out last year by Mr
John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. The declaration by the British and Irish
prime ministers, published shortly before Christmas, gives Irish
nationalists an opportunity to win by peaceful persuasion the unity for
their island that 25 years of bloodshed have shown cannot be achieved by
violence. The terrorists among them are, reasonably enough, asked to cease
hostilities before they can take part in negotiations. The strength of the
joint declaration lies in the fact that it puts the two governments on the
same side. They have not yet wavered on its central tenets. So far so good.
Enter Mr Clinton. This is a relatively small matter for him. He has no dead
to count, only votes. He is, however, an intelligent man. So on Saturday
morning the US position was the same as that of Mr Major and Mr Reynolds: Mr
Adams must renounce violence and accept the joint declaration before a visa
is granted. The latter, a master of blarney, let his words travel far enough
in the required direction, without his meaning moving an inch. That enabled
the president of the US to cast aside his brain, redeem a campaign promise
and appease a powerful Irish lobby. Mr Clinton capitulated on Saturday
evening.
The dispute clearly divided the Irish-American community. The visa was
stamped in the US embassy in Dublin. The ambassador there is Jean Kennedy
Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy. This was a victory for both Teddy
and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan over a third formidable Irish-American,
Mr Tom Foley. The speaker of the lower house was armed with arguments
provided by the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Robin Renwick. For
once the Renwick magic was insufficient. Perhaps it never had a chance. The
case against dealing in the open with Mr Adams has been harder to make to
Americans since Messrs Reynolds and Major promised that, after a ceasefire,
they would do just that. After being barred for 20 years, the leader of Sinn
Fein set off for New York. Mr Clinton presumably felt that the senators, who
face re-election this year, had greater need of his assistance than the
speaker.
The US is clearly not constitutionally equipped to play the game in the
stonewall manner implied by the Reynolds-Major statement. Its centres of
political influence are too diffuse. You cannot always say who will come out
on top in a particular argument. This is a pity. A unified stance by the
British, Irish and US administrations might have led even the IRA to reflect
that it was hopelessly isolated. The question that the prime minister now
has to ask himself is - which is the odd country out? Mr Reynolds is still
on board, as his recent scholarly exposition of the democratic nature of
peaceful self-determination confirms, but his government did unilaterally
remove the ban on radio and TV appearances by Mr Adams and his ilk. It might
have done better to wait for a joint relaxation of media rules by both
London and Dublin. The Irish also appear to have taken quiet satisfaction in
the granting of a visa to the Sinn Fein leader. Is it Britain that needs to
make a course correction?
The answer depends in the first instance upon how you perceive Mr Adams. The
president of Sinn Fein is customarily depicted as a front-man for the IRA.
His party is usually described as the bombers' political wing. The British
view is that he is too steeped in blood to be qualified to take part in the
democratic process until there is an IRA ceasefire and he renounces the
'armed struggle'. The Irish and American view appears to be a softer version
of this, namely that Sinn Fein has to be drawn into the peace process, since
both it and the IRA are split. The more exposure that can be given to
supposed doves like Mr Adams, the more likely it is that they will prevail.
It would be easier to accept this proposition if there was any evidence in
support of it. There is none. We are invited to take the word of Mr John
Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party member of Parliament whose work
for a peaceful settlement has been admired by all. Mr Hume is an honourable
man, devoted and brave in his pursuit of an end to the killing. We do not
know what Mr Adams says behind closed doors, but to judge by his public
statements he has not condemned IRA violence, let alone pressed for a
ceasefire. Mr Hume has begged the IRA to suspend the slaughter while they
and Sinn Fein debate the Reynolds-Major declaration. He may have been
encouraged to so by his private conversations with Mr Adams, but the latter
has yet to be seen deploying even the most basic argument for peace, such as
that unity can only be gained through the ballot box, minus bullets. Perhaps
Senators Kennedy and Moynihan will prevail upon him to do so while he is in
New York.
The British view is that the Major-Reynolds declaration will slowly achieve
its desired end, which is a cessation of violence. The Northern Ireland
secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has avoided negotiation with Mr Adams while
doing his best to maintain the moral and rational high ground. Sir Patrick
will not 'clarify' in the sense of altering the original meaning of the
declaration, but he will make its intent clear. This war of words may
continue for some time. Britain might as well lift the ban on the
broadcasting of the voices of Mr Adams and his colleagues, since their
words, spoken by actors, are not challengeable by live interviewers.
The principal response to the granting of a US visa to Mr Adams should be a
review of British public relations. This is an area in which London's
expertise is at least matched by Sinn Fein, in Belfast, Dublin and New York.
Mr Adams plainly cannot be silenced. Attempts to muzzle him have
increasingly become counter-productive. There is no call from Dublin or
Washington to negotiate with Sinn Fein, at least not until it calls for a
ceasefire. The Major-Reynolds strategy for managing the violence therefore
dictates itself. Mr Adams must be out-argued.

Sir, Reading the letter from the managing director of Cory Environmental
(January 29), I was deafened by the sound of grinding axes.
The fact that Mr Riddle's business depends on the continuing unsustainable
use of packaging should not blind him to a balanced view of the issues.
He accurately quotes the House of Lords select committee report with respect
to packaging roast coffee. Unaccountably, he omits to quote another finding
in the same report, to the effect that re-usable packaging such as
returnable bottles uses one quarter of the energy of the single-use
alternatives.
Could this be because they do not end up being put in a hole in the ground,
and therefore providing business for his company?

FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tunnel fight will not be skimped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J G ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am a little surprised that you should publish Michael Thompson-Noel's
gratuitous insults aimed at the people of Kent in 'Tunnel of Sighs' (Hawks &amp;
Handsaws, January 29). I may or may not be a 'selfish and common sort', but
I see no reason 'to shut up' in the present circumstances. Presumably he
feels that the common yokels of Kent should touch their straw-ridden
forelocks to Mr Major, and probably indeed to Mr Thompson-Noel if he ever
leaves the city (or cocktail-belt?) to widen his 'experience'. He may be an
expert on macro-engineering, but has he given any thought to our present
problems?
The 'venomous anger' had long since abated with the route fixed in the
corridor already ruined by the M20, and huge sums paid in compensation. Now
a few Ashford councillors, without consultation, have produced a new route
which devastates an entirely new corridor through one of the most beautiful
areas of Kent, including this village which is considered so idyllic that
the 'Darling Buds of May cricket match' was filmed here] The new route has
some merit in taking the new line to the new station, but would never have
been suggested if our penny-pinching government had not refused to tunnel
from the original route, on the grounds that it would cost Pounds 60m, a
paltry sum compared with the Channel tunnel cost.
I agree with Mr T-N, this is a great project, comparable to the Great Wall
of China in the time it will take to complete, so why wreck it by
economising? I am sure Appius Claudius did not skimp on his paving stones. I
suspect that the people of Kent will fight for this tunnel in spite of the
views of Mr T-N, who would evidently be delighted if Mr Major resuscitated
the Fourth Legion and sent it to Little Chart.

Sir, The announcement that the Rover Group is to be sold to BMW is beyond
belief. Those of us who remember how taxpayers' money was used to support

It is absolutely inconceivable that the British government should have sold
to a German competitor a company that was just becoming viable and showing
the way to the European motor industry.
The government must act immediately to halt this flawed sale and insist that
overall control of the Rover Group remains in British hands.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: Suave Gallic strings of the Ysaye - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among young and youngish string quartets, an impressive number can date
their international careers from the Evian competition in Switzerland. The
Ysaye Quartet won it in 1988, and have never looked back. The quartet has
reappeared twice at the Wigmore Hall this weekend, as suave and polished as
ever.
Its Saturday programme might have been designed to honour its namesakes of
former times - for Debussy's quartet had its 1893 premiere at the hands of
the original Ysaye Quartet, and the solo violinist in the first performance
of Chausson's Concert for violin, piano and quartet was Ysaye himself. The
guest soloists here were Pierre Amoyal and Pascal Roge, both determined to
rescue the fustian stretches of the work with sweeping confidence and flair.
Roge in particular aimed at a near-Beethovenian weight: a little more than
the Concert will quite bear, in sober truth, but impressive while it lasted.
(About 40 minutes, by the end of which Chausson has wrung his material
almost dry.)
Amoyal soared and dazzled in his best style, and the whole ensemble was
seamless. This was the second half of the concert; it reinforced the feeling
one had in the first half, that on its own the Ysaye team sounds less
perfectly balanced than formerly - its leader needs more weight to make
himself felt against the strong viola and cello.
That small failing made little difference to the quartet's searching, often
very beautiful accounts of the Debussy and of old Faure's intricate, gentle
quartet. The players' enunciation was scrupulous. They twinkled softly in
Debussy's scherzo instead of dancing, but produced ravishing sounds in all
the rich chordal passages.
If the Faure was slightly understated (the music is almost secretive), its
elaborate weavings and its sideslipping harmonies were always lucid. In
Faure's slow movement as in Debussy's, they were at their delicate, faithful
best: there was a sense of magical elevation.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: New look at the Tate - The gallery's rehang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the fifth time running, Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, begins
his year, and ours, with a fresh trawl through the collections: and what was
once a matter of high contention is now accepted with but a shrug of
irritation at familiarity confounded, and pleasurable curiosity as to what
new, fresh, forgotten things have been pulled out of store.
The serious point is that with works of art, as with people, even the most
familiar or important are seen anew in fresh company, for good or ill. The
serious question is: how far should one go in indulging such change for the
sake of it, at the sacrifice of any more settled context and consideration?
The answer - compromise if you like - is simply the striking of a balance
between the two.
Serota's first great coup was born of his audacity in entirely re-ordering
the historical sequence of the displays that he had inherited with his
appointment. His second, no less radical, was the opening up again of the
central axis of the Tate, the Duveen Sculpture Hall, and rededicating it to
its original purpose. Once done, both changes seemed obvious and inevitable
and, five years on, we would hardly wish them undone.
The shift of the Tudor and Stuart paintings, with which the sequence of the
displays begin, from the bustle of the galleries at the front of house to
the furthest corner gallery at the back, is especially happy for the
appropriate quietness and sense of permanence it affords them. They are in
any case, by the very nature of the collection, less subject to constant
reshuffling.
The Sculpture Halls, on the other hand, have been subject inevitably and
most conspicuously of all to the annual change-around, and triumphantly so.
It is in the nature of the Tate that it should hold so much more than it can
ever show together, and sculpture simply presents the problem at its most
acute. Turn and turn about is the only way, and with last year's Rodins now
replaced by Anglo-French turn of the century academicism -
Reynolds-Stephens' 'A Royal Game', of Elizabeth I and Philip II at chess,
dominating the entrance lobby - and minimalism giving way to British
sculpture between the wars, the contrast could hardly be more piquant. With
not only Gill, Gaudier and Epstein but more obscure figures such as Frank
Dobson, Leon Underwood and John Skeaping given proper recognition, Henry
Moore's old claim virtually to have invented modern British sculpture is
neatly rendered untenable.
But general criticism of the Serota policy is not to be dismissed
altogether. There are two main wings to it: that changes have been too many
and too extreme; and that the hang itself has often been indulgently sparse
 -space where there might have been pictures. My own sense of it is that the
criticism has been met, but only to a degree.
The hang seems a little more settled than before and certainly more
comprehensive, at least on the British side from the 16th to the 19th
century. The 18th century is served well enough, from Hogarth and his
contemporaries to Gainsborough, Zoffany, Stubbs and Reynolds, Wright and
Copley, then into the 19th century with the landscape painting of Constable,
Cox, Turner, Crome and all. The pre-Raphaelites have a room to themselves,
as do the high Victorians, Martin, Leighton, Orchardson, Millais and
Burne-Jones - and how good to see Farquharson's sheep in a blizzard, and
Frederick Walker's delightful young widow stepping out through 'The Old
Gate'.
British aestheticism, impressionism and post-impressionism are also well
served, with a room of Sargent, Albert Moore, Whistler, Steer, Sickert and
Gwen John, and another of late Derain and Bonnard along with Smith, Gross -
a fascinating comparison with Derain - Grant and Vanessa Bell. William
Nicholson, father of Ben and, in many eyes, infinitely the more gifted
painter, is rightly given a small display to himself.
But from here the problems start, not so much in the particular choice of
what is shown, as in what is necessarily left out. From the Cubists and
Vorticists in Room 14 through to the old modern side, the sense is that
suddenly the Tate has run out of space. From this point the displays, room
by room, are increasingly selective, even cursory, as they light upon this
subject, now that - Bacon and Giacometti; a roomful of portrait heads;
abstraction in the 1940s, '50s, '60s.
This is, of course, a political statement that is being made, not so
obliquely. The Tate indeed ran out of space long ago. Positive initiatives
have already been taken, at Liverpool and Saint Ives, and we await the
decision on what might be done at Bankside or the South Bank. But the
problem remains for the moment what it has always been, that the Tate as it
is has an impossible brief. We, for our part, must make up our minds just
what it is we want and expect of it: our national gallery of British Art; of
modern British in its international context; of international contemporary
art? Yes please; all three.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: The virtues and vices of mime - Alastair Macaulay goes
in search of enchantment at the London festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So why do I love mime? Because I love illusion. If someone can make me 'see'
a door that is not there, can 'become' a different character through body
language alone, he or she will have have my attention. If they can sustain
that illusion, can make me feel that their behaviour has summoned up a whole
imaginary world around them, then I am enchanted.
The London Mime Festival, however, may not be the best place to find the
kind of mime I mean. This year's 18-day festival has just drawn to a close;
I caught six performances. But the best mime I saw this January occurred
elsewhere - at Covent Garden, in The Nutcracker, in a performance when that
great artist Stephen Jefferies played the old magician Drosselmayer, and,
with miraculous economy and sincerity of movement, showed the anxiety,
tenderness, solicitude, authority, and fantasy at the heart of this
character.
The Mime Festival performances I saw have made me suspect that professional
mimes do the worst kind of mime. Why does the prospect of a mime performance
make my heart sink? Because most mime is so literal, so galumphing, so
repetitious, so teenage, and - oh - so audience-directed. For the average
mime performer this January, it was never enough merely to enact opening a
door or riding a horse. No, sir. He had to make a hefty great business out
of doing so, had to do it with sound effects, had to do it again and again,
and, while doing it, he had to keep turning his face to the audience, with
his big eyes wide open at us, as if to say 'Get this]'
I use the male preposition advisedly. Mimes tend to be male. I saw 18 mime
performers this festival; only two were female. (Even Theatre de Complicite,
usually an equal-opportunities employer, chose to present an all-male show
this time.) Do these statistics suggest that mime would be better if more
women were active in the field? Or that mime somehow brings out certain male
tendencies of thought? (The latter, I fear.)
The Complicite three-man show, a revival of the 1984 A Minute Too Late, was
the best work I saw. Simon McBurney's impersonation of a drab, blundering,
apologising, inhibited, middle-aged little man who cannot express the grief
he feels about the death of his wife was a delicious performance, and the
show has several great set pieces of physical comedy.
Yet even these Complicite artists, alas, go in for some of the
hello-audience cuteness and obvious shticks that so irritate me in lesser
mime shows. One performer will make a darling effect by suddenly 'becoming'
an impersonal object like a kitchen dresser - but then will turn his deadpan
face to us (ie 'Isn't this too funny') and then back again. McBurney has an
aghast way of saying 'Oh no' which is genuinely funny; but he does it again,
and again, and again.
I will pass over Moulin Theatre (French) and its wretched piece of
sub-existential absurdism Alter Ego; and I have already reviewed The Right
Size's heavy account of Moose. As for Ralf Ralf's account of It's Staring
You Right in the Face, although it was a piece of sophisticated nonsense
theatre, it was marred by the way it would flog each of its charmingly
nonsensical ideas to death. (Also by its audience, which determinedly and
dotingly laughed at the performers' slightest antics.)
I was curious to read that Commotion and The Institute of Curiosity and
Execution would be joining forces to create The Quest for Don Quixote; this
impressive-sounding conglomeration turned out to be a three-person show.
Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch directed and designed. I loved the way
they created windmills and mountainscapes and seas and more from ordinary
household implements (stepladders, a blanket, some rope). But again,
cuteness kept rearing its head; and, curiously, there was less true
quixoticism here than in McDermott's own performance in Richard Jones's 1990
Old Vic staging of The Illusion.
The virtues and vices of mime were all evident in MTP Productions' three-man
version of The Three Musketeers. I loved the way that three men managed to
evoke not only the four musketeers, but also the whole dramatis personae of
Dumas's novel (and Gene Kelly &amp; Co. to boot), I yawned through their more
laboriously comic and gratuitous set pieces, I deplored the bright-eyed
dear-audience mugging that kept cropping up, and I giggled happily through
the campy Hollywood grands pas de deux for d'Artagnan and Constance.
And sometimes I found myself oddly thrilled. One brief and wordless scene
between Milady and Cardinal Richelieu was of course absurd; and yet . . . It
was accompanied, to uncannily brilliant effect, by the Dies Irae from
Mozart's Requiem, which lent it both the religious and furious tones
appropriate to Richelieu. And its few gestures went straight to the core of
Dumas's novel, catching its glamour, its danger, its sense of conspiracy,
even its high camp - in only a few instants. How did they suggest so much so
quickly? When mime is economical, and audaciously musical, as here, it is
like conjuring.

Tuesday has become Social Conscience Night. Assignment tells the ghastly
story of 'social cleansing' in Colombia where death squads with names such
as 'Kan Kill' and 'Black Hand' set out to clean up the streets by murdering
prostitutes, drug addicts and street children. It is said that tramps were
lured to a university campus, murdered, and sold to medical students for
dissection. One, who was clubbed almost to death, came round in a room full
of corpses and escaped to alert the police ..who tend to be a part of the
problem instead of the answer (7.45 BBC2).
Undercover Britain found itself a game 71-year-old woman willing to spend
two months with a camcorder filming secretly in a succession of old people's
homes in the Liverpool area. Three of the homes were run by people with
criminal records and a fourth accepted her even though it was registered as
men-only (9.00 C4).
The people with buckets at busy junctions who rush out when the lights go
red and start making your windscreen opaque are the subject of 40 Minutes
(9.50 BBC2).

FT  01 FEB 94 / People: Ian Macpherson dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Macpherson, a leading figure on the Scottish corporate scene, has died
at the age of 57. He had been suffering from a brain tumor since last
autumn.
Macpherson, a big and exceptionally good-natured man, was until recently
chairman of two quoted Scottish companies, Watson &amp; Philip and Low &amp; Bonar,
both based in Dundee, before resiging due to ill health.
After his education at Morrison's Academy in Crieff, Perthshire, Macpherson
trained as a chartered accountant, then became an investment manager with
the Alliance Trust in Dundee, before moving to London where was a
stockbroker with W Greenwell.
He later joined Manufacturers Hanover and in 1979 became a director of the
British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm of the Bank of Scotland, first
in London and then in Edinburgh.
In 1988 he left British Linen bank as deputy chief executive, and began a
career in industry, becoming chief executive of Watson &amp; Philip, the
Dundee-based food distributor, where he soon afterwards took over the chair.
He is credited with taking Watson &amp; Philip from its former marginal position
in wholesale distribution into the condition of being a national player, and
then transforming it into a retailer with a chain of convenience stores.
In 1990 he became non-executive chairman of Low &amp; Bonar, the Dundee-based
manufacturing company in packaging and plastics, where chief executive Jim
Leng yesterday called him 'a clear thinker with a great feel for business
and appreciation of the future.'
In 1992 he was chosen to chair Caledonian Newspaper Publishing, the company
which owns the Glasgow Herald, when it was acquired by its management from
Lonrho. Macpherson was also a director of the International Stock Exchange.
Macpherson, who leaves a wife and two children, moved from Edinburgh to St
Andrews when he joined businesses in Dundee. His main hobby was golf and he
was an energetic raiser of money for charity, particularly those connected
with sport.

FT  01 FEB 94 / People: Age no encumbrance at Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several years beyond the statutory retirement age, Peter Lane - created Lord
Lane of Horsell by Margaret Thatcher in 1990 - has stepped up his duties at
the international waste management group Attwoods to become non-executive
chairman, at 69.
Ken Foreman, a comparative junior at 59, is to continue as chief executive,
while Sir Denis Thatcher, 78, is retiring as non-executive deputy chairman.
By profession an accountant, Lord Lane, right, said yesterday that 'in a
perfect world one doesn't appoint a chairman of 69' but that the board is
fully aware of his age.
The decision to split the chief executive and chairman's role is being made
to ensure compliance with the Cadbury's committee's recommendations on
corporate governance.
Foreman said yesterday that 'it's not easy to find really good
non-executives' and that Lord Lane's 'knowledge, experience and bright mind'
mean that 'he has has all the requisites to be a first class chairman'.
Attwoods has gone through uncomfortable times recently, particularly
concerning litigation in the US, from where it derives some 70 per cent of
its revenues.
But Lord Lane said that a settlement with Eastern Waste Industries, a US
subsidiary, plus the October 1993 sale of another US subsidiary, the
loss-making metal re-cycling company Mindis, which required a Pounds 91m
provision to cover the loss on disposal, had put the group in better shape
to face the future. 'All we need now is for the economy generally to pick
up,' he said yesterday.
In 1992 Lord Lane retired as a senior partner of chartered accountants BDO
Binder Hamlyn and first joined the Attwoods' board in July 1992.
Among his other interests Lord Lane numbers the chairmanship of the charity
Action on Addiction, and the deputy chairmanship of the outdoor advertising
specialist More O'Ferrall.
He said that Attwoods is now seeking to make two new non-executive
appointments, and that one of those will probably go to an American,
boosting the group's representation in its most important region.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Law firms in central London had their worst year for more than a decade in
1993 with profits down on average by 20 per cent, according to the annual
survey of law firm performance carried out by the Centre for Interfirm
Comparison. Typical profits per partner of London firms fell from Pounds
100,000 three years ago to Pounds 72,000 in 1993. Half London firms suffered
a fall in revenue. Litigation was the only area of work to show growth, but
the modest 4 per cent rise indicated the boom in litigation was over, the
centre said.
The profits of provincial firms improved on 1992, but remained below 1980s
levels. Conveyancing, once the mainstay of provincial firms, accounted for
only one-third of revenues.

insurance - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey of UK directors' and officers' liability insurance shows that 62
per cent of companies now have cover, compared with 46 per cent in 1991, and
the total UK D&amp;O premium has risen to between Pounds 65m-Pounds 75m, up from
between Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m in 1991. Almost half the companies that
responded to the Wyatt Company's 1993 survey said they had bought D&amp;O cover
because they felt their directors were at risk, with 22 per cent saying they
had bought it on their insurance advisers' recommendations.
The main business sectors buying D&amp;O cover were banking, consumer
goods/foods, oil/chemical/pharmaceutical, and industrial holdings. All
banking respondents, 88 per cent of consumer/food respondents and 78 per
cent of oil/chemical/pharmaceutical and industrial holdings companies bought
D&amp;O insurance. Compared to 1991, the purchase of D&amp;O cover has increased in
every industrial classification except engineering.

FT  01 FEB 94 / People: Friedman moves from Stoy to Arthur Andersen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Friedman is joining Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth largest
accountancy firm, after jumping ship from Stoy Hayward, the tenth.
Friedman, who said his move from Stoy was 'amicable', will head a new pay
and employee benefits practice, drawing on his experience as head of Stoy
Benefit Consulting.
The move is significant because his role will be to help build up the
discipline for the firm around the world and not just in the UK.
Most Andersen disciplines have by contrast been led from the US, where the
firm was founded. The UK practice recently took the lead in developing a
worldwide insolvency practice.
Jim Wadia, Andersen's managing partner in the UK, expects the UK employee
benefits' practice to be billing more than Pounds 3m within two years; and
the worldwide practice Dollars 15m-18m.
Andersen already carries out similar work in France, Spain and the US. It
was the first UK accountancy firm to devise its own profit-related pay
scheme for staff, since mirrored by other firms including Stoy.
The UK team working with Friedman will include 20 professional staff drawn
from the tax and other existing practice areas, and is likely to begin
hiring new staff.

Robert Clements has been named chairman and chief executive of Marsh &amp;
McLennan Risk Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan
Companies, the New York-based company which is the world's biggest insurance

Clements, 61, is regarded as one of the most innovative thinkers in the

McLennan's backing for new reinsurance ventures in Bermuda such as ACE, EXEL
and Mid-Ocean.
He joined Marsh in 1959 and has for many years headed the group's worldwide

He has been president of the parent company since 1992, a position he will
now relinquish.
Marsh McLennan Risk Capital was formed in 1992 to manage and develop Marsh &amp;

Clements says it will invest in start-up operations in the industry and make
'friendly investments in existing insurance and reinsurance ventures where

FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Sole authority to invalidate directive
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where a national law implements a European Community directive, EC law does
not prevent a national court from examining whether that national law should
be applied if it is found that the provisions of the directive are invalid.
However, it is for the European Court of Justice to determine whether the
directive is valid or not.
This finding was the outcome of a case concerning the sale in Germany of a
product - Setaderm - used to combat hair loss. The product contained a
substance - 11 alpha OHP - which was banned under German law.
The company marketing Setaderm took the product off the market, but brought
proceedings in the national courts for a declaration that it could lawfully
manufacture and market the product on the basis that 11 alpha OHP was not
harmful to human health and that its use in cosmetic products should not be
banned.
The national court commissioned an expert's report, which found that 11
alpha OHP was not harmful to human health. However, prior to the delivery of
the report, the 12th Directive on Cosmetic Products was published.
Article 2 of the directive provided that the marketing of products
containing 11 alpha OHP was to be prohibited from January 1 1991, and that
sale to the final consumer was to be prohibited from December 31 1991. The
directive was implemented in Germany by a law passed on March 21 1990, more
than six months before the expert's report was delivered.
The German court was convinced by the findings of its expert and thus took
the view that the national legislation banning 11 alpha OHP was invalid, but
recognised that this would have the effect of rendering ineffective the
relevant provisions of the directive. It referred the issue to the European
Court of Justice.
The ECJ was asked three questions. First, whether a national court was
prevented from regarding a national law as invalid or void if and insofar as
that law consisted only of provisions implementing a directive. Second, if a
national court could not carry out this exercise, whether a directive had
direct effect. Third, if the answer to either of the two previous questions
was in the affirmative, whether the prohibition of 11 alpha OHP under the
12th Commission directive was valid.
The ECJ decided that answers to the first two questions would only be
relevant to the national court if the relevant provisions of the directive
were found to be valid. It thus examined the third question first.
The manufacturer of Setaderm argued that, before any product was added to
the list of prohibited substances in the directive, the Scientific Committee
for Cosmetology had to be consulted. In the present case, this committee had
not been consulted. There had thus been a breach of an essential procedural
requirement, causing the prohibition of 11 alpha OHP to be invalid.
The Commission, Germany and the UK argued the provision was valid as the
committee only had to be consulted if a member state or the Commission
requested it, which had not been the case here.
The ECJ found that the wording of the directive in the different language
versions of the text made it unclear whether the committee had to be
consulted in all cases. One interpretation was that followed by the
Commission, Germany and the UK. The other interpretation was that it was for
the Commission or member states to take the initiative to convene the
committee, which had to be consulted in all cases.
The ECJ examined the aims of the committee and found that the purpose of
consulting it was to ensure that measures adopted at Community level were
necessary and adapted to the objective pursued by the directive, namely to
protect human health. Consultation of the committee had, therefore, to be
mandatory in all cases.
As it was not contested that the committee had not been consulted about the
prohibition of 11 alpha OHP, the ECJ declared that the relevant provision of
the directive prohibiting the substance was invalid; hence, it had no need
to answer the first two questions from the German court.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: A burden on business - EU competition
law has come under fire for wasting time. Robert Rice examines ways it could
be improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The competition rules of the European Union are unsuited to the 1990s and in
need of reform. This is the view of the Confederation of British Industry
concerning the current regulations, which were adopted in the 1950s, and the
main administrative procedures and policy directions, which were established
in the 1960s.
The CBI has produced a discussion document, with a six-point plan for reform
of the Treaty of Rome rules on anti-competitive agreements and abuse of
market power. Launching it last week, Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general, said that, if the benefits of the single market were to be
realised, an effective and efficient competition policy was needed.
All too often, when companies sought to clear their business plans with the
European Commission in Brussels, they met with delay and legal uncertainty,
he said.
Progress had been made in the handling of mergers and joint ventures in
recent years, which had proved popular with European industry. But in most
other respects, the CBI believed, the Commission's approach to competition
law had ossified.
The way the regulations operate is still unclear. There is confusion over
the precise scope of the prohibition on anti-competitive agreements under
article 85 of the Rome Treaty, and the extent to which an exemption may be
available for a particular commercial agreement.
Industry finds it difficult to judge whether an agreement is covered by the
European regime. In theory, the Commission's jurisdiction extends only where
an agreement has a significant and foreseeable effect on intra-state trade
within the EU. In practice, the test as to whether there is such an effect
is so wide as to make it virtually impossible for companies to say with any
precision that the rules do not apply to any particular agreement.
Uncertainty is increased by the Commission's continued assertion of
jurisdiction in cases where the effect on intra-Union trade appears
insignificant.
As a result of all this, companies end up notifying agreements unnecessarily
to the Commission - including agreements that do not even have a significant
effect on competition, says the CBI.
Concern about the time and money being wasted led the Commission in 1986 to
adopt a policy of granting block negative clearance, where certain
agreements are assumed not to need vetting. Such clearance applies to
agreements involving goods and services with 5 per cent or less of the
market, and where the aggregate worldwide turnover of the companies involved
does not exceed Ecu200m (Pounds 157m) - a de minimis test.
The intention was to reduce the burden on business of having to notify the
Commission about minor agreements. In reality the initiative has been of
little value to business. Because agreements can only benefit from block
negative clearance where both the market test and turnover test are
satisfied, companies with a worldwide turnover of more than Ecu200m still
have to refer all agreements, no matter how small their share of the
relevant product market.
The CBI also has concerns about the regime for gaining exemption for an
agreement. The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to grant individual
exemptions, but does not have the resources to assess all anti-competitive
agreements individually. To get round this, it has developed block
exemptions for certain categories of agreements and developed procedural
short cuts, such as comfort letters.
But neither of these approaches has proved satisfactory. Comfort letters,
where the Commission informs the parties without taking a formal decision
that it does not intend to take further action, lack certainty. Although the
Commission is unlikely to reopen the matter without good reason, the letters
are not binding on it or on national courts.
Block exemptions are subject to arbitrary and irrational limitations. For
example, the 1983 Exclusive Distribution Regulation is limited to exclusive
distribution agreements between two parties, relating to goods, but not
services, and to goods sold for resale with no significant value added.
The biggest problems for industry arise in the handling of commercial
agreements, according to Mr Laurence Elks, a partner of London solicitors
Nabarro Nathanson and chairman of the CBI group which produced the
discussion document. He said CBI members were 'all very conscious of the
vast amount of time and expense incurred dealing with absolutely innocuous
agreements'.
The CBI wants the Commission to 'lift the burden of regulation where it is
serving no purpose', he said. This would require a number of changes.
The rules should apply only where commercial agreements had a genuine effect
on intra-state trade. The Commission should set out clear guidelines
covering the widest possible range of circumstances in which agreements
would be deemed not to have an effect on intra-state trade.
To reduce the number of insubstantial agreements caught by article 85, the
turnover element of the de minimis test should be abolished and the market
share threshold raised substantially.
And block exemption regulations should be reassessed to guide companies
towards drafting agreements which do not need Commission clearance.
The CBI has fewer concerns about article 86, which covers abuse of market
power. Nevertheless, Mr Elks's committee is worried about the swingeing
fines that can be imposed for behaviour which was believed to be legitimate
at the time it was undertaken.
It is also concerned that intellectual property rights might be undermined
if the Commission develops further the notion that, under article 86, it is
unlawful for rights owners to refuse to grant licences to competitors. This
issue is currently before the European Court of Justice in the Magill TV
listings case. The advocate-general's preliminary opinion will be delivered
next week.
In future, the CBI would like to see action under article 86 taken only
where dominant companies are clearly abusing their market power.
The CBI also has concerns about a number of the procedures and practices of
the Brussels competition directorate, DGIV. There is a lack of safeguards
ensuring that the rules of natural justice and rights of defence are
respected, it says, and a lack of supervision of the fact-finding and
decision-making processes.
These concerns have also been addressed recently by a subcommittee of the UK
House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, which called
for improvements in the Commission's handling of competition cases.
Such matters were not merely of British interest, said Mr Graham Mason, head
of corporate and commercial affairs at the CBI. There was a general feeling
among the members of Unice, the European employers federation, that
competition rules needed to be reinterpreted to reduce delays and cut
unnecessary bureaucracy, he said.
He did not expect every member of Unice to support all the detail of the
CBI's proposals, but if the discussion document initiated a debate, pressure
on the Commission to take action would mount.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Sailing to new markets -
In the first of a series on exporting, Richard Gourlay looks at a DTI
initiative which uses the skills of private-sector industrialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasingly competitive domestic market in the UK; a currency that some
say is undervalued and therefore gives an international edge; trade barriers
being dismantled in the nearest market - they all point one way, UK
companies should be stepping up their exports to Europe, if not further
afield.
Yet, according to the Institute of Export, only 40,000 companies in the UK
regularly export in any year, as measured by submissions of zero-rated VAT
returns, and only double this number export on an occasional basis.
Many companies, in fact, see exports as troublesome bolt-on activities. And
those that have products addressing market niches abroad - and an ability to
export - are often afraid to make the first step overseas, according to Ian
Campbell, director-general of the institute.
The Financial Times this week launches a series of articles addressing the
issues exporters must confront. Today we look at a specific Department of
Trade and Industry initiative led by industrialists seconded from the
private sector who bring together potential exporters and companies in
markets they know.
Next week, we will look at how banks deal with exporters.
Subsequent articles will include dealing with export credit insurance,
getting paid, customs and VAT issues, appointing a distributor or agent,
dealing with correspondent banks and hedging of foreign exchange risk, basic
market research abroad, and the DTI's other export promotion schemes.
We would also welcome readers' experiences on fax 071 873 3933.
Two years ago Exchange Textiles of Manchester was fighting for business in a
buyers' market against a background of weak demand; prices barely covered
overheads.
Richard Grubb, managing director, recognised that smaller textile
manufacturers were dangerously dependent on the UK retail trade. 'I decided
that for a company to be successful in the next 10 years it must have up to
50 per cent of sales in exports.'
But like many smaller companies, Grubb had no experience of exporting. He
identified a possible demand for his fashionable childrens' underwear in the
US and Germany, but where should he start?
Grubb says he was greatly helped by a new Department of Trade and Industry
scheme called the Export Promoter Initiative, brainchild of Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Two years later - and only four months after Exchange Textiles shipped its
first set of underwear - the company is heading for exports in its first
year equal to a quarter of its total Pounds 1m turnover. And as long as he
gets paid he says the profit margins achieved are significantly better than
in the UK.
Heseltine used the Conservative Party conference in 1992 to announce that
100 businessmen and women would be seconded from British industry to help
the export effort. So far he has only convinced 64 large companies to donate
the time - and the salaries - of experienced exporters to the scheme.
But there are signs the initiative could provide the much-needed
private-sector drive and market experience that have been lacking from the
DTI's export promotion services. 'The initiative works because businessmen
are working together with other businessmen, banging heads together in a way
that civil servants cannot do,' says Greg Shenkman, an export promoter who
headed merchant bank Kleinwort Benson's operation in Japan until last year.
Each export promoter adopts a different approach in the country he or she
focuses on. Shenkman's priority is to help companies which are already
trying to export to Japan to establish a more effective presence. But, like
other export promoters, he is also using his knowledge of the local market
to sniff out potential market opportunities for which he then seeks
suppliers in the UK.
His fellow export promoter, Peter Bacon, who worked in Japan for five years
with Philips, the electronics group, has a different approach. Initially, he
is trying to encourage import substitution by getting Japanese companies
that have recently arrived in the UK to increase their local purchases.
Export Promoter differs from earlier DTI schemes in that it helps British
companies make contact with the decision takers.
To some extent Bacon should be pushing against an open door because of the
yen's appreciation. But, 'purchasing centres are often controlled in Japan
so it is difficult to get chosen as a supplier. We are targetting the
(Japanese electronic manufacturers) in the UK with the biggest yen content
and the biggest need to localise more'.
The theory is that once initial contacts have been established, UK suppliers
should have made the kind of contacts in Japan that can lead to direct
exports.
Bacon will be taking 10 companies to Japan in April and will be ensuring
that all the Japanese electronic manufacturers in the UK are aware of the
visit.
Grubb's first contact was with Andrew Garcia, sales manager for Europe at
Pilkington Glass until he became an export promoter after attending a DTI
seminar on how to appoint a commercial agent.
Grubb was advised to send samples and a company profile to UK embassies in
Germany. But even after the commercial secretary in Berlin put him in touch
with a suitable agent, he was still faced with a mountain of questions.
He had regular meetings with Garcia about the handling of foreign exchange
exposure, distribution, dealing with the agent and the demanding quality the
German market required. Garcia was the first person he called after
returning from Germany with his first Pounds 70,000 order and he says he
will stay in touch with the DTI. 'From a standing start in Germany I
couldn't believe we had this order and nor could he.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: A better use for design - Why are computers
often so complicated to use? Hugh Aldersey-Williams looks at solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide investment in digital communications and information systems is
about to soar, but many companies have been slow to appreciate just how much
this could change their operations. As well as affecting the electronics and
telecommunications sectors, the shift in industrial emphasis will also
influence the shape of all but the simplest products.
In Britain, the design implications are well appreciated at London's Royal
College of Art which trains students in computer-related design.
The focus is on 'interaction design'. Products are becoming less bulky and
more interactive. Design is less about objects themselves and more about
use. 'In an increasingly software-driven economy, design becomes more
important rather than less,' says Derrick de Kerckhove, director of the
McLuhan Programme in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto.
'It practically becomes the content of the product.'
But interaction design has yet to make its name. Even manufacturers
respected both for the styling of their products and for making them
user-friendly are not yet making full use of designers in shaping their
non-material aspect. 'Even at Apple Computer, there are few designers
involved in interaction design. It is mostly computer engineers and a
sprinkling of psychologists,' says Gillian Crampton-Smith, professor of
computer-related design at the RCA.
Computer specialists solve problems in ways that reflect their understanding
of the workings of a machine rather than its eventual users. The result is
often an electronically efficient device that is difficult or unpleasant to
use.
'In the past, display graphics have been done by software engineers, for
example,' says Stephen Hall, chief executive of IN. form, the UK design
consultancy. 'Their problem is that they tend to live in a very closed world
of computer technology that they understand very well.' Designers' relative
ignorance of the technical side can be a benefit.
The roll call of disciplines that could make future electronic products less
alien will surprise many business people. According to Max Whitby of the
Multimedia Corporation, an associate company of the BBC that publishes
multimedia products, 'it's a synthesis of three disciplines: print design;
television design for planning the delivery of information over time; and
industrial design for the controls, etc'.
These new design procedures offer some distinct business advantages. Where
there is a temporal dimension, for example, it is possible to show that one
design proposal is more effective than another simply by measuring the time
a user takes to navigate a database to perform a desired task.
It also becomes practical to test several trial designs. The IDEO design
company of the US used this strategy in the design of an infusion pump - for
McGaw, the American medical manufacturer - which delivers drugs
intravenously under automatic control. By mocking up instrument controls on
a touch-sensitive computer display and testing them with nurses, the
designers found that doses should be programmed using a volume control
rather than a numerical keypad. This eliminates the risk of large errors in
dosage through pressing the wrong number or by misplacing a decimal point.
This technique was not available, for example, in the early days of bank
automated teller machines. People were leaving their plastic cards behind
because the machines gave out the money before returning the card.
That problem arose, says Hall, who designed the latest generation of ATMs
for American Express, because the machines were made by a small clique of
specialist manufacturers who did not consult enough people at the design
stage. ATMs now return the card first.
Many interactive products still do little to make users feel at ease - and
not because the technology is fundamentally complex or hostile. Frequently,
there has been no attempt to design 'a fluid, immersive experience', says
Whitby. 'Too often the designer is brought in at the end just to fix the
icons.'
Because the requisite teams have mostly not been assembled within the
commercial sector, the potential for interaction design is perhaps best seen
at places such as the RCA where groups of students from different
disciplines can be brought together to collaborate on specific projects. On
behalf of American Express, IN. form set up a research study to extend the
ATM: what other services could it provide? And how could those services be
made more user-friendly?
The RCA students' projects envisaged a multi-dimensional data space which
could show present and past performance of stocks for personal investors.
The FT-SE 100, the London stock market index, is shown on one wall of the
space for comparison. The growth of investments of different amounts is
modelled by columns of different diameter which grow over time from the
floor of the space.
The designer's concern is that the user approaches technology with
preconceptions that must be shattered and fears that must be allayed. In the
past, computer users have been willing to put up with bad design.
Increasingly, however, people are becoming less indulgent.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: On the neural network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies are waking up to the possibilities of neural computing,
which enables patterns to be recognised and masses of confusing data to be
analysed, according to a study prepared for the Department of Trade and
Industry.
Neural computers, with programs allowing them to 'learn' from examples and
comparisons, differ from conventional ones in their ability to analyse and
predict rather than carry out complex calculations. Originating in US
university research into the brain, they are increasingly used in industry
and finance.
The DTI study, carried out by Hi-Tech Marketing, found companies had
responded encouragingly to its efforts to promote the benefits of neural
computing. Many of the 150 companies polled planned to adopt neural
techniques, 55 per cent within a year and a further 20 per cent in two
years.
In March last year, the DTI launched a Pounds 6m programme to support seven
user clubs and an awareness programme run by Touche Ross, the accountancy
group. Projects now under way at the clubs include an intelligent imaging
system for automatic track inspection for London Underground, a thermal
model of a nuclear waste melter at British Nuclear Fuels, a data extraction
system with the Sun Alliance insurance company and a vehicle sensor unit for
monitoring traffic congestion.
Ray Browne, manager of the DTI's neural computing awareness programme, says
many applications can be carried out on personal computers. Neural computers
 -also known as neural networks, non-linear programming, adaptive solutions
or adaptive programming - are not meant to replace existing systems but to
enhance them, he adds. 'It's a mistake to say this is a panacea, but it
certainly does open up lots of new avenues.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: Slippery slope for user support - An extra cost
faced by purchasers of PC software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal computer software is increasingly cheaper to buy, but the real cost
of using it is rising. Several leading PC software publishers have begun to
charge for 'premium' support services for their products, on top of the
'free' support included in the purchase price of a software licence.
Lotus Development, for example, is now offering fee-based support for Lotus
1-2-3 and Ami Pro - after pioneering the approach on its enterprise-wide
Lotus Notes communications system. Microsoft, too, now charges for extra
support on its Microsoft Office products having established a precedent with
charges on support for its Windows NT and MS-Dos operating systems.
The worry for users is that this is possibly the top of a very slippery
slope and that they may find themselves having to pay for all software
support.
Two recent trends are fuelling this fear: the drastic drop in PC software
prices and the increasing complexity of the programs. Both are linked to the
popularity of software 'suite' bundles, in which several applications are
bundled together at a lower price than the sum of the individual
applications.
While software is getting cheaper, it is also more unwieldy. And that means
that support, as well as user training, is likely to become a much more
important part of a company's information technology costs. Deployment of
that support is a problem which all users must tackle.
Perhaps aware that annual support contracts like those in the mainframe and
minicomputer sectors might make PC users rebel, PC software makers have been
clever in the way they have introduced fee-based support for applications.
In the US, Lotus, for example, offers users a choice of support packages.
They may dial into a '900' toll telephone number at the rate of Dollars 2
(Pounds 1.30) per minute (the first minute is free) for 24-hour support on
its flagship Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
Alternatively, Lotus users can pay a Dollars 129 annual support contract for
applications or Dollars 295 per year per user for Lotus Notes support. Lotus
still offers basic free technical support for most of its products for the
first 90 days after purchase - as well as a dial-in bulletin board and a
'forum' area on the CompuServe online information service.
Microsoft offers a similar range of support services in the US - along with
a more varied range of options for developers and corporations. But
according to Tony Ettlinger, Microsoft UK director of product support
services, these are not designed to be profit centres.
Ettlinger says they are merely designed to cover most of the costs of
providing services that users - particularly those in large corporations -
are demanding. 'There is no way we are making a move to provide product
support at a profit,' he says. 'In the case of Windows NT, we decided on
something we thought would be a fair and reasonable charge for support.'
Microsoft has also been encouraging third parties to provide support for its
new Windows NT operating system. Traditional minicomputer makers such as
Digital Equipment, NCR and Hewlett-Packard have all started fee-based NT
support services in the past six months, with the backing of Microsoft.
Microsoft's rationale for this move is that it does not want to have to
create the kind of support infrastructure that a minicomputer-level
operating system such as NT demands, although it does want one to exist. By
involving third parties experienced in providing this kind of support, it
hopes to get the best of both worlds: a solid base of support for users and
strong backing for NT by minicomputer vendors, both at little cost to
Microsoft.
But if price-slashing and bundling continues at current rates, software
companies may have to change the policy of not seeing support as a profit
centre. It may become the only place left to make money in the PC industry.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Prison officers urged to fight criminal justice bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates from the Prison Officers Association were yesterday urged to mount
an intensive campaign against government legislation which they fear will
neuter their trade union rights.
Mr Brian Caton, association vice-chairman, said the government's proposed
criminal justice reforms were an attack on the POA's democratic right to
represent prison workers and would only perpetuate troubled industrial
relations.
Delegates at a meeting, held at the Trades Union Congress headquarters in
London, were told they should lobby their MPs to change the criminal justice
and public order bill. Clauses in the bill make it an offence for anyone to
induce a prison officer to withhold his services and for any officer to
refuse to perform a duty imposed under prison rules.
The association says the measure will have 'profound consequences for free
collective bargaining' because it will allow the home secretary to regulate
pay. It will also enable parts of a prison to be managed separately by
different private companies, and require prison officers working in the
state sector to transfer to private jails if necessary.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Consumer spending is forecast to rise 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer spending is expected to increase by 17 per cent in real terms
during the next five years, Mintel, the market research organisation, says
today.
Mintel says the largest spending growth sectors are likely to be household
and garden products, medical and school fees, and insurance and pensions.
Falls in unemployment and base interest rates and low levels of inflation
should lead to higher disposable incomes between 1993 and 1998, with
spending on home and security taking priority as the recession ends, the
report says.
An upturn in the housing market is forecast to stimulate spending on garden
products (up 36 per cent during the next five years) and hardware (up 35 per
cent). House purchase and alterations expenditure is set to rise by 30 per
cent.
Spending on medical and education fees is likely to increase by 31 per cent,
while insurance and pensions spending is forecast to grow by 26 per cent. Mr
Peter Ayton, Mintel's head of research, said there was increasing public
concern about the need to prepare for old age and ill health 'in the face of
dwindling government resources'.
The popularity of home entertainment will be maintained over the period,
with sales of brown goods such as televisions and hi-fi equipment, set to
increase by 35 per cent, the report says. Interest in healthier lifestyles
will increase spending on fruit and vegetables, while soft drinks will
continue to be the fastest-growing part of the drinks sector.
The highest growth areas in consumer spending over the past year have been:
education fees; shoes, clothing and furniture repair; medical insurance;
house contents and building insurance. Expenditure in all these areas grew
by more than 10 per cent in 1993, the report says.
Overall, housing accounted for the largest part of consumer spending last
year, as it has in previous years.
A total of Pounds 88.4bn - 22.2 per cent of household expenditure - went on
housing. Next came transport (Pounds 48.8bn, 12.2 per cent of expenditure),
then food eaten at home (Pounds 43.8bn, 11 per cent).
A 10-year analysis by Mintel of spending patterns shows some changes in the
shape of household budgets. Spending on food eaten at home, heating,
lighting and power, domestic appliances and drink now each account for a
smaller share of household budgets than in 1983.
The proportion of spending on housing has increased from 20.1 per cent to
22.2 per cent. Other spending which has increased its share of the household
budget includes insurance and pensions, medical and educational fees, and
household services such as cleaning.
Over the 10-year period average gross household income increased from Pounds
12,490 to Pounds 23,533. Stripping out inflation, this represents a real
increase of 14 per cent, says the report.
Mintel, however, also points to a growing polarisation of income. The
top-earning 20 per cent of households increased their share of Britain's
total household income from 35 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent in 1992.
At the other end of the scale, the share of total income taken by the
lowest-earning 20 per cent of households fell from 10 per cent in 1979 to
slightly more than 5 per cent in 1992.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Bank mortgage lending falls 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lending by leading British banks fell 14 per cent in December,
although gross mortgage loans were at a record Pounds 19.3bn for last year
as a whole, figures released yesterday by the British Bankers' Association
show.
The association said gross mortgage lending was Pounds 1.36bn in December,
compared with Pounds 1.58bn the previous month.
There was a sharper fall in the seasonally adjusted figures for net lending,
which dropped from Pounds 871m in November to Pounds 733m in December.
The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders
in the UK.
Figures produced earlier this month by the Building Societies Association
showed that societies' gross mortgage advances totalled Pounds 31.5bn in
1993 as a whole, and Pounds 8.1bn for the final three months of the year.
The fourth quarter figure for leading British banks' gross mortgage lending
was Pounds 4.6bn.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said there had been a
'deceleration' in banks' mortgage lending recently, only part of which was
seasonal. He added, however, that the rise of 16 per cent in gross mortgage
lending figures for 1993 compared with 1992 'probably represents their
largest annual market share'.
That judgment appears borne out by a comparison of net lending figures for
banks and societies. Net building society advances last year were Pounds
9.4bn, compared with Pounds 13.5bn in 1992. Net lending by the leading banks
rose from almost Pounds 7bn in 1992 to just over Pounds 9bn.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Councils to fight abolition in court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Avon and Cleveland county councils were yesterday given leave to mount High
Court challenges to government proposals for their abolition and replacement
with four unitary authorities.
A High Court judge gave permission for both authorities to bring judicial
review proceedings aimed at quashing the recommendations of the Local
Government Commission. The move follows last Friday's High Court successes
of Lancashire and Derbyshire county councils in overturning the revised
guidance on plans to replace the two-tier system of local government with
unitary authorities.

FT  01 FEB 94 / BT cuts price of Australasia calls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is cutting the cost of some overseas telephone
calls in the latest phase of its price war with Mercury.
From Wednesday a standard-rate call to Australasia will cost 70p a minute
and a cheap-rate call 60p a minute, BT said. This will cut the cost of a
five-minute, cheap-rate call to Pounds 2.92 from Pounds 3.36, representing a
13 per cent reduction.
Mercury said its charges to Australasia remained cheaper at just more than
52p a minute standard rate and less than 45p a minute cheap rate.

Stomach upsets can be expected from swimming in dirty sea water but beaches
that meet European Commission standards should be safe, a government report
said yesterday.
Only 80 per cent of the UK's 458 classified bathing beaches now meet
European standards, according to government figures. Water companies are
investing billions of pounds to comply with rules to stop pumping sewage
into the sea.
Yesterday's report was the final stage in a four-year study. It questioned
16,000 people on eight beaches and found that Morecambe in Lancashire,
Cleethorpes in Humberside, and Ramsgate in Kent were among the beaches where
bathers suffered unusual rates of health problems.
Infections appeared to be linked to the length of time spent in the water.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Labour urges faster cheque crediting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called for action to prevent high street banks from making
Pounds 300m a year out of customers by delaying the crediting of cheques to
private individual and business accounts.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said he had asked the
banking ombudsman to intervene and was seeking a meeting with Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury.
Three of the high street banks - National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland -
advise customers that it takes four days for cheques to clear and be
credited to their account, said Mr Griffiths. Cheques are cleared within
three days, he said, letting the banks earn an extra day's interest on
customers' money.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Managers attack quality of training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers would like more official help in weeding out poor providers of
training, on which they are estimated to spend more than Pounds 18bn a year,
says an Industrial Society survey published today, Lisa Wood writes.
The survey says half of Britain's managers believe a significant amount of
the staff training they pay for is 'very poor'.
Much more than a third of the 531 managers surveyed felt that increased
regulation was desirable. Half of them agreed that there should be some kind
of system to licence approved trainers.
The society describes the concern over training quality as 'alarming'. But
it does not support a licensing system, which it says might be bureaucratic.
Instead, it calls for training bodies to draw up agreed criteria to help
employers judge the effectiveness of trainers.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Dormobile comes to an end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dormobile, once a prominent name in the motor industry, came to an end
yesterday when its 200 staff were dismissed by a liquidator at the factory
gates in Folkestone, Kent.
The company, which for more than 20 years produced a successful range of
minibuses and motor caravans that were frequently used in television and
film (above), went into voluntary liquidation days before it was due in
court to fight a bid to have it compulsorily wound up.
The 200 workers had agreed to work for Pounds 50 a week, a quarter of their
normal pay. Dormobile's problems have been mounting for 12 years since
production of the Bedford chassis-based van ended when the design became
obsolete. It shifted emphasis to produce bigger, 29-seater buses based on
Iveco Ford and Mercedes chassis. Until last week it was producing around six
buses a week at Pounds 24,000 each. The company had orders worth Pounds 3m
for buses but was unable to convert the orders into vehicles.

Much more than a third of the 531 managers surveyed felt that increased
regulation was desirable. Half of them agreed that there should be some kind
of system to licence approved trainers. Respondents did not give opinions as
to who should provide the regulation.
At present the market for training is largely unregulated, although some
training and enterprise councils - the government-backed training bodies in
England and Wales - provide lists of 'approved' consultancies for
initiatives such as Investors in People, the programme which seeks to help
employers link training more effectively to business needs.
The society, which exists to promote best personnel management practice and
is a large provider of training, describes the concern over training quality
as 'alarming'. But it does not support a licensing system, which it says
might be bureaucratic.
Instead, it calls for training bodies to draw up agreed criteria to help
employers judge the effectiveness of trainers.
Mr Andrew Forrest, the society's human resources director, said a more
fundamental issue was that while employers spent a lot of money on training,
many of them did not know exactly what they wanted from a course and so it
was more than likely they would not be satisfied with the outcome.
The vast majority of employers, he said, had no system in place to specify
their training needs or measure the results. Employers, he said, should
think more carefully about why they sent people on courses and consider
whether other forms of training might be more appropriate.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Output wavers but trend remains upward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing output fell back in January but remains on an upward trend,
says a survey published yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply.
The survey's index result is based on responses from purchasing managers at
manufacturers, and is designed to give an early indication of changes in
economic activity. The index dropped from 54.6 per cent in December to 49.1
per cent in January, its lowest level since January 1993.
The drop to below 50 per cent signalled an overall decline in manufacturing
output. But the institute said this mainly reflected seasonal factors.
'The demand for goods, especially consumer goods, tailed off after
Christmas,' the survey said.
The index, which has been running for almost two years, is not yet
seasonally adjusted.
The employment index also dropped - from 50.2 per cent in December to 47.5
per cent in January - but the institute said that much of the contraction
could be attributed to the release of temporary staff 'as the busy seasonal
period finished'.
The outlook for manufacturers is encouraging. A significant number of
purchasing managers interviewed reported strong growth in new orders in
January, particularly in export markets.
The managers' optimism was also reflected in the stocks of purchases index,
which rose from 47.1 per cent in December to 50.9 per cent in January. The
institute reported that a considerable number of companies began to rebuild
stock levels after the end of the year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Paper company to shed 500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Dickinson Stationery, which makes Basildon Bond, Challenge, Three
Candlesticks and Lion paper and envelopes, is to cut 500 jobs over the next
12 months.
The company is to shed 300 jobs from its plant in Apsley, Hertfordshire, by
May. The GPMU print union said this included 86 managerial and technical
staff.
The rest of the cuts are expected at the company's other manufacturing plant
at Kirkby near Liverpool, and at distribution sites at Glasgow, Belfast,
Birmingham and Salford, Greater Manchester.
Mr Peter McLoughlin, chairman and chief executive of John Dickinson, said:
'Difficult trading conditions have forced us to shape our plans in this way
to safeguard our future. An unfortunate and sad consequence of these plans
is the need to cut jobs.'
The company added: 'Wherever we can, if people are offering voluntary
redundancy and if that fits in with our plans, we will accept these offers.
But compulsory redundancies may become necessary.'
The decision follows a business review late last year.
The company has an annual turnover of about Pounds 70m and has lost money
for two years.
John Dickinson is owned by Biber of Switzerland, and employs 1,200 in the
UK.
Mr John Abbott of the GPMU said the redundancy plans were a shock. Union
representatives are meeting management tomorrow.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Foreign outlay on property 'up 70%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas investors increased their spending on UK commercial property by 70
per cent to Pounds 2.2bn last year, providing a further stimulus to the
fast-recovering British property market.
German, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern investors led the surge of investment
in UK property, according to a report published yesterday by DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, chartered surveyors.
The resurgence of overseas interest in UK property, after two years of
decline, was mainly inspired by the devaluation of sterling, the falling
costs of borrowing and the high investment yields available on property.
German investors, who spent a total of Pounds 700m, were the most prominent
source of overseas finance. Middle Eastern investors spent Pounds 350m, much
of which came from wealthy private individuals. Far Eastern investors spent
Pounds 440m, 60 per cent of which was accounted for by Hong Kong and China.
Just over half the money invested by overseas buyers went into central
London, leaving Pounds 400m for Greater London and Pounds 475m for the
regions.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe said it expected overseas buyers to play a less
important role in the UK property market this year, although their total
spending was likely to remain at about Pounds 2bn a year for the forseeable
future.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stomach upsets can be expected from swimming in dirty sea water, but beaches
which meet European Commission standards should be safe, a government report
said yesterday.
The four-year study was set up in 1989 by the environment and health
departments, the Welsh Office and the National Rivers Authority - the
environmental watchdog - after rising public concern about the dirtiness of
beaches.
Only some 80 per cent of the UK's 458 classified bathing beaches now meet
European standards, according to government figures. Water companies are
investing billions of pounds to comply with rules to stop pumping sewage
into the sea.
Yesterday's report was the final stage in the study. It questioned 16,000
holidaymakers on eight beaches and found that Morecambe in Lancashire,
Cleethorpes in Humberside, and Ramsgate in Kent were among the beaches where
bathers suffered unusual rates of health problems.
Scientists found no link between ear, eye, nose and throat infections and
the level of bacteria in the water. The infections appeared to be linked to
the length of time spent in the water. Scientists suggested that after some
time in the water, people's bodies lose some of their natural barriers to
bacteria and viruses.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Prison officers urged to fight reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates from the Prison Officers Association were yesterday urged to mount
an intensive campaign against government legislation which they fear will
neuter their trade union rights.
Mr Brian Caton, association vice-chairman, said the government's proposed
criminal justice reforms were an attack on the POA's democratic right to
represent prison workers and would only perpetuate troubled industrial
relations. He said that a rise in lawlessness in jails had coincided with
the prison service's drive towards efficiency savings.
In the past five years, Mr Caton said, the prisons had witnessed nearly
30,000 assaults by prisoners on staff and fellow inmates, more than 13,000
drug finds, over 200 suicides, 79 hostage incidents and more than 100 riots
or protests.
He said: 'The cost to the taxpayer of this unchecked lawlessness amounts to
Pounds 1bn.'
He condemned the criminal justice and public order bill currently going
through parliament, which he said did nothing to address the 'horrendous
spiral of violence' in prisons.
Delegates at a meeting, held at the Trades Union Congress headquarters in
London, were told they should lobby their MPs to change the bill. Mr David
Evans, POA general secretary, said it 'neuters the right of prison officers
to carry out their lawful authority.'
Key clauses in the bill make it an offence for anyone to induce a prison
officer to withhold his services and for any officer to refuse to perform a
duty imposed under prison rules.
The association says the law will have 'profound consequences for free
collective bargaining' because it will allow the home secretary to regulate
pay. It will also enable parts of a prison to be managed separately by
different private companies, and require prison officers working in the
state sector to transfer to private jails if necessary.
The association has already had its right to take industrial action
withdrawn because of a court ruling last autumn.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Sir Brian Kellett: Unigate chief - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Brian Kellett, chairman of Unigate, the dairy, food and distribution
group, died on Sunday after a short illness. He was 71.
Sir Brian studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and, after
wartime service in operations research at the Admiralty, began his
industrial career in 1949 when he joined the St Helens-based glassmaker
Pilkington.
In 1955 he moved to engineering group Tube Investments, which was later to
become TI Group, where he spent 30 years. He was chairman from 1976 until he
left almost 10 years ago. He was knighted in 1979.
In 1985, only six months after his retirement from TI, Sir Brian was
appointed chairman of the Port of London Authority. Before he took over, the
authority had lost more than Pounds 52m in nine years. Under his
chairmanship, it returned to profitability. Tilbury, its last remaining dock
undertaking, was privatised and the groundwork was laid for clearing the
authority's government debts.
Sir Brian became a non-executive director of Unigate in 1974 and chairman in
November 1991. During his chairmanship, the company undertook a number of
disposals and acquisitions.
The company remains one of the largest dairy groups in Britain with a 16 per
cent share of the liquid milk market. In the latter months of Sir Brian's
chairmanship the group was involved in early negotiations on supply and
price resulting from the government's decision to alter the milk marketing
arrangements in place since the 1930s.
Sir Brian was also a director at Lombard North Central, and a member of the
Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life. He was a member of
the Industrial Society council, a vice-president of the Engineering
Employers' Federation and a governor at the London Business School and
Imperial College.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Part-timers hit the exchequer's pocket: Philip Coggan, in
the third of a series on the tax base, looks at changes in the labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The changes in the UK labour market during recent years have been much
trumpeted - the old pattern of males working from nine to five, five days a
week, is no longer the norm. New jobs, when created, are increasingly
part-time or involve self-employment and are often taken by women.
The implications of this for Britain's tax base have not received much
attention, but the change in working practices could be a factor in the
government's funding difficulties.
A number of the 'supply-side reforms' made by the Thatcher administration
were designed to encourage the growth of part-time and low-paid employment.
But the proportion of the income of part-time workers taken in tax will be
smaller than from their full-time colleagues because of the system of
allowances. For example, an individual can earn Pounds 3,445 a year before
paying income tax, and in the 1993-94 tax year pays a rate of only 20 per
cent on the next Pounds 2,500 of income.
The effect of this can be quite substantial. While an individual earning a
salary of Pounds 12,000 will pay Pounds 2,001.25 in tax, two people earning
Pounds 6,000 a year each will pay a combined total of just Pounds 1,002.50.
Similar shortfalls can occur with National Insurance. In the current tax
year, employees only start paying National Insurance when they earn Pounds
56 a week. Once they pass that threshold, they pay 2 per cent on the first
Pounds 56 and 9 per cent thereafter (up to Pounds 420 a week). So an
individual earning Pounds 12,000 a year will pay Pounds 876 in National
Insurance contributions; two people earning Pounds 6,000 each will pay a
combined NI bill of just Pounds 672.
Furthermore, any employee who works fewer than 15 hours a week does not have
to be covered by employers' National Insurance. There is thus a strong cost
incentive for employers to keep working hours below that level.
The impact of replacing full-time workers with part-timers might be even
greater than the above example suggests. Replacing one full-time employee
with two part-time employees working the same hours may reduce the overall
salary bill.
As Mr Steven Webb of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out:
'Part-timers not only work fewer hours, they get lower rates for doing so.'
Over the past decade, there has been a gradual substitution of female for
male, and part-time for full-time, workers.
According to the Department of Employment, in March 1983 there were 9.05m
female employees (excluding the self-employed, the armed forces and those on
government training schemes); in September 1993, there were 10.55m. During
the same period the number of males in employment fell from 11.98m to
10.88m. Meanwhile, between March 1983 and September 1993, the number of
people in part-time employment rose from 3.96m to 5.5m, while those working
full-time fell from 16.57m to 15.39m.
A further development is the growth of self-employment, which has risen from
2.21m to 2.99m between the above dates. Schedule D revenues (which reflect
tax on the self-employed) have gradually been increasing their proportionate
contribution to income tax receipts.
But the self-employed have a more generous National Insurance system and
have more opportunity to offset expenses against their tax bills. They are
likely to pay less taxes than salaried individuals with the same earnings.
Not all the arguments run in the same direction. It may be that
labour-market flexibility and the growth of self-employment will bring more
people into the workforce than would otherwise have been the case. If the
economy is working more efficiently, both output and tax revenues will be
increased by the changes.
Furthermore, the tax philosophy of the Thatcher government, to reduce
headline rates while eliminating allowances, may have increased overall
revenue by bringing more people into the tax net. A good example would be
the taxation of company cars. The switch from direct to indirect taxation
also means that part-time workers are simply paying tax by a different
route.
Nevertheless, the logical implication of the labour market changes is that a
pick-up in growth could generate less additional income tax revenue than in
the past.
If so, those in full-time employment will need to bear the greater burden of
direct taxation, and the government could find that growth does not so
automatically lead to tax cuts, as in the 1980s.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Drop in M0 growth fuels hopes of interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a fall in UK interest rates were fuelled yesterday by news that the
seasonally adjusted annual increase in M0, the narrowest measure of the
money supply, fell to 5.3 per cent in January, from 5.8 per cent in
December.
M0 is one of a number of indicators of inflationary pressure followed by the
government. Traders hoped that signs of a slowdown in M0 growth might
persuade the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of
England to cut rates after their monthly monetary meeting tomorrow.
However the main reason for the drop in M0 growth was a decline in banks'
operational balances at the Bank of England. Growth in notes and coins, the
main component of M0, rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to January, the same
annual increase as in December. The increase between December and January
was a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent. On an annualised basis, notes and
coins in circulation have been growing at 9 per cent over the last three
months.
Even after the January fall, the M0 rate remains above the government's
monitoring range of 0-4 per cent. But the monetary authorities have not been
too concerned about this, arguing that low interest rates, which have
reduced the effective cost of holding cash, are helping to cause high M0
growth.
The Bank of England also released figures yesterday showing that December
growth in M4, the broadest measure of money supply, was slightly lower than
indicated.
Seasonally adjusted M4 rose 0.6 per cent, compared with an earlier estimate
of 0.7 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Gummer rejects shopping schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday demonstrated his
determination to revitalise urban centres by refusing planning permission
for two out-of-town retail developments.
He also signalled a tougher line on town-centre planning by refusing
permission for a shopping development on the site of the former cattle
market in Ludlow, Shropshire, as the design was not sympathetic with its
surroundings in a 'special, historic town'.
Mr Gummer told the 80th anniversary celebrations of the Royal Town Planning
Institute that he would be making a series of announcements in the next few
months as part of an 'urban quality initiative'.
He said: 'At the heart of the sustainable development strategy is the
question of urban quality.
'Improving urban quality means encouraging the re-use of land in our cities.
It means adapting buildings that form part of the familiar townscape for the
uses people expect to find in their towns and cities.'
The out-of-town applications which Mr Gummer rejected were for outline
planning permission for a supermarket and petrol station on the edge of
Ludlow, and for a sub-regional shopping centre at Duxford, near Cambridge.
Plans for a shopping centre beyond Cambridge's green belt were drawn up in
the late 1980s to ease congestion in the city centre.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Public staff face private envy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector workers believe that their counterparts in the public sector
are overpaid and under-worked, unpublished polls by the Trades Union
Congress show.
Private-sector workers think civil servants are 'paper pushers' on an
average salary of Pounds 30,000, compared with the reality of closer to
Pounds 15,000.
The detailed research of attitudes in the private sector, by Opinion Leader
Research, found the greatest hostility reserved for local government
white-collar workers. Few in the private sector could describe what local
government staff do, and average pay for a local authority secretary was put
at Pounds 18,000, 30 per cent more than the true figure.
There was more sympathy for emergency service workers and nurses and
teachers, although the latter are thought to have over-long holidays.
Most of those polled could not describe the government's public-sector pay
policy and did not know of any TUC campaign against the proposed three-year
pay bill freeze.
Quite a large proportion did, however, support the idea of a one-day
public-sector strike against the policy of pay restraint. That is almost
certain to be rejected today at a TUC meeting of public-sector union leaders
to discuss the next stage in the campaign against the pay freeze.
According to polling details which the TUC did release yesterday, two-thirds
of people believe the government's clampdown on public-sector pay will hit
the quality of services. Seven out of 10 believe that the effect will be
reduced living standards for workers in the public sector.
The number employed in the public sector fell by nearly 1.5m over the past
decade, according to official figures published yesterday.
Partly as a result of privatisation the public-sector share of the total
workforce fell from 29 per cent in mid-1983 to less than 22 per cent 10
years later. During the same period the number of people in the private
sector rose from 16.6m to 19.2m. The workforce as a whole grew from 23.6m to
24.9m.
The Central Statistical Office's analysis of public-sector employment shows
that women in the National Health Service and NHS Trusts made up 78 per cent
of the public-sector workforce. Of female public-sector employees, nearly
half worked part-time, compared with 6 per cent of males.

FT  01 FEB 94 / New Glyndebourne Opera House unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Glyndebourne Opera House was unveiled yesterday amid claims that it
is the first professional opera house built in the UK since Glyndebourne
opened 60 years ago. The Pounds 33.5m auditorium, designed by architects
Michael Hopkins &amp; Partners, and constructed in less than 18 months. It
occupies the site of the old theatre in Sussex. The new theatre on four
levels has a total capacity of 1,200, with 370 more seats than the old one.
The money was raised from corporate and private sources.
The 1994 summer festival opens on May 28th with a performance of Mozart's Le
nozze di Figaro. The top seat price has been raised from Pounds 90 to Pounds
100 this season but for the first time there will be seats at Pounds 30 and
Pounds 15, plus the introduction of 42 standing places at Pounds 10 each,
sold on the day of the performance. It is expected that the seats available
to the general public will rise to almost 25 per cent of capacity.

FT  01 FEB 94 / British Gas urged to repay Pounds 4.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Central Manchester Development Corporation is demanding that British Gas
repay with interest Pounds 4.4m in grants paid to help develop a 7.5-acre
site near the city centre.
The corporation alleges that the company submitted 'excessive' estimates for
the redevelopment and the Pounds 12m tender accepted for the work meant that
a grant was never needed.
British Gas would not comment, but the company's land division investment
director Ms Dru Vesty said an internal investigation was under way 'as a
matter of urgency'.
The company's land division was granted the money to help regenerate the
wasteland site, which now contains the new headquarters of the British
Council.
The corporation promised grants of up to Pounds 5.4m, but withheld the last
Pounds 1m when it discovered the true cost of the project was Pounds 5.8m
less than the figure projected by British Gas's land division.
The government-funded corporation said that on one project 'the recipient
was apparently in breach of the conditions of the assistance contained in a
legal agreement and appears as a result to have received an overpayment'.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Commercial radio gains ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial radio continued to take listeners from the BBC in the last
quarter of 1993, according to research jointly funded by the BBC and
commercial radio, published today.
The figures show that commercial radio had 487,000 more listeners a week in
the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, while the BBC's figure
fell by 633,000. For 1993, commercial radio's audience share rose from 37.7
per cent to 42.8 per cent.
Total BBC radio 'reach' - the number of listeners who tune in for at least
five minutes in the course of an average week - stood at the end of 1993 at
30.4m, or 65 per cent of the adult population. The figure for all commercial
stations was 26.5m, or 57 per cent of the population.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Rules tighten on child agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to tighten rules governing the Child Support Agency to
ensure that addresses of separated parents are not disclosed, David Owen
writes.
The announcement by Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, came as the
government told MPs that proposed changes to the way the agency functions
are expected to take effect from next Monday.
The new arrangements - which are due to be debated by parliament this week -
will provide a number of changes, including enabling absent fathers facing
big increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18
months.
They follow a government review of the agency conducted late last year after
widespread anger over the formula used to calculate maintenance.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Travel industry wins tax deferral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imposition of the new tax on aircraft passengers is to be deferred by a
month until November 1 after pressure from the travel ind-ustry.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, told the Commons last night that
summer holiday brochures offering holidays until the end of October had
already been printed - many with no-surcharge guarantees - when Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, announced the new tax in the Budget on November 30.
As MPs began debating the committee stage of the finance bill, which
implements the Budget, Sir John agreed that it was unreasonable to expect
tour operators to take into account 'the theoretical possibility of a new
tax' when offering such brochure guarantees.
The new tax - Pounds 5 for passengers on flights to British and European
Union destinations and Pounds 10 elsewhere - was attacked by Labour and
Liberal Democrat MPs.
The tax was estimated to yield about Pounds 115m in 1994-95 had it been
introduced on October 1. This has been revised to Pounds 90m.
Travel companies welcomed the postponement, though some said that they would
continue to argue for the tax's abolition.
The Association of British Travel Agents said imposing the tax from the
beginning of October could have driven some smaller, specialist tour
operators out of business. Companies would have had to absorb the cost of
the tax themselves. Abta said smaller companies might have found this
ruinous.
The Federation of Tour Operators, whose members account for 90 per cent of
overseas package holidays sold in the UK, welcomed the postponement but
added: 'We remain opposed to the principle of a travel and tourism tax. We
hope that this tax will be short-lived.'
A Labour attempt to delay the tax until a report had been presented to
parliament on its effect on the air transport industry and tourism was
defeated by a government majority of 34 (312-278). Debate on the committee
stage of the bill will be resumed later today.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Government to use parlimentary guillotine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will use the parliamentary guillotine from today to curtail
debate on the remaining stages of the finance bill.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, last night justified this unusual
course on the grounds that it had become clear that Labour leaders intended
to persist with their procedural 'trench warfare' to obstruct the bill,
which implements the Budget.
On the first day of the bill's line-by-line committee stage, Labour MPs
dominated a six-hour debate on a single clause dealing with the new tax on
aircraft passengers.
Mr Newton said it was clear that Labour MPs were intent on obstructing a key
component of the government's legislative programme. The 417-page bill is
the longest taxation measure ever introduced in the Commons.
The timetable motion to be debated later today will require consideration of
the remaining portion of the committee stage scheduled to be dealt with on
the floor of the House to be completed by tonight.
The motion will also set a date for completion of the rest of the
proceedings due to take place in standing committee, and for the third
reading.

FT  01 FEB 94 / No. 10 denies split with Washington over Sinn Fein:
Congressmen say granting Gerry Adams a visa is a 'calculated gamble' for
peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downing Street last night played down suggestions of friction between London
and Washington over the visit of the Sinn Fein leader.
'I don't think Gerry Adams is going to split the US and the UK to put it
mildly,' a spokesman said. But it urged the US government to put pressure on
the Sinn Fein president to use the controversial visit to announce an end to
violence.
In New York Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said it was 'an American
decision entirely'.
Last week London said it hoped a visa would not be given to Mr Adams unless
he made 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence'.
US officials believe Mr Adams's visit could strengthen his position within
the Irish republican movement thereby helping those willing to move towards
peace talks to control the more extreme members of their organisations.
A group of about 40 members of Congress had been pressing President Bill
Clinton to grant Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference in New York today on
the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland, arguing that this could
contribute to the peace process by enhancing his influence over the rank and
file membership of the IRA.
'The visa won't ensure that, but it's a calculated gamble to raise his
prestige against some of his party's extremists,' a congressional official
said.
'What is the worst that can happen? If it doesn't work and they go back to
terrorism he doesn't get in again,' he added.
White House officials said the intention behind the visa authorisation was
to 'reach out to him and his organisation to encourage them to work within
the peace process'.
The House of Representatives' Speaker Thomas Foley, Congress's most
prominent member of Irish extraction, was opposed last week to granting Mr
Adams a visa. However most of the Friends of Ireland, a congressional caucus
whose leaders include Congressman Frank McCloskey of Indiana and Senator
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, have strongly urged Mr Clinton to agree to
Mr Adams's visa request.
In 1992, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state, Mr Clinton
told a gathering of Irish-Americans he thought it would be 'totally harmless
to our national security and would widen the political debate in this
country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams.
Two days later, however, Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament,
offering Mr Clinton an excuse for not fulfilling that promise when Mr Adams
applied for a visa last summer.
While US officials maintain a degree of scepticism about the likelihood of
any imminent breakthrough towards peace in Northern Ireland, they also see
real hope in last month's joint declaration by Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers.
'It is by no means gilded excitement but for the first time in a long time
people aren't just saying 'this is all balderdash',' a US official said.

US visit with peace forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said in New York last night he was
convinced that young republicans now growing up in Ireland would experience
peace. 'We have to produce a demilitarised nation,' he added at Kennedy
airport immediately after arriving from Dublin.
'I want to see an end to all armed conflict in Ireland,' he continued at a
press conference. 'The Irish and British people deserve peace.'
Asked if the IRA supported a ceasefire, Mr Adams said: 'I don't speak for
the IRA; I speak for Sinn Fein.' But he added: 'The largest military
presence in the north of Ireland is the British army, followed by the allies
of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed.' Asked
if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams said that was not
necessary if they became part of the peace process. 'They have to become the
persuaders. Once they become part of the peace process then we will be able
to build a peaceful country.'
Speaking on CNN television last night, Mr Adams reiterated his support for a
peaceful solution to the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: 'I want to
see the gun taken out of Irish politics. The gun was brought into our
affairs by the British. I want to see the IRA disbanded and the British army
disbanded.
'I have had the courage to call on the IRA to take part in a demilitarised
Northern Ireland.'
Mr Adams is in the US for 48 hours for a conference about Northern Ireland
organised by an independent think-tank. His visit was made possible when
President Bill Clinton decided to grant him a visa, lifting a 20-year ban.
The decision to grant the visa was met with outrage by Ulster unionists who
warned that the Sinn Fein leader would exploit the visit for propaganda
purposes.
But it was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the
prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend
today's conference in the US.
Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act
as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Campaign over bids for quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management consultants, merchant banks and service companies were last night
urged by ministers to aid plans for privatising government agencies and
quangos.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, told business executives at
a private seminar organised by the Cabinet Office that the government was
keen to receive bids to buy agencies and quangos, or for running them under
contract.
The seminar was also attended by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury minister.
Mr Waldegrave told the seminar the government would in future invite the
private sector to participate in discussions over the setting up of
agencies. The same would apply to reviews of the 92 agencies, which normally
take place every three years.
In both cases, the government must examine alternatives to agency status.
The alternatives are abolition, privatisation, putting the agency under
private management or contracting-out its work to the private sector.
Similar arrangements will apply to almost 1,400 non-departmental public
bodies, the quangos that deliver services on behalf of government. The
computer operations of Itsa, the Department of Social Security's information
technology agency, are to be offered to the private sector, the government
said yesterday.
Some 2,000 staff, mostly based in the north-west and north-east, will be
affected.
The successful contractor will win business worth some Pounds 100m a year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Banks make cautious moves to try to win more friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers expecting an instant transformation in the behaviour of banks as a
result of the new code of banking practice, to be published next week,
should not hold their breath.
The fact it is called a 'second edition' of the code rather than a new
version shows it is not a fresh start, but a refinement of the original code
published two years ago.
Specific improvements will be made. These include plans for banks to
introduce pre-notification of charges for personal customers, and tighter
rules on how they may obtain the consent of their customers to pass on
account details to other parts of the group.
The governing principles of the code - that banks should be fair and
reasonable in their dealings with customers - are to be incorporated in the
code itself, to promote greater compliance with the spirit as well as the
letter of the guidance. Banks will also do more to ensure that both
customers and staff are aware of the code's provisions.
The changes are the result of a tortuous process. An independent advisory
committee led by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of
England, made recommendations late last year to a working party representing
banks and building societies.
That working party, comprising members from the British Bankers'
Association, the Building Societies Association and the Association of
Payment Clearing Services, came to its own views on the recommendations. The
new code will be published by the three associations, after consultation
with their own members.
Sir George believes that bankers have improved since work on the original
code began in 1990.
'I have been much impressed with the change in attitude of the banks between
four years ago and now, about the importance of a good code in improving
bank-customer relationships,' he says.
Those involved in the discussions say the banks rejected the review
committee's advice in only one minor respect, and in many areas -
pre-notification of charges included - they went beyond the recommendations.
The commercial logic for banks of improving relations with personal
customers - or at least with certain types of customer - has become
increasingly evident. Competition is intensifying for customers who are
confident enough in the service from their bank or society that they look to
those institutions for a range of financial services.
But the code can also conflict with those competitive pressures. The annual
report from Sir George's committee on its enforcement, published last July,
for example criticised Barclays Bank which had been requiring customers
applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans to sign forms consenting to
account information being given to other companies within the Barclays
group.
Barclays has said that it will change its ways, and produce new forms
enabling customers to 'opt in' to agreeing that information about their
account may be distributed, but these are not yet in use.
The conflict is one example of the limitations of the voluntary system,
particularly as it is intended to act as a substitute for statutory
guidelines.
The code resulted from the work of the Jack committee in the late 1980s on
banking law. That recommended a statutory code of practice for banks'
relations with private customers. The government did not want to legislate
on this, and agreed with the associations that instead there should be a
voluntary code based on recommendations from an independent advisory
committee.
The Treasury's continuing ability to legislate has given it influence in the
discussions on revising the code. Its wishes have been heeded sufficiently
for the government to continue to back the current system.
In the absence of a move to legislation, the voluntary arrangement has some
value for customers as the best code they have. For banks and societies it
has a value also in diffusing pressure for a more draconian system.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Adams squares up for US campaign: Unionists outraged at
decision to grant travel visa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL

<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, will today turn his back on the furious
row which has erupted over his visit to the United States and launch a
concerted 48-hour campaign to press home the republican case for a political
settlement in Northern Ireland.
The US decision to grant Mr Adams a visa was met with outrage by unionists
in the province, who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would fully exploit
the visit for propaganda purposes.
Some Ulster politicians now expect Mr Adams to use his visit to hold out the
prospect of a temporary ceasefire by the IRA in order to extract maximum
publicity from his short trip and to cast Sinn Fein as the peacemakers.
British government sources in Northern Ireland, however, made it clear that
any such gesture would be regarded as meaningless and that only a full
renunciation of violence and a permanent ceasefire would help the peace
process move forward.
But the decision was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring
closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic
and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also
expected to attend today's conference called by the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy.
Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act
as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party,
accused the US administration of 'kow-towing' to the Boston Irish lobby. He
will meet Mr Ray Seitz, the US ambassador in London, later this week to
discuss the US decision.
Mr Jim Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, accused the Clinton
administration of 'presidential wobbling'.
But Mr Adams claimed the decision to grant him a visa would advance the
entire peace process in Northern Ireland. Before leaving for New York he
said he thought the US could play an influential role in resolving the
Ulster conflict. 'They can encourage the British without taking sides, and
move the situation on,' he said. Asked whether he now renounced violence -
one of the stipulations originally laid down for a visa - Mr Adams replied:
'My attitude is quite simple and straightforward - I want an end to
violence.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / Ministers urge more bids for agencies and quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management consultants, merchant banks and service companies were last night
urged by ministers to bring forward plans for privatising government
agencies and quangos.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, told business executives at
a private seminar organised by the Cabinet Office that the government was
keen to receive bids to buy agencies and quangos, or for running them under
contract.
The seminar was also attended by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury minister
who has spearheaded a drive to put greater emphasis on privatisation of
public services.
Mr Waldegrave told the seminar the government would in future invite the
private sector to participate in discussions over the setting up of
agencies. The same would apply to reviews of the 92 agencies, which normally
take place every three years.
In both cases, the government must examine alternatives to agency status
under a process known as 'Prior Options'. The alternatives are abolition,
privatisation, putting the agency under private management or
contracting-out its work to the private sector.
Similar arrangements will apply to almost 1,400 non-departmental public
bodies, the quangos that deliver services on behalf of government. Next
year's edition of Public Bodies, the Cabinet Office guide to quangos, will
include details of those due for review.
The seminar was attended by representatives of the Merchant Banks
Association, management consultancies which have advised on market-testing,
the largest information technology contractors and several companies which
specialise in supplying services under contract to central and local
government.
The computer operations of Itsa, the Department of Social Security's
information technology agency, are to be offered to the private sector as
part of a market-testing programme, the government said yesterday.
Some 2,000 staff, mostly based in the north-west and north-east, will be
affected.
Private companies will be invited to bid for the maintenance of Itsa's data
centres, the installation and support of data networks and the production of
benefits payments.
The successful contractor will win business worth some Pounds 100m a year.

FT  01 FEB 94 / CSA address rules to tighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to tighten rules governing the Child Support Agency to
ensure that addresses of separated parents are not disclosed.
The announcement by Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, came as the
government told MPs that proposed changes to the way the agency functions
are expected to take effect from next Monday.
The new arrangements - due to be debated by parliament this week - will
effect a number of changes, including enabling absent fathers facing big
increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18 months.
They follow a government review of the CSA conducted late last year after
widespread anger over the formula used to calculate maintenance.
The government yesterday remained under fire over the agency from all sides
of the House of Commons, including its own back benches.
Mr Burt rebutted a call by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security
secretary, to consider following an Australian precedent by introducing a
system of review officers. The Australian system was 'far more rough and
ready', the minister said.
Mr Burt's pledge on not disclosing addresses followed a warning by Mr Kevin
Hughes, Labour MP for Doncaster North, that the leaking of confidential
information while investigating fathers refusing to pay for their children's
upkeep could lead to violence.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Creditors set for Maxwell group payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Maxwell Communication Corporation are expected to receive a
first payout from the company in March this year, says a report just
circulated by the administrators.
Mr Mark Homan, Mr Colin Bird, Mr Alan Jamieson and Mr Jonathan Phillips, the
joint administrators to MCC from accountants Price Waterhouse, said they
expected a 'substantial' distribution by next month and another during the
second quarter of the year.
They placed the total amount to be distributed as being in the range of 28p
to 43p in the pound, plus up to a further 8p if a series of litigation
claims were successful.
This represents an increase in estimated realisations from the previous
range of 23p to 40p, reflecting greater proceeds from sales of MCC's US
businesses than initially expected.
The figure for realisations from litigation has fallen from 9p in previous
reports. It includes potential legal actions against professional advisers
to MCC and against insurers, and over disputes covering Dollars 137m in
shares in Berlitz, the language school and publishing company, and Dollars
140m paid to five banks in the three months before the company entered
administration.
The report estimates that total assets available for distribution to
unsecured creditors are in the range of Dollars 1.03bn (Pounds 680m) to
Dollars 1.35bn, and the value of unsecured claims is in the range of Dollars
3.17bn to Dollars 3.62bn.
It says legal actions have begun for claims on 14 insurance policies taken
out by MCC through the brokers Willis Corroon, as well as against insurers
who have not paid up on a personal accident policy taken out on the life of
Robert Maxwell.
The creditors' report suggests the administrators are still seriously
considering suing the principal advisers to MCC, 'in particular' Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the auditor. It says the administrators have interviewed audit
staff and examined papers in the UK and US.
The report says a decision will be taken this month on whether to begin
legal action in connection with transactions involving the disposal of
property to companies which transferred the assets to Liechtenstein trusts
or private Maxwell companies.
The administrators are also considering actions in connection with the sale
of a subsidiary of the publisher Macmillan in December 1988, from which
Dollars 119m was transferred to private Maxwell companies.
Total professional fees paid so far are Dollars 65m, which Mr Homan said
should be seen in the context of the total realisations in MCC achieved so
far and likely in the future.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Lamont soon to attack Major again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont has launched a fresh attack on Mr John Major. In an
interview to be broadcast later this week the former chancellor accuses the
prime minister of bowing to a media campaign to oust him from the Treasury
and issues an ominous warning that he is determined to 'fight another day'.
The interview, following Mr Lamont's reported description last week of the
prime minister as 'weak and hopeless', was being seen at Westminster last
night as a further attempt to undermine Mr Major.
Mr Lamont is thought to be seeking a position of influence among Mr Major's
opponents on the back benches which could be traded for a post in government
after any leadership contest.
In an interview on BBC Radio 4's On the Ropes programme to be broadcast on
Thursday, Mr Lamont says that after the 1992 general election Mr Major
offered him unequivocal backing to continue as chancellor. The prime
minister also insisted that he should not resign after sterling's exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism.
But Mr Lamont says that 'a lot of pressure' from the press prompted Mr Major
to change his mind. Revealing his current feelings towards the prime
minister, Mr Lamont adds: 'Tomorrow's friend is yesterday's enemy and vice
versa.' He continues: 'I may have been knocked out, but I live to fight
another day and I'm determined to fight another day.'
'I do want to be in the government again one day and I intend to be,' he
says.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Tesco sheds 800 jobs in drive to cut overheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, is to cut about 800
full-time jobs among head office and distribution staff in the next six
months.
The announcement comes less than two weeks after the company said it was
cutting back its store expansion programme, and provides further evidence of
the growing pressures in the food retailing market. On Friday market leader
J. Sainsbury shocked the City with news that profit margins and underlying
sales had fallen.
Tesco said the job losses followed an internal review of the company's
structure, and were split roughly equally between head office and
distribution functions. They would lead to a reduction of 10 per cent in
affected departments.
The company said it was attempting to achieve as many of the cuts as
possible through early retirement and voluntary redundancy. But some staff
at head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, would face compulsory redundancy.
There would be a three-month consultation period, and Tesco would provide
counselling and make every effort to help employees find new jobs within or
outside the company.
The company employs more than 86,000 people and will create about 5,000 jobs
this year by opening 25 to 30 stores.
The company said it was committed to improving its service to enhance
customer loyalty, and that had to be funded from improved efficiency. 'We
have got to pay for improved service in a very competitive environment. We
have got to cut our overheads.'
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was in consultation with Tesco over
the losses and it was 'well aware of the pressures facing retailers'.
Those pressures include the approaching saturation of the market and the
rapid growth of cut-price retailers such as the UK's Kwik Save and Shoprite,
Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto.
Tesco's job losses may be followed by others in the sector - J. Sainsbury
has confirmed it has hired consultants to review head-office operations and
staff cuts cannot be ruled out.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Lawson backed for top job at OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is backing Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to be
the next secretary-general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
The job of running the 'club' of 24 industrialised nations falls vacant in
September when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the present secretary-general, completes
his second five-year term of office. Mr Paye, a former French diplomat, is
again a candidate for the job, as is Mr Donald Johnston, a Canadian Liberal
politician.
British government officials said yesterday that Lord Lawson was ideally
qualified, pointing out that he was a strong supporter of international
economic co-operation when chancellor.
The OECD secretary-general has a tax-free salary of FFr91,000 a month (about
Pounds 125,000 a year), a flat in the elegant 16th arrondissement of Paris
and a chauffeur-driven car, and can qualify for additional allowances. The
succession will be discussed by OECD ambassadors, aiming at a consensus by
June.
Lord Lawson's candidature is unusual because he has a heavyweight political
background, whereas recent OECD heads have been bureaucrats. However, there
is a growing tendency to put strong political figures into such posts - for
example Mr Peter Sutherland's appointment as director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Paye has earned praise for his stewardship of the OECD, but has adopted a
low profile at a time of dramatic upheaval in the world economy. The OECD,
which serves as a source of advice and a forum for exchanging views among
its members, is also facing change, with Mexico negotiating membership and
South Korea, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia anxious to
join.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Post Office presses for sell-off decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office yesterday urged the government to change its ownership
'without delay' if privatisation is favoured as the best way to give it more
commercial freedom.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, said: 'If privatisation is the means by
which the government decide to give us more freedom, let's have it as soon
as possible. Any further delay would be very damaging.'
His outspoken remarks, which came on the eve of today's inquiry into the
Post Office by the Commons trade and industry committee, are aimed at
injecting a note of urgency into the government's decision-making process.
They also reflect concern that, unless a bill to privatise the corporation
is put forward in the next session of parliament, it is unlikely to take
place before the next general election.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is to appear before the
committee today. He is expected to tell MPs that the government's own review
into the Post Office, which has taken 19 months, is nearly complete.
The Post Office hopes today's committee meeting will put pressure on Mr
Heseltine to bring the DTI review to an immediate conclusion in favour of
privatisation.
Post Office managers have always said the ownership of the corporation is a
matter for the government. However, they are understood to have told
ministers that privatisation is the only option which would enable them to
take on international competitors.
Mr Heseltine is understood to have ruled out privatisation for the
foreseeable future. Mr Cockburn and Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, are
expected to press him to give the corporation more commercial freedom.
Mr Heron said restrictions were giving foreign rivals the opportunity to
poach key customers and forge ahead.
'Government restrictions on the Post Office are giving aggressive foreign
sales teams the opportunity to poach key Royal Mail customers,' he said.
'This could lead to higher prices, lower quality and the threat of job
losses.'
He will today tell MPs that the days when UK companies automatically looked
no further than the Royal Mail for mailing services have gone.
The Mail Users' Association, which represent more than 100 businesses,
described the government's new financial targets for the Royal Mail - equal
to a 2p tax on every letter - and its refusal to give it more commercial
freedom as 'a recipe for disaster'.
The Post Office Users National Council warned that the Post Office faced a
crisis if the government did not change the financial regime under which it
operates.

deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday flew to Tokyo at the
head of a mission whose purpose is to conclude a 'framework' trade agreement
with Japan before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits Washington on
February 10-12.
Talks in Washington last week by senior officials from both countries failed
to produce any breakthrough on US demands that Japan accept sector-by-sector
targets for greater access to Japan by US goods and services. It was agreed,
however, that follow-up talks at ministerial level in Tokyo would be
necessary.
The US continues to insist officially that Japan improve market access and
stimulate its economy. However, the political confusion that has gripped
Japan over Mr Hosokawa's attempts to bring about political reform - resolved
in a compromise bill only last weekend - has hampered US attempts to settle
the framework issue. President Bill Clinton is seen as unwilling to
undermine a prime minister whose reformist policies he has supported.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Low poll on Guatemala reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than one Guatemalan in five voted in a referendum on constitutional
reforms on Sunday, failing to provide President Ramiro de Leon with the vote
of confidence he was seeking to boost his lacklustre presidency.
About four-fifths of those who did vote supported the reforms sponsored by
the president - to bring forward congressional elections, decentralise
government spending and combat corruption - but more than 80 per cent of
voters stayed at home, according to early results.
Even so, Mr de Leon, who negotiated the reforms with congress in November
after he had failed to purge corrupt congress members, is claiming a renewed
mandate.
Congressional elections will now be brought forward to this year, and a new
and expanded supreme court will be chosen. But there is nothing to prevent
corrupt deputies or supreme court judges being re-elected or re-nominated.
Opponents from unions and popular organisations who called for Guatemalans
to abstain, arguing that the reforms were merely cosmetic, said the result
was a political failure for the president.
'The referendum was postponing the necessary restructuring of the state,'
said Mr Byron Morales, a union leader.

<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia and the US have signed an agreement under which the
cash-strapped Saudis will restructure Dollars 9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in arms
payments to five US companies, defence officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington.
The deal, signed on Saturday, could also clear the way for a reported plan
by the Saudis to buy Dollars 6bn in commercial airliners from Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas.
The US defence officials said the restructuring deal was signed by officials
of the two governments and of McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon, General Dynamics,
FMC and General Motors.
The Dollars 9.2bn in payments, previously scheduled over the next two years,
cover part of some Dollars 30bn in US weapons orders by the Saudis.
The defence officials said the plan would allow Saudi Arabia, which has been
hit by declining oil prices, to stretch out payments for jet aircraft,
missiles, tanks, armoured troop carriers and other arms, without cancelling
planned purchases.
The deal chiefly affects a Dollars 9bn deal by the Saudis to buy 72
McDonnell F-15 fighter aircraft. Instead of taking delivery of two of these
jets each month, beginnining sometime next year, the Saudis would buy one
each month, the officials said.

Dresser Industries, the Dallas engineering company, has won a pioneering
agreement to treat wastewater in China, an area with huge market potential.
DI will collaborate with Beijing Wastewater Treatment Engineering
Corporation (BWTE) to build wastewater treatment plants and provide
technical know-how.
'Dresser Industries has played a significant role in China for many years
and is committed to doing business in China,' said Mr Robert Brimberry,
president of Dresser's Trading Division, at a signing ceremony last week.
China produces 100m tons of waste water a day. Only 5m tons, or 2 per cent,
is treated, because of a lack of treatment facilities.
Beijing now treats 20 per cent of the city's daily 2.4m tons of sewage.
Officials plan to raise that figure to 80 per cent by the year 2000.
DI won its first Chinese order in 1974. It now has an office in Beijing and
one in South China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chequered history of the failed US effort to restore stability to
Somalia took another violent turn yesterday when US marines opened fire near
a food distribution centre in Mogadishu, killing and wounding several
Somalis.
A US official said the marines, who were escorting US diplomats to a meeting
with representatives of General Mohammed Farah Aidid, a Somali clan leader,
were first fired on by at least two Somali gunmen. This account was not
corroborated by a nearby detachment of Bangladeshi troops, and was
contradicted by Somali witnesses who said US troops fired directly at the
crowd. At least five Somalis were reported to have died in the incident.
President Bill Clinton has set a March 31 deadline for the withdrawal of US
troops. That withdrawal was ordered in response to criticism in the US
Congress after 18 US soldiers were killed last October during a raid
intended to capture allies of Gen Aidid.
The United Nations has sketched out plans for a reduced international force
of around 15,000 after the US withdrawal, with most of the troops deployed
in the more settled areas outside Mogadishu.
However, UN officers predict the peacekeepers will increasingly come under
attack from gunmen seeking to test the resolve of remaining troops.
US officials have acknowledged they are not hoping for much more than 'a
sort of rough and ready coexistence' between the rival Somali clan leaders
after the US troop withdrawal.
Mr Clinton is expected to ask Congress in next week's budget for another
Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) to wrap up the US involvement in Somalia,
bringing the overall cost since US troops first landed in December 1992 to
more than Dollars 1bn.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Treuhand warns Elf over oil refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency reserves its legal right to impose
penalties for breach of contract if Elf Aquitaine, the oil group and
France's largest industrial company, fails to find a partner for the east
German Leuna refinery complex, Treuhand officials confirmed yesterday.
Elf wants to reduce to 35 per cent its current 65 per cent stake in Leuna, a
refinery being rebuilt in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.
The remaining stake is held by Thyssen Handelsunion. Together, they agreed
with the Treuhand to invest DM4.8bn (Pounds 1.85bn) and secure 1,000 jobs in
the refinery's construction. When completed, Leuna will have an annual
capacity of 10m tonnes.
Elf's decision to reduce its stake in Leuna is a part of the group's
strategy of cutting costs and improving profits, which last year fell from
FFr6.2bn (Pounds 700m) to FFr1.1bn.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman of Elf in August last year,
said last week that discussions were being conducted with potential partners
in the project, but that no agreements had been reached. He also held talks
with Thyssen, in Paris in early January, about the prospects for the
project.
'Mr Jaffre is attaching great importance to a reduction of the investment in
Leuna,' said one oil industry analyst in Paris. 'It is necessary to cut
costs, but also to show he is serious about improved returns during the
process of privatisation.'
Elf has assured the Treuhand it will try to find partners to make up any
shortfall following Elf's decision to reduce its stake, but so far it has
found no candidates. Thyssen Handelsunion is not interested in increasing
its own shareholding.
Elf had originally agreed to rebuild the Leuna refinery as part of an
agreement to acquire the east German Minol state service station network.

<TEXT>
Leading Japanese academics and economists have called for their government
to stand firm against US demands for numerical targets as part of the
countries' bilateral trade talks. The 70 academics, in the Scholars for Free
Trade lobby group, said the government should not compromise even if
threatened by sanctions.
Earlier, ,a senior Washington official said the US might have to resort to
sanctions if the framework negotiations over Japan's trade surplus and
access to the Japanese market failed.
The US is targeting Japanese barriers to sales of vehicles and automotive
parts, insurance, and government procurement of medical and
telecommunications equipment. The negotiations are deadlocked over US
demands for objective criteria to be set against which progress can be
measured.
In an open letter to the US and Japanese governments, the group said that,
in a free market, the consumer should decide market shares. It was more
important to create such a market than distort it by numerical targets.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Scandal mars Costa Rica campaign: Messy court case robs the
presidential favourite of his lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SCANLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of scandals has robbed Costa Rica's leading presidential candidate
of his commanding lead in the opinion polls, as one of the dirtiest election
campaigns in the Central American country's history draws to a close.
Mr Jose Mara Figueres of the opposition National Liberation Party is now
even with or slightly behind his opponent, Mr Miguel Angel Rodrguez of the
ruling Social Christian Unity Party, in the election on Sunday, according to
most polls.
The constitution prohibits President Rafael Angel Calderon from running for
re-election.
Mr Figueres, son of a popular former president, Mr Jose 'Pepe' Figueres, was
in front by at least seven percentage points in the autumn but his fortunes
have tumbled through scandals and accusations, including allegations that he
was involved in the murder of a drug dealer 20 years ago.
Given the popularity of his father, this was to be an election for Mr
Figueres to win easily. But an unpleasant court battle got his campaign off
to a poor start in October.
Mr Figueres sued for libel and slander two authors, the brothers David and
Jose Romero, whose best-selling 1991 book, The Chemise Case, linked him with
the unsolved murder of a suspected drug dealer.
In dramatic testimony, Mr Figueres denied the killing but a Costa Rican
judge, in a ruling on November 30, upheld a previous judgement absolving the
authors.
Mr Figueres, whose father was president at the time of the killing, had
vowed to resign if he lost the case. Now, though, he is pressing on - and
has even claimed victory after one of the Romeros' witnesses was adjudged to
have slandered him during a television interview. 'I'm not going to retire
or take a single step back. This is won and won cleanly,' said Mr Figueres.
Mr Rodrguez has capitalised on the upset and has attacked his rival over
complaints that a leading television journalist was fired after pressure
from the Figueres campaign team. Mr Rodrguez's campaign advertising called
Mr Figueres 'a threat to the freedom of the press'.
The latter was also implicated, last month, in a mining investment scandal
of the early-1980s. The public prosecutor's office ruled last week that Mr
Figueres was involved in the scandal but could not be charged because of the
statute of limitations.
In response, the Figueres team has claimed that Mr Rodrguez had a role in
the shipping of tainted beef to the US in the 1980s, when he ran a beef
export company.
The mud-slinging has done little to indicate where the candidates would take
the country over the next four years. The two leading parties claim to be
radically different, but they tend to contest the middle ground.
Both candidates say they would continue a 10-year programme of reduced
government spending and privatisation, and would continue to integrate the
economy with its Central American neighbours. Five nations of the region
signed a landmark pact this year to create a free-trade bloc, but Costa Rica
reserved the right to collect its own customs duties and to prevent free
movement of labour.
The National Liberation party tends to be more concerned with maintaining
social programmes, while the Social Christian Unity party favours free
market economic reforms.
A simpler view of Costa Rican politics suggests that Mr Figueres will win
because it is his party's turn. The two parties have exchanged power at
every election but one since 1948.
Costa Rica still has the richest and most stable economy in the region and
elections tend to be free of fraud and violence.
Even so, the nation is facing new economic and social tensions. Foreign debt
of more than Dollars 4bn represents 62 per cent of annual gross domestic
product of Dollars 6.5bn.
Recent administrations have reduced the debt through a Brady plan
restructuring, cutting government spending and introducing austerity
measures. But wages have not kept pace with inflation and taxes, even though
annual inflation has been cut to 9 per cent over the past 12 months.
Costa Rica's traditional exports have also suffered: bananas from
uncertainty about exports to the European Union and coffee from falling
world prices which led the country, with other coffee producers, to withhold
20 per cent of output from October 1.
Together with rising imports, this produced a trade deficit of Dollars 833m
last year, nearly three times that of 1989.
Costa Rica has endured international criticism over its labour and human
rights records. In a report in October, the US labour group, the AFL-CIO,
said unions in Costa Rica were not legally protected. Mr Calderon's
government was embarrassed and outraged, but worried by the prospect of US
sanctions. It approved in November labour reforms that appeased the US
group.
This criticism, with a recent report from Amnesty International accusing
Costa Rica of human rights violations, have been embarrassments for Costa
Ricans who consider themselves above such charges.
For all that, Costa Rica has lots to brag about, as the candidates daily
remind voters. A growing tourism industry has offset faltering commodity
sales, making it the main source of revenue.
Some Dollars 505m was earned from 700,000 'ecotourists' this year, twice as
many as in 1989. Growth has remained robust: 6.5 per cent last year,
compared with 7.8 per cent in 1992.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Germany's gas rivals end three-year
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arch-rivals in the German gas industry last night called a temporary truce
after a contract guaranteeing long-term Russian gas deliveries to eastern
Germany was signed in Leipzig.
The contract ends a bitter three-year dispute in which Wintershall, a
subsidiary of BASF, Germany's largest chemical group, attempted to weaken
the east German gas monopoly held by Verbundnetzgas, the regional gas
transmission company.
It is also seen as a victory for Wintershall, which is poised to play a more
important part in the German gas industry, despite strong resistance from
Ruhrgas, which holds 70 per cent of the western German gas market, and other
German gas distributors.
Under the terms of the 20-year contract, VNG will buy gas from Wintershall
Erdgas Handelshaus, or WIEH, Wintershall's trading house. Annual deliveries
will rise from 3.5bn cubic metres to 7bn cubic metres after 1999. In the
process, VNG has secured a supplier and Wintershall has secured a buyer for
its gas.
Until 1990, natural gas accounted for less than 9.5 per cent of eastern
Germany's primary energy consumption. It was delivered through two Russian
gas pipe lines - Yamburg, which delivered 3.1bn cubic metres a year, and
Orenburg, which delivered 2.8bn cubic metres to the region. The contracts
had been made between the former east German and Soviet governments, with
VNG acting only as a distributor.
Everything changed after unification. The Yamburg contract - which is due to
expire in 1998 - and the Orenburg contract were taken over by the German
federal government, which assigned them to VNG. VNG had been privatised by
the Treuhand privatisation agency. But the carve-up of its shares weighted
against Wintershall, British Gas and Elf Aquitaine, which combined hold 25
per cent of VNG, in favour of Ruhrgas and other west German gas distributors
which hold the majority.
However, Gasprom, the former Soviet gas ministry, which was selling on
behalf of the Soviet and later the Russian government, insisted it would no
longer accept old - and lower - prices from VNG for any new gas deliveries
from the Orenburg pipe line. At issue was not only price; it was also a
question of who would control Russian gas supplies to eastern Germany.
After VNG declined to pay more, Gasprom and Wintershall set up a joint
venture - the WIEH trading house, with Gasprom holding a 30 per cent stake.
Gasprom gave WIEH both the right to market Orenburg's gas - if necessary
through Wintershall's new pipe lines - and influence over gas prices.
After endless arguments and short contract deliveries by WIEH to VNG, both
sides last night called a truce. 'It has been a difficult dispute,' a
Wintershall official said. 'But if you want to create competition in this
country, you need a lot of energy in order to fight your way into it.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / Bolivia plans far-reaching privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia yesterday set in motion one of South America's most ingenious
privatisation programmes. The new government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada sent to congress a bill to authorise the transfer of six state
companies to private investors and to Bolivia's 3.2m adults, in a scheme
inspired by eastern Europe's mass privatisations.
Mr Ramiro Ortega, the official overseeing the programme, said it would
'generate an investment shock for Bolivia, generate jobs and double-digit
growth within two years'.
Bolivia is South America's poorest country but has been in the vanguard of
economic reform since it defeated hyperinflation in 1985, when Mr Sanchez de
Lozada, a millionaire businessman, was finance minister.
Mr Ortega said that, under the scheme, long-term investors selected through
an international bidding process would take up to half the equity in each
company without payment. They would, however, have to agree to invest
heavily in them and sign a long-term performance agreement.
Ownership of the remaining shares will be divided among the population free
of charge, but will be held in private pension funds. These funds are meant
to provide a minimum retirement income as well as to galvanise Bolivia's
rudimentary capital markets and improve access by private companies to
long-term finance.
Electricity and telecommunications companies are the first candidates for
the scheme, followed by the state railways, an ironworks, the YPFB oil and
gas corporation, and the international airline LAB.
There will be no restriction on foreign investors.
Companies will be transferred free of debt and environmental and labour
liabilities. They employ about 3,000 people and management could sack staff,
with severance charges paid by the government.
The draft law sent to Congress yesterday will be followed by further
measures to create regulatory frameworks, abolish legal monopolies and
specify each company's privatisation mechanism. The government is confident
its majority in Congress will ensure the bills' rapid passage.
Mr Ortega says the scheme will draw Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) into Bolivia
over three years, an annual capital inflow equivalent to about 20 per cent
of GDP. He forecast this would treble the growth rate to 10-12 per cent a
year and cut unemployment and underemployment by two-thirds, from 30 per
cent now.

FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Move to mend banana split - A revised
European import regime proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is believed to be considering a plan that would end
its row with Latin American countries over access to the Dollars 2.7bn
European banana market which might be put before a committee meeting of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today.
It would not be the first solution proposed to end this arcane dispute which
has cast a shadow over relations between the European Union and Latin
American producers for more than two years.
Tempers in the EU rarely run as high as they do over bananas. The complex
row, founded in the EU's obligation, under the Lome preferential trade
convention, to import bananas from former colonies of Britain and France,
has set commissioners against each other and opened divisions between member
countries. Germany has made its own complaint to the European Court.
Many member countries are critical of the Commission's handling of the
dispute but have been unable to hammer out a policy which has their majority
backing.
At the same time, a rift has developed between the group of Latin American
producers over their response to proposals put by the Commission last year.
At a meeting in Guatemala on Friday, the group of five Latin American
producers along with Ecuador and Mexico failed to reached agreement on
ending the stalemate but will meet again in Panama on Saturday.
Earlier this month the Latin Americans rejected proposals put by the
Commission to allow them a ceiling of 2.1m tonnes of banana imports to the
EU this year, breaking down into individual country quotas. These would also
be subject to tariff payments.
The Commission had put great pressure on the producers to accept its plan -
a ceiling of 2m tonnes was imposed last July. But producers have complained
to Gatt about the EU banana regime and a condition of accepting the improved
ceiling was that they drop that complaint.
One of the ways the Commission brought pressure to bear on producers was to
threaten to withdraw the offer if the Latin Americans had not accepted it by
the time Gatt issued its report on the banana regime. However, the
Commission has since extended its deadline for agreement to February 11
which is when the Gatt report will be circulated to all members.
The Commission is believed to be looking at improving the latest offer by
slightly increasing the overall import ceiling and removing individual
country quotas for those that are unhappy with them. Those countries - in
particular Guatemala, which objected strongly to the previous plan - would
then compete with each other for import access within the overall ceiling.
However, the idea of the ceiling still irks the Latin Americans when, in
fact, there is strong demand for their bananas in Europe. 'It's a
contradiction: they want us to open up to free trade under Gatt on the one
hand, but accept restrictions on certain products like bananas,' said a
central American ambassador.
The African, Caribbean and Pacific countries covered by the Lome convention
claim their economies would be devastated if they had to compete freely for
EU banana business.
Production costs in the ACP countries are much higher than in Latin America
where fruit is also of a uniformly high quality. 'Logic dictates that the
central Americans which grow the best bananas at the cheapest price should
be able to provide the best deal for the EU consumer, but since when has
logic ever dictated EU agriculture policy?' said Mr John Wakeley, food and
drink analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Latin American producers have been supplying up to 2.3m tonnes of the
3.6m-tonne EU banana market in the past couple of years. These so-called
'dollar' bananas can still be sold more cheaply than those from ACP
countries even after payment of tariffs since production costs can be a
third lower on the more highly mechanised plantations in central America.
In a rush to secure market share Latin American producers last year flooded
the EU market with fruit. This led to a slump in prices.
The market has been further confused by Germany's complaint to the European
Court calling for a free market for bananas. The Germans even suggested at a
Gatt meeting last week that the EU's Lome commitments on bananas be
abandoned altogether. In the meantime, observers suggest that German banana
distributors are ignoring the EU rules and continuing to import freely. This
could be happening to a lesser extent in the Netherlands, Denmark and
Belgium.
Banana distributors such as Geest, which has warned it would make a loss for
last year, bemoan the political squabbles which have cast a shadow over the
market. 'I think it's almost unprecedented in any sphere where government
and industry bump against each other,' said Ms Clare Wenner, external
affairs director at Geest. 'It makes it extremely difficult to know how to
plan for the long term.'
The Gatt report on the EU's banana regime has not yet been made public but
is understood to criticise the Lome arrangements as not in keeping with its
free trade rules. This is, however, a moral rather than a practical victory
for Latin American producers as the report will almost certainly not be
adopted by Gatt - any member can block the majority needed to adopt the
report.
The EU could now be forced to apply for an exemption to Gatt rules
specifically for Lome. There is even a narrow chance that problems over
bananas could hold up the signing of the Uruguay Round accord as they
delayed the signing of the Treaty of Rome that created the European
Community in 1957.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Big challenges for new Algerian leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gen Lamine Zeroual, sworn in yesterday as Algeria's sixth head of state,
faces huge challenges on the economic and political fronts during his first
weeks in office.
Gen Zeroual, who retains his defence portfolio, will have to decide whether
to attempt dialogue with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
Secret talks between senior officers and representatives of FIS have come to
nothing, and Mr Ali Benhadj, one of the more fiery FIS leaders, has written
from prison that nothing is possible until 'those who suspended the
elections two years ago and spilt the blood of Moslem children are brought
to trial'.
Some in the military are convinced that a genuine attempt to talk provides
the only hope of separating moderates from the more revolutionary
fundamentalists, such as the Armed Islamic Group who have claimed
responsibility for the killing of foreigners and foreign wives of Algerians.
Some officers fear that without dialogue there could be a risk of widespread
regional and factional violence. Others are wary of dialogue, as they
believe fundamentalist supporters would make them pay a heavy price for the
repression they have suffered for the past two years.
A policy of dialogue is supported by the most respected lay opposition
leader, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, who leads the Front des Forces Socialistes.
He says the army holds 'the keys' to the future but must talk to all
political parties, not only the FIS. He suggests it should share power with
civilian parties, a position the military has not agreed to since
independence 33 years ago.
A further argument in favour of dialogue is that negotiations are well
advanced with the International Monetary Fund on a package of economic
reforms.
So are talks to lighten the burden of foreign debt payments which in 1994
will absorb all Algeria's foreign income.
Mr Redha Malek, who was confirmed as prime minister yesterday, has made
public his wish for agreement with the IMF ever since he took taking office
last August.
Senior European and US observers do not believe it will be possible to sell
further austerity to a population which has suffered five years of declining
living standards and civil strife, if minimum political consensus is not
achieved.
Gen Zeroual's father was an imam (preacher), and Mr Malek's a cadi (Moslem
judge). Their background and credentials may help their efforts towards
building a consensus.
Much of the initial support for the FIS came from young Algerians despairing
at the corruption and inefficiency of a command economy which, for a quarter
of a century was run by one party, the National Liberation Front, with army
backing.
This despair was shared by millions who were opposed to the methods and aims
of the 'Party of God' but who in the past two years have refused to support
the government because of its failure to enact economic reforms.
Some of Algeria's western partners, such as Spain and the US, for two years
now have consistently argued that dialogue, however hard, and economic
reforms provide the only hope of averting civil unrest.
The French government, most notably Mr Charles Pasqua, minister of the
interior, has been blunt in support for the regime. But the comment of Mr
Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, this month, indicating that the status
quo was untenable, suggests France may be shifting its ground.
Those who remain opposed to talking with the FIS argue that a 'moderate'
fundamentalist is a contradiction in words. Yet the more radical Islamic
groups are known to despise the FIS, which when allowed to operate legally
was never monolithic in its views and behaviour.
Even Algerians opposed to the FIS know there must be a difference between
religious fanatics trained in Afghanistan and the average young Algerian
despairing at the prospect of no job and no housing.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Israeli health move deepens coalition rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A special session of Israel's cabinet yesterday approved a controversial
health insurance proposal, deepening rifts in a fragile coalition
government.
Approval of the health insurance compromise will force the resignation of Mr
Haim Ramon, health minister.
By a 9-5 majority, the Labour-led cabinet backed a compromise endorsed by
the Labour convention on Sunday, rather than opting for a bill put forward
by Mr Ramon which would have separated the trade union movement from
health-care contributions.
Mr Ramon's bill also called for all insurance contributions to be collected
by the National Insurance Institute rather than the Kupat Holim Clalit, the
health-care arm of the trade union federation. The Labour convention
compromise, endorsed by the cabinet, maintains the link between the trade
union and the Kupat Holim, leaving the Kupat Holim with 50 per cent of the
insurance dues.
Mr Ramon and the four cabinet ministers from the left-wing Meretz party
opposed the compromise move.
After the vote Mr Ramon, a popular figure among the young reform generation
of the Labour party, said he would resign at next Sunday's cabinet meeting.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is anxious to retain Mr Ramon and is trying to
persuade him to stay, possibly as minister without portfolio.
The health insurance compromise is unpopular in the country and could be
voted down in the Knesset (parliament), threatening the government and its
peace platform. Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud, said
his party would oppose the compromise and vote for Mr Ramon's original bill.
If Mr Ramon leaves the government, it would weaken the coalition, already
enfeebled after the ultra-orthodox Shas party left the coalition last year
after charges of corruption were brought against two Shas ministers.
The internal difficulties came as Mr Yoel Singer, legal adviser to the
Foreign Ministry, was due back in Israel from Switzerland to present a draft
Israeli-PLO agreement to Mr Rabin.
The draft was hammered out in Switzerland between Mr Shimon Peres, foreign
minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman.
Israeli officials said the main obstacles to a final agreement to implement
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho had
been largely agreed in Switzerland but some details remained unresolved.
Mr Rabin has apparently taken a tougher position on control over border
crossings and the size of the Jericho area than his foreign minister.
Mr Said Kamal, the PLO envoy to Egypt, yesterday confirmed the details of
the Peres-Arafat compromise and said: 'Rabin has the final word now and
reaching agreement depends on his approval of the compromise reached between
Peres and Arafat.'
A drafting team from both sides will meet in Cairo this week before Mr Peres
and Mr Arafat meet on Sunday in the Egyptian capital, where they could
initial the agreement.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Oriental's hopes ride on the Eastern Express: An
English-language daily hits Hong Kong's streets today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with the morning's delivery of newspapers and magazines Hong Kong's
band of newspaper hawkers have been receiving an unexpected visit.
Mr Ma Ching Kwan, chairman of the Oriental Press Group, publisher of the
Chinese-language Oriental Daily News - Hong Kong's biggest selling daily
newspaper - and Mr Herman Hui, an executive director, have been rising early
over the past few weeks to meet the people who sell their paper on the
streets.
Both are there to tell the hawkers about Oriental's latest publishing
venture, a daily English-language newspaper called the Eastern Express, and
to ask them to give it prominent display on their stands.
Eastern Express begins publication today after an 11-day delay due to
technical difficulties with its computer system. It is the first
English-language daily to be launched in Hong Kong since 1949, when the
Hongkong Standard was started by the Sing Tao newspaper group.
Mr Ma's early-morning chats are more than just a beguiling example of
oriental politesse. English-language newspaper publishing in Hong Kong can
be extremely profitable if you get it right.
The South China Morning Post, controlled until recently by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation and now by Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok,
has the highest operating margins of any listed newspaper in the world. In
the six months to the end of December 1993, the Post's HKDollars 312m
(Pounds 27m) income before tax was equal to 53 per cent of its turnover; its
after-tax margin was 44 per cent.
It is this margin and the change in the Post's management (Mr Kuok is seen
as a 'pro-Beijing' proprietor who will turn his newspaper into the 'People's
Post') which finally prompted Mr Ma to dust off a two-year-old proposal to
bring out a competitor to the Post. 'I don't think I can smash the Post
overnight,' says Mr Hui. 'But I believe the fittest survive.'
He appears equally confident in the face of questioning about press freedom
after Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997. 'I do not think a free press
should be afraid of the Communist party. A newspaper should not exist
according to the political weather.'
The Oriental group has a mixture of pride and corporate strategy riding on
the Eastern Express. First is the company's unblemished record in Hong Kong
of succeeding in every publishing venture that it has embarked on.
Second is the desire of Mr Ma to spread his wings beyond Hong Kong by
publishing the Eastern Express for predominately Hong Kong Chinese
populations in Australia and on the west coast of the US.
That said, the start-up cost has not been large. According to Mr Hui, the
company has invested some HKDollars 20m in the newspaper, mainly in its
editorial system, and staff. Other costs are limited because the paper is
printed on existing presses.
Distribution costs will also be minimal, although coverage of Hong Kong will
be comprehensive, because the Eastern Express will be distributed along with
the Oriental Daily News. Mr Hui says that with a circulation of 60,000 the
Eastern Express should break even within a year.
The newspaper has been designed by Mr David Hillman, the man responsible for
the controversial redesign of the Guardian in Britain in the late 1980s. He
has crafted a three-section newspaper - news, views and business - which
would sit happily on the newsstands of London.
In its pre-launch phase the Eastern Express has billed itself as 'the paper
you can trust'. Its editor, Mr Stephen Vines, former Hong Kong correspondent
for the Observer and the Guardian, promises an independent newspaper
containing more analysis of daily events than readers have been used to in
Hong Kong.
'The thinking behind this newspaper is that we are entering a period of
intense interest in news, with a demand for an independent source of
information,' Mr Vines says. 'Non-aligned publications will become fewer and
fewer as time goes by.'
This is a dig at the Post, at present the dominant English-language
newspaper in Hong Kong. It sells 110,000 copies a day. This compares with
40,000 for the Standard, a paper whose frequent redesigns and relaunches
have made it seem unsure of itself. Both papers have responded to the coming
competition with changes in layout and the addition of new features sections
and, in the case of the Standard, another redesign.
Mr David Armstrong, the Post's editor, says the Eastern Express is founded
on the false premise that the change in the Post's ownership means a change
in its editorial policy away from Governor Chris Patten towards China.
'Well, the expected change in editorial policy hasn't happened, and it
won't,' says Mr Armstrong. He adds: 'I'm confident that we can deal with
anything they might throw at us. The Post is a well-established newspaper in
Hong Kong with strong reader loyalty.'
If, however, success could be ordained, the Eastern Express would have it
immediately. Hong Kong's advertising industry, bridling at what it sees as
monopolistic pricing behaviour by the Post, seems keen for the Eastern
Express to knock the Post off its perch. According to Mr Garry Brown,
managing director of Leo Burnett in Hong Kong: 'It's not as if there are
that many people who feel they owe the Post any favours.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / End killings of Inkatha, says Mandela
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela yesterday urged his
followers to stop killing members of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party,
as negotiators from the two parties met for further talks aimed at averting
serious ethnic conflict.
After meeting briefly yesterday the right-wing Freedom Alliance and the ANC
said they would today consider their negotiating positions in a final
attempt to amend the 1993 constitution to accommodate right-wing demands for
regional autonomy. Full tripartite talks, including the government, would
resume later in the week.
There is no legal hurdle to further discussions, as under the electoral law,
the last possible moment for agreement is still as much as three weeks away.
The law states that parties must register for elections no more than 10 days
after the planned April 27-29 election is officially promulgated. This has
not yet been done, and promulgation could be as late as February 24.
Inkatha and the white right will determine whether to register for elections
on the basis of whether the constitution is amended to their liking. But
negotiators from all sides said time was running out, with President F W de
Klerk expected to proclaim the election this week to allow complicated
preparations for the first all-race poll to begin.
Right-wing parties also want a solution, knowing that, if they decide to
enter the poll, they will have lost valuable campaign time.
ANC negotiator Mr Joe Slovo said on radio he was pessimistic about a
breakthrough in the three-month stalemate between the government, ANC and
the Freedom Alliance, but 'while there's talk, there's life.'
At the weekend, supporters of both Inkatha and white right Afrikaner
Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) made clear their rejection of the
poll, though neither party has yet made a final decision on participation.
Mr Mandela reacted to weekend news of right-wing opposition by trying to
reassure right-wing Afrikaners they can vote separately for their own
homeland, a key demand from conservative Afrikaners.
He made no such concession to Inkatha, which is demanding strong powers for
regional governments, but called for peace between his supporters and those
of Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
'It is disturbing there are some people who want to kill every Zulu because
they believe every Zulu is Inkatha,' Mr Mandela told a crowd of 10,000 in
Ikageng township outside Potchefstroom, western Transvaal. ANC members
should reason with their opponents, not kill them, he said.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Britain withdraws Kenya forest aid
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Overseas Development Agency has withdrawn a Pounds 12m grant for a
forestry conservation programme in Kenya because of concerns over
unregulated land use in protected forest reserves.
This is the first aid-funded project to be cancelled since the international
donor community restored financial assistance to Kenya last November.
Balance-of-payments aid had been frozen for two years over allegations of
corruption and economic mismanagement, problems which have not been fully
addressed.
The British High Commission yesterday said it had been 'unable to agree on
mutually acceptable conditions for further support for the Kenya Indigenous
Forest Conservation project'.
The ODA is believed to have pressed the Kenyan government to end the illegal
allocation of protected forest areas to members of the ruling Kanu party and
their acolytes. It also demanded an end to unregulated logging concessions,
which are destroying Kenya's tropical hardwood forests.
It is believed the vation project was cancelled when the government failed
to provide these assurances. Government officials were unavailable for
comment.
Land has always been a political issue in Kenya because of the scarcity of
arable land for a rapidly growing population. It is a main cause of ethnic
violence in Kenya.
Dr Richard Leakey's resignation as director of the Kenya Wildlife Service
last month was also triggered by the political hunger for land. He contended
that his refusal to grant mining or commercial concessions within Kenya's
nature reserves provoked a vendetta against him.

FT  01 FEB 94 / ANC tries to heal mines investment confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress is stepping up its efforts to repair damage to
investor confidence in South Africa caused by what it says is
misunderstanding by foreign investors and the mining industry of its draft
mining policy.
While the ANC is determined to see mineral rights fall under state control,
it is increasingly concerned that change takes place after consultation with
the mining houses, trade unions, and foreign mining companies operating in
South Africa.
Despite an acrimonious meeting between the ANC and mining industry
representatives last week, the organisation and the Chamber of Mines are
moving towards a more constructive relationship.
The chamber is preparing an official response to the ANC proposals before a
meeting tomorrow at which the two sides will draw up guidelines and a
timetable for more talks.
Mr Paul Jourdan, the organisation's co-ordinator of mineral and energy
affairs policy, said yesterday the ANC had no plans to set up a state-run
marketing corporation with control over the pricing of South African mining
output, and had no intention of expropriating or nationalising mineral
rights or mining companies.
Clauses in the draft mining policy document referred only to the
establishment of a formal minerals auditor to monitor export pricing, a job
which the South African Reserve Bank was already doing.
Mr Jourdan said research showed that although the mining sector seemed to be
one source of irregular capital flight from South Africa through transfer
pricing, it was small mining companies rather than the mining houses which
were to blame.
Mr Jourdan believed the ANC's plan to return mineral rights to the people
was in line with general sympathy inside the industry that public ownership
was preferable to private.
Given the complexity of mineral rights in South Africa, the transfer to the
state would be slow, perhaps involving the introduction of a tax on mineral
rights with the option of ceding rights to the state in exchange renewable
long-term mining leases.
'Reversion should be achieved without impairing the profitability and
expansion of all mining companies operating in South Africa,' Mr Jourdan
said.

have called for Mr Moland to resign.
They argue that his authority at the Bank of Norway was undermined by
allegations of tax regulation violations in the sale of his share in Airbus
A320, a limited partnership used to finance aircraft purchases, to
Ostlandske Stenexport, a subsidiary of Christiania Bank, where Mr Moland was
a member of the board.

Germany's machine tool industry, one of the key sectors reflecting trends in
the country's economy, is showing some sign of growth, the association for
German machine tool manufacturers, VDMA, said yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey
from Berlin.
Foreign orders in December rose by 19 per cent compared with the same period
the previous year, although there were few signs that orders from European
Union countries and eastern Europe were increasing. The VDMA said that
south-east Asia, the US and Latin America accounted for the bulk of the
orders.
But domestic orders continued to decrease in December, falling by 14 per
cent over the same period last year.

Leaders of the German opposition Social Democrats yesterday appealed for
wage negotiations to resume as thousands of engineering workers across the
country held protest strikes over pay increases.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and rival
candidate to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, called for trade unions and employers
to start negotiations again, saying it was urgent that all the mistrust be
put aside.
But trade union leaders made clear yesterday that the strike was only a
warning in order to bring negotiations back on track. 'We are ready to meet
the employers in whichever town they choose to continue the negotiations as
long as they are willing to present new proposals,' Mr Walter Riester,
deputy chairman of IG Metall, the engineering union, said.
Employers' leaders also said they were ready to try to bridge differences.
'We are ready to hold constructive talks with IG Metall any time,' Mr
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, said on German
television.
Mr Scharping and other SPD leaders issued their warnings as 60,000 workers
in 137 companies downed tools to protest against the refusal by employers to
grant unions' demands for pay increases of between 5.5 per cent and 6 per
cent.
More than 40,000 workers held morning stoppages in Bavaria, where around 80
companies, including carmakers Audi and BMW, were affected, according to
trade unionists. In Baden-Wurttemberg, 9,000 engineering workers stopped
work for up to three hours. Other protests took place in the states of
Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin.
Talks between IG Metall and Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, broke
down last week after a two-week deadline during which employers refused to
discuss the pay increases demanded. Gesamtmetall is instead offering pay
deals which would lower the workers' real purchasing power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's economy, already under pressure following last week's devaluation,
was dealt another setback yesterday with the resignation of the central bank
governor, Mr Bulent Gultekin.
The resignation will further undermine the credibility of the battered
conservative-led coalition, and that of the prime minister and chief
economic policy-maker, Mrs Tansu Ciller, at a critical time as the country
approaches municipal elections in March.
Mr Gultekin is a widely respected economist and a former professor of public
finance at Wharton School in the US. His departure will further fuel the
public impression of deep divisions in the government over economic policy.
The governor was only appointed to the job last August.
The immediate cause was unclear yesterday although Mr Gultekin is understood
to have been particularly angry at Mrs Ciller's reported remarks that it was
the central bank that was to blame for 12 per cent devaluation.
Mr Gultekin warned yesterday of 'political and economic tensions in the
coming days'. He said he had used all the monetary instruments available to
him to see off a crisis, but had been 'left alone'. He urged the government
to adopt a 'reliable and believable' stabilisation programme.
'Instead of a market economy, we have a situation where every sector expects
everything to be provided by the state,' he said.
Like Mrs Ciller's clash with the former central bank chief, Mr Rusdu
Saracoglu, her differences with Mr Gultekin revolve around disagreement
about how to finance the budget.
While tapping international debt markets, the prime minister has relied on
short-term central bank advances, wary of fuelling interest rate raises and
diverting funds from the equity markets by increasing issues of government
debt.
That strategy must now be in doubt after the decision of Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade Turkey's international credit rating, the
event that initially triggered the currency crisis.
Mr Gultekin's departure could cast an immediate shadow as Turkey attempts to
tap international debt markets.

Fears that the war in Bosnia will escalate further were fuelled yesterday
after Bosnian Serb leaders announced a full military mobilisation and Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist Russian leader, encouraged the Serbs
to ignore western threats of air strikes.
The army high command in the Serb-held region of Bosnia declared it was
mobilising all the republic's available resources 'that would lead to a
successful end of the war'.
All able-bodied citizens would be drafted, and the economy placed on a war
footing, the army command said. The call-up orders, which also include a
summons for women to work in factories or do military service, appeared
aimed at compensating for a shortfall in troops caused by desertions and the
refusal of many refugees to report for military service.
Coming amid evidence that the Croat forces in the area have recently been
bolstered by up to 12,000 new troops from Croatia, and signs that the peace
talks are effectively stalled, the declaration has prompted concern that
both the Croats and Serbs are preparing for a final military carve-up of
Bosnia.
Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday warned that the
developments pointed to impending all-out war in Bosnia, and made fresh
appeals for protective Nato air strikes.
Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said in New York last
night that the continued presence of British troops in Bosnia would depend
on how peace talks developed, military operations in general and
humanitarian needs.
He was speaking after two hours of talks with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali the
UN secretary general. Mr Hurd, who was due to meet Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state, in Washington today declined to join France in
criticising US policy.
Debate over Britain's long-term role in the conflict was fuelled on Friday
by the murder of a British aid worker. The UK defence secretary, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, is to fly to Bosnia next weekend to see the 2,300 British troops
there.
In a development that threatened to add a new level of tension into Nato's
recent threat to use air strikes, Mr Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist
Russian leader, warned that Russia would avenge any air strikes carried out
against the Serbs. 'If a single bomb falls on the towns of Bosnia . . . .I
warn (the western governments) that this means declaring war on Russia,' Mr
Zhirinovsky said.
He was speaking to a crowd of 2,000 in the Serb stronghold of Bijeljina, in
the north-eastern corner of Bosnia, which he visited as part of a tour of
Serb areas he regards as natural Slav allies for Russia since they share
close cultural and religious ties.
As if on cue, a Serbian military aircraft, in defiance of the UN no-fly zone
over Bosnia, swooped over the town square and punctuated a string of
speeches filled with vows to resist western pressure.
Nato sources in Brussels yesterday played down Mr Zhirinovsky's melodramatic
comments, pointing out that Serb leaders had been issuing similar threats
during the course of last year.
Although air strikes were unlikely to occur in the coming days - not least
because the UN is first committed to attempting a peaceful reconnaissance
mission to Tuzla - the alliance remained prepared to use defensive air
power, an alliance source said.

On a year-to-year basis, total orders in 1993 were down 8 per cent compared
with 1992, with domestic orders falling by 15 per cent and foreign orders
growing by 1 per cent.
Most of the growth in foreign orders was recorded in the second half of
1993, confirming a pick-up in exports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yuri Meshkov yesterday became Crimea's president-elect, after winning a
landslide victory on a platform of re-integrating his republic into Russia.
In a result that could provoke a direct confrontation between Kiev and the
Black Sea peninsula, Mr Meshkov won 73 per cent of the vote in Sunday's
run-off presidential election.
Mr Meshkov is promising to press ahead with a March referendum on Crimean
independence from Ukraine despite Kiev's threat to 'take decisive action'
and 'use all possible options' against any steps to undermine 'Ukraine's
territorial integrity'.
Russia is maintaining an embarrassed silence on the election results, but
the Russian media have been quick to point out that Crimea could be the next
in a series of bloody civil wars in the CIS republics.
President Boris Yeltsin has just signed a trilateral agreement with the US
guaranteeing Ukraine's current borders, in order to coax its neighbour into
relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. But it will be tough for Russia to deny
assistance to its former province.
Since Crimea's short-lived declaration of independence in May 1992,
Ukrainian leaders have been struggling to keep Crimea content by expanding
the region's sphere of political and economic self-rule. However Crimea, 70
per cent populated by ethnic-Russians and part of Russia proper before 1954,
has become increasingly dissatisfied with the catastrophic Ukrainian
economy, racked by hyperinflation since last summer. Crimeans rejected the
status quo offered by Mr Meshkov's defeated opponent, Mr Nikolai Bagrov, in
favour of uniting with their ethnic kin and historical homeland in hopes of
a brighter economic future.
A western diplomat in Crimea for the elections said: 'It is not that Russia
has won Crimea, but that Ukraine has lost it through economic ineptitude.'
The vote puts the Kiev government in a vulnerable position, frightened that
Crimea's loss will destroy its fragile state. Ukraine's regional divisions
run strong from the more Ukrainian, nationalist west to the Russian-oriented
industrial east.
Ukraine is also wary about losing its stake in the Crimean-based Black Sea
fleet in the dispute between Kiev and Moscow.
While Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to allow the first Crimean
presidential election to proceed, he has also indicated a secessionist
referendum would be unconstitutional.
Mr Meshkov has already toned down his rhetoric of Russian unification in an
effort to avoid hostilities with Kiev. 'No one is talking about separating
from Ukraine,' he said.
He now advocates a step-by-step re-integration, starting with a gradual
re-entry into Russia's rouble zone and establishment of a Crimean central
bank.
He insists his proposed referendum for 'an independent Crimea in union with
other CIS states' is not secessionist. 'This is a problem for Ukraine's
constitutional court. Kiev's executive branch does not have the right to
overrule us.'

FT  01 FEB 94 / France nudged down path to growth: Balladur's cautious but
skilful prod for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy, according to Mr Gerard Longuet, the minister for trade
and industry, is on a razor's edge. 'Now it is necessary to give a small
push to send us on to the side of growth,' he said in a radio interview last
week.
On Sunday Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, announced the push. The
measures he conjured up to revive the struggling economy were numerous and,
in several cases, innovative. Car owners, for example, will be offered
FFr5,000 (Pounds 560) from the government if they trade in vehicles over 10
years old to buy a new one.
The aim of the measures is to encourage French households to save less and
spend more, and to curb an unemployment rate of 12 per cent and rising. But
the prime minister's very resourcefulness demonstrated the dilemma his
government faces in combining these goals with its commitment to
anti-inflationary policies and a target of reducing the budget deficit to
FFr300bn this year.
The limited room for manoeuvre forced the government to choose its targets
carefully. The motor vehicle and property sectors, worst hit by recession
and described by the government as 'motors of the economy', were singled out
for special treatment.
In addition to the FFr5,000 allowance for potential car-buyers, the
government will raise from FFr75,000 to FFr100,000 the annual amount by
which companies can write down the value of their cars. The measures apply
to all makes, but French manufacturers stand to benefit most as, according
to Mr Balladur, three-quarters of company cars are French-made.
In property, the government said it will cut from 6 per cent to 5.25 per
cent the rate on deposits paid into savings schemes designed for house
purchases. The aim is to encourage individuals to spend, rather than save,
such deposits,
FFr5,000 will not buy a new car, and the cut in returns in property deposits
will not spark a run on estate agents. To reinforce the measures, the
government said it would ease rules on employee profit-sharing schemes,
which represent about FFr80bn. Employees will be able to spend their
deposits before the usual five-year limit if they buy cars or spend at least
FFr20,000 on property improvements.
The measures aimed at curbing unemployment were also targeted. Mr Balladur
said he would accelerate rebates of value added tax to companies if they
create jobs or take on more apprentices. The outstanding amount of VAT
rebates is estimated at FFr40bn and companies will receive FFr30,000 for
each job they create in the first half of this year. The government will
also extend from June until the end of the year the availability of state
aid of FFr7,000 for each apprentice taken on.
The various measures will provide help to the sectors concerned. The car
industry, which saw sales in France fall by 18.3 per cent last year to just
1.72m vehicles, welcomed the measures. 'They are strong enough to persuade
those hesitating,' said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault, who
predicted that the effects should show from the beginning of March.
But for the broader economy, the effectiveness of the measures is less
clear. 'Because the measures are targeted they are also limited,' said one
economist in Paris.
'There are still substantial obstacles to a marked and general upturn in
growth,' he said, describing the government's forecast of a 1.4 per cent
rise in gross domestic product as optimistic.
One such obstacle is the continued rise in unemployment. Mr Balladur claimed
progress, pointing out that whereas the number of unemployed rose by 200,000
in the first half of last year, it increased by just 100,000 in the second
six months. Figures published yesterday showed a rise of just 4,300 in
December, which kept the rate of unemployment stable at about 12 per cent.
But the trend is still upwards, and most economists predict several more
months of increasing joblessness until unemployment stabilises. Consumption
will continue to be depressed by the threat of unemployment and by the weak
purchasing power of the 3.29m people out of work.
In addition, many industrialists believe that interest rates, particularly
short-term rates, remain too high. Overnight borrowing costs have been
reduced to about 6.4 per cent, but with annual inflation of just 2.1 per
cent, real interest rates remain relatively high.
'Economic activity has never revived without low short-term interest rates,'
said Mr Ernest-Antoine Selliere, vice-chairman of the Patronat, the French
employers federation. He called for further cuts in borrowing costs to
support the country's fragile recovery.
Monetary policy is now out of the government's hands. But the
newly-independent Bank of France, eager to establish its anti-inflationary
credentials, has shown little inclination to move quickly on lowering
interest rates.
According to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers, the
central bank's emphasis on the stability of the French franc and its
decision to set only a medium-term target for M3 suggests 'a bias towards
monetary tightness both in 1994 and 1995'.
Such a strategy is consistent with Mr Balladur's own belief in the need to
create the conditions for long-term non-inflationary growth. When he reached
into his bag of tricks on Sunday, he knew there would be no magic solution
to France's economic problems.

<TEXT>
Direct foreign investment in Portugal fell by 43 per cent to Es112bn (Pounds
427m) in the first seven months of last year, compared with the same period
the 1992, according to the central bank.
Total foreign investment over the period was Es202bn but disinvestment rose
to Es90bn. The financial and real estate sectors attracted 52 per cent of
the total. Only 24 per cent went into manufacturing.
Portuguese authorities say they do not fear growing competition from eastern
and central Europe for inward investment because Portugal offers the bonus
of European Union membership.
But the figures appear to indicate that some potential industrial investors
are finding eastern Europe's lower wages and closer proximity to large
markets more attractive.
New corporate capital accounted for Es12bn of the total amount invested,
capital increases for Es76bn and investment in securities for Es43bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Milan magistrates yesterday issued arrest warrants for the top management of
Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank and one of the country's leading
financial institutions, on charges of corruption.
The warrants were for Mr Roberto Mazzotta, the chairman, Mr Carlo Polli, the
deputy chairman, and two senior executives, including the head of Cariplo's
pension fund.
This is the biggest single judicial action against the senior management of
a large Italian bank since the corruption scandals first broke two years
ago.
It also underlines the way in which magistrates are beginning to direct
their attention to the activities of financial institutions.
Yesterday's move brings to 13 the number of senior bankers from seven
different banks and savings institutions who are under investigation for
various offences ranging from fraud and corruption to conspiracy to
bankrupt.
The latest charges mainly relate to activities involving the sale and
purchase of property by the Milan-based Cariplo's pension fund during the
period 1985-92. Milan magistrates are reportedly investigating allegations
that up to L1bn (Pounds 39m) had been paid over to the Christian Democrat
and Socialist parties in illicit funds camouflaged by phoney property deals.
Mr Mazzotta, 54, is a former Christian Democrat deputy and one-time minister
of regional affairs. Mr Polli was a Socialist senator in the outgoing
parliament. Both were regarded as political appointees - a reminder that top
management in Italy's publicly-owned financial institutions have long owed
their appointments to the leaders of the governing political parties.
Yesterday Mr Mazzotta was reported in London. Mr Polli, however, was
arrested along with the two other Cariplo executives.
Apart from Cariplo, executives at the following financial institutions are
involved in corruption allegations: San Paolo di Torino; Popolare di Novara;
Banca Commerciale Italiana; Banca di Roma; Cassa di Venezia; and Carimonte
Modena.

Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, finance minister in the last Solidarity-led government,
that the stock market 'bubble' was about to burst.
Shares of the recently privatised Bank Slaski led the declines, falling the
maximum permitted 10 per cent to 6.1m zlotys yesterday. It was first quoted
last week at 6.7m zlotys, 13.5 times more than its public offer price. High
profits for early investors caused the political row which led to the
dismissal of Mr Stefan Kawalec, deputy finance minister, and sparked off a
power struggle between the governing Peasant party (PSL) and Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD) over control of the banking and insurance sectors.
Trading was heavy as most of the other 22 quoted companies also fell by up
to 10 per cent, the daily limit. Turnover reached 4,442bn zlotys (Pounds
136m) with a record 131,784 trading orders received.
Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the PSL prime minister, dismissed Mr Kawalec, against
the wishes of his finance minister, Mr Marek Borowski, who has demanded an
explanation in writing. Mr Borowski, a member of the SLD, the largest party
in the government, said he wanted to see a report from the official audit
and control body before deciding Mr Kawalec's fate.
Mr Osiatynski, of the opposition Democratic Union, claimed at the weekend
that the PSL was merely trying to gain control of the banking sector. 'I
think the prime minister is interested in having a say on the make-up of the
state bank supervisory boards, which is where the jam is,' he added.
Mr Kawalec, a professional economist highly regarded by foreign bankers,
entered the Finance Ministry in 1989 together with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, a
pioneer of Poland's free market reform. He is not a party politician and
opposition parties believe Mr Borowski is not so much interested in saving
Mr Kawalec as in ensuring that the key banking post stays under SLD control.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Major set to resist right wing calls for reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to warn the right wing of the
Tory party to stop undermining his leadership when he meets MPs from the 92
Group today.
The 92 Group deputation, led by Sir George Gardiner, will press for
promotion for up to eight rightwing ministers, half of whom would enter the
cabinet.
But last night the Tory right was backing away from demands for an early
cabinet reshuffle after Mr Major made it clear that he will not be hurried.
The group's main aim is to secure promotion for Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, who is widely regarded as the most plausible
rightwing leadership contender.
Friends of the prime minister said he had agreed to meet the deputation to
show that his door is open to all party sections. But he will tell Sir
George that a reshuffle is 'far from his mind'.
The right believes that such a reshuffle would bring fresh blood into the
party leadership ahead of the local and European elections in May and June.
But support has ebbed since the demand was disclosed at the weekend. Many
Tory MPs said that it had merely reinforced the image of a party in turmoil.
One prominent Eurosceptic said the demand for a reshuffle had distracted
attention from the real divisions in the party over Europe and taxation
policy.
Others said it reflected continuing disillusionment with the prime
minister's leadership and anger over his failure to take a firm grip of the
party.
'The prime minister cannot regain the support of the right unless he rules
out a return to the European Monetary System - ever - and pledges to cut
taxes to the 1992 level before the next election,' said one.
The prime minister appeared to have sustained little damage from a weekend
interview in which Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, was said to have
described Mr Major as 'weak and hopeless'.
Most MPs said the article had damaged Mr Lamont more than the prime minister
and senior Conservatives rallied to give public support, including Mr John
Redwood, the Welsh secretary.
However, the upheaval in the party was underlined by Lord Tebbit, a key
indicator of opinion on the Thatcherite right, who warned MPs not to panic.
Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Tebbit said the economy was likely to
continue growing, but added that 'many Conservative MPs are determined to
panic again, as they did when they overthrew Margaret Thatcher. They would
do well to take a grip on themselves'.

FT  01 FEB 94 / European bourses surge to record closing levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets yesterday swept to record highs after an active
day's trading, writes John Pitt.
Bullish sentiment was helped by a combination of factors: resolution of the
political crisis in Tokyo; good inflation data from the US on Friday; an
agreement restricting world aluminium production; and strength in car stocks
after the BMW-Rover deal.
Records were set in the UK with the FT-SE 100 index of leading companies
rising 1.3 per cent, to finish up 44.4 at 3,491.8; in France, where the
CAC-40 index added 1 per cent; in Switzerland, where the SMI index set its
fifth consecutive high; and in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Stockholm.
Only Germany failed to outstrip its previous best, although the Dax index
gained 2 per cent.
With hopes of a cut in European interest rates this month, further gains are
expected this week.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Government ignored warnings on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government ignored warnings by pensions specialists nearly 10 years ago
about the dangers of allowing personal pensions to be sold by a
self-regulated life insurance industry, it has emerged.
Documents from the National Association of Pension Funds, the occupational
pensions industry group, show that senior figures in the industry told the
government in 1984 and 1985 that strict controls had to be placed on sales
agents to prevent abuse.
Personal pensions legislation was then under consideration by the Department
of Health and Social Security headed by Sir Norman Fowler. Government
incentives to encourage personal pensions took effect in July 1988.
The documents have come to light as the Securities and Investments Board,
the City's chief regulatory watchdog, is preparing an investigation into up
to 500,000 cases of people who were persuaded to transfer out of their
employers' schemes into less attractive personal pensions.
A pilot study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, published at the end of last
year, showed that in 90 per cent of files examined, sales agents collected
too little information to be able properly to advise their clients.
Mr Colin Lever, of consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow who was chairman
of the NAPF in 1984, said the association's warnings were dismissed by some
government officials and by the life insurance industry as 'self interest'.
'Everyone is acting so surprised now. But what we were saying was that
people need protection,' he added.
The association's warnings were given in response to a government green
paper on social security reforms in September 1985. The association wrote:
'Stringent investor protection is essential if the proposals for personal
pensions are to gain any semblance of public acceptability.' It added that
the plans then under way for self regulation in the life insurance industry
were inadequate.
The response echoed warnings issued a year earlier by the association to a
government panel.
Among the specific protections it recommended were several which government
officials now believe are necessary to protect buyers of life insurance and
pensions. These include full disclosure by life insurance companies of fees
and charges - including sales agents' commissions - and disclosure of
penalties for early surrender of policies.
The NAPF feared that employers' schemes would lose younger members to
personal pensions plans and pensions for older workers would become more
expensive for employers.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Rover taken over by BMW in Pounds 800m deal with BAe: Honda
shocked by UK partner's sale; Tory MPs join in criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's last volume carmaker yesterday passed into foreign control when
BMW of Germany seized Rover in an audacious deal, buying the 80 per cent
stake in the UK company held by British Aerospace for Pounds 800m.
The deal, which will create a group producing more than 1m cars a year with
100,000 employees worldwide, took the rest of the world motor industry by
surprise and delivered a humiliating defeat to Honda, Rover's partner for 14
years, which was only told of the takeover talks last Friday.
The acquisition is the latest in a series over the past few years which have
recast the shape of the world motor industry.
Concluded just 10 days after BMW made its formal offer in secret, the deal
was greeted with shock and dismay by Honda, which owns the remaining 20 per
cent of the British group. 'Now our partner has been acquired by a
competitor we must start to reassess our entire operations in Europe,' Honda
said in Tokyo.
The end of British-owned volume car production also provoked a sharp
reaction from British MPs, who claimed it showed that Rover had been sold
too cheaply when privatised six years ago. BAe paid Pounds 150m for the
whole of the group, and has since sold parts of it, including its share of
Daf Trucks.
Conservative backbenchers were among those voicing concern at the sale. Sir
Teddy Taylor (Southend East) regretted it had been carried out without
Honda's consent. But Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the ownership
of Rover was a low priority compared to its profitability.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, trying to calm union unease, said
in London that jobs at Rover would be safeguarded, provided volume went up,
and that some defunct Rover marques might be resurrected.
The City welcomed the deal for the scope it gives BAe to further its
aerospace interests ranging from Airbus airliners to fighter aircraft. Its
shares closed up 55p at 499p. BAe said yesterday it was first approached by
BMW last October. BMW also approached Honda, but there was no response. On
January 19, BMW held an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board - the
first in its history - and agreed an offer to BAe. BMW executives yesterday
said the decision was the most important taken since the company's
formation. The formal offer was delivered last Wednesday.
The BAe board met last Thursday and took less than five hours to accept the
deal, and Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, flew immediately to Tokyo to
inform Honda. On Saturday, Honda responded by offering to raise its stake in
Rover to 47.5 per cent, but was rebuffed. Honda has consistently opposed
taking a majority stake in Rover.
Mr Simpson said yesterday: 'Honda's position has always been that it did not
want to own Rover. BAe wanted to exit, so the position of the two was such
that we had to find another way.'
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'The deal gives us the
opportunity to focus on the strategy the board undertook 2 1/2 years ago, to
focus the business on defence and aerospace.'
He rejected claims that BAe had made a large profit. 'It's totally
unreasonable to draw a direct comparison between the Pounds 150m and the
Pounds 800m,' he said. 'Our total investment is many times Pounds 150m.'
In 1993 Rover made an operating profit of Pounds 56m but a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 4.3bn. Its net assets were Pounds 1.4bn. Its
sale will also relieve BAe of Pounds 200m of net debt and a further Pounds
700m off balance sheet financing. Rover's revival has been based on Honda
technology and working practices. Asked what would happen if Honda pulled
out, Mr Simpson said: 'It depends how fast it happens. It would clearly be
in everybody's interest if it happened in an orderly fashion over the next
four or five years.'
Mr Shojiro Miyake, president of Honda Motor Europe, said it was too early
for Honda to make strategy decisions - 'it has been too big a shock'.
Neither Mr Simpson nor industry analysts expected existing collaborative
projects or component supply arrangements to be dismantled.

FT  01 FEB 94 / Greenspan warns US rates will rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday served notice
that short-term US interest rates will be raised - but he gave no indication
of when the Fed would begin to tighten policy or by how much.
'Short-term rates are currently abnormally low in real terms. At some point,
absent an unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will
need to move them to a more neutral stance,' he told members of the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress.
Mr Greenspan gave some of his most upbeat congressional testimony since
assuming the Fed chairmanship in 1987. He said the economic recovery,
although still uneven, was firmly established. With business investment
rising strongly and inflationary pressures apparently still subdued, the
long-term economic outlook was the best he had seen in two or three decades.
He spoke after the release of figures showing strong gains in personal
income and consumption in December. His remarks boosted Wall Street and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 32.93 at 3,978.36 - a third
consecutive all-time high.
He said Fed governors and regional presidents would this week discuss 'the
appropriate time to move to a somewhat less accommodative level of
short-term interest rates'. The question was 'how long we can continue
monetary accommodation without sowing the seeds of another bout of
inflationary instability, accompanied by steeply rising long-term rates'.
'We don't see any need for rising interest rates,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers,
White House press secretary. Clarifying earlier remarks by President Bill
Clinton, she said the president saw no evidence of rising inflation and so
no reason for higher rates.
The betting among Wall Street economists is that the Fed will raise rates,
now 3 per cent, by  1/4 - 1/2 point in March or April.
Mr Greenspan warned that the Fed would have to move before inflationary
pressures had surfaced. 'By the time inflation pressures are evident, many
imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed, and only harsh
monetary therapy can restore the financial stability necessary to sustain
growth.' But he also said that he saw few signs yet of nascent problems.
Core consumer prices had risen 3.1 per cent between the fourth quarters of
1992 and 1993, the lowest reading since the early 1970s.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Iran must 'curb oil revenue hopes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TEHRAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Iranian parliament yesterday told the government to scale down its hopes
for oil revenue to Dollars 10.15bn in the year starting March 21, Reuter
reports from Tehran.
The figure compares with a government estimate of Dollars 11.84bn next year,
actual oil sales of about Dollars 14bn in the current year and a 1993-94
target of Dollars 17bn.
The government has warned deputies that reducing the estimate may force it
to cut oil industry development.
The deputies' calculation was based on sales 10 per cent below present
levels. Their price estimate was not spelled out but some said in debate
that Dollars 12 a barrel was more likely than the government's hopes for
Dollars 14.
'We set the ceiling of oil revenues at Dollars 10.15bn,' Mr Kazem Mirvalad,
secretary of the joint budget and planning, economy and commerce committees,
said.
'Considering the situation of the world oil market, among various
alternatives we chose the most realistic,' he said.
'We reduced oil exports by 5 per cent of the present level. We allowed
another 5 per cent reduction for the likelihood of resumption of Iraqi
exports.'
Mr Mirvalad was speaking on the second day of a debate on the budget for the
Iranian year beginning March 21.
Deputies have also called for the government's estimate for next year's
total state revenues to be cut to Dollars 17.6bn from Dollars 19.3bn, to
take account of a fall in oil prices.
Mr Masoud Rowghani Zanjani, an adviser to President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, yesterday told parliament that deputies would jeopardise oil
development if they cut projected revenues in the new budget, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
The government had drafted the budget so that 'most of the country's
expenditures could be earned through tax revenues'.
This year, parliament is debating the budget in two stages for the first
time since the 1979 revolution. It will discuss revenues over three days.
Two weeks later it will discuss expenditure.
Iran's Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) production quota
under the current accord which runs until March 31 is 3.6m barrels per day.
Iran earned Dollars 11.4bn from crude oil exports and Dollars 346m from
exports of oil products in the past 10 months, Iranian television reported.
Iran's budget for the year ending March 1994 anticipated oil revenues of
Dollars 17bn. World oil prices have fallen about 30 per cent since the
budget was drawn up.

Other economic news
Monday: The week is dominated by a string of important economic indicators
from the US. But today the focus turns to France where Insee, the
statistical office, releases its business survey and December unemployment
figures. The upward spiral of the jobless total paused in November and
economists expect only a small increase in the rate for December.
Tuesday: Another increase is expected for US construction spending in
December. Economists believe that regardless of what the latest figures
show, the construction industry should perk up in the first quarter when the
rebuilding of Los Angeles begins.
Wednesday: If, as expected, the US leading economic indicators for December
rise, this will be the fifth successive increase in the series.
Thursday: The focus will remain fixed on the US where figures for factory
orders, car and truck sales, plus the weekly jobless and money supply
figures are released.
Friday: Markets will wait for signals from US unemployment data as to how
strong the economy is growing. Minutes from the last FOMC meeting are also
released.

MONDAY 31
Hurd in talks on Bosnia
The fast-fading prospects for a Bosnian peace settlement will be the main
item on the agenda of talks which Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, will have in the US this week. After seeing Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, in New York today, Hurd will meet Warren
Christopher, the US Secretary of State, in Washington on Tuesday. The talks
will focus on the possible withdrawal of UN peace-keeping forces from Bosnia
if no peace settlement is reached by the late spring, and the proposal to
launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs if they refuse to relax their
stranglehold on Sarajevo or prevent the relief of Srebrenica and Tuzla in
Bosnia.
Kohl in Washington
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet President Clinton in Washington,
underlining Germany's growing role as the most important US partner in
Europe. He will also be the first European politician to address the
conference of state governors.
Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, gives his view on the 1994
economic outlook to Congress's joint economic committee at the start of a
week in which several key economic figures will be released.
IG Metall, Germany's biggest union, covering 2.5m engineering and steel
workers, will start industrial action following the breakdown of pay talks.
The union wants up to 6 per cent wage rises, while employers have demanded
pay freezes and benefit cuts.
Poll boycott looms: The Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the white right
Afrikaner People's Front will make a decision on whether to boycott South
Africa's April elections after talks today with the government and the main
opposition party, the ANC.
ILO agenda: Michel Hansenne, director-general of the International Labour
Organisation, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, sets out its
agenda for 'social justice in a global economy' in Geneva. This will be
debated at the ILO's annual conference in June. The organisation, created in
1919 to counter the appeal of the emerging Soviet Union by improving labour
rights, is still struggling for a distinctive and respected voice in the
post Cold War world.
TUESDAY 1
EU airline report
The European Commission unveils its long-awaited report on the future of the
European airline industry. Abel Matutes, Spanish Commissioner for transport,
and Herman De Croo, the Flemish liberal senator who chaired the 'committee
of wise men', will present the report, which is expected to deal with the
prospects for liberalisation and the industry's financial crisis.
Banesto trading resumes: Trading in the troubled banking group resumes on
the Madrid Bolsa five weeks after the Bank of Spain intervened to replace
the management and its shares were suspended. The share price, which stood
at Pta 1,995 when trading was halted on December 28, will be allowed to fall
freely. In the off-the-floor 'grey' market, shares were last week priced at
between Pta 500 and Pta 700.
Schengen deadline passes: Today passport checks at land borders between
member states and on flights within the European Union should have been
abolished. But the operation of the Schengen convention, which ends border
controls in nine of the twelve EU countries, has been postponed yet again.
Britain, Ireland and Denmark are the only EU states to have stayed out of
the convention because of concerns over national security and illegal
immigration.
UN human rights moves: The UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali is due
to announce the appointment of Jose Ayala Lasso, Ecuador's UN ambassador, as
the first UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, for a four-year term.
Yasser Arafat, PLO president, and Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister,
will address the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which began its 50th
session on Monday in Geneva. For the next six weeks the 53-member
commission, which includes such staunch defenders of human rights as China,
Indonesia, Iran, Sudan and Syria, will be plied with evidence of human
injustice around the world.
China talks to Taiwan Representatives of China and Taiwan will resume their
slow-moving talks in an effort to expand areas of agreement on such issues
as fishing, hijackings and commercial links. The talks are scheduled to last
until 5 February.
Post Office inquiry: The all-party trade and industry select committee of
the House of Commons launches its inquiry into the future of the Post
Office. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Mike
Heron and Mr Bill Cockburn, chairman and chief executive respectively of the
Post Office, will give evidence. The Committee members are understood to be
concerned that the corporation's investment plans and profitability are
threatened by uncertainty created by the government's review of the Post
Office.
WEDNESDAY 2
Verdict on Volkswagen
Frankfurt state court is due to decide if Volkswagen poached General Motors
and Adam Opel managers 'unfairly' last March. A ruling in favour of Opel
could mean suspension for a year for seven key VW purchasing and production
personnel. It may also increase pressure for the company to review the
position of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, their leader, and VW's
production director, who remains under criminal investigation in Germany and
the US.
Caldera assumes office
Rafael Caldera is scheduled to begin his five-year term as president of
Venezuela. Caldera, who founded Venezuela's Christian Democrat party but ran
as an independent, won the presidency with 30 per cent of votes in national
elections last December.
Caldera assumes office in the midst of recession and a financial crisis
caused by the failure of Banco Latino, the second largest bank. The
government faces reduced income, a taxpayer revolt and a large fiscal
deficit.
Euro Disney's banks will meet in Paris to assess the conclusions of the
special investigative audit of the troubled leisure group's finances that
they commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
Treasury report: Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England, meet for their monthly monetary talks
today. The quicker availability of statistics has meant that these meetings
have been brought forward in the month.
National Party conference: The ruling South African party will publish its
manifesto and unveil its list of candidates ahead of April's first
democratic elections.
Commonwealth Games: In London the Commonwealth Games Council will receive
submissions from London, Manchester and Sheffield to host the games in 2002,
the year of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.
Maltese prime minister Eddie Fenech-Adami will be in Brussels to have talks
on the possibility of his island joining the EU.
Angola talks: ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Mozambique President Joaquim
Chissano will hold talks with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in
Luanda. They will focus on ways to prevent elections this year in Mozambique
and South Africa degenerating into mass violence or civil war, as Angola's
poll last year has.
THURSDAY 3
Bundesbank council meets
The German central bank will hold a council meeting to review its interest
rates policy. Last week's inflation figures of 3.4 per cent for the month to
mid January compared with 3.7 per cent in December were proclaimed 'good
news' by Bundesbank directors. Bank chiefs expect December's figures will
show a rise in the rate of money supply growth, but January's figures,
published next month, to show a fall.
German privatisations: The long-awaited reform of German post and
telecommunications, paving the way for the privatisation of Deutsche
Telekom, Postbank and postal services, is scheduled to come to the Bundestag
for a first reading. It has taken months of negotiations between the
government and opposition in order to create the two-thirds majority needed
to change the German constitution.
Indian PM's visit: P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, is in
Germany for an official visit which lasts until 5 February, during which he
will meet a range of top-level German industrialists as well as politicians,
and seek to promote more two-way trade and investment.
Meanwhile, in New Delhi from Wednesday to Friday, 15 major developing
countries will reaffirm their commitment to ensuring basic health standards
for all their citizens. The global Task Force for Child Survival and
Development, sponsored by the World Bank, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO and the
Rockefeller Foundation, will discuss how existing health systems can best
confront the range of problems associated with child health, including
family planning and maternal care.
Yeltsin visits Georgia
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit the former Soviet republic of
Georgia for a one-day summit with Eduard Shevardnadze, the embattled
Georgian leader. Although Shevardnadze still harbours suspicions over
Russia's military's role in his republic, he is likely to rely increasingly
on Russian economic and political support to extract his country from the
ravages of its recent internecine conflicts. The two men are expected to
sign a friendship treaty and various economic accords.
The Space Shuttle Discovery is tentatively scheduled for lift-off on an
eight-day mission to conduct experiments in a commercial laboratory anchored
in the craft's cargo bay. The 5 man, 1 woman crew includes a Russian
cosmonaut, Sergei Krilakev, the first Russian ever to be launched in a US
spaceship.
FRIDAY 4
National Front congress
France's extreme-right National Front party will hold its ninth national
congress at Port Marly, outside Paris, until February 6 to choose its top
officials, re-elect its president, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and to decide its
platform for this June's European parliamentary elections.
The advent of a centre-right government has pushed the Front more to the
margin, particularly because the cabinet includes hard-line conservatives
like Charles Pasqua, the interior minister. Its national share of the vote
dropped from 13.9 per cent in the 1992 regional elections to 12.7 per cent
in last March's parliamentary poll.
However, the Euro-elections' proportional representation system favours
minority parties, as the Front found in 1989 when it won 10 seats with 11.9
per cent of the vote.
US employment: The markets will be watching to see whether January
employment data released in the US will signal a modest deceleration in the
pace of economic recovery. Analysts are forecasting a 180,000 rise in
non-farm payrolls, roughly in line with the December increase of 183,000.
WEEKEND 5-6
Finnish run-off
The final round of the Finnish presidential election on Sunday pitches
Elizabeth Rehn, a member of the tiny Swedish-speaking minority, against
Martti Ahtisaari, a former UN diplomat and the firm favourite until Rehn
began a late surge in popularity.
Costa Ricans also go to the polls on Sunday. Opposition National Liberation
Party presidential candidate Jose Maria Figueres is running neck-and-neck
with Miguel Angel Rodriguez of the governing Social Christian Unity Party.
Togo holds its first multi-party parliamentary elections on February 6.
Hopefully it will be cleaner than August's poll which re-elected President
Gnassingbe Eyadema, in power since 1967.
Wehrkunde conference: Concern over the former USSR seems certain to dominate
the exclusive annual event in Munich over the weekend which brings together
leading luminaries of the European and US defence and foreign policy
establishment for a brainstorming on western security.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (3): 'Knowledge gap' is
still widening - Education shows only patchy improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's young people, in the 1990s, live in the shadow of a 'knowledge
gap'.
While it continues to widen, the chances of the young generation in the
developing world being able to help their nations achieve lasting economic
progress remain slight.
The second report on world education, published at the end of last year by
Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation), provides stark evidence of the gulf in educational provision
between richer and poorer nations.
While many nations are now making real progress, goaded by the improvements
made by the Pacific Rim countries on the back of strong national training
systems, other areas - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - are being left
further behind.
The nine most populous developing nations - China, India, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - last December
demonstrated that they thought increased educational provision was the key
to economic progress, and stemming population growth, by pledging to provide
their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest
possible moment'.
Within the poorer nations, research reveals another 'gap'. In the developing
world, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and
receive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not
think it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls'
chances in life.
Unesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect
to stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing
reading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest
problems.
In the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in
school, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only
expect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8
years at school, compared with 4.2 for girls.
In both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent
of primary school children, and the school year is short.
Comparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal
education (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more
than 15 years to formal study in the US.
However, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
For example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years
 -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind
the UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life
expectancy of more than a decade.
Unsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later
life, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still
increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia.
However, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as
better-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach
adulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity -
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of
local languages.
In Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of
four nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna -
in primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic.
The reform should improve the standards of general education, because
children will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be
that overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute.
While problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging
generations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output
which developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education
may in the short term be even more damaging.
Lack of a developed higher education system critically damages
competitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and
research and development communities to keep abreast with developments
elsewhere.
Most Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels
which conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco
reports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a
'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world.
Foreign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students
than they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes
through direct aid from banks and funds. Nearly half of this goes to the
Pacific Rim countries, whose education systems have already been extensively
reformed.
As this aid is in the form of loans which will have to be repaid by the
countries which receive it, and much money has been spent on physical
infrastructure and buildings, which create their own recurrent costs, it
seems, still, that nobody has a clear grasp of how the 'gap' in higher
education can be closed.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: An image of Japanese caution - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask Mr Yoki Satani about Japanese investment attitudes toward emerging
markets and the account executive for the foreign stocks division of Nomura
Securities will lose his native reserve and state pointedly that the general
image among his domestic clients is one of caution.
However, months of compelling statistical data and favourable articles,
pleading and persistence finally persuaded at least one of his Japanese
client's to invest a small percentage of funds into Hong Kong late last
year. This reluctant move ultimately earned the client dividends, and saved
face for Mr Satani.
The descent of Japanese equity prices, now languishing in their fourth year
of weakness, and bad economic conditions, have made domestic investors
extremely cautious about putting money into equities, either at home or
abroad.
Recently, however, some life insurance companies, trust accounts at trust
banks and investment trust management companies have started to look to
south and east Asia for better returns on their investments. Brokers
speculate that this trend will continue, eventually including key markets in
eastern Europe and Latin America. For instance, some domestic investment
trusts have begun to offer funds specialising in stocks from other Pacific
Rim countries to accommodate a slowly growing interest in emerging markets.
One such is Nomura Securities Investment Trust Management, which established
the Asian Open Fund last October, and saw its value double in three months
to Dollars 2bn.
Mr Giles Scott, director of sales at Barings Securities Japan, expects a
further disinvestment of monies into Pacific Rim funds from retail investors
staring in April, the start of the new fiscal year. 'Cash rich people are
looking for other investment opportunities and are finding the rest of Asia
more attractive than Japanese markets,' he says.
Nevertheless, the level of investment remains low - less than 1 per cent of
the funds that Japanese securities houses have available to allocate -
according to the Investment Trust Association. In general, Japanese
investors have been slow to see the potential of other Asian equity markets
and the growth in emerging markets worldwide. This stems partly from
ignorance - most institutions have had limited historical exposure to
overseas equity markets, while traditionally they have looked to western
Europe and the US for fixed income instruments and equity markets with deep
liquidity.
Another reason is a fear of the unknown, preventing them from taking
immediate action, even when the performances of emerging markets has proved
otherwise. But the primary explanation for caution has been the country's
economic doldrums, and the severe equity losses suffered by institutions in
recent years.
Direct overseas investment during fiscal 1992 dropped by 17.9 per cent to
Dollars 34.1bn, representing half the amount invested during fiscal 1989,
the peak year. According to the ministry of finance, in the first half of
fiscal 1993 it declined another 9.6 per cent, compared with a year ago.
Mr Toshihide Sakamoto, a director of the sales division at Salomon Brothers
Asia, believes domestic institutional investors will limit foreign
investment until the Nikkei starts to show significant signs of improvement.
'If you have Y1bn and you are losing Y900m, you cannot take the risk,' (by
investing in overseas markets) he says.
One effect of declining stock prices, together with falling domestic
interest rates, is that institutional investors, pursuing a higher yield,
have sold some of their foreign stock holdings: Dollars 3bn in 1992, the
first net sale in 12 years, compared with a net purchase of Dollars 3.6bn in
1991.
But given the impressive performance of emerging markets in 1993, will
Japanese investors become more active in the future? Assuming the Tokyo
stock market improves, Mr Sakamoto expects investment 'to grow dramatically
over the next three years'.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Keeping an eye on the weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To make an educated guess on the direction of US share prices this week,
investors are advised to check the North American weather forecast.
With a fresh Arctic blast on the horizon, the US economy suddenly seems
vulnerable, at least temporarily, just as the initial readings on its
first-quarter performance are trickling into a snow-bound Wall Street.
Memories of the economy's deep freeze in the first months of last year,
after a buoyant fourth quarter, are lingering. 'Weather, after all, was the
first explanation used to justify last year's early stall,' says Mr Robert
Barbera, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Few analysts expect any more than a brief downturn this year. However, a
weather-induced slowdown could influence the financial markets.
Record-setting cold weather in the east, combined with the devastation of
the California earthquake, has put sales of cars, industrial production and
construction on ice over the past fortnight.
The extent of the damage may begin to surface today with the Chicago
Purchasing Managers index of manufacturing activity. It will offer a preview
of tomorrow's national survey, a closely watched measure of future economic
strength.
However, the direct impact of the weather on economic activity is less
important to the stock markets than its indirect influence over monetary
policy. In view of the recent natural calamities, will the Federal Reserve
decide a shift to tighter money is warranted when its policy-making arm, the
Federal Open Market Committee, meets for the first time this year on
Thursday and Friday?
That question has assumed greater urgency with last week's news of a 5.9 per
cent jump in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, more than a half
point better than the consensus forecast.
'Unfortunately, nature seems determined to deny the Fed the accurate and
timely information required' to make a well-considered decision, say Mr
David Resler and Ms Carol Stone, economists at Nomura Securities
International in New York.
Be that as it may, most Wall Street analysts believe the FOMC will hold its
fire - rain, sleet or shine - especially after reading beyond the headline
GDP figure. The data also included a surprisingly tame 1.3 per cent increase
in the implicit price deflator, a good gauge of inflation.
As a result, stocks resumed their forward march late last week after
consolidating in the first two trading sessions, when unease over technical
conditions began to catch up with the market. On Thursday, the biggest
one-day rise in the rate-sensitive Dow Jones Utility Average, viewed as
market harbinger, put the blue-chip barometer back on track. The Dow
industrials finished at 3,945.43, a second consecutive record.
Is a sanguine mood justified? The market is sure to be listening attentively
to today's Congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
for any hints about the FOMC's thinking. His words could well bring warmth
and reassurance.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: A period of consolidation in prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This morning sees the start of a new two-week trading account on the London
market and if some of the signals being transmitted by the market in recent
days are to be believed, could herald a period of consolidation.
Share prices are viewed by many observers as beginning to show signs of
running out of steam. Turnover levels began to subside last week, compared
with the virtually record levels achieved the previous week. Many old market
hands said they had carried out more customer business during that five-day
period than ever before. The Stock Exchange confirmed that recent activity
approached all-time records.
So a tapering off of turnover levels would seem to indicate that the big UK
and international funds may have, for the time being at least, carried out
much of their new year reshuffling of portfolios.
Another potential indicator that the market may have topped out is the ratio
of call/put activity on the FT-SE Option which, according to Smith New
Court, the securities house, has seen call volumes rise sharply since the
November budget, while put volumes have declined.
Sentiment, says Smith, has swung from extreme pessimism in October/November
to the unusually optimistic; 'This suggests that we should not be expecting
a big move up in stock prices just yet, since everyone is already a bull.'
International influences have also been at work; worries about the German
economy have been translated into a weak Bund market, which translates into
a weak gilts market and in turn into weak UK equities.
While adopting a more cautious view of UK equities, most strategists do not
foresee a great downwards correction in the market, where there remains
substantial underlying support. But the view of the head of trading at one
of the leading UK integrated securities houses is that share prices are in
for a period of consolidation.
February is viewed as a crucial month for the market as the results season
gets fully under way. Any significant disappointments in profits and
dividends will have a substantial impact on sentiment.
The spectre of some large-scale fundraising via rights issues accompanying
the results flow in February, should also be borne in mind. NatWest
Securities has forecast Pounds 8bn-worth of rights issues this year to take
advantage of high ratings and liquidity in the equity market, compared with
the Pounds 11.3bn total for 1993. The broker says this total will be easily
swallowed by the cash-rich institutions and will have little effect on the
overall market.
One area which could provide fresh upside impetus in share prices could be
in the takeover arena, virtually bereft for many months. In recent weeks the
electronics and composite insurance sectors have been alive with talk of
imminent bids.
The two-week trading account brings results from two of the market's top
five stocks, BT and BP. Any disappointments and the market will be
unforgiving.

TOKYO
Parliamentary approval over the weekend of political reform is likely to
encourage investors, already cheered by last Friday's unexpectedly strong
industrial production figures announced after the market closed.
Expectations that the government will announce an economic support package
is also likely to help prices.
FRANKFURT
Speculation about lower interest rates will again be revived ahead of
Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting, although most analysts do not expect
any move until later in February.
MADRID
Spain's Stock Exchange Commission has said that trading will resume tomorrow
in Banesto, the troubled banking group in which the authorities intervened
to impose a new management at the end of last month.
AMSTERDAM
KLM reports third-quarter results on Thursday. Hoare Govett, forecasting a
net loss of Fl 11m after the Fl 438m deficit in the same 1993 period, says
the results are currently being flattered by the pensions holiday announced
last year, although cost savings, still to be implemented, should be more
than sufficient to compensate when pension payments start again.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Risk and Reward: Exploding warrants exploit volatility of
emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the innovative field of emerging markets derivatives, Swiss Bank
Corporation has come up with a new twist, designed to allow investors to
benefit, rather than suffer, from the volatile price swings which typify
emerging markets.
SBC has launched a series of call warrants on a basket of Eastern European
debt with a novel feature: they are exploding warrants. This means that if
the price of the underlying basket rises to a certain level above the strike
price, the warrant is automatically exercised. This structure, developed in
the currency options market, has not been used before on a public emerging
markets transaction.
For the investor, the structure has several distinct advantages - and one
clear disadvantage. The disadvantage is that the potential gain on the
warrant is capped. But this allows the warrants to be priced much more
cheaply.
In fact, the cost may be as much as 60 per cent lower. This is important as
emerging market derivatives are often prohibitively expensive as a result of
of the volatility of the underlying markets.
More importantly, even though they are European-style warrants (that is, can
be exercised only on the day they expire), if the 'exploding' strike price
is reached, cash payment to investors is triggered automatically.
Not only does this remove the onus of tracking prices from the investor, it
also means that investors will not have to watch their warrants rally for
several months and then be caught by a sudden sell-off, which leaves the
warrants to expire worthless.
The basket consists of Eastern European commercial bank debt, which SBC
believes will rally further if debt restructuring agreements are reached.
The basket contains 25 per cent each of Bulgarian syndicated loans and
Poland's trade-related debt, with the remaining 50 per cent made up of loans
for Russia's Vnesheconombank.
SBC has set the strike price at 47.5 per cent of the face value of the debt,
and the explosion strike at 59.5 per cent. It the warrants explode,
investors will have earned a 100 per cent return. The warrants cost Dollars
600, a 6 per cent premium.
SBC will hedge its own exposure by using delta-hedging techniques, which
require it to hold a proportion of the underlying assets.
While the exploding structure is a new one, previous issues of emerging
market warrants have been structured as knock-out options - that is, if the
value of the underlying basket falls below a certain level, the warrants
'disappear'. These are even cheaper than exploding options, and they appeal
to investors with a strong view on the market - in a volatile market they
can be dangerous.
Investors in two recent warrant issues by Societe Generale discovered this
to their cost last week, when two knock-out warrant issues - one on
Vnesheconombank debt and one on a basket of Polish and Vnesheconombank debt
 -disappeared, because the down-limits on the long-dated warrants were hit.
Consequently, Societe Generale decided to issue a further two tranches of
warrants - also totalling Dollars 200m - on Thursday.
The first are European call warrants with a down limit set at 32 7/8 per
cent of face value, 5 1/2 per cent below the strike price of 38 3/8 per cent
(the mid-price of Vnesheconombank debt at pricing).
The second consists of European call warrants with the same strike price but
without a knock-out feature. However, the second tranche is therefore more
expensive, with an 8.4 per cent premium, compared with a 5 per cent premium
for the first tranche.

FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Fund managers gear up for a bear market
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-income fund managers have had a glorious run in the last few years,
riding on the crest of a global bond rally that sent yields tumbling close
to their historical lows.
But while many bond fund managers are still preoccupied with wringing the
last gains out of the ebbing rally, others are gearing up for the phase
expected to begin in the latter half of this year: a period of stable or
slowly rising interest rates, which will make it much harder to prosper
using conventional bond strategies.
'Bond management is a bull-market profession, where fund managers seek to
identify markets where interest rates are falling,' says Mr Paul Abberley,
director and head of fixed income at Lombard Odier Investment Management in
London. 'However, that style will become obsolete in a period of
interest-rate stability or rising interest rates.'
In anticipation of the bear market, Lombard Odier began to reassess its
investment management style 18 months ago.
It is important, says Mr Abberley, to expand one's investment universe to
include countries outside the OECD and focus increasingly on emerging bond
markets. Lombard Odier invests in emerging markets on a minor scale at
present but over the next year these markets are expected to play a more
active role in its portfolio construction.
Investment managers may want also to refine the way they take bets on
interest rates.
Rather than looking for markets where interest rates are falling, causing
bond yields to fall and prices to rise, they need to identify markets where
interest rates are changing, whatever the direction.
'As long as you have interest rate changes, you can structure securities in
such a way as to take advantage of those changes,' says Mr Abberley.
With increased liquidity in the derivative markets, a growing array of
structured products is becoming available. Bond investors who cannot buy
derivative instruments can take the same view by purchasing bonds with
em-bedded options, for example.
This allows them to implement their own views when they are at odds with the
market and means they can make money irrespective of the direction of rates
and yields.
Mr Abberley says an environment of stable or rising interest rates also
requires more active yield curve management (taking long or short positions
in different parts of the yield curve); sector plays (trading the volatility
in spreads between different sectors of a bond market); and volatility
trades (applying sophisticated derivatives strategies).
Different interest rate scenarios can suggest various yield-curve plays. For
example, in an environment of stable interest rates and a positive yield
curve, a yield-curve play could simply involve riding the curve.
Most markets approaching the end of the interest rate cycle have positive
yield curves, where short-term rates are below long-term rates. An investor
who buys and holds a long-dated, higher-yielding bond, will benefit when the
yield declines as it gets closer to maturity, generating capital gains.
In an environment of rising short-term interest rates, it might be more
appropriate to play the yield curve at both ends, since yield curves rarely
move in a parallel fashion.
Rate increases at times of low inflation could be seen by market
participants as an indication of a central bank's commitment to containing
inflation. This may cause yields to fall and prices to rise at the long end
of the yield curve.
At the short end, however, the opposite may happen, with yields rising and
prices falling on such rate increases.
In that context, one useful strategy could be to establish a short position
in short-dated, say two-year, bonds and a long position in long-dated, say
seven to 10-year bonds, if one believes that the fulcrum, or pivot, of the
yield curve lies somewhere between the two.
One prerequisite for applying such strategies is that the portfolio
guidelines allow fund managers to go short of securities, a strategy many
fund management groups are not allowed to implement.
'If you take aggressive views on interest rates, some feel it becomes
speculation. Some institutions have had a close look at whether this is an
acceptable style of managing their assets,' says Mr Abberley.
Another senior bond fund manager warns of the temptation of leveraging a
bond portfolio through complex structured strategies or investment in
lower-rated credits.
'We haven't yet devised a strategy for managing our portfolios in a bear
market, but we won't start getting speculative, or go for negative duration
(run synthetic short positions on bonds),' he says. 'We won't bet the farm.'
Still, more liberal investment guidelines clearly can boost a fund's
performance. Lombard Odier's conventional bond funds last year outperformed
its benchmark indices by roughly 5 - 8 per cent. In contrast, one of its
more liberally structured portfolios was able to outperform its benchmark
index by 13.5 per cent in 1993.

The Bundesbank policy-making council meets on Thursday for the third time
this year and could well seize the opportunity to cut the discount rate for
the first time since October.
One positive factor is that inflation is coming back under control - the 3.4
per cent rise in prices in January reported last week was better than
expected and points to inflation down to below the 3 per cent for 1993 as a
whole.
Another is the Bundesbank's insistence that however dreadful the delayed
money supply figures for December turn out to be, this should be put down to
special factors.
The Bundesbank is encouraging markets to look ahead, saying that in January
M3 growth subsided.
Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets Research in London says the
easing may come via a move to a 28-day variable-rate repo tender on Tuesday.
This would the first move from fixed-rate repos since early November and
could usher in a cut in 'official rates' on Thursday.
She argues that the recent weakness of the D-Mark will not discourage a rate
cut - 'the D-mark is weak precisely because interest rate easing is already
discounted'.
In the bund market further easing is not so well discounted and yields on
10-year bunds are likely to fall from Friday's 5.72 per cent level if the
Bundesbank acts.

The US bond market, having rallied strongly late last week on hopes of
subdued inflation, will have plenty of fresh information to absorb over the
next five days, which will bring significant new data on the strength of the
economy, and perhaps some clues to Federal Reserve thinking.
The benchmark 30-year Government bond ended last week yielding 6.21 per
cent, against 6.28 per cent a week earlier,as fourth-quarter GDP figures
convinced Wall Street inflation was not an immediate problem and the Fed was
unlikely to tighten policy in the near future.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to go before Congress's
joint economic committee today to discuss the economic outlook, and the
market will be scouring his testimony for clues on interest rates.
Fed policy will be set on Thursday and Friday at its Open Market Committee
meeting. It is expected to discuss tightening monetary policy for the first
time in five years, although many analysts think a move may not happen until
the early spring.
The Fed will be able to chew over the first major economic indicator for
January - employment figures due out on Friday morning.
The Treasury will also announce its February refunding plans during the
week, including an auction of 30-year bonds.

The monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on
Wednesday is likely to dominate market attention this week. Although the
meeting has been brought forward by a week, Mr David Walton, UK economist at
Goldman Sachs, is not expecting any immediate action on interest rates.
'Economic activity looks relatively buoyant,' says Mr Walton, pointing to
the recent CBI industrial trends survey. He also thinks today's figures for
M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, will show strong growth. The
consensus forecast is that M0 will have risen 5.8 per cent in the year to
January.
Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg Securities argues that 'the Treasury will
surely want to see January retail sales figures and to gauge the
follow-through from the buoyant CBI survey' and he doubts that a rate cut
will be sanctioned.
The market may spend part of the week digesting last week's disappointing
auction of 2010 stock. Foreign investors normally prefer 10-year stock but
Yamaichi International (Europe) argues that the lack of overseas demand has
set alarm bells ringing as to whether next year there will be as much
take-up of gilts by foreign investors as seen in the current financial year.

FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Dragon breathes new life into Asia -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia's Dragon bond market started life with more of a whimper than a roar.
But two years after its inception, efforts to create an active capital
market serving the Asian region are slowly paying off.
A Dragon bond is similar in structure to a Eurobond, but is listed in Asia
(usually in Hong Kong or Singapore), targeted at investors in the region,
and launched in the Asian time zone.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the first Dragon issue at the end
of 1991. Its aim was to focus attention on the development of a regional
capital market, given that some of the domestic bond markets were either
illiquid or relatively unsophisticated.
In Asia's fast-growing economies savings ratios are high and central banks
are flush with reserves: yet the problem remained how best to mobilise these
funds so that they could be channelled into infrastructure projects in a
rapidly-developing region.
Typically, investors pour money into the region's stock markets: the ADB
thought it might make more sense for these funds to be diverted into bonds
and used to provide long-term, fixed-rate financing for construction and
energy projects.
Alas, it certainly did not work out that way in the first two years for the
actual Dragon issues. A cursory glance at the list of borrowers in the
Dragon bond market shows that the overwhelming majority are non-Asian names,
such as General Electric Capital Corporation, Nordic Investment Bank, and
European Investment Bank.
Most of them wanted to raise their profile among Asian investors (such as
central banks, bond funds and retail investors) by issuing debt in the
region, thereby widening their investor base.
Adding to the non-Asian flavour, investors complain about the poor liquidity
which characterises these relatively small bond issues (most are for Dollars
200 to Dollars 300m), and the fact that the overall yield tends to be low
(only 10 - 30 basis points above the US Treasury bond yield), reflecting the
high credit rating of the borrower and historically low US bond yields.
Hopefully, these grumbles will be resolved. Already, there are signs that
more Asian names are gearing up to tap the market. The People's Republic of
China launched a Dollars 300m, 10-year issue last October and other Asian
names - including The People's Construction Bank of China - are rumoured.
Those with a long-term interest in ensuring the success of the Dragon bond
market claim that it was necessary for the non-Asian supranationals and
triple-A rated names to make an appearance at an early stage. 'The whole
process of establishing a market takes time and you need top-rated names to
pave the way - you simply cannot just start a market with the lesser credits
in the region tapping it first,' says one banker.
As more of the lower credits in the region have the confidence to tap the
market, Asian investors should be able to buy paper with a more generous
yield.
Where the development of the Dragon bond market has proved a success is in
encouraging international banks to expand their operations in the region and
to explore the domestic capital markets.
Ms Ellen Miller, executive director of the bond syndicate at Lehman
Brothers, London, points out that some of the international houses have
become more involved in domestic instruments.
International investors are also showing much more interest in the domestic
debt instruments of countries such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and
Indonesia.
The more cynical bond specialists dismiss the Dragon bond as a mere
marketing gimmick, but even they are prepared to admit that it has helped to
focus attention on the development of debt markets in the region and should
encourage Asian borrowers to eventually launch more large, global issues.

The last-minute passage of the coalition government's political reform bill
over the weekend may further dampen sentiment on the Japanese government
bond market.
Bond traders fear an economic stimulus package, likely to be announced this
week, will mean extra supply and a formal announcement may prompt
profit-taking.
The bond market has already been hit by fears of oversupply, triggered by a
recent government announcement that it will auction bonds outright rather
than with repurchase agreements.
Also, while the government has indicated that an income tax cut to boost the
slumping economy will ultimately be funded by an increase in consumption
taxes, an immediate rise is impossible. Last Saturday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
prime minister, said he was not considering a sales tax hike at the moment,
and Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, on Sunday said the
income tax cut will be funded by government bonds.
An income tax cut larger than Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn is likely to discourage
investors and profit-taking by institutional investors ahead of the March
book closing may also weigh on the bond market.
A recovery in the stock market is also negative for bonds, as hopes of a cut
in the official discount rate cut fade with a rally in share prices.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Japan yen remains market's focus -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a big week for monetary policy watchers the Japanese yen is likely to
remain the centre of attention for foreign exchange traders.
The aftermath of the Saturday deadline for political reform and the
continuing uncertainty surrounding economic and trading relations between
Japan and the US will determine the movements of the yen.
Although the dollar weakened by over three yen last week, many analysts
argued that this was a short-term move dictated by the confused political
situation in Tokyo and that the dollar should be a strong currency over the
medium term.
Late on Friday hopes were growing that conditions might be in place for a
new fiscal package to boost the economy, possibly presaging a new shift in
sentiment.
Monetary authorities in the UK, Germany and the US will review official
interest rates this week.
A change in UK rates seems unlikely when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, meet on Wednesday. But
the outcome of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting and the US Federal Open
Market committee meeting on that day and Friday is less clear.
Last Friday's news of subdued US inflationary pressures in the fourth
quarter has dampened expectations of an early Fed tightening.
It also gave a boost to the D-Mark, triggering hopes in Germany that the
Bundesbank would no longer be deterred from cutting its official interest
rate by weakness of the currency.
However, the possibility of labour unrest, signalled by threatened stoppages
from the IG Metall trade union in support of a 6 per cent pay claim, may
persuade the Bundesbank to remain cautious. IG Bau, the construction union,
is also demanding 6 per cent while banking sector unions hold wage talks in
two weeks time.
With regards to the dollar the markets are looking ahead beyond the last
quarter's robust growth to the future.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, argued that: 'The
Fed will act cautiously on interest rates. I don't think they will act
aggressively at all.'
He reasoned that although the economic data has been bullish, tax rises in
the current quarter will weigh on economic growth.
Some commentators said hesitation by the Fed would have a positive impact on
Europe.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO bank, said that the
prospect of European rate cuts had become more likely because the likelihood
of a tightening of policy by the Fed had receded.

Investors in the Istanbul stock exchange are waiting to see if the dust
settles this week after recent convulsions in Turkish money markets forced
the government to devalue the lira, writes John Murray Brown.
The equity market closed on Friday down 4.9 per cent, but off a mid-session
fall of more than 7 per cent, as investors were encouraged by reports that
the government was to provide new incentives for companies going public.
With the lira devalued by 12 per cent late on Wednesday, the index has lost
38 per cent in dollar terms since January 21.
Mr Stuart Harley, of Schroders, says that the worst is probably now over,
although concern remains over prospects for higher inflation.
The authorities face another test of nerve this week with the redemption of
some TL7,000bn worth of government paper on Wednesday and Thursday. This
could create renewed pressure on exchange rates - the continued volatility
in money markets was underlined again on Friday when overnight rates briefly
touched a heady 450 per cent.
By announcing a new range of incentives Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime
minister, hopes to avoid any repeat of last week's market pandemonium.
Following moves to tighten monetary policy, the additional demand for
treasury paper is expected to hold back equity prices. Nonetheless, Istanbul
brokers say that in spite of the dramatic collapse of dollar share values,
there has been little move by foreign investors to liquidate holdings.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strategy
Morgan Stanley's Barton Biggs notes in his latest comment on trends in
emerging markets that he considers 1994 should see a significant shift in
investor attitude. 'I think getting the country decision right will be much
more important . . . in 1993 if you caught the re-rating of one region,
Asia, you didn't have to worry much about countries, groups or stocks. I
think it's going to be much more challenging in 1994'.
The Emerging Markets Traders Association has elected Mr Alexis Rodzianko,
managing director at Chemical Bank, as chairman for 1994.
Latin America
With worries that a severe correction is imminent among Asia's equity
markets, Kleinwort Benson's Latin American team, headed by Roger Palmer, is
claiming that the region is less exposed 'to any bursting of the liquidity
bubble'.
This view is based on the fact that the Asian markets have been driven ever
higher by a wash of foreign, notably US, money, while the same funds'
exposure to Latin America has been small.
Therefore, when US interest rates finally rise, the argument goes, Latin
America should be immune to the fall-out.
Poland
Argument and counter-argument continue to swirl around the equity market
after last week's listing of Bank Slaski.
On the first day of trading the shares rocketed 1,250 per cent from the
offer price of 500,000 zlotys (Dollars 23).
Now many are saying that the price was too low, while the securities
commission is investigating the delay in processing applications, which has
left some unable to trade shares on the exchange.
On Friday the government minister responsible for privatising the country's
banking sector was sacked.
Indonesia
The government is considering privatising some state-owned companies on
foreign stock exchanges, although this is unlikely to include Garuda
Indonesia, the state airline, for the time being.
Fund growth
Emerging market funds could double in 1994, following rapid growth in the
last few years, Peter Jeffreys of Fund Research told a conference in London
last week.
The number of funds has risen from 65 in 1990 to 525 in 1994, he said, with
467 being equity funds with the remaining debt funds.
Some Dollars 120bn has been invested over the last decade, with more than 50
per cent of that total coming in 1993, he added.
Brazil
Smith Barney Shearson is understood to have raised its weighting of
Brazilian equities in its model Latin American portfolio from 10 per cent to
15 per cent.
'The economic and political outlook for Brazil shows signs of improving more
rapidly than we had originally anticipated,' the broker said.
It recommended buying on the market's recent weakness, which it said was due
to profit-taking after a strong recent rally.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The Markets: Financing the upgrade to a high-wage-growth
economy - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is not known for
its publicity-seeking ways. Strong titles, racy language, bold conclusions -
none of these are house-style at the industrialised countries' Paris-based
think tank.
Yet, despite the usual diplomatic language and veiled prescriptions, a clear
message shines through the OECD's draft report on employment and
unemployment. The study, currently circulating among member governments,
criticises continental European governments for their poor records of job
creation and high long-term unemployment. But the OECD does not believe that
the deregulated Anglo-American labour markets are the answer.
Far from it. The collapse in the demand for unskilled workers in developed
economies, the draft report says, is a serious problem 'regardless of the
form it takes - low paid, low quality jobs or overt unemployment'. Less
regulation may mean more low-wage, low-productivity employment. But the
side-effects of America's hire-and-fire labour markets - rising wage
inequality and in-work poverty as well as male inactivity - are as
economically and socially dangerous as the long-term unemployment they are
supposed to avoid. The only sustainable, and affordable, solution is to
reverse the dwindling ability of most developed economies - with the
exception of Japan and perhaps western Germany - to create high-wage,
high-skill jobs and equip poorly educated workers to compete for them.
What the OECD is not willing to do, however, is to ask whether the free
market policies pursued by the UK government or deeply embedded in the
structure of the American economy also explain why they have comparatively
low levels of investment in physical and human capital. Last year's OECD
Employment Outlook, for example, published research which finds a strong
link between security of employment tenure and the willingness of both
workers and managers to invest in training. But, while the draft report
makes many suggestions for increasing the quality of education and removing
obstacles to job creation, it does not tackle the question of whether
flexible hiring and firing necessarily undermines long-term relationships
and thus investment in skills.
Again, with a clear nod in an Anglo-American direction, the report suggests
that 'investment levels are too low in many OECD countries to provide the
capital stock necessary to generate sufficient numbers of high-productivity
jobs.' But perhaps the low levels of investment in the UK and US are linked
to the structure of Anglo-American financial systems, and the fluid
relationships between managers, shareholders, banks and other stakeholders
that they encourage. The OECD's desire to duck these issues is
understandable - international comparisons of financial systems are fraught
with difficulties. Identifying differences in corporate governance across
country is comparatively easy: US and UK companies have few intercorporate
or bank equity holdings, while the takeover threat means incumbent managers
must focus on short-term results; German and Japanese companies are less
vulnerable to takeovers because of cross-shareholdings while management
decisions are supervised by committees on which banks play a leading role.
Yet the standard complaint from UK companies - that they do not have the
same level of access to long-term bank finance as their German or Japanese
competitors - is not borne out by the evidence. Oxford University economists
Jenny Corbett and Tim Jenkinson have identified the net sources of funds
available for physical investment over the period 1970-1989 after adjusting
for bank deposits and purchases of bonds and equities.
Contrary to the conventional wisdom, their research finds that internally
generated profits are by far the main source of funds for investment in all
four countries, as the charts show. US and UK companies actually depend more
on bank finance than German companies. But market capital - bonds and
equities - provides a small and dwindling net source of finance. For British
companies, the development of the takeover market means that equity finance
has increasingly become a net drain on resources.
Yet financial systems clearly make a difference to the time horizons over
which managers and workers can plan. The pattern of UK investment is much
less stable than in Germany, in part because of Britain's recent
macroeconomic turbulent history, as the charts show. But the share of bank
finance in UK investment also fluctuates markedly, rising when investment
increases but then falling sharply in recessions as the profitability of
lending falls and banks call in their loans. In Germany, by contrast, the
banks' role as actual and proxy shareholders in the companies they lend to
seems to deliver much more dependable bank finance. The ability of German
and Japanese stakeholders - workers, managers and shareholders - to take a
longer term view and forgo earnings to invest for the future must also be
part of the reason why profits and thus investment are consistently higher
than in the US or UK. Who can blame British managers or workers for trying
to extract as much as possible as fast as they can from the companies in
which they work when the threat of takeover, recession or bankruptcy remains
so immediate?
The OECD is right of course, to counsel against easy solutions to
unemployment. The long-term challenge of tackling unemployment, and creating
more high-wage jobs, is not easily understood, let alone solved. But finding
corporate structures which encourage managers, workers and bankers to take a
longer-term view must be part of that solution. The OECD's decision not to
explore how differences in corporate governance affect wages, profits and
investment leaves a gap which needs to be filled.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The Markets: The last picture show, perhaps - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A grim-faced, bearded soothsayer tramps through the streets of New York
holding aloft a placard declaring that 'the end of the sale of Paramount is
near.'
The cartoon, published in New Yorker magazine, sums up both Wall Street's
weariness with the five-month-old battle for entertainment group Paramount
Communications, and the gloomy expectation that whichever bidder wins the
contest will turn out to be the loser - at least in the short run.
Over the past few months the market has hammered the shares of each of the
two bidders - Viacom and QVC Network - when they appeared to be the likely
victor, and analysts expect this movement to be accentuated when the contest
is finally settled.
That could be as early as this week. The Paramount board has set tomorrow as
the deadline for best and final offers, and it issued a stern warning last
week that bids beyond February 1 would violate the ground rules it has laid
down for the contest. Shareholders will have until the middle of the month
to make their choice.
However, since the board has a duty to get the best value for stockholders -
and may face investor suits if it does not - it could find it hard to ignore
a higher offer made after the auction gavel has supposedly dropped for the
third time.
The winner's shares are expected to drop in part because much of Paramount's
stock is now in the hands of Wall Street arbitrageurs, rather than long-term
investors, and they will be keen to liquidate quickly the holdings in the
victor's stock which they receive in part-payment for their Paramount
shares.
At the same time, whichever company wins Paramount will be leveraging itself
up with debt in order to pay a very high price - more than 17.5 times
operating cash flow in the year to April and a price/earnings multiple of
over 40 - for a business with a lacklustre profits record, forecast to
produce flat earnings this year.
Viacom says Wall Street is 'grossly underestimating' the growth potential of
its merger with Paramount, and the simultaneous takeover it is planning of
video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment.
The company certainly has an impressive record in the creation of branded
television programming. But Paramount's core business is its film studio,
and the track record of QVC's Barry Diller, one of the most creative
Hollywood figures of the past two decades, suggests he is more likely to
make this asset hum - eventually.
Disney
Whatever the outcome, the Paramount bidders are gambling that entertainment
software assets - film and television shows - will have a high scarcity
value in the brave new world of inter-active, multi-media communications,
which promises to bring a host of new television-based services into the
home, ranging from shopping to video telephony.
No one really knows how much of this consumers will be willing to pay for,
or when, and fortunes are going to be won and lost finding out.
But it is a fair bet that movies and TV shows which can be summoned on
demand, by the flick of a remote control button, will be among the most
popular offerings.
With Paramount about to lose its independence, the only remaining large,
quoted and fairly 'pure' film business is Walt Disney, which last week
produced a remarkably strong set of first quarter figures, with net income
rising 34 per cent to Dollars 368.6m.
Disney shares have been held back by the crisis at its 49 per cent-owned
associate, Euro Disney, which is crippled with debt and is about to start
negotiations with its banks over an emergency refinancing.
Last week's figures excluded Euro Disney losses because Walt Disney has
written its investment down to zero. But the Euro Disney crisis will
eventually pass, be it through a debt restructuring or closure, and the
recent emergence of a secondary market in Euro Disney debt is one positive
straw in the wind.
Euro Disney aside, the basic business fundamentals at Walt Disney look
strong, a fact which may have escaped European investors, perhaps enjoying a
touch of schadenfreude at America's most powerful purveyor of popular
culture fouling up in the old world. Walt Disney's American theme park
business may be growing only modestly, but its film division produced a 45
per cent surge in first quarter operating profits to Dollars 340m, thanks
largely to two animated films: Aladdin, which was released in video form in
the US market and in cinemas internationally; and the Jungle Book, an older
Disney title which was released internationally in video.
There is plenty more in the cartoon pipeline, with the release in the US
next summer of Lion King, an African wildlife tale with music by Elton John,
followed next Christmas by Pocahontas, an American Indian saga.
Jessica Reif, of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, who has been one of the most bullish Wall
Street analysts on Disney and thinks the stock could rise 30 per cent over
the next 12 months, says the success of the Jungle Book underlines a unique
feature about the company.
Disney can 're-release each animated film every seven to ten years and do as
well or better than the original release.' That is not true for live action
films, and makes its library the most valuable in Hollywood on a per-title
basis.
The Fed's dilemma
The US Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet on
Thursday and Friday of this week to address the question uppermost in the
mind of the global financial community: when will the Fed tighten monetary
policy, implementing the first US interest rate increase in five years?
Most Wall Street analysts expect the central bank to nudge rates higher  -
possibly taking the Fed funds rate from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent - over
the next few months, to nip incipient inflation in the bud and reassure the
bond market as the US economy's growth accelerates .
Yet at the moment inflation does not seem a problem. Last Friday's figures
for fourth quarter GDP - showing the economy growing at an annual rate of
5.9 per cent - also contained good inflation news. The implicit GDP
deflator, a broad measure of price changes and shifts in buying patterns,
rose just 1.3 per cent in the quarter, compared to the 3 per cent forecast
by some analysts.
The fourth quarter growth rate was boosted by special factors and Wall
Street is expecting a sharp drop in the first three months of this year,
particularly in view of severe winter storms in the East and the earthquake
in Los Angeles (though some economists argue that the quake could be a net
plus for growth, given the construction spending it will trigger).
The Wall Street concensus for 1994 as a whole is growth of a little over 3
per cent. The FOMC, in this week's first meeting of the year, will form its
own view on the outlook for 1994, as well as setting monetary growth
targets.
As it considers tightening it will have one more piece of statistical
evidence to weigh - January's employment report, due out on Friday morning,
which is expected to show a gradually expanding labour market, though the
picture may be distorted by seasonal factors and changes in reporting
methodology.
The committee faces a dilemma. It needs to firm before inflation becomes an
evident problem, because by then a price spiral will be embedded in the
system and the harsh medicine necessary to stop it would severely unsettle
the markets.
On the other hand, last week's bond market rally indicates that Wall Street
remains relaxed about inflation, while an early rise in rates would be
politically unpopular (particularly against a background of natural
disasters) at a time when Congress is threatening to curb the Fed's freedom.
In a week when the US is basking in the best of all possible Panglossian
worlds - solid growth and low inflation - the Fed would be brave indeed to
break the spell.

FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Downturn at Sanyo Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant sales of batteries and semiconductors were not enough to support
better results at Sanyo Electric, which reported a 44 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits for the year to November 1993.
Pre-tax profits were Y6.04bn (Dollars 553.5m), down from Y10.69bn in the
previous year, and the dividend is being cut to Y5 from Y6.50 per share.
Sales dropped 6 per cent to Y1,020bn and the net loss was Y4.07bn, compared
with Y5.77bn.
The company's performance was adversely affected by last year's sharp rise
in the yen which, combined with depressed domestic demand, put pressure on
sales both at home and overseas.
Demand for audio-visual products, such as colour TVs, was particularly weak
and capital investment by Japanese companies remained stagnant.
Amid the prolonged recession in Japan, prices of consumer electronics goods
have collapsed, with heavy discounts offered not only on old models but also
on those recently introduced.
In addition, Sanyo's business in Japan was last year hurt by the unusually
cold and wet summer, which hit demand for air conditioners.
In contrast to the decline in audio-visual and electronic product sales, the
company saw firm demand for semiconductors and batteries.
On a consolidated basis, sales fell by a marginal 0.7 per cent to Y1,530bn
from Y1,540bn but pre-tax profits rose nearly six-fold to Y3.23bn from
Y562m.

FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Argentaria net profits up 12% to
Pta75bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentaria, the partially-privatised Spanish state banking corporation,
raised its 1993 consolidated net profits by 12 per cent to Pta75.4bn
(Dollars 538m) due to strongly increased fee income during last year's
currency turmoil and strict cost control.
The gain was ahead of that of other successful domestic banks and reflected
Argentaria's lowered exposure to falling interest rates, which have squeezed
margins among its rivals. With only 38 per cent of its liabilities in
deposits, against a domestic sector average of 65 per cent, Argentaria
obtains most of its funds from the market and its balance sheet is less
affected by lending conditions.
The banking group's net interest revenue increased by a more modest 5.8 per
cent to Pta256bn, in line with that of the more profitable Spanish banks. It
raised its commission income by 17 per cent to Pta54bn, reduced its
operating expenses by 0.5 per cent to Pta166bn and lifted its operating
profit by 18.9 per cent to Pta144bn.
Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), Portugal's state-owned savings bank and
largest financial institution, registered a 6 per cent increase in net
profits in 1993 to Es41.3bn (Dollars 236m). Net assets grew 18 per cent to
Es4,373bn, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.

FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: ANA mission looks for links with
BA - Japan's second airline's search for increased volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A team from All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest carrier, leaves Tokyo
today for London. Its immediate mission is to negotiate an agreement to
allow the airlines's passengers to participate in British Airways' frequent
flyer programme.
But ANA has bigger ambitions. The team is also under instructions to explore
the possibility of a wider marketing alliance with BA that will help counter
a collapse in demand caused by Japan's worst post-war recession.
The airline, the world's eighth biggest - larger than BA in terms of
passenger numbers - urgently needs to improve loads on its international
flights, particularly from Europe and the US to Japan.
The carrier's management believes a strategic marketing alliance with BA
could be the answer. Mr Yuzuru Masumoto, senior vice-president legal
affairs, says the two airlines could negotiate code sharing agreements, as
well as exchange of data, engineering facilities and flight crew.
The depth of the Japanese recession has taken ANA by surprise. The
percentage of available seats filled on domestic flights dropped from 71.3
per cent in the financial year to March 1992 to 62.2 per cent during the six
months to September 1993. The airline's plight has been exacerbated by
increasing deregulation allowing greater competition from Japan Airlines
(JAL).
Meanwhile, the group's international strategy is faltering. ANA's heady
expansion during the late 1980s and early 1990s has come to a halt. Loading
on international routes has fallen from 69.7 per cent in 1992-93 to 63.2 per
cent in the six months to September and management expects no recovery
during the second half.
The fall in passenger volumes has been exacerbated by a change in customer
mix. Mr Masumoto says the number of passengers in first and business class
has fallen by a third since the early 1990s.
ANA, unlike its rival JAL, is still in profit, but management admits its
post-tax results would have fallen into the red during the six months to
September if the group had not changed its depreciation policy, by extending
the assumed life of its aircraft from 10 to 13 years.
Retrenchment is now the order of the day. The company is drawing up a new
five-year plan which should be ready within a month and is based on lower
growth expectations.
ANA's management knows cost-cutting can only go so far. What the company
needs more than anything is improve passenger volumes and upgrade its
passenger mix. Hence the approach to BA.
But although ANA is clearly keen, BA's management, contacted by airlines for
similar agreements almost weekly, remains to be convinced.

FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aetna Life to shed 10% of its
workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, one of the biggest US insurance companies, is to drop
two insurance products and shed 4,000 jobs - almost 10 per cent of its
workforce - at a cost of Dollars 1bn to after-tax earnings in the year just
ended.
The measures are the latest in a series of actions that have already
resulted in the loss of almost 8,000 jobs over the last three years with the
aim of revitalising profits.
The businesses being dropped, written through Aetna Life Insurance, involve
the sale of guaranteed investment contracts and single premium annuities to
companies and other large sponsors of retirement plans.
Both of the products offer guaranteed returns to investors regardless of the
performance of the underlying investments.
Aetna, following a trend set by other insurance groups, said that it was
dropping the products because they were capital intensive and unprofitable.
At the end of 1993, the company had Dollars 14.7bn of assets under
management attributable to the products, of which Dollars 6bn was invested
in commercial mortgages and real estate.
Aetna plans to continue to expand its remaining asset accumulation
businesses, the company said, including individual and group variable
annuities for small and not-for-profit customers and also pension investment
management services for its larger customers.
The 4,000 job cuts will be spread across the group's businesses with the aim
of cutting costs. The move follows a reorganisation in 1990 which resulted
in Aetna's splitting its three large divisions into 15 smaller profit
centres so that the performance of each business unit could be more closely
monitored.
Aetna said that without the charges for the latest measures, its 1993
results, which are due to be released on February 9, would show an operating
profit of slightly more than Dollars 600m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported strong fourth-quarter results to cap one of the best financial
years in the company's history.
Growth in semiconductor sales drove revenues for the fourth quarter up 19
per cent to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.0bn in the same period last year.
Net income was Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, compared with Dollars
78m, or 80 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Profit from operations increased 75 per cent to Dollars 198m from Dollars
113m in the same period of 1992. The increase reflects improved results from
semiconductor operations and an increase in patent royalties, which rose to
Dollars 133m from Dollars 89m in the same period last year.
Fourth-quarter results for 1993 included an accrual of Dollars 31m for
employee profit sharing and a pre-tax charge of Dollars 23m related to the
consolidation of TI's consumer and peripheral products businesses.
For the full year, TI's revenues rose to Dollars 8.5bn from Dollars 7.4bn in
1992. Essentially all of the increase was in semiconductor revenues, the
company said. Net income for the year was Dollars 472m, or Dollars 5.03 per
share compared with Dollars 247m or Dollars 2.50 per share in 1992. Profits
from operations rose 73 per cent to Dollars 728m from Dollars 420m in 1992.
Revenues from components, the bulk of which are semiconductor devices, rose
28 per cent to Dollars 5.1bn for the year from Dollars 4.0bn in 1992. About
half of semiconductor revenues were from 'differentiated products', TI said,
reflecting the company's strategy to diversify beyond its strong position in
the market for standard memory chips.
Royalty revenues for the year rose 33 per cent to Dollars 521m from Dollars
391m in 1992.

<TEXT>
Efforts to raise the debt funding for the large Lihir gold mine project in
Papua New Guinea are expected to get under way in the next couple of weeks,
writes Nikki Tait.
Niugini Mining, one of the joint venture partners in the mine, alongside
Britain's RTZ and the Papua New Guinea government, said an information
memorandum would be circulated early in February to international banks.
The banking memorandum follows preparation of a detailed financial plan for
Lihir Gold, the corporate entity which will eventually own the project. The
development cost of the mine, put at USDollars 610m, is expected to be
covered by the raising of both equity and debt funds, and JB Were, the
Australian stockbroking firm, has been appointed as lead broker for the
planned initial public offering of share in Lihir Gold.
Lihir has the potential to become the largest gold mine outside South
Africa.

Flughaven Wien, the Vienna airport company (VA), is negotiating with the
Slovak government to take a 50 per cent stake in Bratislava airport, writes
Patrick Blum.
Talks between the Slovak and Austrian governments have revived the project
first mooted two years ago.
Bratislava airport would become a joint venture 50 per cent owned by VA,
which would invest some Sch200m (Dollars 17m) to help modernise the airport,
bring know-how, and provide training.
Bratislava has spare capacity while Vienna, with 7.1m passengers last year
and growing demand, will need extra capacity by the end of the century. The
two airports are about 45 minutes drive apart.

FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: IMI share issue priced at top
end of expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian Treasury has responded to the growing confidence in its
privatisation drive by pricing shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI),
the latest sell-off, at the top end of expectations.
Shares in IMI, the big financial services group which goes on sale today,
will be priced at L10,900 each, close to the top of the L9,800 to L11,000
range indicated by the Treasury, and will raise L2,180bn (Dollars 1.29bn).
The pricing came alongside new rules from the cabinet limiting the role of
shareholder pacts in privatisation issues. Such pacts, which are commonplace
in big Italian companies, allow small groups of shareholders to aggregate
their holdings and exercise control without necessarily owning more than 50
per cent of a company.
The IMI pricing represents a discount of 6.07 per cent on the company's net
worth, much tighter than the discount of about 10 per cent offered on
Credito Italiano last month.
The smaller discount on IMI reflects the Treasury's growing confidence in
the issue, in spite of its being the biggest initial public equity offering
in Italy.
The optimism stems from strong demand from foreign institutions, which will
be allocated half the 200m shares on offer. Soundings by S G Warburg, the UK
merchant bank co-ordinating the global tranche, have indicated foreign
buyers were willing to take at least three times the stock allocated.
Analysts expect the Treasury to allocate an additional tranche of almost 19m
shares, normally reserved for market stabilisation purposes. If these shares
are also sold, the state's stake in IMI will drop to about 27 per cent from
over 60 per cent at present.
The Treasury has also overcome its initial doubts about IMI's appeal to
Italian retail investors, who have been allocated 75m shares. The lavish
advertising campaign and the bandwagon effect of the Credito Italiano deal
have triggered considerable interest among small investors, as has the
generally upbeat sentiment on the bourse.
The privatisation campaign will gather pace next month with the sale of the
remaining public sector shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana.
It was partly with the BCI deal in mind that the cabinet issued its new
rules on shareholder pacts. Although the details remain unclear, the
regulations call for greater information about the membership and intentions
of such pacts in privatisation issues. Members could also be obliged to
launch full takeover bids for outstanding shares if they acted in concert in
acquiring additional stock after a privatisation.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Re-energising Magnet - Berisford's
conglomerate plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International is quietly confident that this afternoon its
shareholders will give the go-ahead for its proposed reverse takeover of
Magnet, the kitchen and joinery manufacturer and retailer.
It will be the first step in Berisford's planned transformation into a
conglomerate. But now Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, has another worry.
He fears that some brokers have been too eager to talk up the group's
shares. With Berisford buying Pounds 138m of assets for a net Pounds 26m it
is easy for outsiders to get carried away with the deal.
The shares were suspended at 128p just before the announcement of the deal.
They start trading again tomorrow. Kleinwort Benson, the securities house,
has recommended clients to buy them up to 240p. A sweep organised among the
company and its advisers for tomorrow's closing price has produced a more
cautious range from 131p to 210p.
Mr Bowkett has stressed his strategy is a long term one. He emphasises the
difference between what he plans for Berisford in the 1990s and what he
calls the 1980s style of conglomerates - get the share price up, do more
deals on the back of a high rating, and use acquisition accounting to make
them look good.
In the 1990s, he says, conglomerates will not have asset price inflation and
acquisition accounting to bale them out. Instead Berisford and its like will
have to rely on 'real things' such as consistent unit cost reduction and
differentiation through quality.
Berisford, he says, will aim to take the best of Anglo-Saxon commercial
attitudes and Japanese attention to detail and quality and apply them to
basic industries.
In the short term he lists three priorities. Bedding down Magnet is the
first, with the continuing liquidation of the old Berisford assets - which
might yield Pounds 30m in calendar 1994 - a close second. Then he wants to
start the search for a US acquisition which he reckons will take a year.
As for Magnet, Mr Bowkett has detailed plans for the business which have
been developed over the last few months of due diligence investigations.
This work has identified a number of areas where costs can be cut. For
instance, Magnet's division of the business into trade and retail has
produced two buying departments, each purchasing the same goods from the
same suppliers. Put the two together and there should be cost savings and
perhaps larger discounts.
Another aim is to take advantage of the strong operational gearing of the
business so that even without any recovery in its markets, sales and profits
can be expanded by, for example, the introduction of new products.
Magnet has segregated the trade customer from the retail, Mr Bowkett says,
to the detriment of sales. Different kitchen ranges aimed at the two types
of buyer has caused confusion.
All that Mr Bowkett asks is that shareholders be prepared to take a
medium-term view rather than look for a quick return. If the Magnet deal
completes in March, he thinks it will take until September, Berisford's
financial year-end, to start seeing an improvement. The clock starts ticking
on October 1, he says, and he is willing to be judged on the 1994-95
results.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Postel in mezzanine finance move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Postel, the UK's largest pension fund manager, is for the first time to
provide private companies with mezzanine finance in a move that signals that
higher proportions of debt are likely to begin creeping back into the
financing of management buy-outs.
Through the BT and Post Office Pension Schemes, Postel is buying 20 per cent
of Intermediate Capital Group, one of the few groups still providing
mezzanine finance, a form of capital that is riskier and higher yielding
than bank debt but is not generally classed as equity.
Many of the institutions that entered the market in the late 1980s and lost
substantial sums on deals like the buy-outs of Isosceles and Magnet, have
recently withdrawn. One of the main reasons these deals failed was that
buyers were able to inflate the price they could offer by taking on what
proved to be unmanageable amounts of debt.
Postel has also given ICG Pounds 50m to invest alongside its own funds in
the European mezzanine market. Together with a Pounds 10m injection from
another 'major UK insurance company', ICG says it will have over Pounds 250m
to invest over the next three to four years.
Last month Postel folded most of its investments in private companies into a
joint venture with Granville, the private investment bank, signalling a
withdrawal from direct management of assets in this sector.
Postel's moves are seen as confirmation that demand for mezzanine finance is
likely to increase as management buy-out teams and their financiers seek to
raise gearing and therefore, the prices paid to acquire their companies.
Increased demand is also expected from companies seeking development funds
that the banks will not supply.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel chief executive, said a material proportion
of what the group allocated to unquoted investments was being put in the
mezzanine market because 'there is a gap in the funds available to unlisted
companies between bank borrowings and equity funds from venture capital
investors'.
Mr Ross Goobey said Postel was 'attracted by the high yield and more
reliable return that this form of unquoted investment is able to offer.'
Postel is understood to be buying 20 per cent of ICG, mainly from Westpac
Banking, the Australian group, for substantially more than the Pounds 9m
value of the stake when the group was set up in 1989.
Mr Tom Bartlam, managing director of ICG, said mezzanine finance could
increase gearing and therefore helped management buy-out teams pay higher
prices. But he did not think there would be a return to the highly leveraged
buy-outs of the late 1980s.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Panel demands retractions from Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Takeover Panel forced Granada Group to publish late on Friday certain
retractions to statements in its latest missive in the war of words between
itself and LWT (Holdings), for which it has made a hostile bid of about
Pounds 725m.
In 1993, LWT generated cash before investments and dividends of Pounds
23.8m, rather than Pounds 22.9m as Granada said. So the conversion of profit
before interest and tax into cash before investments and dividends was 51,
not 49, per cent. Similarly LWT's net cash inflow before investments and
dividends was down 23.9, not 26.8, per cent on 1992.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tring flotation go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the budget price compact disc company which faces legal
action from other music groups, is expected to announce today that it plans
to go ahead with its postponed stock market flotation.
A pathfinder prospectus is expected to be published this morning. Tring
expects trading in its shares to begin before the end of February.
The flotation, originally planned for last month, was postponed because of
what the company saw as the weakness of the new issue market.
Mr Alan Wheatley, the former chairman of venture capital group 3i, who had
agreed to become Tring's chairman, has withdrawn. Instead, the chairman is
expected to be Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram
International, the music group.
Tring faces legal action from other music groups, including MCA and
PolyGram, alleging that the company has breached their copyright. Last week,
Tring agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music to settle two copyright
actions. The two actions concerned recordings by Olivia Newton-John and of
Puccini's La Boheme.
The Tring pathfinder prospectus is expected to say that the outstanding
legal actions will have no material impact on its profits, which are
expected to be Pounds 5.1m for the year to March 31 1994.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Applied Distribution to float in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applied Distribution, a Maidenhead-based contract distribution group
providing third-party warehousing and distribution services mainly to
retailers and food manufacturers, plans a stock market flotation in March.
The group intends to make its market debut through a placing organised by
Baring Brothers, which is likely to value the group at about Pounds 40m.
NatWest Wood Mackenzie will be brokers to the issue.
Applied was formed five years ago as part of a Pounds 16.5m management
buy-out of Geest's distribution division led by Mr Michael Rowley, who
became chief executive of the new company.
Since then, the group has benefited from the growing outsourcing trend among
UK retailers and manufacturers to contract out their warehousing and
transport needs to specialist service suppliers. The UK contract
distribution market is estimated to have been worth about Pounds 5bn in 1992
and to represent about 30 per cent of the total UK distribution market.
Applied operates nationally from five main depots and specialises in
distributing food and other fast-moving consumer goods, fresh produce, cut
flowers and pot plants under temperature controlled conditions. Its main
customers include J Sainsbury, Nestle, Esso, Somerfield/Gateway and CWS.
Despite the recession, the group reported increased operating profits of
Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.2m) in 1992 on turnover of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds
18.4m). Applied has also invested about Pounds 4.5m in depot facilities and
its vehicle fleet since the MBO. Results for 1993 are expected to show
continued growth and will be contained in the forthcoming prospectus.
The group plans to uses part of the placing proceeds to repay bank and other
borrowings, with the balance being used for working capital and investment
purposes.

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Merger terms put Pounds 15m tag on Europa
Minerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Terms for the three-way merger involving Europa Minerals value the UK-quoted
mining finance house at 62.6p a share or Pounds 15.4m, according to Samuel
Montagu, adviser to Burmine, the Australian gold company making the offer.
Europa's share price touched 57p at one stage on Friday after the news and
ended the day at 54p, up 12p.
Burmine is offering one of its shares for every two Europa ordinary and at
the same time, is making a 1-for-12 offer for Austmin Gold, an Australian
exploration company, valuing it at ADollars 15.5m (Pounds 7.4m).
Europa shareholders owning 52.5 per cent of the company said it was their
present intention to accept the Burmine bid. Europa's independent directors,
owning 2 per cent, recommend the offer and have irrevocably undertaken to
accept.
However, the three-way merger is challenged by an offer for Burmine by Mount
Edon, another Australian gold producer. Hearings by the Australian
authorities into technical challenges made by the companies are due to be
heard on February 7 and 8 and Burmine cannot move ahead with the three-way
deal until then.
The situation is made more complex because Mount Edon owns 22.6 per cent of
Burmine and 19.9 per cent of Europa. Europa owns 38.5 per cent of Burmine
and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Banesto rescue plan agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Banco Santander have emerged as the
contenders to control Banesto, the Spanish banking group in which the
authorities imposed a new management last month, according to a rescue plan
agreed by the Bank of Spain and the private banking sector.
The plan will provisionally make the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), which is
financed the Spanish banks, into Banesto's chief shareholder by underwriting
a Pta180bn (Pounds 861m) capital increase for the troubled bank.
Before the end of the year, the FGD will publicly auction its Banesto equity
and the share offer will be constructed to allow a domestic institution to
become Banesto's dominant shareholder.
BBV and Santander are singled out by analysts as the only possible strategic
buyers of Banesto stock among the domestic institutions. Neither bank has
officially declared an interest but both are understood to have spent the
weekend assessing the rescue plan.
Banesto is due to shrink dramatically in size prior to the FGD's capital
increase.
The bank will allocate all its Pta244bn reserves to provisions, raise an
additional Pta49bn towards its financing requirement by reducing the par
value of its individual shares from Pta700 to Pta400 and write down over
time a further Pta27bn in provisions.
In all, Banesto new management has undertaken to provide Pta320bn towards
the finally agreed figure of Pta605bn needed to restore the bank's balance
sheet. The private banks and the Bank of Spain will jointly, and on an equal
basis, provide Pta285bn to finance the acquisition by the FDG of outstanding
non-performing loans which Banesto is unable to provision.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, said: 'Banesto will be
profitable before the end of the year and I hope there will not be any more
frights.'
Trading in Banesto shares, suspended last month, is due to resume in Madrid
tomorrow.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Westerner takes a shine to the rustbelt: Richard Waters
explains BankAmerica's shift away from its California home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For BankAmerica, the midwest is about to become a second home. Friday's
announcement of its planned Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.26bn) takeover of
Chicago-based Continental Bank signals its first big foray out of its home
markets in the western states of the US. It also signals a plan by the US's
second biggest bank to shift its centre of gravity away from California,
where it earns an estimated two thirds of its income.
As such, it is likely to give a further push to the development of
nationwide banking in the US.
Continental is a rare animal in the US. While many institutions have shifted
their focus more towards retail banking, credit cards and consumer finance,
where lending margins and fees are good, Continental has sought to become a
specialist corporate bank. In this, it resembles its far larger and more
powerful New York rivals, JP Morgan and Bankers Trust.
With the purchase of Continental, BankAmerica is buying extensive contacts
with companies throughout the nation's rustbelt. Mr Richard Rosenberg,
BankAmerica's chairman, says: 'It's still the largest industrial base in the
US, with a string of good companies.' The bank claims the acquisition will
give it more primary relationships with US companies than any other bank,
including Citicorp, the country's largest banking group.
With the takeover, BankAmerica plans to move the headquarters of its own US
corporate banking operations to Chicago, in the process creating a new
wholesale banking giant in the midwest. Mr Rosenberg puts BankAmerica's
corporate banking assets at 'around three times' Continental's total Dollars
22bn, and its income from the business at more than Dollars 500m.
Despite the size, the new BankAmerica operation will have a long way to go
to rival banks like Citicorp and JP Morgan in the market for servicing big,
internationally active companies. While Continental will bring it experience
in trading in foreign exchange, derivatives and other financial markets,
these trading operations are modest compared with the big New York trading
banks. Also, BankAmerica has a weaker international network than its rivals:
it drew in its horns, along with other US banks, in the late 1980s, and
since then has been held back by the prolonged slump in its home market in
California and the long and arduous process of digesting Security Pacific, a
rival west coast bank that it bought two years ago.
Apart from the corporate customer base in the midwest, the deal has many
attractions for BankAmerica. For a start, Continental should prove
relatively easy to absorb. 'It's a much easier transaction than Security
Pacific, since it's not based on cost savings,' said Ms Diane Glossman, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Also, the purchase price - though a premium of around 15 per cent on
Continental's share price before the deal was announced - looks a bargain
for BankAmerica's shareholders. Continental's shares had been trading at a
discount to book value: even with the premium, BankAmerica is paying only
1.2 times book value (most banks sell for nearer 1.5 times book.)
Perhaps for this reason, BankAmerica's share price on Friday did not show
the sort of weakness which has infected the stocks of other acquisitive US
banks of late, brought on by market fear that they are being forced to pay a
high price to pursue their ambitions. Also, BankAmerica said it would buy
back Dollars 500m of its own stock before the cash-and-shares transaction is
completed, countering the dilution to its earnings that would otherwise have
resulted.
The agreement between the two banks contains a poison pill arrangement
designed to deter any rivals from making unwanted bids for Continental. Such
arrangements are becoming an increasingly familiar part of bank takeovers,
which tend to be cosy affairs. BankAmerica will be hoping that no one else
shares its views on just how attractive Continental may be.
Where do the BankAmerica's ambitions end? Many had been expecting it to make
a foray out of its home base to buy a retail bank rather than a corporate
one. Mr Rosenberg says there are no plans now to take over a retail bank in
the midwest, or to build a retail business out of Continental. 'It is a very
focused corporate bank,' he says. 'We certainly do not want to diffuse or
distract that focus by putting the bank into businesses it was not designed
for.'
Nonetheless, a takeover of Continental is unlikely to mark the end of
BankAmerica's ambitions.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Moment of truth for Euro Disney
prospects - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks will meet in Paris on Wednesday to assess the
conclusions of the special investigative audit of the troubled leisure
group's finances that they commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm. The audit analyses the current financial condition of Euro
Disney and its future prospects so that the banks can decide how to proceed
in their negotiations to put together an emergency rescue package for the
company.
The meeting was originally scheduled for January 26 but was reportedly
delayed because Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per
cent of Euro Disney, withheld information from the KPMG auditing team. The
banks now hope to finalise their negotiating strategy so that the rescue
talks can be concluded by the March 31 deadline imposed by Disney.
The marathon takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount
Communications may finally reach a climax today, the deadline set by the
company's board for best and final offers from rival bidders QVC Network and
Viacom. The two have until 5 pm New York time to improve their
cash-and-share tender offers, which will then be weighed up by the Paramount
board. Investors will have until mid-month to make up their minds.
Flat earnings growth is being forecast for Fyffes, the UK and Irish fresh
fruit distributor, whose results for the year to October 31 are due on
Wednesday. Stockbrokers in Dublin anticipate pre-tax profits of between
IPounds 29.5m (Pounds 28.1m) and IPounds 30.5m, up from IPounds 28.5m in
1992. This would be the equivalent to earnings per share of 5.9p (against
5.9p last time).
Rhone Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals division of Rhone Poulenc, the
French chemicals group which was privatised at the end of last year, will
today announce its results for last year and its strategy for 1994. RPR
achieved a 31 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 428m (Pounds 285.3m)
in 1992. But last year the group was confronted with a more difficult
environment as many governments implemented healthcare reforms and measures
to limit expenditure on drugs.
Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, will today reveal preliminary figures
pointing to one of the biggest losses in its 95-year history.
Though Fiat's full earnings figures and dividend will not be announced until
May, the group is expected to provide figures indicating a pre-tax loss of
more than L2,000bn (Pounds 784.31m) on sales of almost L54,000bn in 1993,
excluding disposals.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Groups examine Ferranti businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About eight companies from the UK, France and the US have emerged as serious
candidates to take over the bulk of Ferranti International's defence
electronics operations.
Ferranti's administrative receivers have drawn up a short-list of companies
which have expressed interest in acquiring 70 per cent or more of the
collapsed group which has been in receivership since early December when the
General Electric Company withdrew a 1p-a-share rescue bid.
The list, compiled by Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the
administrative receivers from Arthur Andersen, is understood to include GEC,
British Aerospace, Thorn EMI and Thomson-CSF of France. The list of
potential corporate purchasers is also believed to include one other French
defence concern and two US companies.
A team of seven Ferranti managers, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's
director of marketing, is also preparing a bid for most of the Ferranti
operations. Last week the management team began seeking equity finance to
back either a full management and employee buy-out, or the
management/employee element of a consortium bid in conjunction with a
corporate partner from the UK or overseas.
The Ministry of Defence would not stand in the way of either a corporate or
a consortium bid and has indicated that it would not raise competition
objections. However, in the event of a French bid it is likely that the MoD
would seek a joint-venture solution with a British partner.
Thomson-CSF already has first refusal rights on the 50 per cent it does not
already own in the profitable Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems UK joint
venture, which is not affected by the receivership. It is believed to be
close to a deal to sell the additional shareholding on to GEC.
Such a move would satisfy the MoD which wants to see a 50 per cent British
share maintained in the joint venture company since it regards sonar
technology as crucial to national security.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Murdoch revival should be on the
bottom line - News Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many questions have been aired over Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
recently, but the delivery of some good bottom-line figures for the six
months to end-December on Thursday is not in much doubt.
BSkyB, the UK satellite television venture is likely to brighten the
results. In December the satellite company set a new monthly record by
adding 140,000 new subscribers, bringing the total to around 3.3m. But the
newspaper price cutting war in the UK, while boosting sales of The Sun and
The Times is likely to cost around Pounds 43m in the 1994 financial year.
Many analysts think that after-tax profits for News first half-year, before
abnormals, could nudge above ADollars 600m (Pounds 283m), compared with
ADollars 490.1m last time. In terms of operating profit, however, the
progress is likely to be less marked.
News actually saw a small fall here in the first three months, with the
quarterly figure easing to ADollars 412.2m from ADollars 432.5m. Earnings
from the newspaper interests were affected by the price war in the UK, while
the smaller magazine and inserts division reported a 32 per cent profits
drop.
Analysts say that this situation is unlikely to reversed in any dramatic
fashion during the second quarter, although earnings from the film interests
are expected to be strong. Indeed, the newspaper division's earnings will be
further affected by the sale of a 34.9 per cent interest in the South China
Morning Post in October. Macquarie Bank Analysts talks of a very modest
ADollars 5m rise for the first half overall.
The boost to net profit, say analysts, will come from falling interest
charges and from a rise in associated companies' profits - namely, Ansett
Airlines, the Australian carrier which News owns jointly with TNT, and
BSkyB, News' 50 per cent-owned satellite broadcaster in the UK. (Pearson,
publisher of the Financial Times also holds an interest in BSkyB).
Meanwhile, gossip over Mr Murdoch's joint venture plans - said to involve a
move into the 'electronic superhighway' field - has eased off in the wake of
the 'super share' plan's demise.
But few analysts think News' interest has died: 'I don't think the subject
has gone away,' says one, 'but it's a question of how to do it.'
Murdoch watcher Mr Terry Povey of Bell Securities is predicting an Pounds
80m contribution to News Corp this year and Pounds 140m in 1995.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Retailing again main engine of
growth - BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time BAA, the airports operator, is to report quarterly
results. Tomorrow it is to release figures for the first nine months of the
year to March 30.
Analysts are shy of forecasting for the third quarter, but anticipate that
full-year profits will fall between Pounds 312m and Pounds 325m.
Again the main engine of growth is expected to be the retailing side, though
improved productivity and cost-cutting throughout the group will have their
impact.
Watchers will be awaiting the group's reaction to the government's call for
a probe into the economic regulation of airports - currently overseen by the
Civil Aviation Authority and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  31 JAN 94 / NFC chiefs clash over values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An extraordinary clash between the chairman of NFC and his predecessor
marked the annual general meeting of the UK-based transport and logistics
group.
About 1,110 shareholders heard Sir Peter Thompson, 65, who led an employee
buy-out in 1982, accuse his successor, Mr Peter Watson, of putting the
group's traditional values at risk.
Sir Peter particularly criticised the board's failure to seek shareholders'
permission in advance of the group's Pounds 263m rights issue last month,
which will dilute the proportion of equity held by employees.
He asked Mr Watson, who succeeded him in 1991: 'Why did you find it
impossible to seek permission from the people who have supported you all
these years?'
Mr Watson said advance permission had not been sought because of the
possible adverse effect of a deal on NFC's share price, but denied that the
'continuing evolution' of the group posed any threat to its traditional
values.
Sir Peter was concerned that recent developments had threatened NFC's core
values - of employee involvement, participation and frugality. He said: 'We
used to be non-elitist - and I now see executive share options are creeping
in all over the place.'
Mr Watson told Sir Peter he had 'been away for some time,' and said he
regretted he had chosen to raise the issues at Saturday's agm. He reminded
Sir Peter they had worked closely together for many years, adding: 'I do
resent a little bit the suggestion that I don't share these values.' Mr
Watson said the rights issue was necessary to develop NFC, and he had
clearly flagged that strategy to earlier meetings of shareholders. It was
also essential to have a pattern of shareholding which worked for the 1990s
 -'we can't always look back to the 1980s'.
Sir Peter - describing himself as a 'humble pensioner' - drew warm applause
before and after his contributions. However, Mr Watson's robust defence of
the board was also applauded and the meeting overwhelmingly approved all the
resolutions before it.
On NFC's trading, Mr Peter Sherlock, chief executive, said there was
encouraging evidence of a steady if unspectacular return to growth in the US
and UK, although not in mainland Europe.
Overall revenue in the group's UK Logistics business (combining Exel
logistics and BRS) in the 12 weeks since October had grown 5 per cent
compared with last year. The grocery and consumer sector had started well,
but the industrial sector remained difficult.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Japan plans Pounds 85bn economic stimulus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government this week plans to follow its agreement on political
reform with a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government spending,
estimated to total at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 85bn).
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said at the weekend he aimed to
announce details by the end of the week. His seven-party coalition
government would seek co-operation on economic policy with the opposition
Liberal Democratic party.
The Nikkei rose more than 900 points by mid-morning today. Brokers said
investors welcomed the reform deal because it cleared political
uncertainties.
The economic package will come as a relief to the US and to Japanese
business organisations, which have been urging steps to relieve the
recession.
Until the weekend, the coalition's ability to act on the economy had been
paralysed by its attempts to win parliamentary agreement on plans to
redesign the electoral system and curb corruption. However, parliament on
Saturday voted in favour of a compromise on reform.
The newly confident coalition plans to hold elections 'anytime from this
autumn', said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. Ministers
responsible for the economy started work on the package at the weekend.
Early drafts envisage Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn in income and residential tax
cuts, plus Y4,000bn of government spending on infrastructure, according to
government officials quoted in the Japanese press. The package is also said
to include increased loans for housing and small businesses, plus possible
tax concessions for corporate land sales.
The government will draw up its budget for the coming fiscal year by
February 15, said Mrs Manae Kubota, director of the Economic Planning
Agency. It may expand an existing five-year programme of public works, worth
Y430,000bn. This week's package will be the fourth and possibly largest
pump-priming plan in 14 months.
Mr Hosokawa will have evidence of attempts to stimulate domestic demand when
he meets US president Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. US-Japanese
trade relations have been strained by failure to agree on US demands that
Tokyo should accept numerical targets for reducing its trade surplus.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Russia will cut aluminium output in trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is to cut its annual aluminium output by 500,000 tonnes, or about 15
per cent, for two years as part of an unprecedented international trade deal
agreed at the weekend by the world's leading aluminium-producing countries.
Western producers are expected to follow Russia's lead with cuts which will
reduce global aluminium output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes - or about 10 per cent.
The arrangement aims to end growing friction between Europe, the US and
Russia over aluminium supply surpluses that last year produced record
stockpiles of the metal and cut prices by half to record lows.
Nearly two-thirds of the former Soviet Union's aluminium was used by the
military but is now being exported. This has boosted aluminium exports of
the Commonwealth of Independent States from 250,000 tonnes in 1989 to an
estimated 1.6m tonnes last year.
In the west, where aluminium is mainly used for transport equipment,
construction and packaging, producers have already cut annual output by 1.4m
tonnes or nearly 10 per cent of their total capacity.
But stocks have continued to accumulate at the rate of 1.8m tonnes a year.
Many producers were unwilling to make further cuts unless Russian industry
shared in the reduction.
Now a formula to bring the market back into balance has been approved by
trade representatives from Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union
negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US. Mr Georgy Gabuniya, Russia's
deputy foreign trade minister, said after tense discussions last week with
the republic's smelter managers that Russia would cut its output by 300,000
tonnes in the three months beginning tomorrow and then by a further 200,000
tonnes in the following three months.
The memorandum of understanding accepted by the aluminium producers at the
weekend provides no specific targets for individual western countries
because of anti-trust problems. The trade delegates hope they can convince
anti-trust authorities in the US and elsewhere that the aluminium industry
is reacting to market forces rather than acting as a cartel.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Soros and GE join forcesto finance power plants: Dollars
2.5bn venture for projects in developing world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, best known as the currency speculator who made massive
profits betting against the pound during the 1992 sterling crisis, is
joining forces with GE Capital, the financial services arm of America's
General Electric, to raise Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to invest in power
projects in the developing world.
The fund should give a strong boost to General Electric's power plant
manufacturing business as it fights for global market share against rivals
such as Europe's Asea Brown Boveri.
Cash-strapped governments in developing countries, particularly in Asia, are
increasingly willing to allow private sector capital to finance new
electrical power plants.
The venture represents a further shift in Mr Soros's investment strategy
which has been mainly concentrated on volatile debt, equity and currency and
commodity markets. Last year he moved into property.
GE Capital and Quantum Industrial Holdings, a new fund to be managed by
Soros Fund Management, will each invest Dollars 200m in the new venture,
called Global Power Investments.
The International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the
World Bank, will be the third founding partner. The IFC's planned Dollars
50m investment is awaiting formal approval.
The partners plan eventually to raise Dollars 2.5bn in equity finance from a
wide variety of investors, ranging from businesses with interests in the
construction or operation of power projects to passive investors.
The initial focus will be on Asia - particularly China, India and Indonesia
 -and on Mexico. GE Capital and various partners are in advanced discussions
about projects in these countries.
The fund is believed to be the first of its kind, although vehicles have
been formed before now to invest in individual developing world power
projects.
Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said the venture was an
outgrowth of GE Capital's existing power financing business, which has
focused mainly on the US market where it has financed more than Dollars 7bn
of projects through a mixture of debt and equity.
Mr Wendt said Mr Soros's involvement stemmed from a friendship between a
senior GE Capital executive and an associate of Mr Soros.
'Mr Soros has not only a large amount of money at his disposal but a keen
understanding of the rest of the world,' Mr Wendt added. 'He is a true
international investor. Marry that with GE's international activities and we
think we have an excellent combination.'

A neat coincidence of timing brings Spain's government-sponsored rescue of
Banesto at precisely the moment that Continental Bank, salvaged by a
comparable US effort in 1984, disappears into the arms of BankAmerica.
Since Banesto is also likely to be swallowed up, one lesson is that a fight
for survival, even one as successful as Continental's, damages a bank's
chances of remaining independent.
There is another lesson, too. Both Continental and BankAmerica came through
their difficulties of the 1980s by focusing on the things they did best -
nationwide corporate banking in Continental's case, regional retail banking
at BankAmerica.
In principle, the two together make a stronger, more diversified bank than
either alone. In practice, unusual management determination may be needed to
avoid a consequent loss of focus. And the knock-down price in relation to
assets at which BankAmerica is acquiring Continental reflects the market's
misgivings about the long-term profitability of wholesale banking.
Banesto should have such problems. Despite JP Morgan's cajoling, the old
management had not steeled itself to settle for doing a few things well. The
new managers probably have the inclination but they may not have the time;
the rescue plan seems set to hand control to a rival in a matter of months.
Selling the deposit guarantee scheme's stake so promptly risks crystallising
losses at the low point of the bank's fortunes. Banesto shareholders,
diluted by 75 per cent, may not be happy, but all Spanish bank depositors
are likely to be losers, too.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's auction of the rump of Trafalgar House's rights issue marks a
radical departure for the London equity market. By turning its back on the
established system - whereby shares are placed with institutions at a
discount to the market price - Swiss Bank Corporation has attracted
brickbats. Such placings have long been a source of cheap stock for
institutional investors and means of patronage for stockbrokers.
As a relative newcomer to the London market with a run of aggressive deals
to its credit, Swiss Bank is already out of favour with corporate financiers
of the old school. But if the auction results in shares being sold closer to
the market price, Trafalgar's shareholders - even those who declined to take
up their rights - stand to benefit. The main reason for caution in principle
is that auctioning a very large rump of shares from a badly failed rights
issue could arguably result in a more volatile market than the old
softly-softly system. Since Trafalgar's share price has risen by more than
25 per cent in the last month, though, the rump is likely to be modest. If
that turns out to be the case, the proof of the pudding will be in the
price.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No one can accuse Australian equities of poor performance in 1993, but their
rise of around a third did lag the striking gains elsewhere in the Pacific
rim. That raises the question of how the market will fare if international
investors really tire of the fancier markets such as Hong Kong. Part of the
answer is that an end to the liquidity flows from the US and Japan which
have bolstered south east Asian markets would certainly dull the prospects
for Australia as well. But international investors are still underweight in
Australia, where markets could fare relatively better. Gains to date have
not left industrial issues particularly expensive in relation to expected
earnings increases of some 25 per cent in the current fiscal year. Resources
issues could outperform if recovery in the industrial world brings the
prospect of rising commodity prices.
Australia's long recession forced companies to cut costs to the point where
they are markedly more competitive. That has helped contain the current
account. Measured as a proportion of output, last year's deficit of some 3.5
per cent of GDP was the lowest since 1980 even though exports have not yet
been boosted by higher commodity prices. With inflation still low, there is
also some prospect of a stronger Australian dollar.
The biggest appeal should be Australia's resource-based economy. On past
experience this should come into its own if a turnround in both the Japanese
and European economies brings synchronised recovery in the industrial world
in 1995. Admittedly, coal prices remain depressed, but metals are already
starting to attract attention, as the response to Mercury Asset Management's
international mining fund showed. This argument still assumes, though, in
stark contrast to the latest US GDP figures, that there can be no meaningful
recovery without a spot of inflation in its train.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UAP breaks cover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UAP has again cast its shadow across the boardrooms of UK insurers and set
pulses racing in the equity market. Last week's comments by Mr Jacques
Friedmann, UAP's new chairman, were not the first to spell out the company's
ambition. A slice of the UK non-life insurance market would be a strategic
fit with interests in continental Europe. While it is difficult to believe
that UAP would be willing to launch a bid before its privatisation in the
spring, an acquisition thereafter cannot be ruled out.
The small stake in Sun Alliance acquired last summer by TransAtlantic, the
investment company which UAP jointly controls with Liberty Life of South
Africa, could provide a toe-hold. The remarkable performance of
TransAtlantic's shares in recent weeks - up from 320p to 440p since early
December - would be a promising foundation from which to raise additional
capital. That said, UAP's partnership with TransAtlantic was a convenient
way of settling an uncomfortable rivalry with Liberty Life over the
ownership of Sun Life. In the long term it might prefer full control of its
investments.
Neither is it clear that UAP would be getting good value by making a hostile
bid for Sun Alliance, which is already trading at a substantial premium to
net assets. A smaller, agreed deal might offer better value. Since UAP does
not have to worry about upsetting UK insurance brokers, buying into the
fast-growing direct insurance sector must be a tempting option. It is less
clear that the owners of the three largest direct writers - Royal Bank of
Scotland, Royal Insurance and Winterthur - would want to sell.

The Japanese government this week plans to follow its agreement on political
reform with a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government spending,
estimated to total at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 85bn).
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said at the weekend he aimed to
announce details by the end of the week. His seven-party coalition
government would seek co-operation on economic policy with the opposition
Liberal Democratic party.
The package will come as a relief to the US and to Japanese business
organisations, which have been urging the government to take steps to
relieve the worst recession since the second world war.
Until the weekend, the coalition's ability to act on the economy was
paralysed by its attempts to win parliamentary agreement on plans to
redesign the electoral system and curb political corruption. Failure to
reach a deal by the end of the parliamentary session at midnight on Saturday
could have led to the government's collapse.
However, parliament voted in favour of a last-minute compromise worked out
between Mr Hosokawa and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the LDP.
The newly confident coalition plans to hold elections under the redesigned
electoral system 'anytime from this autumn', said Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
chief cabinet secretary.
Ministers responsible for the economy started work on the package at the
weekend. Early drafts envisage Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn in income and
residential tax cuts, plus Y4,000bn of government spending on
infrastructure, according to government officials quoted in the Japanese
press. The package is also said to include increased loans for housing and
small businesses, plus possible tax concessions for corporate land sales.
The government will draw up its budget for the coming fiscal year by
February 15, nearly two months late, said Mrs Manae Kubota, director of the
Economic Planning Agency. It may also expand an existing five-year programme
of public works, worth Y430,000bn, officials were quoted in the press as
saying.
This week's package would be the fourth and possibly largest pump-priming
plan in 14 months. The previous three, worth a total of just over Y30,000bn,
have so far failed to rekindle growth.
The package means Mr Hosokawa will have evidence of attempts to stimulate
domestic demand when he meets US president Bill Clinton in Washington on
February 11.
US-Japanese trade relations have been strained by failure to agree on US
demands that Tokyo accept numerical targets for reducing its trade surplus.
The Japanese government knows Mr Clinton is under pressure to use sanctions
if talks break down.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Odd man out in global welfare state: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the White House 'war room' aides reportedly punched the air with their
fists. The cause of the excitement? President Bill Clinton had just taken
one of the boldest steps in his political career. In his State of the Union
address, he waved his pen at members of Congress and threatened to veto any
healthcare legislation that did not guarantee insurance cover for all
Americans.
The incident is a reminder that policies (such as universal health cover)
taken for granted for decades elsewhere remain controversial in the US. In
Europe, the political challenge is to find ways of easing the crushing
financial burden imposed on public sectors by long-established
'cradle-to-grave' welfare states. There is little stomach for extending
government services; the quest is rather for politically acceptable cuts in
public provision.
The US, by contrast, is still in the building phase. In addition to
providing health cover for 37m uninsured Americans, Mr Clinton envisages a
larger government role in labour markets. He wants to replace a passive
unemployment insurance system with an activist 're-employment service' of
the kind pioneered in Sweden. Rather than simply handing out cheques, public
agencies would assess workers' skills, organise training and provide
assistance in job search. As with healthcare reform, this is part of a
broader effort to restore a sense of personal economic security.
An extension of the US welfare state is feasible only because social policy
has been so circumscribed in the past. Americans grumble about high taxes,
but their fiscal burden is still relatively modest. Total government
spending accounts for only about 34 per cent of gross domestic product
against an average of 52 per cent in Europe. Public spending is under better
control because the US relies more heavily on private provision (the
majority of Americans still get health insurance through private employers)
and because it never entirely lost confidence in the 19th century ideal of
self help.
Most Americans accept that a safety net for children, the elderly and the
disabled - the 'deserving poor' - is needed. But the concept of 'income
support' for anybody who falls on hard times remains alien to the culture.
Unemployment insurance lasts only six months (except during recessions);
thereafter single adults are on their own. Welfare support is restricted
mainly to families with children, usually those headed by single parents.
Public debate about social policy, however, is strangely skewed. Querying
the vast sums lavished on the elderly - including well-to-do senior citizens
 -has become politically taboo. There is virtually no discussion of the
merits of Social Security, the federally run pension system that costs
taxpayers Dollars 300bn a year. Nobody seems remotely concerned by actuarial
reports showing that this pay-as-you-go system could become insolvent early
in the next century once baby-boomers start retiring.
Pundits are instead driving themselves into a frenzy over welfare support
for inner city families, a financially insignificant component of the US
welfare state that threatens to overshadow the healthcare debate. Total
spending on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare prop,
is only Dollars 23bn a year, or about two per cent of the federal budget.
The average payment under the programme is a princely Dollars 377 a month,
little more than half the level 20 years ago after allowing for inflation.
Welfare touches a nerve, however, because it is widely regarded as having
contributed to a host of chronic social problems, including sharply rising
illegitimacy rates, violent crime and drug abuse. Ever receptive to public
opinion, Mr Clinton has promised to attack the 'culture of dependency' by
unveiling tough welfare reforms this spring. He plans to build on the 1988
Family Support Act, which introduced a limited form of 'workfare,' by
setting a strict two year limit on welfare cheques.
The hope is that most welfare recipients would be placed in private sector
jobs before the time limit expires; the remainder would be required to
perform community work. This, at least, is the theory although many experts
doubt that it can be realised. It would require heavy investment in training
and involve the creation of perhaps an additional 1.5m public sector jobs,
which would hardly further the administration's objective of 're-inventing'
government by reducing bureaucracy.
In urging Congress to enact reforms of healthcare, welfare, and job training
 -not to mention criminal sentencing policy - Mr Clinton is emerging as the
most socially active president since Lyndon Johnson. But whether he will
succeed in significantly reshaping social policy remains uncertain.
If Mr Clinton obtains a guarantee of universal health cover, it is likely to
be phased in over many years. And the role of government will certainly end
up more restricted than envisaged in the original White House plan. In the
longer run, America's welfare state is likely to remain lean, patchy and
relatively inexpensive by world standards - despite Mr Clinton's activist
agenda.
This is the last in a series analysing the pressures on the welfare state
across the world. A reprint of all 15 articles, in A4 format, will shortly
be available for Pounds 12. For details, contact John White, Marketing

Weekend reports that MPs are threatening to boycott the BBC because it has
stopped paying them for their TV and radio appearances, seem a bit wide of
the mark. After all the BBC's new policy has been in place for almost a year
and it doesn't seem to have led to any drop in the number of MPs wanting to
grab the BBC microphones.
It's surprising that the BBC did not call the MPs' bluff earlier. Only a few
mavericks, such as former defence minister Alan Clark, refuse interviews
because there's not enough money on the table.

Five months after moving to London on the Bank of England's insistence
following HSBC's takeover of Midland, Sir William Purves is hardly a
familiar part of the City scenery. But his determination to maintain a low
profile reaches new heights this month. He is not going to turn up to his
own bank's results presentation at its headquarters.
Sir William has opted to present the results in Hong Kong, leaving the
honours in London to John Bond, chief executive. All perfectly proper, given
that HSBC has a slightly higher capitalisation on the Hong Kong exchange
than in London. But perhaps rather telling about the city in which he feels
most comfortable, central bank formalities aside.

Granada is resorting to some hard-hitting copy in its battle to take control
of LWT. Its latest circular contains '10 facts LWT would rather you didn't
know. . . '.
That's the kind of editorial trick Kelvin Mackenzie used to pull when he was
editing The Sun, Britain's raciest daily tabloid. Come to think of it isn't
Mackenzie in the Granada camp these days by virtue of his new job managing
British Sky Broadcasting, partly-owned by Granada?
Granada insists that the 10 facts about LWT were all its own work and not a
straight lift from The Sun's editorial style book. Fortunately for LWT,
Granada's knocking copy is bound by the rules of the Takeover Panel rather
than the Press Complaints Commission.

Hope that Alan Bowkett and his team at Berisford International, poised to
take over the troubled Magnet business, are better prepared for today's
shareholder meeting to agree the deal, than they were when quizzed last
week.
Observer hears that whilst Berisford's top team might be good at financial
figuring, it is a bit short on general knowledge, judging by its performance
at a corporate quiz night organised by headhunters Whitehead Mann last
Thursday. Rather foolishly, Berisford fielded its top team of chief
executive Alan Bowkett, Denis Mulhall, finance director, and company
secretary, Barry O'Connor, rather than a bunch of unknowns from its
personnel department.
The Berisford big-wigs got into trouble early on when Bowkett (geography 'A'
level with distinction) admitted that he had no idea of the length of the
Amazon and his finance director confused miles with kilometres. After
Bowkett had correctly identified a picture of Caernarvon Castle, only to be
over-ruled by his company secretary, Berisford's position in bottom place
was invincible.

Has Britain's recently married food minister, Nicholas Soames, taken his eye
off the ball? A set of draft regulations about mineral hydrocarbons are
bubbling to the surface in Soames' department and are causing a bit of a
stir amongst his buddies in the landed gentry.
Soames' officials have long been concerned about the harmful effects of
these compounds in foodstuffs. The plan is to ban almost all of them, but to
continue to permit their use in defeathering waterfowl, coating cheese and
in chewing gum.
All fine and dandy, except that the only two kinds of mineral hydrocarbon to
be allowed - high melting point microcrystalline wax and high sulphur
microcrystalline wax - are not, according to those who are supposed to know,
remotely suitable for the aforementioned processes.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Sweeteners for a bitter pill: The strategies adopted by
European drug companies to cope with cuts in state spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Boehringer Mannheim, the German healthcare company with sales of almost
Dollars 1.5bn a year, realised how much cuts in German drug spending would
damage profits, it decided to move the headquarters of its pharmaceuticals
division on the Rhine to Connecticut in the US.
Mr Mark McDade, chief operating officer, is determined to be gone by April.
'Operating profits in Germany fell by 20 per cent in the first half of last
year. We have to reduce costs. This move will save money.' About 1,500 of
the 9,660 jobs on the company's German payroll will be cut as a result of
the move.
Emigration may not be on every European drug company's agenda. But
executives across the Continent are making some tough decisions in response
to curbs in spending on drugs by governments seeking to cut healthcare
costs.
Official figures for 1992, the latest available, show prescription drugs
worth Dollars 50bn were sold in the five biggest European markets  - France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Three years earlier, the figure was
Dollars 36bn, in real terms.
Almost all of this cost was borne by the public purse, through schemes which
reimburse or subsidise pharmacists and doctors supplying medicines to
patients.
The bill is rising as an ageing population demands more healthcare, and
medical advances offer new treatments for ailments ranging from migraine to
Aids.
But recession has blunted both the will and ability of governments to foot
the bill. Moreover, a combination of pressures has led to a re-appraisal of
the basic principle of universal provision on which many of the European
welfare state systems have been based.
In an effort to control costs, Germany has cut its national health drugs
spending from DM26bn (Pounds 10bn) in 1992 to DM22bn in 1993. Italy this
month reduced the number of drugs eligible for subsidy, saying it wanted to
cut the national drugs bill by 30 per cent. The French government last week
signed a deal with drugs industry representatives that will cut the growth
in drug sales from more than 8 per cent a year to 4 per cent, according to
estimates by Goldman Sachs, the securities house. Last year, the UK
government imposed a 2 1/2 per cent cut on the prices of drugs the NHS buys.
And Spain is considering toughening controls on drug prices.
The effect has been startling. Growth in pharmaceutical sales in Europe,
which averaged 11 per cent a year from 1987 to 1991, fell to just over 8 per
cent in 1992 and zero last year, according to Lehman Brothers, the
stockbroker.
The impact on corporate profits will be apparent in coming weeks as the
annual results season for European pharmaceutical companies gets under way.
An indication of what lies in store came last week when full-year results
from Merck, the US drugs company, showed 7 per cent sales growth in the US
but only 1 per cent in Europe.
With the impact of reforms in the UK, Italy and France still to be felt, and
with further price controls likely in Spain and outside Europe, drugs
industry executives have not waited for profit figures before taking action.
What they are doing varies by company and country, but there are four
themes:
First, they are cutting payrolls and closing sites to reduce operating
costs. In Germany, Hoechst is eliminating more than 20 per cent of its 1,400
jobs at its pharmaceuticals head office.
Bayer, where profits on drug sales in Germany for the first nine months of
1993 were down 50 per cent on the same period a year earlier, plans to cut
almost 30 per cent of its 1,100-strong pharmaceutical marketing division.
The company is also beset by troubles in its chemicals operations. 'I cannot
rule out targeted job cuts in 1995, but it will not be on the level seen so
far,' said Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, last week.
Glaxo of the UK, Europe's biggest drugs company, is cutting staff in Germany
and Italy. And Fisons last week said it would cut 1,000 jobs, almost 15 per
cent of the workforce, and partially close its biggest plant - at Holmes
Chapel in Chesire in the UK.
Other companies have closed entire plants. Wellcome of the UK, for example,
has shut one in Belgium and another in the UK.
Meanwhile, Switzerland's Ciba is reorganising its entire pharmaceuticals
manufacturing operations in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium at a cost of
SFr250m (Pounds 114.1m). The plan involves closing general-purpose plants
and replacing them with large specialist centres. The company intends to
close, by summer 1994, two multi-product sites in France and others in
Spain, Italy and Belgium, and replace them with new plants in France, Spain
and Italy, each of which will specialise in particular products. The
programme is only half complete, but Ciba is already claiming production
cost savings of 20 per cent. Second, pharmaceutical executives are
responding to pressures by developing new marketing strategies. The
objectives are to promote drugs which governments pay for and to focus on
hospitals or doctors with the greatest buying power.
Swiss company Sandoz is one company taking this approach. It 'will promote
products that are least affected by the healthcare reforms', says Mr Urs
Baerlocher, chairman of Sandoz's pharmaceutical division. Products least
affected are usually those that are unique and have little competition.
Spending on its drugs Sandimmune, used in organ transplants, and Clozaril,
used to treat schizophrenics, has emerged relatively unscathed from
healthcare reforms.
Third, industry executives are redirecting research and development - away
from programmes producing 'me-too' drugs, which grab a small slice of an
established market for a particular treatment, towards programmes most
likely to produce high-selling drugs.
In the UK, Italy and Germany, only a handful of products in each therapeutic
area is being given official blessing for state support. Others are ignored.
'Nobody is now going to develop the 10th beta-blocker (a heart treatment) in
the hope of getting a few per cent of that market,' says Mr Steve Leventhal,
Ciba's head of central product management. 'Governments just won't reimburse
it.'
There is a corresponding emphasis on genuine innovation, which offers the
possibility of new niche markets or even monopoly products. Boehringer
Mannheim is following this route. 'We have reduced headcount and are
focusing on fewer areas of R &amp; D,' says Mr McDade.
Another option is to bolster efforts on generics - drugs whose patents have
expired (usually after 20 years). Competition means prices are low, making
them attrac-tive to government health administrations. Finally, European
drug companies are seeking alliances with counterparts elsewhere, notably in
the US, to import expertise in cost control, research and management of
generic products.
Last October, Hoechst paid Dollars 546m for a 51 per cent stake in US
generics company Copley, the company's first North American corporate deal.
Moreover, Glaxo and Wellcome last year signed deals with the US drug company
Warner-Lambert to sell generic products internationally. Last week, Bayer
said it was in the final stages of negotiating an alliance with a US
generics company.
Glaxo now has ties with no less than 12 small biotechnology companies,
mainly in the US, while Swiss company Roche has more than 20 such deals.
For Mr McDade of Boehringer Mannheim, the strategy now is simple. 'We are
going to build collaborations. We are not going to build bricks and mortar
any more.'
These efforts to create a leaner European pharmaceuticals industry may,
however, be inadequate. Government anxiety about escalating healthcare costs
looks set to spread to more European countries.
Privately, and sometimes publicly, industry executives acknowledge they
could do more. 'Every drugs company has fat to cut,' says Mr Patrick Egan,
Fisons chairman.
Ciba's Mr Leventhal believes the industry's past profitability concealed
structural weaknesses. 'Production costs have in the past not been a
significant consideration. One key to success now will be productive
efficiency.'
There is still resistance to drug price controls within the industry. The
European Commission is debating whether national drug pricing controls
contradict the spirit of the single market. But governments are bound to try
to control costs. Pharmaceuticals companies, it seems, must be prepared to
restructure.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Leading Article: China and the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Napoleon once advised the world to let the Chinese giant sleep since 'when
he wakes he will move the world'. By now it is too late. The question for
the world is how to respond to the quake. On balance, the best choice is to
facilitate rapid market-oriented development of the Chinese economy. One
implication is that China should be accepted into the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, on strict economic conditions.
There is no denying, however, that China presents problems. The country has
three inhabitants for every two in western Europe, North America and Japan
combined. Its economic growth ran at over nine per cent a year between 1980
and 1991 and could continue at such a rate for decades. It also brings
together a powerful comparative advantage in labour intensive manufactures
and easy access to capital and skills. On the minus side, its economy
continues to be distorted by the legacy of planning and controls.
Last but not least, China is a corrupt despotism. The notion of China as an
economic colossus under anything like the present regime is bound to cause
concern. But rapid export-oriented industrialisation is likely to create
strong pressures for political change in China, as it has in other east
Asian countries. This is why the west should focus its attention on
sustaining market-oriented reforms. China's application to join (or, as it
would argue, rejoin) the Gatt presents an opportunity for achieving just
that.
Urgency
The Gatt's working party on China's membership was established in 1988. But
the Tiananmen Square massacre and the Uruguay round put these discussions
largely on hold. Now a degree of urgency has been injected into the
negotiations, partly because this is an important piece of unfinished
business and partly because China is ensured of becoming a founding member
of the prospective world trade organisation only if the negotiations on Gatt
accession are completed this year. Otherwise, there would have to be new
negotiations over China's accession to the WTO.
China, would like Gatt entry on standard conditions, consisting of tariff
concessions alone. Other Gatt contracting parties want special provisions,
including a selective safeguards clause, a special procedure for review of
the reforms and greater transparency in the policy regime.
Meanwhile, the US is making the grant of most favoured nation treatment,
itself the most fundamental Gatt principle, hostage to improvements in human
rights. Technically, it would be possible to combine Gatt membership with
such bilateral conditions. But they would render membership largely
meaningless, since the US would not be in a secure contractual relationship
with China.
Economic dialogue
There are good reasons, however, for the US to modify its approach.
Withdrawal of MFN treatment would be economically damaging to the US itself.
It would also harm the economic dialogue begun by President Clinton at the
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum in Seattle last November.
Bilateral pressures designed to corner Beijing and force concessions have
been shown not to be the most effective way to secure political change in
China. Gatt, by contrast, offers a less tense but still powerful
multilateral framework for improving China's economic policies in a more
market-oriented direction.
China's membership of the Gatt should therefore be accepted, but subject to
a safeguards regime that could be modulated to the state of economic reform.
This would bring China into what is expected to become one of the most
important bodies in the global economy, as befits the country's size and
potential.
Some will argue that China cannot be a Gatt member in good standing, because
it would be politically impossible to offer equal treatment to imports from
so large a non-market economy. That is an argument not against accession,
but in favour of conditional accession.
The west cannot ignore gross violations of human rights in its relations
with China, or any other country. But its trade relations should focus on
the policies that affect trade. If trade and economic issues move in the
right direction, the politics will follow.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Reforming the welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of the welfare state is one of the most challenging policy issues
facing the world's leading economies. Increases in welfare spending have
been a significant factor in the budget deficits which burden almost all the
24 states in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As
the UK government is learning, failure to control such spending leads
eventually to the political odium that accompanies higher taxes.
Demographic trends mean that reform cannot be long delayed. The number of
people over 65 in OECD countries will almost double by 2050. At the same
time, lower birthrates mean that there will be fewer people of working age.
In 1990, there were five people of working age for each one over 65: in
2050, there will be fewer than three. The rising cost of pensions and
healthcare for the elderly will fall on a shrinking band of people at work.
They are unlikely to find acceptable the increases in taxes needed to pay
the bill.
The techniques being deployed across the developed world to control welfare
costs vary according to national circumstance. But in the FT's series on
welfare state reform around the world, which concludes on the opposite page
today, it has been possible to discern some common themes.
One is a greater emphasis on persuading individuals to make their own
provision. In the UK, persuasion is open, with incentives to take out
personal pension schemes. In other European countries, such as Germany,
state pension benefits have been reduced, encouraging individuals to do more
for themselves. Public welfare spending will inevitably take a larger share
of national income unless individuals can be persuaded to save more for
their retirement.
Part-time work
A second theme is reform of the labour market to increase effective working
life. One way is to encourage more opportunities for part-time work for
older people and those with home responsibilities; this requires looser
regulation. Another is to raise the retirement age so that individuals may
work for as long as they wish, and continue paying taxes longer to support
the welfare state. In the current recession, employers often retire older
workers before pension age to reduce their staff. But demographic pressures
will soon require them to retain their older staff for as long as possible.
Thirdly, user charges will also come to play a greater role in welfare
services, particularly in health. Such charges can foster responsibility
among users by providing an incentive not to waste resources. And as in
President Clinton's health reforms, asking patients to share the cost of
treatment can encourage them to exert downward pressure on charges.
Safety net
In making these sort of reforms, the nature of the welfare state will
inevitably change. No longer will the aim be to support citizens 'from the
cradle to the grave'. Instead, the welfare system will become more of a
safety net which helps those who are unable to provide for themselves. This
withdrawal of the state in favour of individual provision should be seen as
a natural step in societies which are becoming more affluent and consumers
more choosy.
Such a transformation is not easy. It can only happen gradually, since those
currently in work must continue to pay the pensions of those already retired
while building up their own savings. And there is a danger that a more
targetted welfare system creates disincentives to save. Greater compulsion
to save for old age may be required as the state withdraws from universal
pensions.
However, it is in ensuring that the welfare system does not reduce the
efficiency of labour markets that the greatest challenges are faced. There
is an inexorable decline in opportunities for full-time unskilled labour and
a growing demand for part-time and flexible workers. Participation in this
changing labour market can be discouraged if the withdrawal of means-tested
benefits combines with the taxation system to create a poverty trap with
very high effective tax rates.
Finding ways to ensure that this does not happen is not only the key to
avoiding welfare dependency. It is at the heart of the economic success
which is necessary to underpin any form of welfare state.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Evidence for a real recovery at last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commentators on the economic scene have a habit of pointing to in-formation
gaps. But just occasionally it is possible to be more definite. For
instance, it is certain, as far as anything ever is, that the British
economy has at last embarked on a real recovery. By that I mean not merely
positive growth, which we have had since the second quarter of 1992 and of
which the Treasury makes so much, but growth sufficient to take up some of
the slack that developed during the recession.
The fascinating aspect is that it is possible to infer something important
from trends to which we can put only signs and not real numbers. The growth
rate itself - now estimated at 2.1 per cent per annum for non-oil GDP - will
not be known with any confidence for years to come. What we can, however, be
reasonably sure of is that output is rising faster than trend.
There are two main ways of measuring the slack in the economy. One is from
direct survey data. The CBI trends inquiry now shows that capacity
utilisation is not merely a good deal higher than at the bottom of the
recession, but above the average percentage recorded since the survey began
well over 30 years ago.
Survey evidence of capacity covers mainly manufacturing, which is only a
little more than a fifth of the total economy. It is also very likely that
the high utilisation ratio reflects scrapping of capacity and not just the
strength of recovery. So it is best to check with labour market data. Here
we see that the jobless count has surprised nearly all observers by falling
by 226,000 in less than a year. The increase in female part-time jobs does
not explain the whole change. Other data, notably vacancies, suggest that
the labour market has been tightening since the middle of 1993.
For any given state of price expectations, inflationary pressures are
affected both by the amount of slack in the economy and the rate at which
the slack is being absorbed. Core inflation - if we remove both mortgage
interest and tax distortions - is not far from 2 per cent per annum. The
upward trend in sterling is also an anti-inflationary influence. The one
influence for inflation is the rate at which the labour market is
tightening, and unused capacity has been taken up.
But starting from a deep recession, there is not yet a danger here. The
remarkably subdued level of pay settlements indicates that the economy is
still operating beneath the point at which inflation is liable to
accelerate. What prudence does suggest is that the Treasury and the Bank
should leave well alone and not try to stoke up the recovery by interest
rate cuts - which oddly enough seem to have been demanded mostly by the
anti-EC Right among ministers.
Clearly, the present rate of recovery cannot be guaranteed. What are the
main threats? The first and well-advertised one is from the effects of this
year's tax increases, amounting to more than 1 1/4 per cent of GDP. But
fiscal squeezes just as large have in the past failed to slow down recovery
once confidence has returned. It would be quite wrong to offset
contractionary pressures from this source before there is any evidence of
their impact.
The other potentially contractionary influence is an excessive rise in
sterling. Here, however, the alarmists themselves are being over-influenced
by the rate against the D-Mark. They should look at a chart in the CBI's own
January Economic Situation Report, which shows that the great bulk of the
depreciation of sterling since the UK left the ERM has remained intact, if
measured by the comprehensive sterling index. This is better luck than the
government was entitled to expect. Independent evidence such as that
collected by the Bank of International Settlements suggests that sterling is
slightly undervalued.
If a wall of money were to descend on London and sterling threatened to
reach dizzy and unsustainable heights, then it would be right to cut
interest rates, maybe drastically. The anti-European Right might then be
torn between its dislike of exchange rate management and its lately
discovered penchant for depreciation.
If I had to put it all on one of Winston Churchill's postcard-sized
messages, it would be: 'UK economy moving right way. For now. As Asquith
used to say: best wait and see.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time for more circumspection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GEORGE M GEORGIOU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It's a bit late in the day for Joe Rogaly to shed crocodile tears ('It
is a moral issue', January 13). His apparent revulsion at the vulgar
materialism resulting from 14 years of Thatcherism and the concomitant lack
of morality in British politics would have sounded far more convincing had
he taken a more critical attitude towards the Tories throughout the 1980s.
Mr Rogaly is lucky. With the benefit of hindsight he can take the moral high
ground without the loss of his job. However, no amount of preaching will
eradicate the misery of the millions whose misfortune it was to be guinea
pigs in a 14-year experiment in naive laisser faire economics.
I hope Mr Rogaly will not hesitate to use his column to be more circumspect
when the Tories begin expounding their next zealous conversion to whatever
economic religion they discover from books written long, long ago.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different pay deals for Channel train
drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEW ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Due to a misunderstanding, your report, 'Aslef wins 30 per cent pay
rise for Channel train drivers' (January 13) confused two agreements reached
by my union.
Annual salaries of between Pounds 20,500 and Pounds 25,000 have been agreed
for 55 Eurostar drivers working for the BR subsidiary, European Passenger
Services. They will take passengers from Waterloo International through the
Channel Tunnel to Paris and Brussels.
A separate deal has been reached with Railfreight Distribution under which
drivers of freight trains will receive a tunnel allowance of Pounds 90 a
week, double the current driver only allowance, on top of their BR basic
weekly wage of Pounds 210. They will take trains through the tunnel as far
as the terminal in Calais. We anticipate that such drivers will be able to
earn about Pounds 400 a week in total.
Aslef publicised these agreements, which compare with drivers' current
average earnings across British Rail of about Pounds 18,000, to show that we
intend to negotiate the best possible settlements for our members. Last
year's Aslef conference accepted that we may not be able to keep all drivers
on a uniform rate of pay nationwide when we face the possibility of having
to talk to some 41 different train operating companies under the
privatisation plans.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Now some aid for UK science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr E G NISBET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a scientist, I would like to express my thanks to the former
chancellor and to the Bank of England for their sterling support of science
in the former Soviet Union. A significant chunk of their spending to support
the pound last year was, I gather, channelled via the generosity of Mr
George Soros to this purpose. Over the past month or so my colleagues and I
have been deluged with requests from the International Science Foundation to
review research proposals, many excellent, from science groups in the former
Soviet states.
These proposals are typically tightly budgeted requests for modest sums, to
carry out first-rate science. In cost-effectiveness this is probably the
best aid yet given to the former Soviet states. By sustaining the scientific
morale of eastern Europe, it does far more than an opera house of bankers
for reconstruction and development. Perhaps the former chancellor will sing
some more during his ablutions.
The present chancellor might even consider similar aid to UK science. Here,
research is at present mostly carried out by harassed post-doctoral fellows
on short-term contracts and with no prospects.
Those who are lucky enough to have jobs as lecturers and professors are too
busy responding to quality audits, selectivity exercises and other aspects
of the UK's Stalinist regime of accountability and control (something not
suffered by our colleagues in the west). At our college, they closed down
chemistry recently for lack of interest. At an annual salary of Pounds
17,000 for a bright young lecturer, with an Oxbridge first, a doctorate and
post-doctoral experience, or Pounds 30,000 for a high-flying 45-year-old
professor (no cars, no fringe benefits), a slight diversion of the Pounds
23bn motorway money to aid science would go far to aid the UK's recovery. It
is too much to ask for a lane off the M25, but could we at least have a hard
shoulder?

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We refer to Mr Skapinker's article (Business Travel: 'Long day's
journey', January 10) regarding the disruption caused to British Airways'
flight from Heathrow on December 27 1993 and Cyprus Airways' flight from
Heathrow on December 28 1993, as a result of the civil servants' strike in
Cyprus.
This lightening strike occurred on a bank holiday late in the evening and
there was insufficient notice.
Cyprus Airways and British Airways, (which acts as the handling agents of
Cyprus Airways), the two affected airlines flying from London Heathrow to
Cyprus, followed the same policy for their passengers.
Although the strike was outside our control and the airline is not liable,
we would like to apologise to Mr Skapinker and indeed to all of our

when they next fly with us.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The price of a share in the cake / Are structural problems
in the US stock market being obscured?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every business day, at 5pm Eastern Standard Time, a computer in a plain
building in Phoenix, Arizona, goes into action. It does not take long for it
to do its work: within seconds, orders from people who want to buy and sell
shares in US companies have been matched together and deals struck, without
human intervention.
At less than 700,000 shares a day, the two-year-old Arizona Stock Exchange
accounts for a tiny fragment of the volume of trading that passes through
the US stock market. It represents about 0.1 per cent of the combined
turnover of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the
US's screen-based market.
To some in the longer-established exchanges, however, the Arizona Stock
Exchange, and others like it, pose a serious threat to the future of the US
stock market by taking business away from so-called 'primary' markets such
as the NYSE and Nasdaq.
The critics have two complaints about the newcomers. First, some investors'
orders may end up being executed in a market where they do not find the best
price. Second, and worse, fragmentation may weaken the mechanism by which
markets determine the best price for shares: increasingly buyers and sellers
will no longer be coming together in a single forum.
The people who raise these concerns - the NYSE has been among the most vocal
in recent years - do so in part out of self-interest. But such worries
prompted the report last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
government agency which regulates the investment markets.
'Market 2000', the SEC's first broad study of the structure of the US equity
markets for two decades, concluded that there is not much wrong with the way
the markets are currently run. In the process, though, it may have skated
over some of the structural questions worrying participants.
At first sight, there seems to be little wrong with the way the US
stockmarket is operating. The volume of shares traded across the country is
far higher than in the fabled trading frenzy which seized financial markets
in the mid-1980s. On the NYSE, the number of shares traded in 1992 crept
back above the previous, 1987, peak to 52bn; last year it soared to 67bn and
shares worth Dollars 2,250bn changed hands.
The brokers, dealers and trading systems which act as intermediaries to this
activity have reaped the benefits. Whether in the form of trading fees,
dealing spreads (Dollars  1/8 a share is typical) or commissions (big
institutions generally pay six cents a share), their income has been surging
ahead, along with the volume of trading.
Competition has intensified for this business - particularly as technology
has increased opportunities for automating large parts of the share-trading
process. Technology has also blurred the distinction between broker/dealers
and trading systems. Some of the biggest private automated systems are owned
by securities houses - for instance by CS First Boston in New York.
But the argument of the critics is that the competition is threatening the
integrity of the US stock market.
Certainly, some of the methods used by dealers and trading systems to win
business may be at the expense of customers. One way to attract more orders
is to pay the person who brings them to you. Some dealers pay a cent or two
a share to brokers who put business their way (known as 'payment for order
flow'). Another way is to refund part of an institutional investor's
commissions by supplying him with equipment such as Reuters screens or other
services (known in the US as 'soft dollars', and in the UK as 'soft
commissions').
This is big business: soft dollar 'refunds' run at more than Dollars 1bn a
year. As the commission pie keeps getting bigger, more and more people are
trying to cut out a slice.
Such practices raise serious questions about whether inducements interfere
with a broker or institutional investor's duty to get the best deal for
their customers. However the SEC, in its report last week, seemed to
disagree - provided there was full disclosure of the practices being used.
It concluded that the inducements should not be banned. But it is planning
to bring forward new regulations this year to force the release of more
information about such arrangements.
However, automated trading systems, such as the Arizona Stock Exchange, have
other ways of attracting business. They allow buyers and sellers of shares
to deal directly with each other, avoiding the dealer's spread. To the
extent that it has brought down the cost of trading and forced established
markets to improve their services, this has benefited investors. Though the
NYSE is worried about the impact on its business, the SEC concluded that
fledgling new markets should be nurtured with a light regulatory touch and,
if anything, given greater opportunities to compete with the primary
markets.
The SEC has, however, not assuaged a far-reaching fear of established
players in the US stock market: that if the volume of share trading is
divided among an increasing number of arenas, the efficiency of the market
will eventually be undermined. Trading on the NYSE still determines the
price of, say, IBM shares. Other markets take its prices as a reference when
handling trades. But if many of the orders to buy or sell IBM shares never
reach the NYSE, its effectiveness in setting the most appropriate price will
be lessened.
So far, the extent of the fragmentation is limited, though use of private
trading systems is growing fast - the volume of shares traded on them rose
by 60 per cent in 1992 and then doubled again last year. They still account
for only a small fraction of the total: 1.4 per cent of trading in NYSE
stocks last year, and 13 per cent of Nasdaq stocks. The NYSE still handles
79 per cent of the trade in the shares it lists, and customers are generally
happy with the service. 'I like the NYSE - it's a fine auction market and
costs are OK,' says Mr George Pirrone, head trader at mutual funds group
Dreyfus.
At the same time, the NYSE has itself encouraged the fragmentation of
markets. Half of its trading (up from 17 per cent 20 years ago) does not
take place on the exchange's floor at all but is carried out by big
securities firms who match buy and sell orders from their own customers, or
who take big blocks of shares from sellers and parcel them out to other
investors. These trades only nominally 'cross' on the floor of the exchange.
One way to overcome the potential problems of fragmentation as the US stock
market expands, is through linkages. Some electronic links already exist:
the ITS, a link between the US's seven exchanges, Nasdaq and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, handles about four per cent of trading in NYSE
shares.
To reinforce such safeguards, the SEC last week proposed rule changes which
would go some way towards forcing a greater dispersal of information within
the US stock market about possible orders from buyers and sellers of shares.
But while the commission wants to to give the stock market a nudge towards a
more open, competitive trading environment, the tone of its report leaves it
unclear how hard it will push for reform. Changes will, in part, require
amendments to the 'primary' exchanges' own rules. It is not yet evident how
willing they will be to make such adjustments - nor how much pressure the
SEC will try to exert on them to do so.
In expressing a desire not to disturb what it calls the 'carefully
maintained equilibrium' in the markets, the SEC may have avoid antagonising
many of the middlemen who make a living out of trading shares. But the SEC
may have missed an opportunity to establish a framework to cope with the
upheavals in market structure that competition and technological advance -
and perhaps a future downturn in the volume of transactions - will bring.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Star-struck Stockhausen - The Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Music Moving Theatre is a small troupe, formed last year with the blessing
of the composer Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. Their prime mover is the dancing
clarinettist Ian Stuart; their aim is to devise performances of contemporary
music, new or newly adapted, in which the musicians will also be actors and
dancers. Their first exhibit is Stockhausen's Tierkreis, which had its
London premiere at The Place on Thursday.
Tierkreis is a Zodiac cycle of twelve 'melodies', one for each star-sign -
originally composed for music-boxes, as deployed in his stage-piece Musik im
Bauch. (Some readers will remember that work from the Roundhouse, in its
palmy days long ago.) Those 'melodies' were altogether unexpected from
Stockhausen: concise and plain but elegantly built, immediately appealing,
even haunting, and near-tonal to boot. Soon he made other versions of them
for various forces, and MMT has followed his example.
Their version, which goes through the Zodiac clockwise from Aquarius and
ends where it started, is for dancing clarinet, dancing soprano (Francesca
Best) and bearded, firmly seated pianist (Paolo Alvares). In Michael
Rolnick's choreography and designs it breathes the air of a pre-Raphaelite
idyll, with an occasional whiff of the Isadora Duncans and numerous touches
of whimsy. The music holds it all together, and is played and sung with
pretty aplomb - even from the floor, supine or prone, or almost upside-down.
Tweeness threatens intermittently, but no more than in Stockhausen's own
conceptions for solo artists back in the 1970s (stylised mime in Harlequin
costumes and the like). MMT looks entirely faithful to that spirit.
Some viewer-hearers will find that the visual titivations make a charming
foil for the music, which on its own might seem too small and special for
pure concert-performance. Others, perhaps, will want to pelt the performers
with boiled sweets from quite early on, until they have to flee the stage.
I plead critical detachment - but the star-sign 'melodies' do have a curious
magic about them, and at 40-odd minutes Stockhausen's cycle comes nowhere
near outstaying its welcome.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Mayerling - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A cemetery at deadest night; sleeting rain; light glinting on the oilskins
of gravediggers as a coffin is lowered into the ground; a grief-stricken
coachman, a priest and two mourners. Between this mysterious beginning to
Mayerling and the same scene which ends the ballet, lies MacMillan's potent
study of love frustrated, destroyed and destroying. Returned on Friday night
to the Covent Garden repertory, it is the boldest among his full-length
creations. The tragedy is political as well as emotional: MacMillan's
choreography tells us about the Archduke Rudolf's despairs, and through them
we learn of the disintegration of a family and a dynasty.
Friday's performance was scheduled to bring us Zoltan Solymosi as Rudolf and
Leanne Benjamin as Mary Vetsera. Solymosi was injured at the dress
rehearsal, and Adam Cooper was called in to take over a role he first
assumed (in similar circumstances) during the Royal Ballet's European tour
last summer. This unscheduled London debut thus became more than usually
arduous - albeit Cooper was able to perform with Viviana Durante as Mary,
with whom he has danced the role before. It is proper to view his
interpretation as something like a dress-rehearsal under hair-raising
conditions. That Cooper pulled it off at all is remarkable. It would be idle
to pretend that the first scenes were anything but sketchy, yet he grew into
the role, and the last act was proof of his right to the ballet. We saw here
a terrible exhaustion of spirit, a man driven to the limits of emotional
endurance. Pallid, distraught, Cooper made Rudolf a haunted figure, hunted
to death by his own anguish.
Viviana Durante's Mary is a reading whose physical daring suggests the
girl's sensual alertness. Durante shapes the choreography with a fine, true
line, phrasing small scenes with delicacy (the little solo when Countess
Larisch has taken her letter for Rudolf was exquisite), and giving the most
impassioned sequences a broad dynamic sweep. It was also admirably
responsive to Cooper's view of Rudolf. Among the ensemble I thought some
dramatic fences were rushed and technical edges untidy, but Natalie McCann
was very touching as Rudolf's hapless, prim bride, and Fiona Chadwick knows
 -and shows - that Larisch is the only woman to understand Rudolf.
The present run of performances will bring a welcome recording of the ballet
for television, with Irek Mukhamedov and Viviana Durante. The staging now
incorporates slight textual emendations that Sir Kenneth MacMillan was
contemplating at the time of his death just over a year ago. The opening
court dances are edited; the Empress Elizabeth no longer has a solo in the
second act. Most important, the song in the Hofburg scene - cut in an
earlier revival - is restored. It is a crucial moment for Rudolf and the
very core of this extraordinary ballet.

Those disinclined to believe that the Aids circus is driven by research
grants may want to watch Horizon which tells the story of 'Genie'. This
American girl spent the first 13 years of her life in silence, as a prisoner
in one room of her parents' house. When scientists found her there was
competition to use her to prove theories on language (she could hardly
speak) and development. Some of the researchers even fostered her. Then,
when the grant money ran out, Genie was sent to live in an institution,
where she has remained (8.00 BBC2).
Cutting Edge promises a report on the lives of British children who look
after disabled parents yet do not qualify for carers' allowances. In
Glasgow, for instance, a woman suffering from multiple sclerosis is in the
care of her children who are 13, 12 and 11 (9.00 C4).
Completing a Monday night trio of mournful current affairs programmes,
Panorama is the latest to have a go at the electricity-and-cancer story.
This time, instead of the dangers of electro -magnetic fields near pylons,
it is similar perils from sub-stations (9.30 BBC1).

FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Regionals to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise of regional orchestras was one of the outstanding features of the
1980s. At the weekend the London concert-halls played host to a pair of
orchestras, each of which comes from a self-proclaimed 'second city' in its
respective country - the NDR (North German Radio) Symphony Orchestra of
Hamburg and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.
Both for its past and its present, Hamburg lays claim to be the cultural
centre of Germany. The number of publishing houses and record companies
which have their headquarters there testify to the city's importance in the
arts, but its musical life struggles to rival Munich or Berlin (indeed,
Berlin looks ever more dominant). It may well be that the NDR Symphony
Orchestra was aiming for a higher public profile when it appointed John
Eliot Gardiner as principal conductor in 1991.
With Gardiner's arrival there came a recording contract, which has ranged
from Brahms and Dvorak to Britten and Janacek. Unfortunately, his tenure in
Hamburg looks set to end this year, after a brief stay which is rumoured to
have been difficult. It has not, however, been unproductive. At its Royal
Festival Hall concert on Saturday the orchestra played with a combination of
clarity and intelligence that had Gardiner's stamp on it through and
through.
The programme consisted of two major romantic pieces: Rachmaninov's
Symphonic Dances and Mahler's Fourth Symphony. Both are complex orchestral
scores, in which Gardiner set out to make every note count. The razor-sharp
clarity that he gets from a symphony orchestra is remarkable to the point
where the Mahler became a bubbling cauldron of new and unexpected details.
What I missed was sensuality in the Rachmaninov, charm in the Mahler, though
Barbara Bonney was a delightfully bright-eyed soprano soloist in the latter.
While the Hamburg orchestra had been in Birmingham the night before, the
City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra had been in London, making one of its
periodic appearances at the Barbican. Again there was a vocal soloist who
gave a good account of herself, this time the mezzo Ann Murray, who sang
Berlioz's tragic scena La Mort de Cleopatre with a firm grasp of its
potential. A few years ago she would have been overparted in music like
this. Now both the voice and the personality have grown in stature.
Something similar might be said of the orchestra, which was in good form
under Mark Elder, its principal guest conductor. Their performance of
Sibelius's First Symphony also had plenty of character, as Elder dug away at
the rhythms to create climaxes that became nearly obssessive in their drive.
It was very different from Simon Rattle's Sibelius with his orchestra, less
atmosphere, more intensity. The programme noted that Rattle's recording was
on sale upstairs - rather tactlessly, I thought.
Jonathan Lloyd, an English composer in his mid-40s still far too little
known in the wider musical world, has fulfilled a commission from the London
Philharmonic Orchestra in a way that should aid in righting the balance.
Committed Lloyd-followers long ago learned to relish his music above all for
its wit - achieved not through farce, hyperbole or heavily jokey contrast,
but through fresh and sometimes slyly hilarious use of a highly individual
musical language, in which the popular and the recherche are jostled and
blended with genial sleight-of-hand.
Lloyd's Waiting for Gozo, for the London Sinfonietta, and his recent score
for the Hitchcock silent film Blackmail are just two examples of this
'personal' quality at its most quirkily original. Tolerance - the LPO's new
big-orchestra piece, given on Thursday its premiere at the Royal Festival
Hall under Franz Welser-Most - seems to me a captivating third, on an
orchestral scale larger than most of his previous ensemble compositions.
The title is intended to suggest the 'co-operative anarchy' that rules its
scheme, with different groups of orchestral voices constantly snatching the
limelight and then ceding it, and with a continual undercurrent of
contrasted comment - sometimes wrily amiable, sometimes acerbic - from
others. Snatches of Prokofiev-like bustle are tossed into the mixture, later
to be exchanged for Tchaikovskian melodic sumptuousness and cell-like
outbursts of Janacekian fractiousness.
The circus imagery that Lloyd also invokes in his programme note is
particularly to be sensed in the percussion punctuation: ringmaster, as it
were, of an unfolding entertainment made up of many interlocked diversions.
What is actually achieved beneath the amusing variety of sounds and rhythmic
patterns is an unexpectedly substantial 20-minute concerto for orchestra,
one which tests each department in enjoyably taxing ways.
In their first go at Tolerance, Welser-Most and the LPO got round the notes
efficiently enough but only intermittently conveyed the wry good humour in
their connection, and in Lloyd's use of quotation and pastiche. There is
room here for greater interpretative freedom, sharper responsiveness: future
LPO performances, of which I hope there will be a good number, must surely
help these players.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: A bad dream of the Sixties - Union Chapel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom is, apparently, a cult musical in
Australia. That does not necessarily make it awful but somehow explains its
superfluousness. It is like everyone's bad dream of a sixties happening.
For a start it is being presented in a church, the grand and monumental
Union Chapel in Islington. This is supposed to make it daring and
experimental but only ensures an awful acoustic, restricted acting space,
and a slight feeling of unease.
Then it still believes in the sixties myth that rock and roll is the new
religion, and a guitar hero the natural Messiah. Finally it takes to the
witless limit that sixties freedom to debunk everything, to, well, swear in
church.
Daniel Abineri, who with a credit for book, music, lyrics and direction can
be named as the guilty man, has the sweet idea that by making his main
protagonist, Father Maclean, a murderer, rapist, and swindler, his rock
musical is going to frighten the horses. Throw in a Pope who comes on like a
Mafia boss, and Abineri has stood civilisation on its head. With such
naughtiness, who needs characterisation and plot?
Sadly, no one involved in this superficial romp seems to share Abineri's
bravura. The cast are like hapless victims, stuck waiting for the next
musical number. Luckily the songs are rather good, a pastiche of old
fashioned guitar rock so currently out of fashion that it hits you with its
novelty. There is also some under-used video play, but none of those
psychedelic blobs, that excess of incense, which made earlier happenings in
churches so much fun a generation ago.
Craig Ferguson (an alternative comedian of some note) works at being bad as
Father Maclean but soon realises that, with a script trivialised into
rhyming couplets, it is hardly worth the effort. Mark Shaw (singer with the
band Then Jericho) looks butch enough as Johnny, the choir boy selected by
Maclean as the next Pope-star, but he would be more convincing if he
actually played the guitar he cradles on stage. Only Stephen Marcus as a
Pope enters into the tackiness of it all.
If you think the spectacle of a topless nun trying to give the Holy Father a
heart attack as he sits before an altar is a dynamic coup de theatre, go to
Johnny. You also get a tall lady in white suspenders stalking our hero with
a gun; the heavily predictable sight of Father Maclean turning his waters
into wine; and a chorus dressed as school girls. Perhaps it could have been
fun in a more liberated venue; perhaps the church still holds enough power
over mind to reduce Johnny to tasteless posturing. This is really little
more than an exercise in cheap publicity to promote an album of retro rock.

<TEXT>
Before the Great Fire of London in 1666 there were about 100 churches in the
City of London. After the fire Christopher Wren built, or supervised the
rebuilding of, some 53 City churches. A number were demolished before the
First World War and their sites sold to provide funds for new churches in
the expanding London suburbs.
Curiously, it is the Bishops of London who have often been the enemies of
the City churches. In 1919 Bishop Winnington-Ingram appointed a commission
which recommended demolishing some 19 churches; and, despite public protest,
the Church Assembly approved the measure in 1924. Mercifully, it was not
approved by Parliament; the City of London Corporation presented a petition
at the Bar of the House strongly objecting to the destruction of its
churches.
As recently as 1972 the then Bishop of London proposed that nine churches in
the City should immediately be declared redundant. Once again, it was the
City of London that rejected this episcopal advice.
Last Friday another Bishop of London, the Right Reverend David Hope,
introduced the report of a commission he set up in 1992 to settle the fate
of the remaining City Churches. It is a frightening document, the more so
because it is meant to be reassuring and practical.
The bishop has what he calls a 'mission strategy' for London. He asked this
particular commission to consider what current role there is for the City's
churches within this strategy and to look at the 'practical and financial
implications' for the church.
The commission was very small. Its chairman was the judge and Lord of
Appeal, Lord Templeman and the three members were Lady Wilcox, the
Archdeacon of Oxford, and Viscount Churchill who has run the investment side
of the Church of England Board of Finance for many years. The secretary to
the board was a chartered accountant and it has reported to the bishop that,
after receiving a fair amount of evidence it feels that only 12 churches in
the City should remain 'the Active Churches' and the remaining 27 should
become 'the Reserve Churches' - which really means hovering on the brink of
redundancy.
Much of the report is inevitably to do with money and administration. Its
recommendations are all for rationalisation and the ending of the autonomy
so many of the churches and their incumbents in the City now enjoy.
The commission suggested that the City be divided into four parishes and
that a City Dean be appointed to galvanise and organise them. But what
underlies the whole report is a clear belief that the architectural and
cultural fabric of these churches is a a positive nuisance to the Church of
England and should be handed over to, and looked after by, someone else.
If the listed building rules and the heritage lobby were not so strong, I am
in no doubt that this commission would like to have recommended the
demolition of the 27 'reserve churches.' The report says: 'All Reserve
Churches possess religious architectural, historical and cultural values and
associations which make demolition unthinkable. There is however no demand
for the Reserve Churches as parish churches. It would be possible for a
Reserve Church to be locked up and merely maintained wind and water tight .
. .'
The shadow of redundancy hangs over churches of the architectural quality of
St. Mary Abchurch with its glorious shallow dome; St Stephen Walbrook -
Wren's rehearsal in miniature for Saint Paul's; St. Peter Cornhill, with one
of the most complete and wonderful church interiors in the City; and St.
Mary at Hill with its late 17th-century high pews and central dome. Of
course redundancy need not mean deconsecration and new uses can be found for
historic churches, as has happened with varying degrees of success in cities
like Norwich and York.
What is saddening about this kind of bureaucrat's report is that it sees
God's temples only as awkward elements in a management plan. The City's
churches offer intangible benefits of sanctuary and peace as well as
tangible benefits of scale and beauty in a square mile that is
over-developed and often ugly.
The working population of the City numbers about 300,000, about the same as
the population of Venice, where there are around 170 churches. There is a
natural realisation in Italy that churches are a part of life and that they
have inspirational qualities, even if they are seldom formally used.
There is money for the City churches and the City itself is rich enough to
spend Pounds 11m last year on the restoration of its own Mansion House.
Surely the churches can represent more than the current ineptitude of an
established church to organise its affairs. They are a unique collection of
buildings, undervalued both culturally and as working churches. For too long
they have been seen as a burden and not an opportunity.
All around us, especially among the young, there is a growing interest and
concern for the spiritual and aesthetic values these churches represent. It
would be sadly typical of the Anglican church to abandon many of its finest
churches in the capital just as the signs of a spiritual revival are daily
more visible. We need the churches, their beauty and their music and their
ceremonial more than ever; what a moment to propose the virtual extinction
of so many of the City of London's finest creations.
We live in truly philistine times . . .

FT  31 JAN 94 / People: Riverso decides to fly Alitalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eyebrows were raised last March when Renato Riverso, the outgoing chairman
of IBM Europe, accepted a post on the slimmed-down board of Eni, Italy's
state-owned energy and chemicals giant, only to change his mind a couple of
days later, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Few were convinced by Riverso's explanation work commitments prevented him
from taking up the job at Eni, desperately trying to shake off the stigma of
politicised appointees to its senior ranks. At the time, Riverso's
volte-face was attributed to second thoughts about working for a company
which has been deeply tainted in Italy's political corruption scandal.
However, his acceptance last week of the chairmanship of Alitalia, Italy's
troubled state airline, suggests he may have already sniffed something
better was in the wind. Riverso, 60, who is succeeding Michele Principe, due
for retirement, will be flanked by Roberto Schisano, Alitalia's new managing
director.
Both these Italians recruited from the information technology sector have
decades of experience with big multinationals under their belts. Riverso has
been with IBM since 1957, while Schisano, 50, is currently chairman of Texas
Instruments in Europe, the US components and information technology group he
joined in 1971.
Their mission is to bring Alitalia back on course after deepening debts and
heavy losses under Giovanni Bisignani, the 47-year-old executive who took on
the managing director's job in 1989.
Though obviously talented, Bisignani, the former head of international
relations for the IRI holding company which controls Alitalia, had little
managerial experience. He has been found a new berth as chairman of
Tirrenia, the ferry line which is controlled by IRI's Finmare shipping
subsidiary and links peninsular Italy with its offshore islands.
Friends hope seabound crossings will prove easier going than the obvious
turbulence at Alitalia.

FT  31 JAN 94 / People: The unstuffy privatiser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There could be few less probable champions of privatisation than Lajos
Csepi. The new managing director of the Hungarian state holding company AV
RT rose through the ranks of the state apparatus, writes Nicholas Denton in
Budapest.
The 43-year-old's communist-era career culminated as deputy president of the
national price office. The outwardly gray Mr Csepi admits, 'I am a
bureaucrat.'
Not, at first sight, credentials designed to inspire confidence when the AV
RT controls stakes in 162 strategic companies, including utilities,
pharmaceuticals producers, engineering enterprises and commercial banks.
After all, the last thing Hungarian business needs after 40 years of
communism is more bureaucratic management.
But Mr Csepi is full of surprises. For a start, he is about as unstuffy,
frank and self-deprecating as high officials get. And then there is his
passionate commitment to privatisation: 'I have seen for 20-30 years that
public ownership simply doesn't work.'
His belief has, if anything, firmed during since 1990 when he took over as
managing director of the SPA state privatisation agency.
Mr Csepi says of his new charge, the AV RT: 'Privatisation has not so far
been the focus of this organisation. It will be.'
AV RT's original philosophy, when founded in 1992, was to restructure state
companies first, improve their value and only then, perhaps, divest them.
The first two, Hungarian-American, managing directors of the state holding
showed a touching faith in the state's competence.
The irony is that a homegrown apparatchik like Mr Csepi is far more
sceptical about reorganisation and consolidation, the polite words for state
bailouts.
He fears companies will deceive the authorities in order to win larger debt
write-offs.
Mr Csepi remembers that in the old days the prices office would ask
companies for data needed to set prices in their sector. 'They gave us false
information. They made fools of us.' Some things bureaucrats know best.

FT  31 JAN 94 / People: Heading up the barber's creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are changing the top guard at Phillips Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based
oil company which used to be a favourite target of corporate predators in
the mid-1980s. Wayne Allen, 57, takes over in May as chairman and chief
executive, and Jim Mulva, 47, steps into Allen's place as president and
chief operating officer, writes William Hall.
Arkansas-born Allen will be the ninth chairman of a company set up in 1917
by Frank Phillips, a former barber, who decided he could make more money
from drilling for oil than from Phillips Mountain Sage, his baldness cure.
Allen, like current chairman C J Silas, is an engineer who has risen through
the production side of a company which produces over half its output of
200,000 plus barrels a day overseas.
However, Allen is considerably older than Silas was when he took over nine
years ago, which means he will probably hand over to Mulva before the end of
the decade.
Mulva has been Phillips' chief financial officer since 1990 and has been
heavily involved in reducing the mountain of debt that Phillips incurred
when it was fighting off the unwelcome takeover approaches from T Boone
Pickens and Carl Icahn in the mid-1980s. Phillips has cut its debt from over
Dollars 9bn to Dollars 3.5bn and Mulva says the company is now supporting a
similar-sized asset base of Dollars 12bn with around half the employees.
Phillips shares now stand at a substantial premium to net asset value but
Wall Street still needs convincing that Phillips can continue to play in the
big oil league. Analysts believe that Mulva is as good a choice as any to
get this message across.

FT  31 JAN 94 / The Monday Interview: Casinos deal The Donald a fistful of
aces - Two years ago it looked as if he was down and out. Now Donald Trump
is planning a comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Donald Trump is in his headquarters office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower,
a glittering high-rise on New York's Fifth Avenue. Seated on the far side of
one of America's larger executive desks, he has agreed to talk about the the
rise and fall, and rise again, of Donald J. Trump. But time is money, and
his attention span is notoriously short.
Quickly, then, the story so far. Two years ago it looked as though Mr Trump
 -or The Donald, as people call him - might no longer have his desk, his
office, his tower, or any of the rest of the property and casino empire he
built up during the 1980s. Brought to the edge of bankruptcy by a
combination of debt and collapsing asset values, he seemed destined to go
the same way as the Reichmann brothers, Robert Campeau, and other
over-extended victims of the decade of excess.
And yet, he has survived. Helped by the cashflows from his casinos, he has
reorganised or paid off a large part of his debts. His private yacht may
have gone; so has the Trump Shuttle airline (now part of USAir), and a 49
per cent stake in the Plaza Hotel in New York. But the rest of the empire -
the Trump Tower, Trump Parc, Trump Palace and Trump Plaza high-rises in New
York, and the Trump Plaza, Trump's Castle and Trump Taj Mahal casinos in
Atlantic City - is remarkably intact.
Now, at 47, The Donald is making his comeback. Last month he married Marla
Maples, the 30-year-old actress who eight weeks earlier had given birth to
their daughter, Tiffany. Admittedly, the bride's Dollars 2m tiara was
borrowed from a New York jeweller, but the wedding put the Trump name back
in the headlines across the world.
Next, Mr Trump plans to return to the headlines with his business deals. In
a few weeks' time, he hopes to pay off the rest of his personal debt by
floating his Atlantic City casinos on the stock market. He says he is
looking at five or six possible locations for new casinos, or riverboat
casinos, outside Atlantic City. And in New York, he aims to press ahead with
his long-dormant Dollars 3bn project to develop the 75-acre Penn Central
railway yards in Manhattan.
Mr Trump acknowledges that he was in deep trouble at the turn of the decade.
'But it happened to everybody, virtually. The real estate markets were
collapsing throughout the world.' His personal low, he says, came at the
beginning of 1991, when his financial difficulties coincided with the bitter
divorce proceedings that ended his marriage with Ivana Zelnicek.
He also acknowledges that he sacrificed some assets to get himself out of
trouble - but only, he says, unimportant ones. 'A yacht is an easy thing. I
sold the yacht because I never got to use it because I was too busy. I sold
some of the toys, but the big toy, the great toy, is Mar-a-Lago (his
palatial estate in Palm Beach, Florida). I never sold that.'
Times were hard. 'I had a couple of bad years,' says Mr Trump. And the
mauling the media gave him led him to sympathise with others who suffer the
same fate. 'One of the people that I think has gotten a really bad rap -
somebody I know just little bit because he was at my home, Mar-a-Lago - is
Prince Charles, from your country. I think he's a wonderful guy. He's taken
a lot of heat. I think he could get a little better press.'
But on the issue that really matters - the state of the Trump Organisation -
his recurring theme is that the business is stronger than ever. 'The Taj
Mahal (one of the three Atlantic City casinos) has just set an all-time
record - it made a profit of Dollars 135m last year. No casino in history
has ever made that much money.'
While it is true that the casinos are doing well, it is less easy to
determine what The Trump Organisation is worth. In 1992, Business Week, the
US business magazine, calculated that Mr Trump's liabilities exceeded his
assets by Dollars 1.4bn. Mr Trump disputed the figure at the time, and in
any case it is long out of date: but not even The Donald will attempt to put
a value on his business. 'It's a very substantial number,' he says. 'But I
really can't tell you exactly because it's very hard to value what the Taj
Mahal's worth, or what the Trump Plaza's worth, or what the land's worth.'
In one sense, it doesn't much matter: investing in The Trump Organisation
was always an act of faith, and is likely to stay that way. That is how The
Donald says it should be. 'If a person owning bonds in the Taj Mahal didn't
sell their bonds, those bonds would be golden: that investment would be
gold. If they sold them, I can't help them because they weren't loyal. But
the people who were confident in me all came out ahead.'
The hard times taught him a lot about loyalty, he says. Some people he
hadn't much liked turned out to be good friends, and others he trusted let
him down. 'There are a couple of people I trusted who, I'm glad that I
learned, weren't particularly loyal. And now they're coming back to me,
kissing my ass and wanting to get back on the gravy train, and they haven't
got a shot.'
But what drives The Donald to do what he does? A lust for power, or wealth,
or beautiful women? Is it sheer egomania that makes him want to acquire more
and bigger buildings, and put his name on them? Or some displaced desire for
immortality?
'I hate to sound like an overly negative person, but people ask me why I go
forward, and I say it's because I have nothing else to do. Because it's
true. What else am I going to do? Watch television? Read a book? I read
books anyway, but I mean, what else am I going to do? We're here, we're put
on this earth for an average of 72.3 years, and after we've gone, who the
hell knows what happens? And in the meantime, I just like the game.'
The Donald is getting fidgety. Clearly, his attention span has reached its
limit. At some unseen sign, people have started wandering in through the
open door to his office, ready to start the next meeting.
'Come in, Henry,' says The Donald. 'Sit down Henry, just sit down. I'm just
finishing up an interview with the Financial Times. It's going to be a very
negative story, based on the questions. But you know what? Who gives a shit.
I don't even care. One of the things I've learned is that I just don't
care.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Management: MBWA - manage by wandering around - Lew Platt,
chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, offers advice on keeping close to your
employees / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have just completed my first year as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, a
year of escalating competition in our industry and continuous pressure on
our employees to make difficult changes. Sounds familiar?
Because most of our 96,000 employees around the world are struggling with
tumultuous change, I made a decision at the outset to focus my inaugural
communication efforts on employees. Although this left little time for press
interviews or communicating with other important constituents, the first 12
months presented an opportunity to gain employee support that wouldn't be
repeated.
I've been a believer in open, two-way employee communication throughout my
career, and this year reinforced that belief.
Employee communication seems to be a fad that comes and goes in many
companies. At HP, though, it is a sustained effort; in fact, it is ingrained
in our company culture.
There are some simple practices that have worked well at HP for more than 50
years. They are so simple that they're often rejected or overlooked. They
were put in place by our company founders - Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard -
when they started the business and I'm fortunate to have inherited this
legacy from them.
The first rule is to trust and respect all employees. We approach each
situation with the understanding that people want to do a good job and will
do so given proper tools and support. This is one of the values that
underlie our corporate objectives. It's evident in our lack of time clocks.
Employees are trusted to keep track of their own hours. It is also evident
in our placing decision-making at the lowest possible level, where
invariably the best decisions are made.
Second, create an atmosphere of open communication and let it permeate the
culture. At HP, we have an informal atmosphere where everyone is on
first-name terms, regardless of rank or job.
We also have a number of mechanisms to encourage people to talk to each
other, including: an environment where there are no doors; regular employee
communication sessions in which managers update employees on the state of
the business; communication lunches where employees can share ideas and
identify problems in a two-way exchange with management; and coffee pots
located around the company where people can gather for informal
conversations. We also encourage MBWA - managing by wandering around - which
gets managers in touch with people.
Third, establish an 'open door' policy. At HP, any door is literally open to
an employee with a problem, a complaint or a suggestion. The practice has
been extended successfully to our electronic mail system and I get dozens of
letters each week from employees, as do managers throughout the company.
This practice has worked as well as any formal employee suggestion programme
I've ever heard of, and it's much less costly.
I spent much of my first year as chief executive travelling to HP sites
around the world.
It is amazing how these principles work as well in India and China as in the
UK and the US. At every site, I've made a point of having a communication
session with employees. These have been invaluable for reinforcing my key
objectives and learning what's on people's minds.
This is not just the job of the chief executive. People expect the entire
management team to live by these values and not just talk about them. Every
HP manager is accountable for communication on his or her performance
evaluation. Our employee survey, conducted at each site every 12 to 18
months, is one of the best measures of how well managers are performing in
this regard.
None of these practices is new. There is no magic about them. But they are
time-tested, and they are the primary reasons why we have been able to
attract and keep top talent, even in the most difficult times.
This concludes the present series. The FT will shortly be publishing Tips
from the Top as a single booklet. Fax John White on 071-873-3072 for further
information.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): California
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Flights to Los Angeles were not affected by one of the strongest aftershocks
the city has suffered since the massive earthquake ten days ago.
The Saturday morning aftershock measured 5.0 on the Richter scale. For many
families it was the first night that they had ventured back in to their
damaged apartments.
California's reputation with the Japanese took a further blow last week
after state governor Pete Wilson was forced to apologise to 22 Japanese
executives who were robbed at gunpoint on a tour bus hijacked by two men
after a visit to a factory.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Greece snowbound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While airports on the east coast of the US are back to normal despite
continuing cold weather, Greece's transport system was heavily disrupted
over the weekend by a cold snap. The bad weather caused extensive power cuts
and flooded Athens streets as temperatures sank to their lowest level this
year and snow blanketed much of the country.
In Athens temperatures went down to minus 3'C (26'F) over the weekend and
authorities advised people to stay indoors. Few tourists and cars ventured
onto the usually busy streets. Sea travel to all islands was suspended.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air France is spending Dollars 930,000 to spruce up the interiors of five of
its seven Concordes.
The US Supreme Court last week backed US airports in their long running
dispute with airlines over fees for using runways and airport facilities.
The court ruled that airports were free to charge fees they decided were
reasonable.
USAir and British Airways are taking practical steps to consolidate their
alliances in the US. The US airline, which is British Airways' partner in
North America, plans to move its services at New York's Kennedy Airport to
BA's own terminal to improve connections with BA's eight daily
trans-Atlantic flights.
British Airways flights to Poland are still disrupted by a dispute with
Polish Airlines over landing rights at Heathrow. Travellers on BA flights to
Warsaw are flying to Frankfurt and then travelling onto the Polish capital
by bus.
Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines, plan to add 12 international
destinations to their routes this year, including Washington, Seattle,
Beijing, Brussels and Khabarovsk.
India is planning to change regulations to permit its state-owned domestic
and international airlines to become publicly held companies, according to
Indian newspaper reports.
They said the government issued a special ordinance scrapping a 1953
parliamentary act that nationalised air services in the country and did not
allow private airlines.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Management: Wealth eludes the salaryman - Western managers
are under attack for being greedy. It's a different story in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, acquired a small,
ready-built house, of what might be considered modest proportions, in the
outskirts of Tokyo.
A photograph of Kume's dream home, sitting on an undistinguished plot of
land, shocked the Japanese public when it appeared in a popular magazine.
Expensive as Japanese land prices might be, Kume's residence, located in a
distinctly middle-class residential area, was not what might have been
expected to be fit for the chairman of Japan's second-largest auto maker.
Executives of Japan's large and famous companies may enjoy prestige and a
high profile on the international stage, but wealth is usually not one of
the benefits that comes with their office.
Like Kume, many Japanese executives live in residences which would be
considered humble by western standards. And unless they are self-made
millionaires, or have inherited wealth, their personal fortune is likely to
be so insignificant that it would make American and European executives
blush at the comparison.
According to a survey last year by the Seikei Kenkyu-jo, a private research
organisation, the average annual income including bonuses of the presidents
of 46 companies listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
Y37.25m (Pounds 223,000).
Although this is about 10.5 times the average pay of first-year salarymen,
according to the Seikei Kenkyu-jo, it is a paltry sum compared with the
millions of dollars paid in remuneration to the executives of America's top
corporations.
The exception to that general rule is the executive who is the company
founder or belongs to the founding family, owns a large number of shares in
the company or enjoys an unchallenged position at the top for similar
reasons.
Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who inherited the Seibu Railway empire from his father
and was estimated by Forbes to be worth at least Dollars 10bn in 1992, and
Akio Morita, of Sony fame, who built up his radio business into one of the
biggest names in consumer electronics, are two examples.
But for most so-called 'salaryman managers', who are employed by public
companies, such wealth is the stuff of dreams.
One reason for the low level of executives' remuneration is that unlike
western companies, Japanese businesses which use a seniority-based
employment system do not make as much of a distinction between ordinary
employees and those with executive status.
'In Japan, the executive's job is seen as an extension of the work of other
employees, so it is considered inappropriate to create a huge gap between
executives' and other employees' pay,' explains Sadao Ohta, director of
Seikei Kenkyu-jo.
Nor do Japanese companies offer benefits to executives on the basis of
performance, such as in the form of preferred shares or stock options which
are commonly used in the west. Stock options have made many a businessman in
the west quite wealthy. But in Japan, where companies cannot buy their own
shares, no such system exists.
Even if it did, the Japanese view that a company's performance is the sum of
employees' work would prohibit rewarding executives alone for good business
results.
'Japanese companies take a long-term view of business performance which is
considered the outcome of measures taken over many years rather than the
result of one man's hard work,' says Ohta.
At the same time, the Japanese company executive is expected to set a good
example for other employees. Extravagance in any form is likely to be
frowned upon and would trigger criticism at the first signs of a business
downturn or unhappiness among employees.
So while many would sympathise with Kume, his self-restraint, according to
one industry official, 'is a model for the Japanese salaryman.'
That role of the company executive, as a mirror for other employees, has
been in particular evidence during the country's present economic downturn.
When business is low it is common practice in Japan for companies to cut
executive bonuses and pay first.
So while Japanese salarymen face the prospect this year of a freeze on pay,
many Japanese executives have already taken cuts in their bonuses, while
basic pay is also down for those at some companies.
Executives at Toyota, for example, have had their remuneration cut by 30 per
cent since the summer of 1992 while those at Nippon Steel have been living
with on average 10 per cent less of their pay since October of that year. To
add to their financial woes, Japanese executives are still expected to
attend countless weddings, funerals and other social events, and make cash
gifts befitting their high social status.
However, there are some remuneration compensations. The Japanese executive
does generally enjoy round-the-clock use of the company car and his own
chauffeur, as well as membership of the most exclusive golf clubs, an
entertainment allowance that is almost unlimited and other perks. Some
companies even have luxurious housing arrangements for their president.
As a result of such benefits, it is difficult to strictly compare the
remuneration of Japanese and western executives, says Koji Aoyagi, a
consultant at Wyatt-Seikei, the consulting firm. With Japanese companies, it
is hard to draw a clear line between perks that exist to benefit the
executive and those which are provided in the interests of business, Aoyagi
points out.
What is clear, though, is that such benefits only last as long as the
executive retains his position at the company. For the retired Japanese
executive, the exclusive golf club he has come to know so well often becomes
a distant memory.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Not yet a pretty sight, but safe - Beirut
is again a place to do business. Mark Nicholson offers some tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These days only the deeply skittish are scared of doing business in Beirut.
Unless, of course, you include the fear of being hoodwinked or outwitted in
what, since Phoenician days, has been one of the Mediterranean's sharpest
trading cities.
Now that Lebanon has settled into peace after its bloody civil war, trade is
picking up. The UK last week renewed export insurance cover to Lebanon for
the first time since 1977. At the same time Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri was in London selling the country's Dollars 10bn reconstruction
plans. The French and Italian governments are also taking a positive view of
Lebanese prospects.
Post-civil war Beirut is not the prettiest place to do business - though the
blocks of hollowed and lacerated buildings are morbidly fascinating. Neither
is it the most efficient. The telephone system can sometimes leave you
yearning nostalgically for the Phoenicians' pigeon post, and some trips
across town at rush hour are best undertaken in the company of a fat novel
and a mask to filter the petrol fumes. But it is safe enough.
There has been no shooting or shelling since 1990, and there is no longer
any hostage-taking. But visitors ought not to tempt providence. Roaming
around the Hizbollah enclave of Beirut's southern suburbs, for instance,
would excite suspicion, while jogging its streets in a stars-and-stripes
sweatshirt would not be a good idea.
There is no cause to be too nervous of men in fatigues with guns, who are
everywhere, along with the odd armoured car or tank. Lebanese and Syrian
army checkpoints are also common, though usually offer no impediment.
However, soldiers in Beirut do not like being photographed. And you should
carry a passport, particularly at night or when leaving the city.
Getting around Beirut is fairly straightforward. Battered Mercedes cabs are
easy to find in the centre and short hops cost only a dollar or two (just
about everything in Beirut can be paid for in dollars; taxis, restaurants
and many shops will quote you dollar prices first).
Most drivers speak some English and know their way around. But get the
directions clear, or ask the hotel to write them down. For a series of
morning meetings, cabs can be hired from the hotels. Rates, which can be
exorbitant, are directly related to your ability to bargain - a pricing
principle that applies to most transactions. A common charge is about
Dollars 35 for a morning. Grabbing a cab on the street is always cheapest,
but if you are going far from the centre, ask the driver to wait.
Getting to Beirut is also becoming easier - aircraft arrivals were up 26 per
cent in the third quarter of last year and are rising. The airport is simple
but effective, and historians will enjoy the sight of Middle East Airlines'
fleet, which still includes a few doughty 707s. In most airports in the
developing world, the degree of delay, intrusiveness, bloody-mindedness and
bureaucracy at the airport is often a good indicator of things to come.
Beirut scores suitably high on the no-nonsense scale.
Once there, despite the obliteration of Beirut's more upmarket hotels during
the war, accommodation is comfortable if not always lavish. The seafront
Summerland and Coral Beach Hotels are reckoned to be the city's most plush,
and cost from Dollars 150 a night.
In and around Hamra Street in west Beirut, the Bristol and slightly cheaper
Cavalier and Mayflower Hotels offer good rooms and excellent service. And,
at the Bristol and Cavalier at least, there are direct-dial, international
phone lines, at about Dollars 7 a minute to the UK.
Telephone calls are Beirut's chief headache. The old rotary exchanges are
hopelessly inefficient and will stay so until 500,000 contracted new lines
are installed over the next year or so. Reaching an outside line from a
hotel can, on occasion, take about half an hour. Dialling some 'difficult
numbers' in different areas of the city is often only an exercise in finger
abuse. Many Beirutis, therefore, have portable phones that use US networks,
which means dialling through New York to speak to someone across town. Such
calls must be among the most crackly per dollar/minute in the world.
To cheer yourself up after a frustrating phone call, you could visit one of
Beirut's restaurants. Lebanese food is, as the locals will keep reminding
you, the best in the region. Traditional mezze dishes, such as hummous,
babaganoush and tabouleh, are generally freshly prepared. Seafood is
excellent. Locals consider Nasr, Yildizlar, el Pasha and Istambouli among
the best places to eat. There are several good Italian restaurants,
including the Spaghetteria, and French ones, such as Retro and the Vieux
Quartier, which is arguably Beirut's best and certainly its most pricey.
Lunch is a pre-eminent business institution. Forget about bringing
prospective business partners gifts: offer them a two-hour lunch a la
francais and, while being sensitive to your associates' religion, wash it
down with a little of Lebanon's respectable wine.
Otherwise, there are few rules of business engagement in Beirut that do not
apply elsewhere. The city's business community is more cosmopolitan than any
other in the Middle East though, as elsewhere in the region, personal
contact and trust are at a premium.
Most business people speak good English, but the years of French rule have
also left an enduring legacy, especially among Beirut's Christians. As for
'baksheesh', Lebanese businessmen are far too sophisticated for any such
crude transactions, which is not the same as saying 'commissions' will not
be required at some point.
For your non-working hours, there is a wider selection of extra-curricular
activities than in almost any other Arab capital. These range from casual
jazz bars, such as the Blue Note in Ras Beirut and the Soho-style Scoozi's
bar-restaurant in Verdun, to the nightclubs of Jounieh, 45 minutes' drive
north. Cinemas play newly released, and uncensored western movies.
The old souk has been shelled out of existence, and is a focus of Lebanon's
ambitious rebuilding plans. But there are plenty of chic western-style
shops, with commensurately high prices.
As for sport, there is that old Lebanese chestnut about being able to ski in
the morning and swim in the afternoon. The determined visitor can indeed do
so for part of the year: either on ski-threateningly thin snow, or in
life-threateningly cold water, or probably both. Executives who consider
this a vital part of their trip might more comfortably try Vancouver.
There are, however, both beaches and ski resorts less than an hour's drive
from Beirut which are pleasant enough to enjoy on their own at the suitable
time of year. Swimmers should be aware, however, that Lebanon's
laisser-faire waste-disposal policies are thought by some to have led to
nuclear waste being ejected into the sea.
There are few other hazards confronting business visitors to Beirut. The
comforts of the city - which Life magazine described in 1966 as 'Las
Vegas-Riviera-St Moritz flavoured with spices of Araby' - are being
restored. It will be at least two or three years, however, before the
government's redevelopment plans create the nucleus of a banking and
financial centre, and perhaps 20 years before the current artists'
impressions materialise into a shiny new Mediterranean city.
All that, of course, also depends on a broader Middle East peace settlement.
But Lebanese businesses, at least, are trying not to let the vagaries of
that hold them back.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Careers review for forces ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Career structures, pay and conditions for Britain's 270,000 armed forces
personnel are to be subject to a top-to-bottom independent review, it
emerged yesterday.
The review will examine all aspects of service employment including pay and
allowances such as private school fees, local overseas and lodging
allowances, length of service, promotion, manpower numbers and ranks.
The review threatens to exacerbate the damage caused to forces' morale by
personnel cuts and continuing pressure on funding and new equipment.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has ordered the review as part of a
drive to cut defence costs. Public expenditure cuts agreed between the
Ministry of Defence and the Treasury last November have forced the MoD to
lower its medium-term spending plans by about Pounds 750m a year.
The career and pay review is, however, independent from the MoD's 'defence
costs study' into efficiency improvements, which was launched in the
aftermath of the November Budget.
A review team is due to begin work in the spring, headed by an independent
chairman. It is expected to have between three and five other independent
members.
The exercise, the first of its kind for many years, is comparable to the
Sheehey review into police career structures. But defence officials said the
armed forces study would be more complex in view of the services' worldwide
role.
'This is to take account of changes in military commitments and deployment
patterns and to ensure that the career management and remuneration of the
armed forces are appropriate to the early part of the 21st century,' the MoD
said.
No deadline has been set for completion of the review, and the members of
the team have still to be named.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Television adverts for children defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ban on television advertisements during children's programmes would be an
'unwarranted curtailment of freedom' as well as removing funding for such
programmes, a report warns today
The study was commissioned by the Advertising Association and conducted by
Professor Patrick Barwise of the London Business School. It was commissioned
after a call last year from the National Food Alliance for the government to
consider an advertising ban during children's television.
The alliance - a research and lobbying group supported by, among others, the
British Dental Association, trade unions, the Institute of Child Health, and
the National Farmers' Union - said it was concerned about the effect of TV
advertisements on children's diet.
The alliance said advertisements for children were dominated by sugary and
fatty foods, such as pre-sweetened cereals, confectionery, fast foods and
soft drinks 'which neither encourage healthy choices nor promote a varied
and healthy diet'.
Prof Barwise's report accuses the alliance of publishing a 'poorly
researched and one-sided' document. He rejects its claim that advertising is
a strong influence on children's consumption of particular types of food and
drink. 'What advertisers try to do is encourage people to choose their
brand. This has little or no effect on total category sales.'
Ms Sue Dibb, author of the alliance's report, said of the Advertising
Association's study: 'I've heard the arguments many times before - they tend
to be trotted out when the advertisers are under attack.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Corporation cut may prove cruellest: In the second of a
series on the tax base, Philip Coggan considers a fierce debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's financial position has sharply deteriorated this decade,
with the public sector moving from surplus to the Pounds 50bn deficit
expected for this financial year.
April's tax increases, which will have a substantial effect on consumers'
pay packets, are designed to restore the health of the public purse.
Economic recession has been the main cause of the problem, with unemployment
causing a rise in social-security spending and a fall in tax revenues. But
there is also a debate as to whether government actions have weakened the
tax base and created a structural deficit on top of the cyclical effect.
One key issue is whether events in the mid-1980s had effects on corporation
tax receipts which are still working through the system. The debate was
outlined by Mr Bill Robinson, a former adviser to the last chancellor, Mr
Norman Lamont, in a series of FT articles last summer.
His argument was that the 1986 oil-price fall caused a sharp drop in
petroleum tax revenues. This was temporarily disguised by a surge in
corporation tax receipts, which had two causes.
The first was the vigorous expansion of the economy in 1986-88. The second
was former chancellor Lord Lawson's reforms in 1984, which reduced
corporation tax rates from 52 per cent to 35 per cent over time but severely
cut the tax shelter provided by the capital allowances.
According to the Treasury bulletin, published in the summer of 1992, these
two factors meant that 'growth in corporation tax receipts accounted for
something like one-third of the swing in the public finances from deficit to
surplus between 1984-85 and 1988-89. At its peak in 1990, corporation tax
contributed about 11 per cent of total tax and National Insurance receipts'.
These buoyant revenues may have made the government over-confident and led
to the tax cuts in the 1988 Budget. But then came the recession.
The Treasury bulletin stated: 'Changes to capital allowances and loss offset
provisions, and the abolition of stock relief, have made (corporation tax)
receipts more sensitive to the cycle over the long term.'
Corporation tax revenues have dropped from Pounds 21.5bn in 1989-90 to the
official forecast of Pounds 14.7bn for this financial year. Mr Robinson
believes this decline laid bare the weakness resulting from the oil-price
decline and the income tax cuts of 1988.
The point is far from universally accepted. Lord Lawson describes the
argument as 'complete nonsense from beginning to end'. He says the
government was well aware of the effect of falling oil taxes and had planned
accordingly.
Lord Lawson says the main cause of the government's financial difficulties
is the surge in public spending in the early 1990s - to be fair, this is
also a main part of Mr Robinson's argument. On the tax side, Lord Lawson
points to two factors. He says the 1980s saw a tendency for profits to
increase as a percentage of GDP (in part a reaction to the 1970s era of low
profits). GDP was also growing strongly. The recession therefore caused a
sharp fall in tax receipts but he believes this cyclical effect will work
for the government as the economy recovers.
There is support for Lord Lawson's arguments. In its green budget, published
last year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies analysed the ratio of corporation
tax liabilities to company profits, which declined from a peak of more than
50 per cent in 1990-91 to about 47 per cent in 1992-93. The institute,
however, said: 'This is not a dramatic decline, and tax remains higher
relative to profits than in the early 1980s. There is certainly no
indication that revenues will not recover with profits.'
Even the Treasury has admitted, albeit in mandarin-speak, that it took its
eye off the public-spending ball in the late 1980s. In its summer 1993
bulletin it said: 'Spending accelerated uniformly across programmes from
1988-89 with GGE (general government expenditure) rising by over 3 per cent
a year. The rise in GGE was partly cyclical and this element can be expected
to reverse as the economic recovery gathers pace. But there were also
structural or underlying increases reflecting rising expectations and demand
for public services.'
Mr Robinson agrees that excessive growth in public spending helped cause the
deterioration in the government's finances. Looking at the changes in the
government's financing plans between 1990 and 1993, he argues that, if one
excludes the effects of the recession, the government spent Pounds 19bn more
than expected. But he also points out that its revenues were Pounds 13bn
less than forecast.
Time alone will settle the argument. If as the economy recovers tax revenues
fail to pick up by as much as expected, the government will have to
re-examine its 1980s reforms.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Eurofighter set for maiden flight by May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial partners in the Pounds 32bn Eurofighter project are confident
that the four-nation aircraft will make its maiden flight by the end of
April - more than two years later than originally planned.
The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium said no date had been fixed for the
flight, which was postponed last autumn because of difficulties with the
jet's computerised flight-control system. But the aircraft was in its 'last
test phase'.
The first prototype of the twin-engine Eurofighter 2000, being developed
jointly by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, is due for trials at Manching
in Germany in the next few weeks. An initial private flight is expected at
Manching in March or April before it appears in public. Mr Jonathan Aitken,
defence procurement minister, has told the Commons that the fighter might be
on display at September's Farnborough air show.
Although the industry consortium has played down the importance of the first
flight in the overall development programme, senior managers are extremely
anxious to avoid further delay, fearing it could undermine political support
for the Eurofighter and jeopardise production prospects.
British Aerospace, the principal UK partner, has meanwhile agreed to take
joint responsibility for the flight-control system with Deutsche Aerospace,
which has headed this part of the project. The new arrangement is designed
to make the two directly answerable to the partner governments and put
pressure on them and their sub-contractors - notably GEC-Marconi which is
supplying the crucial software - to meet their contract dates.
The partners decided to hold further tests on the system after crashes of
both the Swedish Gripen and the US F-22, which also depend on sophisticated
flight-control technology.
The consortium is still in talks with government representatives over a new
contract price for the roughly Pounds 10bn development programme. This
follows changes to the programme agreed in late 1992 which were designed to
reduce the eventual production cost.
The companies are seeking price increases to reflect the longer development
period now planned. On the other hand, the governments hold the consortium
responsible for delays caused by technical hitches.
The Ministry of Defence would have to seek Treasury approval for any
increase in Britain's share of the cost.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Redundancy fears decline sharply in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of redundancy and becoming unemployed fell sharply in January, the
latest monthly survey from MORI, commissioned by the Financial Times and
Industrial Relations Services, shows today.
The proportion of workers who said they were 'very' or 'fairly' concerned
about the prospect of losing their job during the next 12 months fell 7
percentage points to 44 per cent from 51 per cent in December.
This represents the largest monthly fall in employee concern over job
security since the FT/MORI survey began last April.
It suggests there is growing optimism among those in work about the labour
market outlook 11 months after Britain's official, seasonally adjusted
registered unemployment began to decline.
Mrs Lilian Bennett, chief executive of employment agency Manpower UK, said
yesterday: 'Our own findings suggest a marked improvement in employee
self-confidence about the future.'
Mrs Hilary Skarratt, head of marketing at Alfred Marks, the recruitment
consultants, said there had been a 'significant' increase in the numbers of
employed people looking for new jobs. 'This indicates people are becoming
less anxious about their prospects,' she added.
This month's drop in the poll findings reverses the upward if volatile trend
that began last October, but the proportion of employees anxious about their
job security still remains high. It was lower last September at 43 per cent.
While 24 per cent of workers were 'very' concerned this month about the
chances of becoming unemployed compared with 28 per cent in December, 20 per
cent were 'fairly concerned', down from 23 per cent in the previous month.
The most significant trend in the survey was among those aged 35 to 54 who
are in employment. Here there was an 11 percentage-point drop in those
concerned about their job security to 43 per cent from 54 per cent in
December.
There was also a noticeable 10-point decline to 47 per cent in concern among
unskilled and semi-skilled manual workers in social classes DE.
By contrast, the proportion of employees in social classes AB concerned
about job security fell by only 5 points this month to 35 per cent.
Workers in the north and the Midlands are much less concerned than those
employed in southern England. There was a 9-point drop in concern in the
north to 43 per cent, and an 8-point decline in the Midlands to 41 per cent.
Anxiety has fallen in the south, but it still remains higher there at 47 per
cent compared with 52 per cent in December.
The MORI survey was based on interviews with 1,045 adults aged 18 and over,
who work both full and part-time, across 146 constituency sampling points
throughout Great Britain weighted to match the profile of the population.
Interviews took place between January 20 and 24.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Food discounters grow swiftly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discounters made up the fastest-growing sector of the retail food trade last
year with a 22 per cent increase in total floorspace, says Verdict, the
retail research group, in its annual report on food discounting published
today.
The Verdict document is one of two reports published today which predict
that UK retailers face the twin threats of a discount revolution and an
invasion by powerful US retailers.
Verdict says discounters - low-cost, low-margin operators which aim to offer
the lowest possible prices - generated sales of Pounds 4.8bn in 1993.
This gave them 9.8 per cent of the grocery market, up from 8.8 per cent the
year before.
The report forecasts that by 1997, food discounters will have turnover of
Pounds 8.4bn and a 14.2 per cent share.
Corporate Intelligence, the retail research group, says the UK and
continental Europe face an invasion of a 'new wave' of US retailers, many of
them price-led oper-ators.
These range from small retailers to the very biggest, including Kmart, which
has already opened in the Czech Republic, and Wal-Mart, the world's largest
retailer with sales last year of Dollars 55.5bn (Pounds 37bn).
Corporate Intelligence says that companies known to be interested or
believed to be coming to Europe soon are fashion retailers Liz Claiborne,
Ann Taylor, Leslie Fay and The Limited, DIY chain Home Depot, and general
discounter Wal-Mart.
The report says many are likely to use the UK as a launchpad to expand into
the rest of Europe.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Ministers plan tactical retreats: Tory whip says measure to
hit student-union spending power is a 'dead duck'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officials in Westminster and Whitehall said yesterday that the
government was preparing a number of tactical retreats rather than risk
defeat by its own party.
Plans by Mr John Patten, education secretary, to end the student union
closed shop and give the government a greater say in deciding how unions
spend their funds were described by one government whip as a 'dead duck'.
He predicted that the education bill would be altered to win over Tory
opponents in both houses.
Mr Robert Jackson, a former education minister, said: 'John Patten has to
recognise that there is strong opposition to his plans from Conservatives
who stand by the traditional Conservative view which rejects the analysis
that student unions are the same as trade unions. The minister's impulse to
take power, in effect overturning the status of universities, is quite
unacceptable.'
Mr Patten's retreat comes as Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, prepares
to back down over his plans to overhaul the structure of the police in the
hope of defusing opposition in the Lords.
Whitehall officials believe that Mr Howard is ready to drop the proposal
that the home secretary appoint the chairman of each police authority.
He yesterday made an impassioned plea to troubled Tories to 'keep cool
heads, calm nerves and a sense of perspective - and then we can see things
going our way'.
But a further government retreat may be necessary as it emerged that many
Conservative MPs are opposed to plans to replace the dual structure of
English local government by a single tier of all-purpose councils.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, denied that the party was
failing to deliver strong government.
He said: 'In terms of performance, the government is delivering. What I also
think you have got is a strong prime minister, and a prime minister who is
leading, and will lead us through. The party stands behind the government
and it stands behind John Major, and what you will see over the coming
months is the recovery of the economy and the recovery of the political
position and the political fortunes of the government'.
Lord Archer, who has offered himself as party chairman, called on
Conservatives at all levels to 'stop squabbling among themselves'. He added:
'We have become not only the best government, we are also the best
opposition.'
However, Lord Tebbit said the prime minister and his colleagues 'must carry
a major part of the blame' for their situation. They had made 'some serious
errors' but had also worked against a difficult background. 'One of their
key problems is tax.'
Lord Tebbit told London Weekend Television's Walden programme that there had
been some 'very poor staff work' by the government, and that had been very
damaging.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Labour defends decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is to avoid making manifesto commitments in order to foil Tory hopes
of exploiting public-spending pledges. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary,
yesterday defended his party's decision not to make promises it could not
keep.
He admitted the decision against making spending pledges was a 'tough
strategy' and one which left the party open to some 'difficult questions'.
But he insisted: 'We are not in the position now to start writing the
manifesto. We are a party that is a government-in-waiting now, and we have
got to act like that, and we have got to put things honestly before people.'
His comments on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme came after Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, last week faced calls for a 'return to clear
socialist commitments' after his order to avoid spending pledges.
Thirty-four Labour MPs, mainly from the left of the party, tabled a Commons
motion challenging Mr Smith's decision to steer clear of commitments which
the party might not be able to honour in government.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Troubled electrical chain continues trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Group, the Glasgow-based electrical retail chain which went into
receivership on Friday night, is to continue trading while receivers follow
up expressions of interest from potential buyers.
The company was defeated by persistent under-capitalisation, poor sales and
a costly expansion programme in England, according to one of the receivers,
Mr Malcolm Shierson of accountants Grant Thornton. Clydesdale claimed to
have the third-largest share of the UK electrical goods retail market, after
Dixons and Comet.
The board of Clydesdale asked a consortium of four banks - Bank of Scotland,
Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and NM Rothschild - to call in receivers
after they refused to provide an emergency funding package of Pounds 4m.
The banks are owed about Pounds 35m, of which nearly half is owed to Royal
Bank. Total debts have not been quantified.
The company had resorted to the banks after attempts to raise money from its
main shareholders, led by Standard Life and Scottish Amicable, had failed.
The joint receivers, Mr Shierson, Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Donald
McGruther, have arranged for the group to continue trading for the time
being. They have secured support from the banks, from Cornhill Insurance -
which will underwrite the product warranties - and from British Midland
airline, which will continue honouring cheap flight vouchers from Clydesdale
customers.
Mr Griffiths said the receivers had already received three expressions of
interest from large organisations and expected to receive more. The
receivers intended to sell the group as a whole. It is likely to appeal to
electricity companies anxious to expand their retail network.
Clydesdale, which employs about 1,500 people, has about 100 high street
stores in Scotland and 20 out-of-town stores in England. In the year to
March 31 1993 it had sales of Pounds 141m on which it made an operating
profit of Pounds 5.6m.
Last June it abandoned a flotation after an audit by Arthur Andersen
revealed that stock had been overvalued. Mr Jim Boyd, finance director, left
the company.
The failure of the flotation, which would have raised Pounds 30m, meant that
the group's problems of under-capitalisation intensified. The expansion
programme had been based on the assumption that the recession was ending and
that the flotation would proceed.
Over the weekend Royal Bank of Scotland angrily rejected accusations by Mr
Henk van Eck, Clydesdale's chief executive, that it had blocked the bank
rescue package. It said the members of the syndicate were unanimous in
refusing to advance the Pounds 4m.
Mr van Eck, a company rescue specialist, joined Clydesdale in 1985, taking
51 per cent of the shares.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Stores curb the urge to expand: Neil Buckley and Vanessa
Houlder examine the end of a building spree by the supermarket groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Decisions by the UK's three largest supermarket groups to write down land
and building costs and trim their opening programmes signal an end to the
store-building free-for-all of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The pace in future will be less frenetic and the prices paid for land less
astronomic. The retail scene has changed markedly from 1991 when the big
three were spending up to Pounds 2.5bn a year between them on expansion, and
were prepared to pay huge premiums to secure prime sites.
Since then, increasing price competition and market saturation has sparked
fears in the City that superstore groups would be unable to sustain their
margins and returns on capital. Those fears - coupled with the slump in the
property market - led to increasing pressure on store chains to rein back
expansion and depreciate buildings and land.
Asda, the UK's fourth-largest grocer, halted its expansion programme 18
months ago and wrote down its property and fixed assets by Pounds 319m. Yet
it took until last month before Argyll, the UK's number three, announced it
would depreciate buildings at 2.5 per cent a year, and cut capital spending
from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m this year.
Two weeks ago Tesco followed suit with a similar depreciation policy for
buildings, as well as a decision to write down the 'premiums' it had paid
for its land - the difference between the price paid and the alternative use
value - over 25 years. With the latter charge put at Pounds 32m this year,
there was an implicit admission that the group had overpaid, by a massive
Pounds 800m, on its land.
Tesco also made an Pounds 85m write-down on land it had decided to sell
rather than use for new stores. It said it would cut capital spending from
Pounds 750m this year to Pounds 450m-Pounds 500m in 1996-97, and its
store-expansion programme from 31 to 20 over the same period, with the
emphasis shifting to smaller superstores and its new Metro city-centre
format.
Finally last Friday, J. Sainsbury said it would depreciate stores at the
slower rate of 2 per cent a year, and make a one-off write-down of the
Pounds 365m it had overpaid for land. Some Pounds 60m of that charge
referred to surplus land which it, too, had decided to sell.
It said it would continue to open 20 grocery superstores a year for four
years, but beyond that the pace might slow.
Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'The biggest
thing about all these announcements is that they recognise the fact that
superstores don't last for ever.'
They also reflect a decline in the top end of the property market from more
than Pounds 2m an acre in 1991 to between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m an acre
now, according to Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors.
Some agents believe, however, that the decline in prices has come to a halt
as a result of strong demand from other types of out-of-town retailer.
After years when bidding battles between supermarket chains pushed site
prices above the reach of other purchasers, there is now strong competition
for the best sites from operators of retail warehouses. Tenant demand for
warehouses has been buoyant as these large out-of-town stores have appealed
to a growing number of retailers. The warehouses sell goods ranging from
furniture to office supplies.
Another factor that could sustain prices would be a tightening of planning
controls, which would reduce the supply of potential sites. Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, recently indicated that he wished to discourage
development on greenfield sites on the edge of cities, so as to help
revitalise town centres.
The sites that are best expected to retain their values are those
surrounding prosperous towns where development was constrained by
restrictive planning policies in the 1980s.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Rampant expansion rouses critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury is going ahead with its programme of 20 new superstores a year
for the next four years in spite of its property write-down and the risk of
increasingly fierce local opposition.
Alarm at the pace of superstore development and its effect on town centres
has been marked in the West Country. Sainsbury is embroiled in a cause
celebre on the edge of Yeovil, Somerset, where it plans a superstore with a
gross area of 50,000 sq ft, parking for 460 cars and a link road.
A local protest group has been formed and petitions organised. Supporters of
Earth First, an environmental group, are occupying a closed Tesco store and
warehouse in the town centre. A High Court order to remove them has been
granted but not yet enforced. Earlier this month, 20 campaigners disrupted
Saturday shopping at a Sainsbury store in Bath.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Yeovil, became
involved in the controversy by arguing that if Sainsbury's plans were
blocked, then the retailer would apply for an out-of-town site and probably
get it. But he has praised the non-violent protests as evidence of a
'community coming alive'.
Sainsbury admits the site is a 'sensitive location' but says it will be
landscaped with 550 trees. It claims, with the support of the local chamber
of trade, that the superstore will encourage regeneration of the area.
Although the town council voted against the scheme, South Somerset District
Council, the planning authority, is not opposing it.
The application was referred to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
who decided not to call it in for a public inquiry in spite of his
department's tougher stance on superstore development.
Sainsbury has also run into stiff opposition with its plans to build a
superstore on a cricket ground at Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol. A residents'
action group has been supported by the city council at a public inquiry. The
inspector's recommendation has not yet been made.
The Westbury site is not far from a Tesco superstore built on an open space
at Golden Hill, Bristol, which the city council also opposed but was allowed
by the environment secretary. When the store opened last year there were
demonstrations and arrests. Unlike Sainsbury, Tesco is scaling back its
superstore expansion plans.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Issue of university bonds considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Universities are preparing a blueprint for a financial vehicle company which
would raise funds from the capital markets through bond issues.
A group of university principals has been appointed to decide how the
vehicle company, which would be funded by a consortium of universities,
should be established. The group will also examine restrictions on
univers-ities borrowing against their assets.
They said the move was necessary to fund capital building projects after the
sharp expansion in student numbers over the past five years, which they said
had not been balanced by increased government funding.
The cost of the projects was estimated to be at least Pounds 3.2bn by the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals last year.
Figures published today by the universities show that the number of
graduates will rise by 40 per cent between 1992 and 1995, with no reduction
in growth until 1997. Over this period, the number of business and financial
studies graduates will rise by 60 per cent, while graduates in 'studies
allied to medicine' will rise by 77 per cent.
The committee is backing the project, in conjunction with the higher
education funding councils - government quangos responsible for distributing
funds to universities - and the Northern Ireland education department.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Big-business supporters turn on Major: Peter Marsh samples
the views of sceptical executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying hard - could do better. That is the verdict on the government's
record since the general election nearly two years' ago from leading
business executives who are all firm Tory supporters.
Several of those questioned in the FT poll said they were worried by the
lack of leadership qualities of Mr John Major, the prime minister.
None said they saw any reason to shift their allegiance, while some
criticised Labour for failing to make the most of the government's
difficulties.
The 22 questioned constitute just over half the 43 business leaders - all at
that time senior executives of big companies - who signed a letter
supporting the Conservatives in The Times in March 1992, a month before the
election.
One of the signatories - Sir Patrick Meaney, former chairman of Rank
Organisation - has died. The other 20 either could not be contacted or
declined to participate.
Many said the government should be given credit for riding the political
storms of a serious recession and for bringing down interest rates after the
pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, so
helping recovery.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan,
who organised the original letter, said he remained confident about the
government. He added: 'After coming through the worst recession in over 50
years there are clear signs we are entering a period of sustainable growth
accompanied by low inflation.'
However, serious criticism emerged of ministers' style and their ability to
convey a strong image when presenting policies in such areas as health,
education, and transport.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll supermarket group, said: 'My
commitment to the Tories is no less, but my respect for them has decreased.
Many Conservative MPs must be wondering what they can do to win the next
election and one option is to have a new leader.'
Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman of the Iceland food group, said: 'Some of the
government's presentation has been appalling . . . I wonder if anyone has
told Mr Major he is not much good on TV.'
Mr David Kendall, former chairman of paper group Bunzl, said: 'You've got to
have at the helm (of the government) a winner. There's no point in having
someone who is respected but looks a loser.'
Others said they were frustrated at how the prime minister often lacked
authority in public. Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive of Trafalgar
House, said: 'The achievements of Mrs Thatcher have been diluted. The
government is accident prone and the case for Mr Major (continuing in power)
looks unproven.'
More charitable was Lord Stockton, president of Macmillan, the publisher. He
said: 'In small gatherings, Mr Major has a clear view of the big issues and
does a stunning job.' But he said that in public these capabilities
frequently failed to come across.
While generally supportive, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates,
said too many ministers seemed to want a hand in the overall direction of
policymaking, which stopped the government conveying its views clearly. He
added: 'Mr Major should impose his authority. He suffers from being a decent
kind of person who does not like stamping on people's corns.'
Relatively optimistic about the prime minister was Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of
Tate and Lyle. He said: 'Sometimes in business you appoint executives who do
a bloody awful job for two years and then improve. Mr Major's got time to
get better.' He added that Labour's record in opposition gave him no reason
to switch sides politically.
Mr Peter Drew, former chairman of construction company Taylor Woodrow, said
the prime minister was 'just the kind of chief executive I would want' who
had taken some 'courageous' decisions, while Sir John Cuckney, chairman of
Royal Insurance, said it was 'premature' to judge Mr Major.
Also supportive of ministers generally was Lord Delfont, president of First
Leisure. He said: 'I'm as confident of the government as when I signed the
letter. There has been an unfortunate run of scandals (mainly affecting the
private lives of Tory MPs) but this is the kind of thing that could happen
to anyone.'
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical retailer Dixons, accused some
sections of the media of waging a 'vendetta' against the government, and Mr
Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy hotels group, said the
scandals were 'background noise'. He added: 'I feel happier than six months
ago. I think the government is getting back on top of things and business is
looking better.'
Others said the government should be given credit for creating the
conditions for a steady economic upturn, though many said they were worried
that the tax increases due in April would hold back recovery.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, said: 'We are the only country in
Europe moving out of recession and the economic indicators are promising.
There is a feeling abroad that the government is no good, but I would give
them a vote of confidence.'
Mr Richard Jewson, former chairman of builder's merchants Meyer
International, said the government had to take a large share of the
responsibility for the 'parlous state' of public finances which had
necessitated the steep tax increases announced in the two Budgets last year.
Mr Peter Catesby, deputy chairman of the Vaux brewing group, said: 'The
problem (of high borrowing) should not have arisen in the first place. The
government has not been radical enough in controlling spending.'
Also expressing reservations was Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman of the
Sears retail chain, who said: 'The government kept sterling in the ERM
almost to the point of (economic) collapse and they still haven't admitted
they made a mistake.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Cost-saving option could cause wide power cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to a third of England and Wales could be hit by a single power cut under
an option being considered by the electricity industry to relax transmission
security standards and save Pounds 30m a year.
While National Grid, which operates the transmission system, stresses in a
confidential document that the probability of such a failure is extremely
low, there is growing concern in the sector about the effects of taking up
the idea.
Under existing standards a power cut involving anything more than an area of
a city is thought virtually impossible.
Executives fear the public reaction to a power cut covering large areas of
the country would be extremely unfavourable, even if the occurrence was
rare. The sector already faces presentational difficulties in explaining its
profitability and the pay rises of top personnel since privatisation.
National Grid drew up the option after Offer, the industry regulator,
requested a review of transmission security standards.
It appears in National Grid's interim report which has been distributed
within the industry and to leading customers. The final document is to due
to be sent to Offer in March.
National Grid says it neither supports nor opposes the option, and that a
possibility is a gradual 'partial approach' implementation over several
years.
It notes in the report, however, that several regional power distributors
and users say they do not wish to see a reduction in the reliability of
supplies from the grid without very significant cuts in cost.
Although Pounds 30m appears a large saving, distributing it throughout the
English customer base would result in a saving of less than Pounds 1 a
customer a year. Some regional distributors doubt that the savings would
reach Pounds 30m.
This is because National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators,
would lose out financially if the option was introduced. The regional
distributors fear the generators could make good their losses by raising
their prices.
Offer ordered the grid report 15 months ago because it was concerned that
the transmission system was protected against the consequences of faults
regardless of whether or how often they occurred.
The high standards often mean that an area is supplied from two routes even
when one would be enough provided it works normally, which is usually the
case.
National Grid's report concludes that it would be possible to reformulate
security standards using cost-benefit techniques and probability. This could
enable capital investment to be cut by 10 per cent.
In addition, operation security could be relaxed by operating many parts of
the system to single circuit rather than double circuit in fair weather
conditions which are experienced 80 per cent of the time.
Although this could result in savings of Pounds 30m in 1994-95, the report
says 'there is a risk of widespread loss of supply (up to a third of the
total system) for certain double-circuit faults.
'However, the probability of such trips in fair weather is very low.'
The existing grid system is 99.999 per cent reliable. The 'cost benefits'
option would double grid unreliability, but the report says this would have
a less dramatic effect on customers since blackouts are more frequently
caused by other problems.
'A doubling of grid unreliability represents only a 1 per cent increase in
the unreliability an average customer currently experiences. Additional
interruptions would be expected at a rate of about once every 10 years for
the whole system. (Up to every three years if all weather forecasts are
wrong.)
'For each individual end customer, the rate of additional interruptions
should be much lower because not all interruptions will affect everyone.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Union Railways make house sale losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent have been made on house sales
in the Kent village of South Darenth by Union Railways, the British Rail
subsidiary responsible for developing the high-speed rail link to the
Channel tunnel. Of the Pounds 135m that BR spent on potential sections of
the link which have been excluded from the route, it spent about Pounds 40m
buying up 370 houses in South Darenth at the height of the property boom in
1989. The bill was higher than BR expected because it used out-of-date maps
which failed to show an estate built in the early 1980s. BR is now trying to
sell the houses.

FT  31 JAN 94 / De-recognition expected to rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union de-recognition is likely to increase this year although the trend is
attributed to practical factors rather than hostility towards unions, says
an industrial relations report published today.
Of those companies which admitted de-recognising unions in a survey by
Industrial Relations Services, the independent research organisation, most
said that a wish to establish a closer link between pay and performance was
the main motivation. De-recognition entails switching from national to local
bargaining.
Pembrokeshire NHS Trust took issue with the report's belief that it had
de-recognised unions. Mr Keith Brown, head of personnel, said it still
recognised its 16 unions for the purposes of representation and
consultation. He added that Pembrokeshire was one of the few trusts to
organise its pay system locally. 'The rest of them are wimps,' he said.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Fiscal squeeze 'will cut growth'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The two Budgets of 1993 will reduce UK economic growth by between 0.5 per
cent and 1 per cent a year for the next three years, say accountants and
management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
It says the combined effect will be a fiscal squeeze of about 1.6 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1994-95, rising to about 3 per cent in 1996-97.
This is a greater impact than that of Lord Howe's 1981 Budget and represents
'the most severe fiscal squeeze in the UK since 1945'.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand does not expect economic growth to average more than 2 per
cent to 2.5 per cent over the next three years.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Barclays chief to be paid Pounds 737,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, the new chief executive of Barclays, the largest high
street bank, is to be paid at least Pounds 737,500 this year including a
bonus of Pounds 150,000, the bank disclosed yesterday, John Gapper writes.
Mr Taylor, 41, a former Financial Times journalist who was recruited by
Barclays from Courtaulds Textiles, of which he was chairman, will be among
the highest paid UK bank directors as a result of the two-year contract
which started this month.
Mr Taylor's contract will give him a basic salary of Pounds 500,000 for each
of the two years. In the second year he will receive a bonus determined by
Barclays' normal directors' bonus formula, and he will revert to a one-year
rolling contract in 1996.
In addition to the basic salary and the Pounds 500,000 bonus in the first
year of the contract, Mr Taylor will receive contributions to two pension
schemes totalling Pounds 87,500.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Farmers' earnings increase by 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers' incomes rose by about Pounds 1.1bn last year, an increase of 60 per
cent on the level of earnings in 1992, according to figures to be published
by the government today.
The rise in farm receipts was almost wholly due to the devaluation of
sterling in September 1992, which increased the value of European Union
agricultural payments for UK farmers. Overall output slipped by 2 per cent
during the year.
Farmers producing milk, arable crops, beef and sheep all benefited from
sterling's devaluation. Cereal growers gained from higher subsidies paid as
part of the EU's farm reforms.
Pig farmers and vegetable growers did not share in the overall return of
confidence to agriculture. Pig producers saw prices for pork slump because
of European overproduction in the past two years. At the same time, their
costs rose because of higher grain prices caused by the devaluation.
Vegetable growers' margins come under pressure with receipts falling in real
terms for the past three to four years. Demand for fresh vegetables has also
dropped.
With farm incomes up substantially and most costs remaining steady because
of low inflation and low interest rates, many farmers are resuming
investment in their business again. The National Farmers' Union estimates
that investment increased 30 per cent last year.
Farmers also reduced borrowings by 5 per cent. Mr David Naish, NFU
president, said the increase in incomes came after years of falling earnings
and poor investment.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Decision soon on moving units from Guy's Hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further controversy over the government's health reforms seems inevitable
with expected decisions in the next few days on the future of London's Guy's
and Royal Marsden hospitals.
It is believed that most of Guy's activities will be transferred to the
nearby St Thomas's Hospital leaving it with only a limited number of
specialised units as part of the reorganisation of the capital's health
service.
Any such move by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is likely to
arouse widespread opposition within the health service.
Yesterday Labour's health spokesman Mr David Blunkett said that 'whatever
move' the government made it would end up 'wasting taxpayer's money'.
The health department said that no date had yet been fixed for Mrs
Bottomley's announcement.
But the health secretary has been under growing pressure to reveal her
intentions well before May's local council elections so that there is more
time to calm voters about consequences of the plans based on the report by
Sir Bernard Tomlinson.
Tomorrow Mrs Bottomley will announce details of the new boundaries for the
future regional health authorities as well as appointments of the chairmen
who will run them.
Mr Blunkett criticised her actions. 'She is pushing ahead pre-emptorily to
make the changes a fait accompli.' He criticised the proposed reforms,
believing they would make the health service less accountable and lead to
greater centralisation.
He said that the government's ultimate aim was to abolish all regional
health authorities, giving power to the central bureaucracy. Mr Blunkett
added that the government would need to pass legislation in the next
parliamentary session in order to integrate the health service management
into the new structures.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Fears grow over the rise and rise of 'petty councillors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Heagney brothers, co-directors of the A. Heagney chain of supermarkets
in the north-east, think they have seen the future of local government
reorganisation. They are convinced it does not work.
They are not alone. Businesses in most of the areas of the country so far
touched by the local government commission's review initially welcomed
reorganisation as an opportunity to save public money and to cut their own
compliance costs by reducing the number of councils they had to deal with.
But now they fear reorganisation will cost extra money and confuse their
position still further. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, wrote to Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, saying the review could become 'an expensive hobby for the
government', and 'an exer-cise in bureaucratic job creation across the
country'.
The CBI supports the general principle of unitary councils - where the
two-tier system of county and district councils is replaced by all-purpose
councils - provided they are of 'reasonable size'. The issue of strategic
planning is paramount. They argue that authorities need to have sufficient
clout for economic development, planning and transport.
Proposals for dismantling the unpopular county of Cleveland and replacing it
with four unitary authorities have met with a particularly fierce response.
Mr Mike Heagney, one of the two brothers who runs the Pounds 6.5m annual
turnover chain, believes he is about to fall victim to the kind of
parochialism that he and others in business fear will gain the upper hand if
the county is divided into four units, as the government is recommending.
He says the success of his shop in Berwick Hills, one of Middlesbrough's
less affluent housing estates, is threatened by a development approved last
week by Middlesbrough council. The Pounds 13m scheme, championed by the
council as part of its City Challenge urban regeneration initiative,
involves the construction of a 78,000 sq ft Morrison's superstore.
To make way for the store and its 788-space car park in the heart of the
30-year-old estate, Berwick Hills' swimming baths, library, community
centre, housing office, youth club, church, church hall and vicarage will
all have to be demolished and rebuilt.
'It's being decided by petty, parochial councillors,' Mr Heagney claims.
'The opposition's been enormous and the councillors have totally ignored
it.'
Cleveland council currently has responsibility for highways and for
formulating the county's structure plan, and opposes the Berwick Hills
scheme on both these grounds.
The districts deny they are parochial. Nor do they accept that four unitary
districts would weaken structural planning controls. A joint committee of
the four unitary authorities would be set up, says Middlesbrough's chief
economic development and planning officer Mr Tony Noble, to deal with any
proposed departures from the structure plan and other strategic issues.
'There's no greater danger of succumbing to parochialism than any other
structure,' he says. The superstore scheme, he says, will enhance the
overall vitality and viability of Berwick Hills.
Business feelings are similarly strong in Avon and Somerset, which are to be
split into seven unitary authorities. 'I've never encountered such a dog's
breakfast before,' says Mr Chris Curtis, director of the CBI in the
south-west. 'Absolutely no good to be said for it, any way at all.'
The Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative describes the business
community as 'outraged' by the recommendations which would have a
'disastrous impact' on the region.
Again strategic planning is at issue. Bristol will be unitary, but
restricted to its present historic boundaries. The CBI, Institute of
Directors and Bristol Chamber had lobbied for an expanded Bristol to include
the urban area outside its present boundaries.
Most local managing directors, according to a survey by the Bristol chamber,
believe the commission's proposals would leave the city too small and
under-resourced.
But Mr John Irwin, a Teesside director of chartered surveyors Storey Sons &amp;
Parker, provides a typical business judgment on the review so far: 'It's a
fantastic opportunity to start again. But that opportunity is being missed.'

Farmers could soon be under pressure again through the effects of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is to ask the government to reverse a decision made last
week by Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, to relax the tariff formula by
which British Gas sets prices to 18m mainly residential customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer spokesman, said the tariff relaxation
and the imposition of valued added tax on fuel bills from April would cause
hardship among low-income householders. Ofgas says the change means an
average annual increase of only Pounds 2 per customer.

Officials are drafting a statement to be issued by March calling for
comments on FRS 1, the first financial reporting standard issued by the

FT  31 JAN 94 / Coopers highlights fiscal squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two Budgets of 1993 will reduce UK economic growth by between 0.5 and 1
per cent a year for the next three years, say accountants and management
consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Philip Coggan writes.
It says the combined effect will be a fiscal squeeze of about 1.6 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1994-95, rising to around 3 per cent in
1996-97. This is a greater impact than Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget and
represents 'the most severe fiscal squeeze in the UK since 1945'.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand does not expect economic growth to average more than 2-2.5
per cent over the next three years. On that assumption, and on the belief
that the government may find it difficult to reduce public spending and may
indulge in a pre-election tax-cutting Budget, the report argues that the
chancellor's aim of restoring the public sector finances to balance by the
end of the 1990s may not be achievable.

FT  31 JAN 94 / BR losses mount in non-link village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent have been made on house sales
in the Kent village of South Darenth by Union Railways, the British Rail
subsidiary responsible for building the high-speed rail link to the Channel
tunnel.
Villagers are not in the least surprised that, as disclosed in the Commons
last week, BR has spent Pounds 135m on potential sections of the Channel
tunnel link which have been excluded from the route chosen by the
government.
BR spent about Pounds 40m buying up half South Darenth at the height of the
property price boom. The bill was even higher than BR expected because it
used out-of-date maps which failed to show a housing estate built in the
early 1980s.
The corporation continues to be haunted by its offer to buy for 'humane
reasons' all the property within a 240-metre 'blighted corridor' next to its
68-mile prefered route for the link. The purchases were intended to ease the
impact on locals who would have had to endure a much more heavily used rail
line.
But the prospect of the high-speed link also brought advantages. In the
1980s small cottages built for millworkers were selling at Pounds 80,000
with buyers encouraged by a line which might take them to Victoria station
in London in 30 minutes.
BR's main effort in South Darenth now is selling off the 370 houses it
bought in 1989. About 100 such properties have been sold in the past two
years, contributing towards the Pounds 30m BR has recouped.
Mrs Linda Green, a partner with her husband in a architects' practice in
South Darenth, recalls that BR's initial decision 'had a terrible impact on
the village'.
After the link plan was abandoned, BR agreed not to dump houses on the
market at distress-sale prices but to release them gradually. It has set up
a sales office in the village. Mrs Green says that, as more and more new
owner-occupiers move in, the village is at last getting back to normal.
Mr Sunil Chopra, owner of the village's combined pharmacy and sub-post
office, agrees. 'Village life was destroyed by BR but confidence is coming
back.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Derecognition of unions expected to rise this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union derecognition is likely to increase this year although the trend is
attributed to practical factors rather than hostility towards unions,
according to an industrial relations report published today.
Companies featured in the survey by Industrial Relations Services, the
independent research organisation, largely dismissed hostility towards
unions in their decisions.
Most of the companies which admitted derecognising unions said that a desire
to establish a closer link between pay and performance was the main reason
for doing so.
Some companies, such as Yorkshire Electricity Group, cited the need to
rationalise bargaining arrangements with fewer unions. Only a small
proportion blamed poor management-union relations and one company said the
impetus had come from the workforce.
Of the 98 which responded to the survey, 25 said they had removed collective
bargaining rights in some cases.
Many of the cases involved recently privatised public companies or National
Health Service trusts. North American companies also featured strongly.
Alcan Consumer Products in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, which last year
derecognised the TGWU general union, said the move had been at the request
of employees since only a fifth of the workforce had been in the union.
The union was told it would be derecognised unless it increased its numbers.
But Alcan said it failed to do so.
British Telecommunications derecognised collective bargaining for 7,500 over
managerial grades between 1990 and 1992 by the introduction of personal
contracts. The company said: 'We wanted to create clear links between
individual managers and the company and to promote greater flexibility in
the terms and salaries we could offer.'
Pembrokeshire NHS Trust took issue with the report's belief that it had
derecognised unions.
Mr Keith Brown, head of personnel, said the trust still recognised its 16
unions for the purposes of representation and consultation. Before becoming
a trust, the authority had recognised national collective bargaining which
meant that no local bargaining arrangement had existed to derecognise, he
argued.
He said: 'We don't get involved in a national pay bargaining. We decide for
ourselves what people get paid. I'm all for it.'
He added that Pembrokeshire was one of the few trusts to organise its pay
system locally. 'The rest of them are wimps,' he said.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Local government reorganisation in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first plans for local government reorganisation in England will reach
parliament next month, at the start of a process which will last into next
year, John Authers writes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, as environment secretary, devised the review system to
ensure a consensus for all proposals. But it also provides opponents with
frequent opportunities to block reforms.
Mr John Gummer, the current environment secretary, cannot present any
restructuring plans to parliament unless they have first been recommended by
the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham.
Sir John's review is working on a county-by-county basis and has so far
presented formal plans for only 10 counties. The remainder do not have to be
completed until the end of this year.
Mr Gummer then has limited powers to amend plans by altering boundaries, but
if he wishes to make more drastic alterations, such as changing the total
number of councils, he must send the proposals back to Sir John.
Once Mr Gummer has approved a plan, orders for each county must go before
parliament to be debated and approved by both houses. If any are voted down,
the status quo will continue for them.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Wave of executions in anti-crime campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dozens of alleged criminals have been put to death across China in what
appears to be an attempt by the judicial authorities to clear their books
before the Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally an occasion for family
reunions.
Reports over the past few days from Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and
elsewhere indicate a widespread campaign is under way to remind the populace
of the severe penalties for a wide range of crimes.
According to a recent report by an Australian human rights delegation, at
least 55 offences carry the death penalty. The delegation expressed concern
that categories had recently been extended to include 'economic crimes' such
as embezzlement and the production of counterfeit goods.
International human rights groups regularly question China's predilection
for capital punishment as a means of dealing with crime.
A report published last year by a mission to China led by Lord Geoffrey
Howe, Britain's former foreign secretary, expressed concern about 'reports
of execution within public view, of instances of convicted persons being
paraded in public prior to execution, and of the use of organs from executed
for spare part surgery'.
The Howe mission urged the Chinese to reduce the number of capital offences,
to apply the death penalty more sparingly and to introduce a code of conduct
for execution that would lessen the humiliation suffered by the condemned.
Hundreds of officials, most of them relatively junior, have been executed
since the anti-corruption campaign began last July. No official statistics
are available for the number of executions in China last year, but the
figure almost certainly exceeds that in 1992.
According to Amnesty International the number of executions annually has
risen sharply since 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In
1989, 370 death sentences were imposed of which about two-thirds were
carried out. By 1992 the figure had risen to 1,891 imposed and at least
1,079 carried out.

FT  31 JAN 94 / EU in disarray over China trade row: Manufacturers fear
rushed decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to end a debilitating row within the European Union over trade with
China are in disarray, with only seven days to go until ministers are
supposed to settle the issue.
EU diplomats will meet in Brussels twice this week to try to decide whether
to recommend abolition or harmonisation of national quotas on certain
Chinese imports to the EU, including bicycles, kitchenware, training shoes
and toys.
US and European manufacturers with plants in China are afraid that after
more than a year of indecision, foreign and trade ministers may now rush
into an agreement on a series of EU-wide quotas at their meeting next
Monday.
Makers of expensive training shoes, such as Reebok and Nike, are
particularly worried about proposals for restrictive quotas on their
Chinese-made products. There is also concern about the proposed limit on
toys, which the European manufacturers say is unnecessary, and the planned
quota for Chinese bicycles, which are already subject to anti-dumping
duties.
At the same time as approving the Gatt world trade accord on December 15, EU
foreign ministers agreed to strengthen the Union's trade defence mechanisms,
making it easier to act against dumping and subsidised trade.
In principle, that agreement was supposed to lead to an accord at next
week's meeting on the abolition or harmonisation of thousands of national
quotas on imports from 'state trading countries', the most important of
which is China.
Most of those national quotas will now disappear, but member states are
locked into a familiar row between northern 'liberals' - Germany, the UK,
Denmark and the Netherlands - and a southern camp, led by France, about
which of the few remaining quotas to harmonise at EU level. They are also
unable to decide how strict the quotas should be. Germany is particularly
concerned about the situation, because it abolished all its remaining
national quotas at the beginning of last year.
'The December 15 compromise was the kind of political deal that you make by
providing some nice wording, but with all due respect to the Belgian
presidency it wasn't a compromise in the sense of bringing minds together,'
said one national official last week.
National quotas can no longer be enforced, because last year's abolition of
controls on goods at internal EU borders makes it impossible to check on
products leaving or entering member states.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Beijing extends freeze on new capital projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has extended its freeze on new capital spending projects until the end
of this year as part of efforts to combat inflation and ensure key existing
infrastructure projects are adequately funded.
The state council, China's cabinet, announced at the weekend that 'no new
fixed-asset investment projects' would be approved, with the aim of keeping
a 'tight rein on the country's fixed-asset investments in 1994'.
The decision effectively extends a ban on borrowing for new projects
instituted last July under a 16-point programme designed to stabilise the
rapid growth of the economy. The leadership has promised to lower growth to
9 per cent this year compared with 12.8 per cent last year, but it faces a
delicate task.
A western economist in Beijing said the state council's decision did not
amount to an outright ban on new projects. Those that were self-funded or
where funds were secured abroad would be allowed to proceed.
The council statement made it clear that a target of the investment freeze
was property development, including industrial zones. Last year's explosion
of speculative investment in both was blamed for China's overheating
problems. Fixed asset investment grew by 47 per cent in 1993 compared with
1992. This year's target is for 14 per cent growth to Yn131bn (Pounds 10bn)
compared with last year's figure of Yn115bn.
The state council is also calling for closer supervision of foreign
investment to 'encourage investment in domestic infrastructure and basic
industry'.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Seoul bourse has surged to a four-year high, in spite of government
efforts to cool the market. The general share index rose 2 per cent to 946
on Saturday, a day after the government announced new share issues would be
increased to soak up liquidity and that financial institutions would be
encouraged to sell stock.
The government wants to curb stock speculation, fearing it could divert
funds from the industrial investment needed to boost economic growth this
year.
The finance ministry said it would raise the amount of permitted new share
issues this year by Won3,200bn to Won10,200bn (Pounds 8.4bn). This would
include an initial share issue by Korea Exchange Bank and a new rights
offering by the Commercial Bank of Korea. It also urged domestic
institutional investors to sell Won3,000bn worth of shares.
Funds are flooding into the exchange because of low interest rates
depressing the bond market and recent government efforts to stamp out
speculation in the property and unofficial loan markets. Korean companies
are also expected to report higher earnings.
The 7.8 per cent rise in the share index last week also reflected the
inclusion on the Seoul exchange of Samsung Heavy Industries, a big
shipbuilder.

SPAIN
A general strike forces everyone to stand up and be counted. And so it was
with the Spanish press as it reviewed last Thursday's call by the unions to
bring the country to a standstill. The day after the strike, the press
examined the same glass and judged whether it was half empty or half full.
A lot of people stood up and stayed away from work (many because they feared
pickets) and a lot of other people went to work (many because they feared
blacklists). El Mundo came out on the side of the unions and headlined 'The
majority backed the strike'. El Pas did not and it put a laconic 'The strike
was not general' across its front page.
There were photographs to suit every mood. Spread across five of its six
columns, El Pas used a shot of union militants standing on a railway track
holding up a commuter train. El Mundo gave similar prominence to a picture
of riot police in full gear protecting a shopping precinct.
La Vanguardia, the main Barcelona newspaper, highlighted a good example of
Catalan consensus. Its front-page photograph had police, wearing everyday
uniforms and not a baton or rubber bullet in sight, patiently persuading
pickets to move along so that those who wanted to go to work, or wherever,
could board the city's metro. La Vanguardia entitled its editorial comment:
'A not very general strike'.
The leader writers at El Pas and at La Vanguardia came out solidly in favour
of what had triggered the strike in the first place: the government's
decision to deregulate the labour market, particularly its rigid hiring and
firing rules. In contrast, El Mundo's editorial urged the government to
amend its economic policies in order to avert 'a dangerous and widespread
sense of frustration and impotence'.
UNITED STATES
Ever since it castigated Bill Clinton for not sending his daughter to a
state school, New York Times editorials have not shown a general
predisposition to be kind to the president. Some ascribe this to the
newspaper's long-standing liberal principles, others to a particular animus
on the part of Mr Howell Raines, the Times's distinguished editorial page
chief, who also happens to be a southerner.
It was therefore, perhaps, noteworthy that the newspaper's leader column
took its time to comment on Mr Clinton's State of the Union message last
week. And when it did, 48 hours after the event, it almost skipped over any
comprehensive assessment, preferring instead to turn its critical guns on
the omnibus crime bill already passed by the Senate. Just about all it could
say in his favour was that 'with a combination of smart legislating and
public education, Mr Clinton can make it hard for the Republicans to
reassert their claim on the crime-prevention franchise'.
Another newspaper whose editorials, for different ideological reasons, do
not like the president much, the right-wing Wall Street Journal, was
horrified by his 'diktat' on healthcare, threatening to veto any bill that
does not include universal insurance coverage ('If anything like the Clinton
plan ever passes, don't get sick'). But - in its own typically quirky,
semi-sarcastic way - it confessed to being 'impressed' by the president's
holistic approach.
'What the Clinton strategy does have going for it is Bill Clinton. As the
State of the Union rhetoric made clear, this is a new kind of presidency. Mr
Clinton does not merely appeal to the electorate, he tries to envelope it .
. . we have, it seems, entered the age of the co-dependency president.' The
phenomenon clearly worries the Journal, if only because of the off-chance
that it might work.
Other comment ranged all over the journalistic lot. The Washington Post
commended a 'strong speech', the San Francisco Examiner found it 'oddly
passionless', though the San Diego Union-Tribune thought it 'highly
emotional', the Baltimore Sun rated the president 'more experienced, more
confident', the St Louis Post-Dispatch 'lacking in initiative', while the
Los Angeles Times complimented 'a doubly daring venture' that was 'far more
than rhetoric'.
AUSTRALIA
The comings and goings of top personalities have dominated the Australian
papers all week. For Alan Griffiths, the nation's upwardly mobile industry
minister, it was a question of going. The Melbourne Age revealed at the
weekend that his partner in a sandwich shop venture was alleging that party
funds had been used in the ailing business, and although denying any
impropriety, Mr Griffiths resigned.
The irony of having a promising ministerial career unpicked by a sandwich
shop in Melbourne's Moonee Ponds suburb - 'best known to most Australians as
the home of Dame Edna Everage' - did not escape the Sydney Morning Herald.
'It looks bad when the minister in charge of industry development in
Australia cannot profitably run a sandwich shop,' it commented. Next day,
under the headline 'A legend in its own lunchtime' the Herald profiled the
eatery, explaining why gleeful competitors reckoned chicken and avocado
sandwiches at ADollars 2.70 (Pounds 1.20) were a non-runner.
But it was the arrival of Prince Charles, and the subsequent Australia Day
lunge by David Kang, an anthropology student, which commanded most
attention. The Australian press, not overfussed by the royal visit at the
outset, cleared its front pages on Wednesday - although The Australian still
gave more prominence to the prince's conciliatory remarks on the republic
issue than it did to the Kang incident.
But much-applauded royal sang-froid didn't seem to win votes. By the weekend
The Sun-Herald was citing a mid-week poll of 600 people in Sydney and
Melbourne which showed that public support to retain the monarchy had
dropped to around 41 per cent, from a previous high of 52 per cent.
'Republic Rockets', it declaimed, adding - in letters one-fifth the size -
'but tour boosts Prince Charles'.
BRAZIL
The defeat inflicted on Brazil's finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, last week, when Congress failed to pass his proposed corporate tax
increase, gave the media a chance to mull over the outlook for October's
presidential elections.
Mr Cardoso's troubles stemmed from the lack of a quorum in Congress. He
criticised the congressional habit of taking long weekends away from the
capital Braslia. But the press wondered if his enemies had used the episode
to damage Mr Cardoso's electoral chances.
Gazeta Mercantil, the main business newspaper, talked of an accord between
the centre-right parties to delay Mr Cardoso's economic restructuring plan,
seen as the first step to his candidature. The paper said the plan still
looked likely to go ahead, but the minister was running out of time.
The election front-runner, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers' Party, went campaigning in Amazonia and was pictured planting trees
and wearing a tribal headdress. The weekly news magazine Veja concentrated
on infighting within the Workers' Party and said industry was confused over
who was in charge.
Mr da Silva's near 20-point lead in the polls has started to worry
politicians of every hue. It even prompted the right-wing mayor of Sao
Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf, to say he might stand down from the race if it helped
someone else beat Mr da Silva. But perhaps Mr Maluf, not reknowned for his
modesty, is losing his touch. On Saturday he crashed his Porsche 911 in the
rain. Luckily he was unharmed.

South Africa at the weekend stepped closer to ethnic conflict as black and
white right-wing groups demonstrated their opposition to April's all-race
elections, increasing the pressure on government and the African National
Congress to accommodate their views.
Both the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the white right Afrikaner
Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) stressed they would take no final
decision on participating in the poll until after today's planned talks with
the ANC and government.
But supporters from both organisations, meeting at separate weekend
conferences, made clear their rejection of the elections. Militant AVF
supporters forced Gen Constand Viljoen, the moderate AVF leader, to leave
the stage when he proposed to a gathering of 10,000 Afrikaners in Pretoria
that they should vote in the April 27-29 election.
Gen Viljoen, who has battled to find a negotiated settlement, was shouted
down by an angry crowd of supporters of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement).
Ultra-militant AWB leader Eugene Terre'blanche replaced him at the podium.
He insisted that Afrikaners would vote only in a separate election for their
own homeland, although moderate AVF leaders later scaled down this demand,
calling for Afrikaners to vote on a separate ballot paper on the same day as
the national elections.
After the conference, at which the AVF declared symbolic independence from
South Africa by electing its own interim representative council to rival the
transitional executive council, Gen Viljoen pleaded for flexibility from the
ANC and government. 'You have seen the anger of the people,' he said, adding
that violence would inevitably result if Afrikaners could not achieve a
homeland by negotiation.
Last night, Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, appeared to go some way to
meeting the demands by indicating he was behind the proposal to allow
Afrikaners a vote during the elections on whether they wanted a separate
homeland.
Both Gen Viljoen and Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi clearly hope
that weekend demonstrations of popular support for an election boycott will
concentrate the minds of ANC leaders, who have so failed to offer
significant compromises to accommo date the right's demands for regional
autonomy and 'self determination' of the Zulu and Afrikaner people.
Inkatha's conference in Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital, yesterday adopted a
resolution calling for further talks, but Chief Buthelezi made clear that
his party would boycott the poll unless constitutional changes were made. He
urged the congress to adopt the 'politics of resistance'.
'We will not be bullied into accepting a constitution agreed without us,' he
told reporters.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (11): Families torn by
want - A poor child in Chicago, in the US, may never meet a successful adult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixty one children under the age of 15 died violently in Chicago last year,
part of an epidemic which plagues all of America's cities.
For young survivors in Chicago's poorest neighbourhoods, where childhood is
punctuated by the sound of sirens and gunshots and families are torn by
want, the world is limited and dangerous. Education, the vehicle most often
used to escape poverty, is inaccessible in the city.
Affluent and middle-income families long ago left the public school system,
enrolling their children in a parallel system of private academies. What
remains, and what serves thousands of poor children, has been judged the
worst public school system in the nation.
One of every two students entering a Chicago public high school this year
will not graduate. For boys, the drop-out rate is even higher. 70 per cent
of Hispanic males who start high school do not finish, and African American
boys in the city also have a dismal graduation rate. Distracted by violence
and street life, many children lose interest in school by the third or
fourth grade.
Chicago, the third-largest city in the US, is also the most segregated. Gaps
in economic well-being among racial groups are perpetuated by gaps in
educational opportunities. A poor child in the city may never meet a
successful adult, has few constructive role models, and may have little
incentive to finish school.
For Walgreens Corporation, the largest drugstore chain in the US, based in
Chicago, the city's educational failures provided the spark for an
award-winning private initiative aimed at raising achievement levels of
inner city children. Tom Mammoser, director of corporate communications for
Walgreens, says the company has a natural and longstanding interest in
youth.
Walgreens, with Dollars 8.3bn in sales last year, operates in many inner
city markets and has 100 stores in Chicago. 'We became concerned that there
be enough qualified employees for us out there,' he said. 'We saw all of
these kids in our own city who weren't making it, and we decided to do
something about it.'
That 'something' became an eight-year partnership with the Midtown
Educational Foundation (MEF), a not-for-profit agency with a 30-year history
of helping mostly minority children in Chicago's west side neighbourhoods.
Midtown was already operating several after-school and summer programmes
aimed at raising the educational success rates for high-school-aged boys.
With a four-year start-up grant of Dollars 190,000 from Walgreens, the MEF
initiated a personal tutoring program for younger children, at the ages of
nine, 10, and 11. Since its inception in 1989, the One-on-One programme, as
it is called, has expanded to help nearly 200 children each year stay on
track at school.
The key to the programme's success has been a host of volunteer tutors,
mostly young professionals drawn from Chicago's business and academic
communities, who serve as role models and confidants as well as homework
coaches. While there are a host of tutoring programmes in Chicago, the
Midtown effort is distinctive because it reinforces what Midtown executive
director Jim Palos calls 'the whole child.'
'We're not just trying to improve grades; we blend education, sports,
culture to form a complete character, a person of substance,' Mr Palos says.
'We place a huge emphasis on becoming a successful person.'
Typically, a child meets with his mentor once a week after school at a
Midtown facility for an hour of personalised study, a 15 minute group
discussion of values, and 45 minutes of sports. Tutors are encouraged to
meet a child's family, and to understand the circumstances of the child's
life.
Affiliated with the Catholic service organisation Opus Dei, Midtown runs
separate One-on-One programmes for boys and girls. Mr Palos does not pretend
that his programme reaches the neediest children. 'We are very focused, and
we aim for the average child. Our goal is to prepare them for college.'
To qualify for One-on-One, a child must demonstrate that he or she has a
supportive parent, who must come in for an entrance interview at Midtown.
Joan Costello, an education consultant who evaluated the One-on-One
programme for Walgreens, praises Midtown for its preparation of tutors, the
support it provides to both children and volunteers, and for measurable
achievement.
95 per cent of the children in Midtown programmes, including One-on-One,
graduate from high school, and 60 per cent of those attend college. 'The
One-on-One programme at Midtown Center exudes vitality,' Ms Costello said in
her report, 'It gives one a hopeful sense of what can be done when a capable
organisation helps one adult and one child become friends and grow stronger
together.'
The One-on-One model has been applied in other US cities, including Boston,
the South Bronx district of New York, Dallas, and Washington DC. Meanwhile,
Walgreens has increased its support of the programme, recently donating an
additional Dollars 450,000 to fund One-on-One through 1996.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (8): Patchwork solutions
 -Leslie Crawford profiles Undugu's work in Kenya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mama, I'm hungry, buy me something to eat.'
The boy's voice is soft, but his eyes are desperate. The rags he wears flap
about his thin legs. I give him a sweet bun and a coupon which will entitle
him to a hot meal and a bath in one of the shelters run by Undugu Society, a
non-government organisation devoted to the care of destitute children.
There are more than 130,000 street children like him in Nairobi, an
inescapable reminder of Kenya's decline into poverty and social strife. The
children - or 'parking boys' as they are known in Kenya - survive by
begging, prostitution, or theft. They cheat their hunger by sniffing glue.
They are regarded as pests by the police and as an eye-sore by the local
tourist authorities.
Every few months, police make half-hearted efforts to sweep them off the
streets. As the government cannot afford to keep them in juvenile detention
centres for long, the children soon return to their old haunts.
Over the past 21 years, Undugu (the name means 'brotherhood' in Swahili)
Society's work has evolved from rescuing children from the streets to
addressing the problems that drove them there in the first place.
The core of Undugu's work revolves round providing under-privileged children
with basic education and survival skills. It has also become increasingly
involved in trying to relieve poverty in Nairobi's sprawling slums.
Through small loans for small business ventures, skills training and
community-based health and nutrition projects, Undugu hopes it might be able
to alleviate the economic hardship that causes family break-ups and
abandoned children. Providing low-cost shelter for the urban poor has been
another priority.
Despite Undugu's efforts, the plight of Nairobi's street children gets worse
every year. Rapid population growth, rising unemployment and structural
adjustment policies have hit urban dwellers particularly hard.
Nairobi's overcrowded slums lack basic sanitation and are often plagued by
water shortages. The removal of food subsidies has priced most staples,
including maize, beyond the reach of most urban households. Children are
withdrawn from schools because parents cannot afford school fees.
Malnutrition is on the rise.
'At best, we can only provide patchwork solutions,' says Friar Arnold Grol,
the Dutch missionary who founded Undugu Society in 1973. 'We cannot solve
national problems, and we should not be a substitute for the lack of
government policies to fight poverty and injustice.'
Friar Grol does not believe in handouts or food aid, but he is now feeding
the 1,000 children who attend Undugu's schools. 'Children were dropping out
because they had nothing to eat,' he explains. For the first three years,
children are taught basic literacy and numeracy skills. The fourth and fifth
years are dedicated to learning a trade. 'We teach them to become
self-reliant,' says Grol.
Undugu is also sponsoring 400 children in state schools and seven at
university. The white-haired friar is a familiar figure round the wood and
metal workshops and the garage, which train future carpenters and mechanics
as well as providing Undugu with an income to finance other projects.
There is a tangible pride in what they do, as well as some grumbling about
low wages. 'When I look at the kids who are still on the streets, with no
future, I know I am lucky to be here,' says Francis, an 18-year-old
carpenter.
Undugu's latest project - centres which provide street children with meals,
counselling and a bath - was developed in partnership with the private
sector. Nairobi residents are being encouraged to buy coupons at Barclays
Bank which they can then give to street children, instead of giving them
alms. The coupon entitles children to food and a thorough scrub.
'It was our way of mobilising all of Nairobi in the care of our vulnerable
kids,' says Aloys Opiyo, one of Undugu's supervisors. 'All of society should
be involved in looking after them, not just the non-government
organisations.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (10): 'High risk' concern
 -Recreation is central to Vicaria's work in Chile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was during the height of recession and the depths of dictatorship that
the Vicaria Zona Norte, an outreach office of the Chilean Catholic Church,
began working with children in the slums of Santiago.
The Vicaria set up its 'Recreation and Urban Centres' programme in 1982. At
that time Chile's economy was in shreds, savaged by the Latin American debt
crisis which had produced the worst assault on living standards since the
1930s. It was also a period of social unrest as huge unemployment and
plummeting wages led to a wave of street protests against the military
government of General Augusto Pinochet.
Against such a backdrop the Vicaria's aims seemed modest. It began to work
with children from the poorest parts of Santiago, encouraging them to meet,
play sports and discuss their problems. Most of the children came from homes
(often violent) where there was little motivation or time for leisure. Many
of their families had been 'relocated' to squalid housing estates in the
no-man's land around Santiago.
The Vicaria's main concern was 'high-risk' children living in these
so-called poblaciones, bereft of public services or recreational facilities.
'The kids just used to go out on to the streets, like vagabonds,' says Ana
Leighton, who came to the Vicaria as a child and who is now chief programme
director. 'It was a period of crisis in terms of participation. Nobody took
part in anything in those days. There were no unions, no political
organisations. But then people began to wake up, disillusioned with having
been asleep for so long.'
The church - often the focal point of opposition to the military regime -
'opened up' to this new-found need for solidarity in a society which had
become deeply divided along political and social lines.
'When the kids first arrived, the games they played were violent. They had a
lot of aggression. We encouraged them to play games where they would be in a
team and learn to respect one another,' says Ms Leighton. Recreation was
central to the Vicaria's philosophy of encouraging children to develop a
sense of self-worth. 'It's more than just tossing kids a ball and saying:
'Get on with it'. For us, recreation is a tool of personal development.'
It was through sports and activities that the Vicaria tried to impart what
it saw as values under threat; love, understanding, respect for others,
sharing and solidarity. Children, organised into neighbourhood groups under
the supervision of trained counsellors, played team sports, went on country
walks, put on plays and learned new dances. Once a year there was a
week-long summer camp. 'From the outset the child was the focal point,' says
Ms Leighton. 'The idea was to defend the rights of children - their right to
an identity, to health, education, a family and a place to live. This became
our slogan.'
The programme has worked with more than 4,000 children, and it has trained
700 volunteers, Today it finds itself operating in very different
circumstances. Chile, which returned to democracy in 1990, is now
experiencing rapid economic growth and is seen as the 'miracle' of Latin
America.
While this has helped to drag many people out of poverty, the country's
success has brought its own problems. The Vicaria now finds it harder to
raise cash internationally, as charities switch funds to more needy causes.
Many centres have become adept at raising their own financing.
Ms Leighton is also concerned that the growing conspicuous consumption of
Chile's middle classes is creating new resentment among the country's poor,
especially its youth. UN criteria show nearly one in three Chileans below
the poverty line.
'Lots of the kids don't have much sense of the future. They speak of today,
but not of tomorrow,' says Ms Leighton. She says that higher education is
beyond the reach of most poor children - save for the few who win
scholarships. Those stranded in the slums can only watch with envy as their
wealthier contemporaries advance ever closer to a western lifestyle.
Among the difficulties faced by children today, Ms Leighton highlights the
rising rate of teenage pregnancies - particularly problematic in
ultra-conservative Chile, where the use of contraceptives is controversial
and abortion and divorce are illegal.
She is also worried by the spread of football hooliganism, and evidence that
violent crime is rising. Towards the end of 1993, the press devoted much
attention to the case of a 15-year-old accused of killing an eight year-old
boy for his ice-cream money. Like the James Bulger case in the UK, many
commentators are using the incident as evidence that, despite the economic
'miracle', all is far from perfect with Chile's children.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (9): Baby boom blues -
Unemployment in Poland has hit young people hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's young people make up one quarter of its population. Free market
reforms after 1989, and the opening of the country to the outside world,
created unparalleled career opportunities.
Suddenly, even first and second year students with a knowledge of foreign
languages found themselves courted by foreign companies desperate for local
employees without the ingrained work habits of the socialist past. The fast
liberalisation of retail and wholesale trade opened up more more jobs to the
young - many of them starting as street traders - while in the media they
took over key reporting posts as discredited and tired journalists faded
into the background.
But, at the same time, the collapse of CMEA (the Soviet-dominated common
market) and stringent policies backed up by the International Monetary Fund,
together with damaging competition from imports of western goods, brought in
their wake a 15 per unemployment rate which hit the mass of young people
even harder than other age groups.
More than one third of the 3m unemployed are aged 24 and under. In the
smaller towns and rural areas, where unemployment rates soar over the 30 per
cent mark, four fifths of school leavers register for unemployment benefit.
Maria Holzer, the head of the Polish Children and Youth Foundation (PCYF)
established in May 1992, and an International Youth Foundation partner,
knows the threats this brings. She has few means to bring about solutions.
'We are seeing a rise of juvenile delinquency and the development of
organised crime unthinkable a few years ago,' she says.
Ms Holzer adds that alcoholism and drug use is on the increase as Poland
becomes an important route for drug smugglers.
At the same time the health of young people - never good in Poland - is not
improving. Ms Holszer concludes that many kids are helpless in the face of
the competitive challenges of the new times.
The foundation is seeking to address these problems. The cheerful and
optimistic Ms Holzer - she is ideally suited to her task - has few illusions
that even the predicted 4 per cent GDP annual growth in coming years will
alleviate the worries without extra effort. 'Indeed, it's a pity that the
talk of Poland's economic success gives the impression that there are no
longer any needs.' They exist, she says, explaining that the late 1970s baby
boom, which lasted into the early 1980s and will start hitting the labour
market in 1995, will bring more of the same.
The PCYF approach is to help fund grass roots initiatives which, broadly
speaking, will help young people develop their initiative and independence,
teach tolerance towards others and improve their state of health.
Since 1990, before the PCYF was established, the 'islands' programme has
helped school children in Chorzow, in the heart of the desolate industrial
region of Silesia, to learn about democracy through a network of school
parliaments.
The programme is backed by another, teaching children to care for their
friends from broken homes. In Starachowice, an experimental programme
running since 1987, supported by the PCYF, helps primary school teachers to
deal with children with psychological problems and teaches the children
themselves to care for their health. Ms Holzer says it could soon be
introduced throughout the school system.
Last year the PCYF backed 107 different projects, covering a few dozen
children or teachers to several thousand, spending 7.1bn zlotys (Dollars
330,000). The approach is to stay clear of government - indeed, support for
non-governmental organisations is seen as a priority.
This has given the PCYF a measure of stability as governments have changed.
There may be controversy as PCYF programmes challenge old ways in a society
which can be authoritarian and conservative in its attitudes and remains
under the influence of the Catholic Church.
Ms Holzer denies that this has happened so far. 'The range of our activity
is so limited that we have yet to be noticed,' she admits.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Pact drives coalition into LDP's arms: Historic agreement
will weaken Hosokawa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japanese politics, great victories are usually achieved only after the
losing side has been mollified.
So it was on Saturday when Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister,
succeeded in getting parliamentary agreement to reform the electoral system
and curb corruption, and in the process avert the collapse of his
government.
To achieve a deal, Mr Hosokawa had to bow to the will of the opposition
Liberal Democratic party and accept a less radical version of his own plans.
The original scheme, voted down in the upper house a week earlier, would
have bulldozed the old structure of money politics. Now the outlook is for
gradual change; the foundations will shift and crack.
In particular, Mr Hosokawa had to tone down his proposed curbs on political
funding and accept an electoral system more favourable to big parties.
Snatched at the last minute from a hopeless deadlock between the seven-party
coalition and the LDP, the accord is nevertheless remarkable.
It retains a central point of the original proposal; to scrap the present
system of multi-seat constituencies in which several candidates from the
same party compete for votes, the main feature in Japan's costly, corrupt
poll campaigns.
Failure to achieve that crucial change brought down two of Mr Hosokawa's
prime ministerial predecessors, since the plans were first mooted five years
ago following the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal. Helped by strong
public support, Mr Hosokawa has succeeded where far more experienced
operators have failed.
Yet the first consequence of the agreement on reform will be to weaken the
fragile coalition and drive it into the arms of the LDP. Mr Hosokawa
recognised this over the weekend when he announced he would seek LDP
co-operation to draw up an economic stimulus package.
Mr Hosokawa's compromise, as he freely admitted, has upset the left wing of
the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest and shakiest partner,
which is committed to banning corporate donations.
Now that the government's main task of political reform is out of the way,
the socialists will have even less in common with their coalition partners,
beyond a taste for power. The socialists will also oppose moves to increase
consumption tax and seek a permanent seat on the United Nations Security
Council, both of which will probably be on the agenda in the coming year or
so.
So it is no surprise that the 17 socialists who voted against the four bills
threatened over the weekend to form the nucleus of an independent group. At
the same time, some coalition members are doing their utmost to encourage
LDP supporters of reform to join the government.
This means that Mr Hosokawa's vision of a two-party structure of the
coalition and LDP looks less plausible. Some political observers think the
trend is now shifting towards a large centre-right coalition - ironically
resembling the LDP in its heyday - excluding anti-reformists on left and
right. Others believe a fresh round of defections from the LDP and the
Socialist party will lead to a two- or three-party system. Either way, they
agree that Japan is set for a long period of coalition governments.
Another result of the agreement is that the change in political style
symbolised by the end of 38 unbroken years of LDP rule in last July's
elections is far from complete.
Last summer's political realignment brought a straight-talking prime
minister, a refreshing contrast to his elliptical predecessors, plus a
tendency for confrontation in parliament, instead of the tradition of
forming consensuses in smoke-filled rooms.
The change in style seemed reinforced over the past few weeks, with dramatic
parliamentary ballots on reform, first in favour in the lower house, and
then against in the upper chamber. Television viewers have observed members
of parliament emerging from angry committee meetings, red in the face and
baffled. All this has made it look as if Japan is 'shifting from a
predictable non-voting democracy towards an unpredictable voting democracy',
in the words of a senior Japanese securities company executive.
Yet in the end the deal was thrashed out in the traditional manner, in a
late-night private meeting with Mr Hosokawa and Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP
president. A week of bitter encounters between their subordinates in
parliamentary committees had led to such complete deadlock that Mrs Takako
Doi, the upper house speaker, had to call on the two leaders to negotiate
personally.
Mr Hosokawa was keen to meet Mr Kono from the start, but the LDP leader was
reluctant, unable to decide whether opponents or supporters of reform were
winning an internal battle in his own party. The risk of defection by 70 LDP
reformists finally persuaded Mr Kono that a deal was necessary.
When the two leaders' compromise was presented to the upper and lower houses
on Saturday evening, members of parliament stood meekly, in the old style,
to give their assent. Out of the 761 members of the upper and lower houses,
a mere 42 - all socialists or LDP members - broke ranks.
Just how much difference the new rules will make to the practical conduct
and outcome of general elections cannot be predicted, according to political
observers. The general aim is to encourage politicians to seek votes on the
quality of their policies, rather than their ability to fund local swimming
pools or roads.
But traditions change slowly in Japan. The politicians campaigning under the
new system, in a general election expected some time this year, will on the
whole be the same people wearing new labels.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Algeria's hardline defence chief appointed head of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Lamine Zeroual was yesterday appointed Algeria's new head of state
by the High Security Council which has ruled the country since multi-party
elections were suspended two years ago.
Born in 1941 in Batna, at the foot of the Aures mountains from where the war
of independence was launched on November 1 1954, Gen Zeroual was not trained
in the French army as was the case of many of his peers. He attended
military schools in the former Soviet Union and France and is one of the
most respected senior officers in the Algerian army.
He has commanded a number of military regions, notably the Tindouf on the
sensitive south-west frontier with Morocco, the military academy at
Cherchell and the land forces. He resigned from the latter post after the
bloody riots of October 1988.
He was recalled from retirement last July to become minister of defence, a
portfolio he will retain. In a rare interview last October, Gen Zeroual said
the army would not 'get involved in partisan infighting. Its purpose is to
help forge a national consensus'.
Such remarks suggest a willingness to open dialogue with the now banned
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was headed for victory before Algeria's
first multi-party parliamentary elections were cancelled in January 1992.
The battle against the Islamic fundamentalists, which has cost more than
3,500 lives since the elections were scrapped, has been left to Gen Lamari.
Given his credentials as a hardliner, Gen Zeroual could be better placed to
seek some accommodation with FIS leaders to bring an end to the violence.
Algeria's fifth president since independence in 1962 faces two challenges.
The first is to end the growing civil strife, either by talking to the FIS
or by 'eradicating' fundamentalists, as some of his peers would wish. The
second is to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on reforms
and to loosen the noose of foreign debt repayments which, in 1994, will
absorb 10 per cent of the country's oil and gas export revenue.
Iran's official radio yesterday said the appointment of Gen Zeroual as
Algerian head of state would deepen the conflict with Islamic militants.
'This has placed the crisis-ridden country of Algeria on a path that is even
more uncertain than before,' Tehran Radio said soon after Gen Zeroual's
appointment was announced.
'The ruling High State Council which cancelled parliamentary elections two
years ago and took power illegally has now violated Algeria's constitution
once again,' said the radio.
Algeria last year broke off diplomatic relations with Iran, accusing it of
supporting the Moslem fundamentalists. The radio said some military units
had joined a newly formed Islamic Liberation Army in Algeria.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's crisis-prone coalition government came under renewed threat last
night as Mr Haim Ramon, the health minister, said he was on the verge of
resigning in a row over health insurance and the power of the Histadrut, the
trade union federation.
Mr Ramon, a popular spokesman for the reform wing of the Labour party, said
he had little alternative but to resign after the Labour convention rejected
his health insurance bill to separate health insurance contributions from
the Histadrut and its healthcare system, the Kupat Holim Clalit.
Mr Ramon's bill also called for all insurance contributions to be collected
by the National Insurance Institute rather than the Kupat Holim Clalit. The
convention voted for a compromise, maintaining the link between the trade
union and the Kupat Holim, leaving the Kupat Holim with 50 per cent of the
insurance dues.
Mr Ramon said the public wanted to separate politics from health, and the
compromise bill would encourage people to leave the Labour health
institutions. The Histadrut, he charged, wanted to use health insurance
contributions for political purposes.
Mr Ramon's bill was clearly intended to divorce the Histadrut from health
and is generally considered to have majority support among the Israeli
public, the Knesset (parliament) and perhaps even the cabinet, which is
expected to meet in special session tomorrow. Mr Ramon said if the cabinet
endorsed the compromise bill he would definitely resign.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, who reluctantly backed the compromise,
warned the move was unpopular, might not have a majority in the Knesset and
could even bring down the government. He warned, however, that the vote of
the Labour convention was binding on all 44 Labour Knesset members.
The first reading of Mr Ramon's bill won approval in the Knesset by 54:1,
and Mr Ramon said last night that if the government allowed a free vote his
bill would win 110 of the 120 Knesset members.
Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud, said yesterday his
party would vote against the compromise and in favour of Mr Ramon's bill.
Inside the coalition government Mr Amnon Rubinstein, minister of education
and member of the 12-strong Meretz party, said he would vote against the
compromise bill in the cabinet, and said the majority of the Knesset would
back Mr Ramon.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Algerian central bank blames technical problems in
loan-repayment delays
</HEADLINE>

   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior official of Algeria's central bank yesterday said that delays over
repayment of medium- and long-term loans were of a 'technical' nature,
writes Francis Ghiles. In no way did these delays, which the central bank
was seeking to remedy, represent a change in the country's long-standing
policy of servicing its foreign debt, he said. 'Such a change of policy
would make little sense at a time when we are close to agreeing a package of
economic reforms with the International Monetary Fund.' Algeria's hard
currency reserves, exclusive of gold, currently stand at an estimated
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn).

FT  31 JAN 94 / UK air engine power record challenges US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The multi-million dollar race to build the most powerful commercial jet
engine was intensified this weekend by the announcement that Rolls-Royce,
the UK aero-engine manufacturer, has set a world record by running its Trent
800 engine at 106,000 lbs of thrust.
By topping the record of 105,400 lbs, set last year by General Electric of
the US with its new GE 90 engine, the UK company has challenged its bigger
US rival in the fierce competition to develop very large engines to power
the new generation of twin-engine wide-body airliners.
GE, which said its new engine had been designed to reach eventual thrusts of
as much as 115,000 lbs, is likely to respond by running its new engine above
Rolls-Royce's latest level.
There is at present no market demand for engines of 100,000 lbs thrust or
more but GE and Rolls-Royce appear anxious to show airline customers that
their new large commercial engine programmes can meet potential demand for
bigger and heavier derivatives of the new Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-body
airliner and super jumbo 600-800-seat aircraft now under study.
Pratt and Whitney, the other big US aero-engine maker, is working on a more
powerful derivative of its PW4000 engine to equip this new generation of big
airliners, but it has yet to run its engine at above 100,000 lbs of thrust.
The stakes are high because of the huge cost of developing these engines. GE
 -with its French, Japanese and Italian risk-sharing partners - is spending
Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 2bn (Pounds 800m-Pounds 1.3bn) on the GE 90 programme.
Rolls-Royce is investing about Pounds 400m to develop its Trent engines,
derived from its RB211 engine.
The competition is all the more fierce because there is in prospect only one
market application for these new engines - the Boeing 777, due to be rolled
out for the first time in April.
All three manufacturers are also in combat over a Dollars 400m engine order
from Japan Airlines (JAL), which is expected to choose next month the engine
for the 777s it has ordered. JAL has placed firm orders for ten 777s and
options for ten more.
The JAL deal would boost the winning maker because large orders continue to
be rare in the depressed commercial aircraft market even while makers are
having to invest heavily in developing new engines.
However, they expect demand for bigger engines to grow in the longer term.
GE estimates a potential market of up to 2,000 wide-bodied aircraft between
now and 2012.
Boeing has indicated it requires at this stage thrust ratings of no more
than 76,000 lbs and 84,000 lbs for the first two versions of its 312-400
seater 777s, but the engine makers are anticipating demand for heavier
versions of the aircraft as well as development of other new large aircraft.
'Aircraft always get heavier, and the heavier versions have traditionally
sold best,' said Mr Russ Sparks, GE 90 programme manager.
Rolls-Royce announced this month its intention to certify its Trent 800
engine for the Boeing 777 at 90,000 lbs thrust, instead of the originally
planned 84,000 lbs, to demonstrate the growth potential of the engine.
GE said it could offer customers 92,000 lbs of thrust very quickly with the
first engine it is to certify at 84,000 lbs thrust in November.
While flexing their technological muscle, the engine makers are also in a
race to cut costs. In the absence of an immediate market recovery and amid
fierce competition, Mr Brian Rowe, chairman of GE's aircraft engine
division, said the priority remained to drive down costs.
GE, which has set the pace in industry restructuring, expects to drop
another 2,000 people from its aircraft engine business this year. This will
bring its world-wide aircraft engine workforce down to 22,000 by the end of
the year, from 26,000 at the end of last year and 40,000 in 1986.
Rolls-Royce is also shedding jobs. It announced last year it was dropping
6,000 jobs between 1993 and 1994, to bring down its aero-engine workforce to
about 24,000 by the end of this year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, arrived last night in Washington for
a two-day visit which, according to diplomats, will focus mainly on
developments in Russia.
Germany and the US are increasingly aware that Nato's Partnership for Peace
programme, designed to lead to more co-operation with the countries of
eastern Europe, will also have to evolve into a new security structure.
German diplomats say that Washington and Bonn will now have to decide what
form any additional aid to Russia should take after the resignation of key
reformers from the Moscow government. They will also have to agree on what
relationship they want with both the ousted reformers and the new cabinet.
However, there is concern in Germany that the rise of Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, leader of the Russian far-right Liberal Democratic party, is
forcing European Union members and the US to focus too much attention on
Russia at the expense of integrating eastern Europe at a faster pace.
German officials in Washington are likely to repeat that eastern European
countries require crucial economic assistance via greater trade
liberalisation. 'It is not just the Partnership for Peace which must serve
as a psychological anchor for eastern Europe, (so should) the economic
sphere,' a senior German diplomat said.
He added that greater liberalisation, from the EU and the US, for imports
from eastern Europe, as well as greater support for creating cushions
against the reforms in the region, were crucial for eastern Europe's
stability.
At the recent Nato summit in Brussels, President Bill Clinton stressed the
need for greater investment in eastern Europe. But German officials, despite
resistance from Germany's agricultural and steel lobby, still insist this be
coupled to greater market access.
Also, Mr Kohl will lobby Washington for the US business community to invest
in both eastern and western Germany. Mr Clinton, however, is expected to
remind Mr Kohl that breaking into the German market, especially eastern
Germany, has proved difficult because of resistance from monopolistic
structures and high labour unit costs.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (5): Mere survival is not
enough - The International Youth Foundation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Battle Creek, Michigan, is a small town in the heartland of the US. It would
go largely ignored by the world but for the fact that it crops up on the
back of Kellogg's breakfast cereal packets.
The dozy town, sometimes smelling of toasting corn, is dominated by the
Kellogg company and its sister philanthropic foundation which, according to
the fortunes of its investments, vies with the Ford Foundation to be the
world's biggest such charitable body.
Four years ago, a Dollars 65m donation over three years from the WK Kellogg
Foundation (WKKF) - one of the biggest grants ever made by a philanthropic
foundation - gave life to the International Youth Foundation, now also based
in Battle Creek.
The inspiration came from Rick Little, secretary general of the foundation,
who persuaded the WKKF to award a grant, allowing him time to research and
develop a new strategy for helping the world's youth.
Impressed by the fact that as much as 80 per cent of private sector giving
is devoted to the creation of new programmes and pilot projects, the
consensus which emerged from the two year consultation period (involving
experts from 30 countries) was that more support should be given to projects
which have already proved their effectiveness.
Thus a distinguishing feature of the IYF is that it steers clear of setting
up new charitable programmes, concentrating instead on identifying and
supporting exceptional local programmes that it believes are already making
a difference, and helping them to expand.
Its philosophy, that people at grass roots level are best able to understand
the problems facing young people in different countries, together with a
creative approach to fund-raising and the backing of the WKKF, has proved
immensely appealing to other corporate donors. Equally compelling has been
the IYF's message that world prosperity depends on the well-being of its
youth, a message that appeals to the business interests of many
corporations.
The small staff of the IYF constantly points out that although great
progress has been made in keeping more children alive, an ever greater
proportion are growing up with little education, job training, productive
employment - or hope.
'The basic issues of starvation, health, nutrition and survival have made
significant progress,' says Rick Little. 'But we also need to concentrate on
the issues that matter after you survive - education, training and
parenting, for example. Unless we do that well, then survival doesn't really
matter.'
To try to ensure sustainable programmes, the IYF encourages the creation of
indigenous, grant-making country foundations which are independent of
government and less influenced by donor pressures.
These foundations - there are currently seven, with another two in the
planning phase - are financially endowed, with the help of the IYF, to make
grants for youth programmes and to provide a channel for direct local
action. The idea is that they eventually become self-supporting through
local and international philanthropy.
Such a system is more likely to ensure sustainable funding for the projects.
Furthermore, it avoids leaving small, economically dependent communities at
the whim of donors, who may abandon projects after a few years if their
priorities change.
Another IYF concern is that many donors prefer to give money for projects
which address problems by categories such as literacy, drug abuse or teenage
pregnancy. 'This approach may overlook the fact that many problems are
interrelated and require comprehensive approaches,' says the IYF.
The selection of countries for partnerships aims for a regional balance; 80
per cent of the foundation's activities directed to developing countries and
20 per cent to industrialised nations. Once a country has been identified,
the formal establishment and staffing of national foundations is exhaustive,
usually taking about 3 years.
In Poland, for example, there was no history of independent charitable
foundations nor of corporate involvement. Yet in May 1992, the Polish
Children and Youth Foundation was legally established and is today the only
grantmaking foundation in Poland focused solely on the needs of children and
youth.
In other countries, the IYF has had to be more cautious. For example, it
decided to delay establishing a foundation in Laos, where there was no
legal, indigenous non-governmental organisation (NGO) structure. Beyond the
partnerships (through which most IYF funds are channeled), IYF supports
programmes in other countries - part of its YouthNet programme.
Any programmes that the IYF does choose to support - whether through a local
foundation, or YouthNet - are put through a rigorous screening process.
Nominations are solicited from NGOs, the church, business leaders,
universities and international foundations, among other sources.
The IYF then 'interviews' a programme to establish what its objectives are,
how youth participates, and what its expected social and economic outcomes
are. The programme's budget is also closely scrutinised, and tested for
economic viability. The foundation further checks that a programme is
independent of partisan politics.
The IYF takes a creative approach to fund raising, and is particularly keen
on leveraged donations. For example, Dollars 6.5m of the initial Dollars
15.3m grant that the Kellogg Foundation gave to IYF was conditional on IYF
raising Dollars 13m from other sources - a Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 match.
IYF in turn asks its sister foundations to match donations, but varies the
matches according to the circumstances of a particular country. For example,
in Ecuador, the IYF gives Dollars 3 for every Dollars 1 that the local
foundation can raise, recognising the difficulties faced by local staff in
attracting corporate donations.
Of course there will always be sceptics who doubt the impact of an
organisation like the IYF. In view of the scale of the problems facing the
world's youth, a degree of cynicism is hardly surprising. But after only
four years in existence the IYF is already having an impact, not only by
helping successful programmes to expand, but by lifting the problems facing
the world's youth on to the agendas of governments and business all over the
world.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (7): Consumers of the
future - Emma Tucker reviews business involvement with youth projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing saintly about businesses who give generously to
community-based charitable projects. Philanthropy barely comes into it.
Companies are well aware that they function best when they exist within a
healthy community of customers, clients, and employees.
But consumer prosperity depends on factors such as education, employment and
job skills, especially for young people who are the consumers of the coming
decades. This is where many businesses see their role. As Sir Allen
Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, puts
it: being involved in the community 'isn't to do with do-gooding. Nor is it
motivated by concern or shame that GrandMet is such a prosperous company.
This is a natural involvement for any company to have'.
GrandMet's case is clear: 'The long term continued success of our business
depends on the existence of prosperous consumers to buy those products,' it
says in a statement on corporate community activities.
Arguments in favour of involvement in youth strategies are probably stronger
now than ever before. Some 3bn people in the world live in countries that
are going through radical restructuring - whether in China, India, eastern
Europe or Latin America.
'In the long-term, business has got to appeal to the young people growing up
in these and other countries in terms of them as future consumers, clients
and employees,' says Mr Robert Davies, chief executive of the Prince of
Wales Business Leaders' Forum, in London.
Furthermore, the idea that government alone should worry about society's
needs has gradually been eroded, paving the way for partnerships between
government, businesses, local communities and non-profit making
organisations. 'More companies are responding with more resources and
creativity than ever before,' says Richard Schubert, president of the Points
of Light Foundation, a non-profit organisation aimed at alleviating the most
serious social problems in the US.
The growth of the International Youth Foundation - which promotes effective
youth programmes across the world that have already proven their ability to
make an impact - reflects the huge interest that business has in promoting
the well-being of young people. In the four years since it was established,
its fundraising commitments have risen from Dollars 5.5m to Dollars 23.54m.
Yes International, a London based foundation responding to requests from
countries overseas for assistance in developing youth enterprise strategies,
has - in the nine months since it was established - developed model pilots
and support infrastructures in Africa, Asia, and the Carribean, reflecting
the fact that business-interest in youth projects as well as willingness to
get involved goes beyond the industrialised world.
In India, for example, a youth business trust was recently launched,
modelled on the Prince's Youth Trust in the UK. Yes reports that the success
of the local trust results mainly from the generosity of local Indian
industry and secretarial back-up from the Confederation of Indian Industry.
For many businesses - at least in the richer nations - significant interest
in community involvement began in the early 1980s, when it became clear, as
companies tackled the problem of over-manning, that unemployment was set to
rise.
'We knew that with a lot of redundancies, we were going to make the
situation much worse,' says Sir Allen. 'The natural answer was to say that
'they' - the government - would do something about it, but that was a
ridiculous idea.'
'Our involvement in the community is genuinely business driven, even if
measuring the returns is not that easy,' he adds.
Like many other big companies, most of GrandMet's activities are focused on
supporting young people in the world of work. These include an initiative to
educate school dropouts, a programme to help young homeless people obtain
jobs and projects offering work experience in offices for children in local
schools.
But business involvement with the community is not just about promoting the
prosperity of future customers and employees. Companies in the US, and
increasingly in Europe, find consumers becoming more discerning about which
products they buy - what may tip the balance is the knowledge that a company
is actively involved with the community.
'We know from 1992 Mori research that nearly three-quarters of consumers -
73 per cent - say they are more likely to buy from companies active in the
community. One testament to this is the fact that Burger King restaurants
which are active in their local area show an increase in their sales,' says
GrandMet.
Involvement in the community is also believed to motivate employees, and is
something - at least when the economy is not in recession - that the best
prospective recruits will look at in deciding where to work.
The idea of partnership between businesses, communities and charitable
organisations is thus an attractive one for the 1990s, appealing both to the
long-term business strategies of companies and to changes in the political
climate.
But this approach is only any good in places where companies perceive that
they have a business interest. Realistically, businesses are unlikely to
give generously to the countries that most need the assistance.
Mr Davies points out that his organisation - the business leaders' forum -
has to 'work with the grain', which means it is unable to get business
involved in Ethiopia or Sierra Leone, for example.
The really poor countries do not have the business potential of a Poland or
a China. Expecting corporations to get involved beyond mere philanthropy is
a tall order.
'And that,' says the otherwise optimistic Sir Allen, 'is a genuine world
problem'.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (6): Commitment to
support youthful ideas and energy - The Prince's Youth Business Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since its birth eight years ago, the Prince's Youth Business Trust has
helped almost 20,000 young people in the UK. (In a survey on youth it is
worth pointing out that its president is not Prince, the American pop star,
but HRH The Prince of Wales.)
To do what? Mainly, to set up businesses. Some 15,000 have so far been set
up or expanded with the help of the Trust (PYBT). Help comes in the shape of
soft loans, grants, expansion loans, training, and marketing and business
advice from a nationwide network of 4,567 advisers, all aimed at young
people (18-29) with a good idea but no means to finance it.
But this help is only forthcoming if the idea is viable, if the applicant
has the necessary initiative and commitment, and if the money is unavailable
from other sources. The Trust makes plain its commitment to help those in
this age group who were born without some of the advantages that a
middle-class, public school educated, budding entrepreneur perhaps might
take for granted. It sees its core market as the unemployed from inner
cities and areas of 'rural deprivation', the minorities, the disabled, and
young ex-offenders.
It calls this its 'mission,' which gives some indication of the zeal to
improve that pervades the Trust's St James' Square headquarters in London
(where it lives rent-free, courtesy of Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of both
the Trust and the Grand Metropolitan food group).
Take, for example, Anastasis Soleas. Before he made contact with the Trust
he had been made redundant; he was unemployed and broke.
A Pounds 5,000 loan and a Pounds 1,500 grant from PYBT later, he set up a
business making Mediterranean snacks such as houmous and taramasalata that
'taste just like the way my Mum made it for us at home.' He expects turnover
to reach Pounds 24,000 after his first year of trading.
Michael Evans and Peter Gotch were among those who spotted an opportunity
but lacked the means to develop the idea. When the government made it
compulsory for all motor cyclists to have some training before setting out
on the road, they knew that training courses for motor cylists had to be a
business winner. They started with a Pounds 5,000 PYBT loan and now operate
from seven centres.
But the going is not all easy. The PYBT's funds are limited, and its
dependence on the private sector to match public contributions pound for
pound means that it is especially vulnerable at times of economic
difficulty. After all, charitable donations are hard to justify when
shareholders are baying for a distribution of profits.
The Trust describes itself as the largest business consultancy in the world
which pays its consultants nothing - and estimates that it gives away Pounds
5m a year in free advice to the supported businesses. Furthermore the
Department of Employment regards the Trust as wholly cost-effective in that
it costs less to help a business through the Trust than it does to pay
unemployment benefit.
John Pervin, the Trust's chief executive, explains that things have been
hard financially since the Prince launched a Pounds 40m appeal on his 40th
birthday in 1988. Though the government, with all-party support, agreed to
match all the money raised from the private sector, the appeal has to some
extent fallen prey to recessionary pressures in the UK. Donations fell to
Pounds 3.2m in the year to June 1993 - they came to more than Pounds 4m the
previous year.
This means that the Trust's future is under serious threat. Its success rate
is by any standards 'amazingly constant', with over two-thirds of its
businesses still trading after two to three years, but 'We've only got
enough money in the kitty for another couple of years,' says Mr Pervin.
Though Pounds 40m has been promised by government, only Pounds 23m is due to
come in - because the government will not match contributions if the private
sector fails to make them. Since covenanting money and paying it to the
Trust, a dismaying number of supportive companies have gone into
liquidation.
As a result, income from the 1988 appeal, as a proportion of total
resources, is diminishing fast, while the numbers needing help are rising
all the time. Nearly half the number of unemployed people in Britain are
under the age of 30 - a figure which has risen by 150 per cent in two years.
'We are reorganising so that we can expand our fundraising,' said Mr Pervin,
who denies being overly disappointed that the Trust's financial livelihood
is threatened by the downturn.
The fact that the Prince of Wales is involved is bound to be a help through
the difficulties that lie ahead.
He has described the PYBT as 'a remarkable achievement' for a 'risk
business.' He is sure to urge companies to look generously on the Trust
despite financial stringency, on the grounds that some of the young people
the PYBT helps are, after all, bound to rise to the top in industry or
commerce themselves.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Futures trading loss at Codelco may hit Dollars 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, yesterday admitted that losses on
futures trading over the past four months amounted to a 'provisional'
Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m), double the figure announced last week.
Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's chief futures trader, is alleged to have
committed a series of errors - without the knowledge of his superiors -
which led to the unprecedented loss.
'Unfortunately, in the past two days, we have detected that there were also
operations in gold and silver. . . in which we have made losses of more than
Dollars 50m,' said Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco president. Losses in copper
futures were about Dollars 150m, he said.
Mr Noemi said internal controls - including ones that set a maximum loss of
Dollars 1m in any single operation - had proved ineffective. 'The failure of
these controls permitted Mr Davila to lead the company to this disaster,' he
said.
Mr Davila, who has admitted through his lawyer to having conducted
loss-making transactions, has been helping Codelco executives to quantify
the extent of the problems. However, he has been unavailable for public
comment.
Mr Noemi refused to answer questions as to how Mr Davila, acting alone,
could have extended lines of credit with brokers above normal limits. 'I
have to keep this secret,' he said.
Mr Jorge Bande, acting vice-president for marketing, said: 'We are
investigating who requested the lines of credit, if they were indeed
requested, and who approved them, if they were approved.'
Referring to reports that Mr Davila had committed Codelco to futures
contracts involving 1.8m tonnes of copper, Mr Bande said: 'This figure
appears enormous, being nearly twice Codelco's (annual) production. But you
have to understand that these operations involve entering and leaving the
market several times a day. Therefore the operating volume could reach 1m
tonnes or more.'
About half of these contracts, maturity dates for which will come due
throughout 1994 and 1995, remained open, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Venezuela's president-elect, Mr Rafael Caldera, to replace
the minister of defence and the military high command caused an angry public
response from the outgoing defence chief at the weekend, raising fears of a
new military confrontation in the country.
The outgoing minister, Vice-Adm Radames Munoz Leon, said that he and the
high command were 'humiliated' by the president-elect. The admiral warned
this would cause splits in the military.
He noted that the high command had consistently supported democracy but he
expressed concern at what the new, 'precarious government' would do. Mr
Caldera won the presidency last month with only 30 per cent of the vote in a
poll with a 40 per cent abstention rate.
Vice-Adm Munoz said that he and the other six members of the military high
command would formally resign today. The incoming government has announced
that the new minister will be an army officer, Maj-Gen Rafael Montero
Revette.
Mr Caldera, 78, who is to be inaugurated as president on Wednesday, seems to
have decided to change the high command so as to give his government a fresh
image. However, the move was seen as an unnecessary shock while Venezuela is
in a period of political instability.
In 1992 there were two coup attempts. Last year a wave of bombings hit the
capital and political upheaval attended the fall of President Carlos Andres
Perez, who faces corruption charges.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Marchais successor in pledge on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Hue, elected at the weekend to lead France's Communist party,
called for broader participation in policy-making as the way to reverse the
party's electoral decline.
But he indicated there would be no marked departure from the policies
pursued over recent years by Mr Georges Marchais, the veteran party leader
who stepped down after 22 years as general secretary.
'I will be the leader of continued change,' Mr Hue said in a newspaper
interview.
Mr Marchais, unexpectedly, will retain a seat on the party's national
committee, the top executive body. Mr Hue, however, stressed that he would
be independent in his leadership. 'Georges is not trying to cling on, and I
am not under the guidance of anyone,' he said.
According to Mr Hue, the party congress in Saint-Ouen, a Paris suburb, had
agreed to 'confirm and extend the renovation of the party' which has seen
its vote fall from almost 25 per cent in the early-1970s to 9 per cent in
the first round of last spring's general election.
'We must do everything for and by democracy, through the development of the
participation of workers, citizens and the people,' said Mr Hue. The
congress voted to approve new statutes which say policy must now be built on
a diversity of opinion, representing a move away from the principle of
democratic centralism.
But the move was not enough for some reformers within the party who have
urged a bigger break from the orthodox Communist policies pursued by Mr
Marchais, and who blame his hardline views for the party's decline. Mr
Charles Fiterman, a former transport minister and a leader of a reformist
faction within the party, announced at the congress that he would quit the
party leadership because of its failure to modernise.
Mr Hue hinted at the possibility of co-operation with the Socialist party
but said all parties of the French left needed to rethink their strategies.
'The Socialist party was in power and its policies were massively condemned
by the people,' said the Communist leader, adding that the left 'has to
start anew'.
Mr Hue, 47, is little-known outside the Communist party, which he joined at
16. A male nurse by training, he became a full-time party bureaucrat and has
been a central committee member for six years.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Balladur acts to lift ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday unveiled a package
of measures designed to stimulate France's struggling economy and curb the
rise in unemployment.
The measures are designed to encourage consumer spending and provide support
to industries, including the motor industry, which have been badly hit by
France's economic downturn. They reflect concerns about an unemployment rate
in excess of 12 per cent and a desire to strengthen the country's weak
economic recovery.
The principal elements of the package, which was constrained by a budget
deficit targeted at FFr300bn (Pounds 34bn) this year, include an easing of
the rules relating to employees' profit-share savings schemes.
Under the proposals, employees will be able to withdraw funds from these
schemes ahead of the usual five-year deposit period if they are used to buy
cars or for housing-related expenditure. Insee, the national statistics
office, estimates some FFr80bn is held in such schemes.
The motor industry will receive additional assistance through an innovative
scheme to give a FFr5,000 allowance to motorists who trade in cars more than
10 years old and buy a new vehicle. This allowance appears to apply to all
makes of car, irrespective of their country of origin.
Last year car sales in the French market fell by 18 per cent to 1.72m, the
lowest since the mid-1970s.
Mr Balladur, stressing that yesterday's measures did not mark a departure
from existing economic policy, outlined additional plans to stem the rise in
unemployment.
Implementation of the government's five-year employment plan, which was
announced last year, will be accelerated. Companies and unions were urged to
bring forward negotiations to discuss how to increase flexibility in working
practices and to extend part-time work and training schemes.
In addition, the government said it would encourage employers to increase
the number of service sector jobs.
Mr Balladur said the economy's performance was improving and confirmed the
government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in gross domestic product this
year after an estimated contraction of 0.8 per cent last year. But many
private sector economists are more pessimistic. The 2.1 per cent decline in
consumer spending on manufactured goods in the final quarter of last year
has raised fears that economic activity declined after recovery in the
July-September period.
The weakness in consumer spending is partly the result of increases in
indirect taxes last year and higher social security payments. But Mr
Balladur promised yesterday that French households would not face any extra
tax increases this year, 'in order not to put the brakes on recovery'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany is bracing for strikes and demonstrations in the engineering sector
this week as the unions step up their fight over pay and benefits. Workers
in several factories briefly downed tools on Saturday foreshadowing what the
unions hope will be a wave of action throughout western Germany.
The IG Metall union has set a two-week deadline for employers to make a
'serious' wage offer, after which formal strikes would be unavoidable. In
the first phase of pay talks regional employers' groups refused to discuss
IG Metall proposals for between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent more pay.
Although the union has said it would accept less in return for job
guarantees or promises of fewer redundancies, the employers are understood
to be seeking further concessions, including reductions in holiday pay and
changes to the basic agreement.
IG Metall has said it will call warning strikes - usually stoppages of up to
an hour or more - in selected companies starting today. Although they
represent the lowest step on the escalation ladder, such strikes can be
severely disruptive, interrupting just-in-time deliveries to other
companies, for example.
Asea Brown Boveri, one of Germany's biggest engineering concerns, warned
last week that it could not be blackmailed by strike threats. The
Swiss-based multinational could move production to other bases, even in
eastern Europe, at short notice, according to Mr Eberhard von Koerber, head
of ABB's German operations. Whether the work came back to Germany later was
another question, he told journalists in Baden-Baden.
Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of the Gesamtmetall engineering employers'
association, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper yesterday that even the unions
conceded that 10 per cent of companies in the sector would go bankrupt in a
strike.
However, industry executives are confident that serious conflict will be
avoided because they doubt union members have the heart for a struggle. The
automotive and mechanical engineering industries alone shed 240,000 jobs
last year. Many large companies have also negotiated in-house deals,
diluting the traditional national pattern of agreements, but often
incorporating measures to protect jobs.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Zagreb denies troops in Bosnia: Moslems claim thousands of
Croat forces have been thrown into war

<TEXT>
Officials in Zagreb have denied that thousands of Croatian army troops are
fighting Moslems in central Bosnia, contradicting mounting evidence of
Croatian and Yugoslav military involvement in carving out ethnic mini-states
there.
Zagreb and Belgrade have consistently denied they are trying to partition
Bosnia at the expense of the Moslems. But the recent accord by Croatia and
Serb-led Yugoslavia to normalise relations has compounded fears that they
are intent on the carve-up.
The head of the Croatian army political section, Mr Drago Krpina, admitted
on Saturday that up to 2,000 private citizens, some possibly wearing army
insignia, might be fighting as volunteers in Bosnia.
His denial of Croatian troop involvement was followed by a Sarajevo radio
report that the Croatian army yesterday used helicopters to bombard Kute, a
village in central Bosnia.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army said that the Croatian army had deployed its
seventh brigade to fight in disputed towns in central Bosnia, even sending
12,000 fresh troops, bringing the total to some 20,000 regulars, according
to Sarajevo radio.
UN officials say some 5,000 Croat army troops with helicopters, tanks and
other military hardware have been deployed in Bosnia.
Despite frequent threats, the international community has stopped short of
imposing economic sanctions on Croatia, like those in force in Serbia.
Meanwhile, General Momcilo Perisic, chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav army, in
an interview yesterday, denied any involvement in Bosnia. However, UN
soldiers and local inhabitants have repeatedly witnessed the despatch of
Yugoslav troops and equipment across the frontiers.
Despite the abundant evidence of Yugoslav army involvement, western
governments have remained silent, apparently at a loss after 20 months of
punitive sanctions against Belgrade have failed to prevent the carve-up of
Bosnia.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist Russian MP, promised in
Belgrade last night that 'any military intervention by the west on Bosnian
Serb forces would be seen as a declaration of war on Russia'.
In accordance with his pan-Slavic rhetoric, he said it would be ideal if
Russia were to share a frontier with Serbia, vowing to win the lifting of
sanctions. Britain will today resume its relief convoys in Bosnia, ending a
three-day suspension imposed after the murder of an aid worker, Mr Paul
Goodall.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (4): The picture still
looks grim - Money spent on children's health is not going where it is most
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world spends Dollars 2,000bn on health care a year; the rate at which
health has improved since 1950 is unmatched in history. So says the World
Bank's recent report, Investing in Health, published last summer.
But the Bank also points out that the impressive sums are deceptive. For the
money is 'either spent on the wrong things, or wasted.' There should be more
'barefoot medicine' and a wider campaign against poverty: for example,
better education for girls and young women, which would result in better
child health and smaller families.
Nevertheless, the report is at pains to say that big spending on health  -
and it argues that more is needed - does not simply result in more babies
and all the dire consequences of over-population.
It results in lower child mortality rates and fertility rates (after a lag
of a couple of decades), as population growth rates in Asia, Latin America
and Africa have shown. Furthermore, it saves money. The potential savings
add up to billions of dollars, because premature death or disability lost
the world (on the Bank's estimates) 1.4bn years of healthy (in many cases,
productive) life in 1990 alone.
But the money is still not going where it is most needed. According to
Unicef's annual report on the state of the world's children - a sometimes
harrowing document - 8m children still die every year from five preventable
diseases: measles, whooping cough, diarrhoea, tetanus and pneumonia. Even
more grim: 1m children have been killed, 4m seriously injured, and 5m have
become refugees or orphaned as a result of wars in the past decade.
A child born in 1991 in Romania or even in Turkey, on the borders of the
European Union, is five times more likely to die in the first year of life
than a child born in Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden, France or the
Netherlands. In Turkey there are more than 56 deaths during the first year
of life per 1000 live births, compared with six in Sweden. Mortality rates
in the third world are considerably worse.
In the Irish Republic only 10 children per 1,000 live births die before the
age of five - Ireland comes near the top of the Unicef tables. In South
America the average equivalent figure is 54, in East Asia 57, in South Asia
131 and in sub Saharan Africa 183. In some African countries almost one
third of all children die before they are five.
Looking at maternal mortality, the European average is 13 deaths in
childbirth per 100,000 births. In South America the comparable figure is
210, in South Asia it is 490, and in sub Saharan Africa almost 600 mothers
die in childbirth per 100,000 live births.
But even wholescale redistribution of all the money spent on health could
never achieve an equal chance of survival. Mortality rates arise from
several different factors, such as what social and economic group a child is
born into, general standards of living, housing and diet.
Access to vaccination is also crucial: there have been big leaps forward in
the global immunisation programme. The proportion of children immunised
against tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio rose
from 5 per cent in 1977 to 20-30 per cent in 1983. By 1990, immunisation
programmes against of polio, diphtheria and measles had reached 80 per cent
of all children, with 35 per cent of pregnant women receiving tetanus shots.
The lowest rate of vaccine coverage was in sub-Saharan Africa.
Lurking behind the call to redirect (and slightly increase) the Dollars
2000bn spent world-wide are wide disparities in health care resources, and
the resulting mortality and illness rates. The Bank says that if more money
was spent on preventing or curing the most common killers, such as measles,
whooping cough, complications of pregnancy and water-born diseases, in parts
of the world, millions of lives could be saved relatively cheaply.
In the developing world, where the amount spent per head on health care is a
only a fraction of that spent in the developed world, a little more money
would go a long way.
By contrast, the Americans spend 14 per cent of the US' gross domestic
product on health care, compared with 6.1 per cent in the UK, and 8 per cent
in Germany, France and Sweden.
Improvements in the developing world's health and child mortality rates will
to a large extent depend on the commitments undertaken by countries of the
developed world, and improving the health of the world's children will take
a greater international effort.
At the World Summit for Children, held in New York in 1990, 71 heads of
states signed a plan of action, seeking 'measurable, attainable goals' for
countries to incorporate into national planning: eradication of polio by the
year 2000; 90 per cent immunisation by the same date; a halving of child
deaths caused by diarrhoea; and virtual elimination of vitamin A deficiency.
While developing countries - Tunisia and Zimbabwe among them - have shown
themselves capable of reforming their health sectors, only 2.5 per cent of
all health spending (about Dollars 4.8bn) in developing countries comes from
donors. Meanwhile, the share of total development aid for health fell during
the 1980s from 7 per cent to 6 per cent.
In the UK much remains to be done. The Child Poverty Action Group, the
Health Visitors' Association and the Save the Children fund argued in their
submission to the health white paper in 1992: 'There are clear links between
poverty, environment and children's health. What hope is there for the
future health of the nation if the government fails to act to improve the
health of the nation's children?'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (2): Reality remains
taboo / A look at world population projections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to United Nations forecasts, the population of the world is likely
to double - to more than 10bn people - by the middle of the next century.
This will be one of the biggest forces shaping living standards of future
generations. Although growth will take place almost entirely in developing
countries, few countries will be able to insulate themselves from the
effects.
However, population growth was a taboo topic at the Rio Earth Summit in
1992, although it is the source of increasing pressure on natural resources
and the environment in many regions. Governments felt that the sensitivity
of the issue was so great - provoking debates about differing cultural and
religious values - that it would frustrate attempts to reach agreement on
other fronts.
Even at the time of the summit the omission appeared a serious weakness, as
Prince Charles pointed out. In retrospect, that is clearly true. Although
countries put their names to Rio's two treaties on climate change and
bio-diversity (the variety of the world's wildlife), many have found
difficulty in drawing up realistic plans for curbing environmental damage.
The omission has also allowed the notion of 'sustainable development' to
remain confused. That principle, which governments attending Rio pledged to
observe, does not define whether resources are to be preserved at a certain
level for each person or simply for each country. Countries with rapidly
growing populations will find it almost impossible to preserve resources -
however defined - on a per capita basis.
But although the projected increase in the world's population is formidably
large, it is much less than many people feared two decades ago.
Prominent among 1970s doomsters, the Club of Rome (an international group of
industrialists, scientists, economists and statesmen) predicted that food,
energy and raw materials would run out. Since then, food production has
increased while population has slowed. The drop in the birth rate in many
countries now looks like one of the development successes of the past two
decades. Many Asian and Latin American countries have had particular success
in bringing down the rate of population growth.
India, for example, now has a fertility rate - the average number of
children per woman implied by the current birth rate - of about four. That
figure shows a fall of about one third over the past two decades - although
still higher than the figure of just over two children per woman which would
maintain a static population.
However, across much of sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates have been
running at more than six children per woman. Demographers studying why some
countries have had more success than others point out that there is no
straightforward formula to apply. Longstanding assumptions that as a country
develops, its birth rate falls, fail to explain some of the patterns now
observed.
Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bulgaria and Kerala in India have all shown sharp falls
in family size despite relatively low prosperity, while the Gulf states have
maintained fertility rates of more than three children per woman during a
period of fast economic growth. Instead, demographers are having to put
together a more complex picture, in which access to contraception, the level
of female education and the availability of jobs for women all play a part.
There has also been international concern about the measures sometimes
employed to restrain birth rates, particularly in China, which has fiercely
applied limits on family size. The scale of China's problem is undeniable:
China now has nearly a quarter of the world's population on about 7 per cent
of the world's arable land.
According to government figures this year, the fertility rate has fallen to
about 1.9 from 2.25 children per woman in 1990. That is nearly as low as
western European and US rates, and less than half that of India. But the
measures used by the Chinese government - including limiting urban families
to one child - have provoked criticism that the Chinese government is
infringing human rights.
Despite those qualifications, the falls in many countries' birth rates have
outstripped expectations. But demographers and environmentalists warn
against complacency, even if the doom-mongers have not been proved right.
They point out that even at current rates, population growth will still put
severe pressures on natural resources and on the quality of the environment.
They also argue that the ageing of the populations in industrialised
countries and the steady fall in the average age of the population in
developing countries will bring further pressures. Children under 15 years
old currently outnumber the elderly by one third in Europe and North
America. But pensioners will soon outnumber children in Europe and North
America for the first time, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has
said.
Mr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University, says that
environmental degradation, pressure on resources and the search for jobs
will cause industrialised countries to be confronted with an unprecedented
influx of immigrants from poorer countries. Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of
UNFPA, has also warned of these pressures - even taking account only those
who have already been born. More than 2m immigrants are believed to have
entered both Europe and North America over the past two years alone. So far,
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have taken the brunt of Russians, gypsies
and Romanians from the east, but political chaos in Russia could intensify
westward migration.
Governments and international agencies for aid, development and the
environment may still be coy about addressing issues of curbing population
growth. But they will increasingly find the subject unavoidable. Worries
about consumption of resources and degradation of the environment are
well-established. But migration may be the factor which finally makes
countries worldwide - industrialised as well as developing - face these
questions.

FT  31 JAN 94 / EU's airlines face flying with less aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited report by the 'committee of wise men' on the future of the
European Union's airline industry due out tomorrow is expected to call for
greater competition, heavy cost-cutting and tougher curbs on state aid.
It is also believed to rule out creation of a special fund to prop up the
region's ailing airline industry beyond what is already available under the
European Union's social fund.
The European Commission ordered the creation of a committee of wise men last
summer to analyse and propose possible cures for the crisis in the industry,
which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) in 1992.
The group was headed by Mr Herman de Croo, former Belgian transport
minister. It also included representatives of the travel and tourism
industry, as well as trade unions.
Its recommendations may draw fire from state-owned carriers such as Air
France, Italy's Alitalia and Belgium's Sabena who remain worried about
progress toward US-style deregulation. During hearings last autumn, this
French-led coalition called for a freeze on air capacity to prevent the
slump in air fares. They also argued that some financial aid was necessary
to help them restructure and tackle low-cost US competition.
On the other hand, a UK-led group of airlines is expected to use the report
to press for an extension of the 'open skies' regime and a ban on government
subsidies to national flag-carriers.
The report itself does not rule out state aid, but suggests that it should
be granted only in very limited circumstances. Last year the Commission
authorised a IPounds 175m (Pounds 167m) equity injection by the Irish
government into Aer Lingus, but attached strict conditions.
The report's findings are non-binding and will be discussed at an informal
meeting of EU transport ministers in Athens on February 7.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Chernomyrdin doubles forecast of year-end inflation
</HEADLINE>

   By LEYLA BOULTON and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, DAVOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, at the weekend doubled
his own forecast of year-end inflation to 15-18 per cent a month, in the
clearest indication yet that he will abandon the country's radical
reformers' fight against inflation, write Leyla Boulton in Moscow and Ian
Rodger in Davos.
In Davos for the World Economic Forum, Mr Chernomyrdin reiterated his
commitment to continue market reforms, saying that he hoped to 'reduce'
inflation to 15-18 per cent a month by December after 'keeping' it at 20 per
cent in the first half of this year.
The new target not only overlooked the fact that inflation was brought down
to 12 per cent in December by his former finance minister, Mr Boris
Fyodorov. It also marked a sharp increase in the 8-9 per cent target he
himself produced when he first announced 'corrections' to radical reforms
less than two weeks ago.
However, he said that Russia would push 'full steam ahead' with economic
reforms and that he wanted Russia to become fully integrated into the
international economy through membership of leading economic institutions
and also the European Union.
He urged that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations - the US, Japan,
Germany, Canada, France, Italy and Britain - be expanded to a 'Group of
Eight' to include Russia.
'The reform in Russia is irreversible. We will never turn back from the
course we have taken,' he said. 'I am not in favour of controls on wages or
on the supply of goods to the population,' he said.
'As a manager in the Soviet Union I learned myself through bitter experience
what the socialist system of distribution is.'

FT  31 JAN 94 / Bundesbank will not pass reserves to EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DAVOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, has ruled out transferring
any of its currency reserves to the newly-established European Monetary
Institute.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he
stressed that the EMI would have only an advisory role throughout the
so-called phase two of the process towards European monetary union.
Responsibility for monetary policy would remain in the hands of member
country central banks.
He pointed out that, according to the Maastricht treaty, important decisions
of the EMI during this period would have to be unanimous.
The treaty permitted central banks to transfer reserves to the EMI, but Mr
Tietmeyer said he had not heard of any country willing to do so. 'The
Bundesbank will not do this. We feel we are equipped to manage our reserves
in the appropriate way. Of course this will change when we move into the
situation of a European central bank.'
He also cautioned the EMI against promoting the Ecu as a currency. 'The
EMI's task is to facilitate but not to promote the Ecu. The Ecu is not a
currency, it is a basket, and there are exchange risks in it during phase
two.'
The EMI, which is to be located in Frankfurt, began work on January 1 and
has the task of preparing the ground for eventual monetary union, due in
1999. Mr Tietmeyer said he did not believe lasting monetary union could be
achieved without a parallel political union of EU countries.
He said numerous issues connected with monetary union still had to be
resolved, including what the main policy aims of a European central bank
should be. While the Bundesbank set priority on money supply targets, the
Bank of England stressed price stability, and other countries pursued
exchange rate policies, he said.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the EMI's most
important task was to prepare the ground for monetary union, seeking
solutions to technical obstacles in member countries and promoting
standardisation of statistics.

FT  31 JAN 94 / French sing a song of Francophilia: Musical defence of the
nation is causing some discord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France is having a fit of the Francofollies and that's official. A
Paris-based organisation called Franco-folies will this week be promoting
French songs in all of New York's French restaurants, in Amsterdam, Madrid,
Copenhagen, Mainz and Berlin, and inside France mounting no fewer than 1,500
concerts, radio shows and school lectures in performance and praise of 'the
French song'.
All this is the brainchild of Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister
who last week criticised Eurotunnel for dubbing its new subterranean rail
transporter 'Le Shuttle' instead of 'La Navette'. The government, said Mr
Toubon, 'refuses to consider the English language as an inevitability'.
But, in the view of France's eight national FM radio networks, a more
serious form of Francofolly is about to be imposed on them in the form of a
law that within two years will force them all to raise the French content of
the music they broadcast to a minimum of 40 per cent - half of that quota
must come from 'new French talent'.
The bill, approved by parliament in December, has just been declared in
keeping with the French constitution, and is expected to be passed into law
this week. But Mr Javier Pons, secretary general of the SRN radio stations
association, said: 'We remain opposed to this infringement of the freedom of
expression, and we are taking legal advice to see if it is contrary to
European law'.
The current drive to protect French culture is thus for the first time
creating internal controversy, compared to just the international row with
the US caused by France's domestically popular and successful defence of its
television quotas in the Gatt negotiations.
The reason is simple. The eight FM networks have all carved out separate
niches for themselves, partly by varying the amount of French songs they
play. This diversity has, up to now, been recognised by the CSA broadcasting
authority which has in fact negotiated a range of French content quotas that
go from 50 per cent for Radio Nostalgie, with its bent for accordion-playing
and crooning, down to 15 per cent for the Fun and Skyrock stations.
'Some 80 new French records come out every month,' explains Mr Andrew
Manderstam, head of the RFM popular radio network. 'If we all have to go for
the same new records - because of the new talent requirement - we will end
up pumping out the same music.'
Listeners will lose out in having less choice, and if they switch off, so
will the recording industry that has strongly backed the new law, he points
out. Mr Pons himself is angry, not because his M40 station which specialises
in new French songs cannot meet the law's requirement, but because if all
other radio stations do so too, 'we would have no point in existing'.
There is clearly a market for chauvinists. Skyrock itself has just set up
Chante France, a Paris radio station with the jingle: 'After Vercingetorix,
Jeanne d'Arc and Charles de Gaulle, you now have Chante France, with 100 per
cent French songs'. But even Chante France is anxious about keeping its
raison d'etre as a distinctively Gallic beacon in an increasingly un-French
world.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Polish row over control of state banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's two-party coalition government has been plunged into an internal
struggle over control of the state banking and insurance sectors, following
the dismissal of Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy finance minister, by Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister.
Mr Marek Borowski, a deputy premier and finance minister, has demanded an
explanation in writing from Mr Pawlak by tomorrow.
The dismissed deputy minister, who has been responsible for banking and
financial services since 1989, said he had been told by the prime minister
that he was being dismissed as a result of 'a review of my work and plans
for the privatisation of banks and insurance companies'.
The dismissal follows the privatisation of Bank Slaski, whose shares soared
from the public offer price of 500,000 zlotys (Pounds 15.40) to 6.7m zlotys,
valuing the bank at the equivalent of about Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.94bn)
last week.
The prime minister, who heads the PSL farmers' party, appears to be using
the outcry over the disposal to make political inroads at the finance
ministry. When the coalition was formed last autumn, the finance ministry,
like the privatisation ministry, was assigned to the Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD), which is the dismissed minister's party.
Mr Borowski says he has asked the NIK, the state audit and general control
body, to investigate the bank sale.
So far two big banks have been privatised and a further six are to be sold
by the end of 1996. The Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy is to be sold
by mid-1994 and a flotation of the state's holding in the Warta insurance
company is also planned.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Russian report urges pay and price controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veteran economists who failed to convince President Mikhail Gorbachev to
start market reforms have included wage and price controls in
recommendations to the new government to help 'correct' President Boris
Yeltsin's economic changes.
A report drawn up by a team including Prof Stanislav Shatalin, father of the
radical 500-Day Programme, and Dr Leonid Abalkin, a former presidential
adviser who opposed the 500-Day plan, was commissioned by the government in
its desperate search for 'non-monetary' methods to fight inflation.
The report sums up all the hopes of opponents of liberal reforms that
painful financial stabilisation can be avoided and that the government can
reimpose controls for which it no longer has the levers.
Arguing that liberalising energy prices in a still-monopolised economy would
only fuel inflation and cut industrial production further, the report
proposes fixing prices for raw materials and rail transport.
Through these price controls - with taxes imposed on producers which sell
for free prices to subsidise the companies which have to operate under fixed
prices - it hopes to restructure Russia's skewed price structure. The
liberals who have lost power say that the only way to eliminate the
imbalances which mean that industrial prices are higher than agricultural
prices is to force enterprises to behave in a more market-orientated way by
reducing their state subsidies.
The report also proposes to 'mobilise domestic savings' to help stabilise
the economy but does not say how this can be achieved when high inflation
discourages investment and pushes individuals and companies to keep their
money in dollar-denominated bank accounts.
It suggests combining unspecified wage controls with the indexation of
salaries to keep up with a minimum subsistence level. It also emphasises
reliance on the former Soviet republics as the main market for Russian
companies, and proclaims the need for Russia not to rely on external
assistance for reforms.
The team urges rejection of voucher privatisation - due to come to an end on
July 1 anyway - and calls for more active intervention by the state in how
enterprises are privatised and restructured.
Accusing the outgoing radicals of 'nave faith that monetarism will
automatically lead to economic recovery', the report nonetheless urges a
tough monetary and fiscal policy, and selective support for industry, both
of which have been government policy for two years.
Prof Shatalin admits that printing money to finance the extra expenditure
would fuel inflation but justifies it by saying 'if the money leads to
higher output and more goods, that will reduce inflation'.

FT  31 JAN 94 / US grants limited visa to Sinn Fein leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, has
been granted a visa to enter the US, in a dramatic reversal of Washington
policy.
Up to now, the US has sought to mirror British policy regarding Mr Adams,
who is excluded from entering the British mainland.
In a statement, the White House said the action was taken because Mr Adams
had made 'constructive comments' on renouncing violence.
'It is in the interests of peace that the US reach out to Mr Adams to press
him to go forward,' it added.
He will attend a conference in New York tomorrow on Northern Ireland
organised by the North American Committee on Foreign Policy, an independent
but influential think-tank with several former secretaries of state among
its members. The leaders of all Ulster's main political parties have also
been invited to attend.
Downing Street said last night: 'Adams has said he wants to end violence and
on that basis he is being admitted to New York to attend a conference. Sinn
Fein will be judged on its deeds. It must renounce violence permanently and
immediately.'
The news was welcomed by Mr Joe Hendron, West Belfast MP for the mainly
Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, but it provoked an angry
response from unionist politicians.
Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, who had been
'on standby' to attend the New York conference, said he would not be going
as long as Mr Adams or any Sinn Fein 'proxies' were there.
He was 'disappointed' by the US decision, 'as it would appear the US
government is more interested in pressuring Her Majesty's government to
concede to violence than in actually encouraging the peace process'.
The US State Department had said last week the decision on granting a visa
would depend on whether Mr Adams would 'publicly renounce violence and
support the joint declaration' issued in December by London and Dublin.
Speaking on Irish TV yesterday evening, before he received news of the visa
approval, Mr Adams said he had had an interview with US embassy officials
last week but denied that he was called on to make such prior commitments.
Later, welcoming the visa decision, he said: 'My purpose in going to the US
is to advance the cause of peace.'
Mr Adams will apparently be allowed to enter the US for 48 hours, but will
be restricted to travel within 25 miles of New York and will be barred from
fund-raising activities.
There has apparently been intense debate in Washington, with Irish-American
politicians divided over the issue.
Senator Edward Kennedy, whose sister, Mrs Jean Kennedy-Smith, is the US
ambassador in Dublin, is thought to have been lobbying the State Department
in favour of the visa approval. Last night he welcomed the decision.
It also emerged at the weekend that Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, has replied to Mr Adams following a request from him for
clarification of the Downing Street joint declaration.
The letter is thought to contain Mr Reynolds' views on the shape of likely
progress after an end to the IRA's campaign of violence.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Saudi royals set up mobile telephone network in secret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Saudi royal family has secretly commissioned a 10,000-line mobile
telephone network for its exclusive use from Siemens, the German electronics
group. In doing so it has not sought the approval of the Saudi
telecommunication authorities and annexed frequencies earmarked for the
country's public portable telephone service.
The network, constructed in only three weeks, was first used for the
December meeting of the Gulf Co-operation Council in Riyadh, where each
delegate was presented, on arrival, with a portable GSM telephone. The GSM
standard has been adopted by European countries for the next generation of
portable phones.
Siemens confirmed that the system had been constructed for the Royal Palace
and that its technicians were extending the network to 30,000 lines covering
Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and other Saudi Arabian cities.
Mr Helmut Muller, the German group's director of international sales for
mobile networks, said the intention was to spread use of the system to
groups outside the Royal Family. The whole system would be completed by
April this year.
He rejected suggestions that the network would cost between Dollars 40m and
Dollars 50m but would not be drawn on the price. A 50,000 line system built
for Kuwait cost Dollars 30m, according to industry analysts; that suggests
that if Dollars 40m was close to the real price for the Saudi system then
the royal family paid heavily for the speed and secrecy with which the
system was constructed.
The royal network was uncovered last week by a journalist specialising in
telecommunications. Mr Damian Peachey happened to switch on his mobile phone
while staying in Riyadh and was puzzled to see a message on the screen that
the network was live but he was forbidden to use it. He knew Saudi Arabia
had no public mobile phone network, but the message suggested there must be
a cellular radio system operating in Riyadh on the GSM standard.
Telecommunications, particularly mobile telephone systems,is a touchy
subject in Saudi Arabia where the demand for mobile telephones is huge.
There is a mobile network of sorts, based on obsolete analogue technology
and extending to only 20,000 lines, 4,000 of which are reserved for the
exclusive use of the Royal Family. The only way to obtain a mobile line is
to buy one from another user at prices said to reach SR 130,000 (Pounds
28,500).
GSM, based on computer technology where messages are transmitted as a series
of electronic pulses, is the technology of choice for the Gulf states. Users
can 'roam' freely and use their phones across national boundaries. Siemens
has installed GSM systems in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
There is a general shortage of telephone lines in Saudi Arabia. Saudi
Telecom is asking for bids for a further 500,000 lines of which 100,000 will
be GSM. The contract is expected to be announced in May and a consortium of
Ericsson of Sweden and NEC of Japan is thought to be in the lead.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Israel and PLO close to a deal: Arafat and Peres to pursue
self-rule agreement at meeting in Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night said they were
on the verge of a breakthrough agreement which would allow for an Israeli
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign
minister, said after a marathon session of talks at the World Economic Forum
in Davos, Switzerland, that further work on the draft agreement was needed,
but that they would meet in Cairo in a week.
'There is more than a fair chance that we can complete our work,' Mr Peres
said, adding it was the first time he had forecast a timescale for
conclusion of the agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Arafat said the 'main principles' had been agreed on but more time was
needed for drafting the deal.
Neither side gave details of the draft deal, but Israeli officials in
Jerusalem said the critical breakthrough in Davos had been broad agreement
on security at border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between Jordan
and Jericho.
The issue, along with disagreements over the size of the Jericho area and
the security of Israeli settlers, has dogged moves to implement the initial
Israeli-PLO accord signed last September. Israeli officials said the two
sides agreed that although most Israeli security checks of Palestinians
crossing the borders would be conducted 'invisibly' by electronic means,
Israel could still retain the right physically to check Palestinians
suspected of security violations.
The PLO had withdrawn its demand to control the roads leading to the
crossings in return for an Israeli concession to grant the Palestinians
access corridors from the self-government areas to the border crossings.
Officials said a copy of a draft wording on the border issue had been sent
to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and returned largely approved
but with some reservations to Mr Peres for last night's negotiating session.
Israel also conceded safe passage of Palestinians by land corridor to the
religious site of Nebbi Mussa and to the northern Dead Sea where Israel and
the PLO will establish a joint-venture tourist resort.
On the second substantive obstacle - the size of the Jericho area - an area
of about 60 sq km had been agreed, the officials said. Israel had previously
offered 25 sq km and the PLO had demanded 345 sq km.
Officials said last night's talks focused on the last important outstanding
issue - the security arrangements for Jewish settlers who will remain in
Gaza. Israel has demanded a wide area of operation - up to 46 sq km - to
protect Israelis in their settlements and on roads between the settlements
and Israel.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Arafat and Mr Peres had saluted each other warmly on
the platform at Davos in front of 800 international business leaders.
Mr Arafat thanked Mr Peres 'for his positive stance which I had felt and
touched during these talks'. Mr Peres paid tribute to Mr Arafat's 'supreme
effort to bring our two peoples together in the domain of peace and hope'.
He invited business leaders from the US, Europe and Japan to come to a
regional economic conference which is being planned for Amman later this
year to help 'to build the new Middle East'.
Both men emphasised the need for building 'an economic platform' on which an
enduring peace in the region could be erected.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Top executives criticise government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the senior businessmen who wrote to The Times before the 1992
election to support the Conservatives have doubts about the government's
record. They also feel its policies are poorly presented and that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, lacks authority.
Twenty-two of the 43 executives who signed the letter in March 1992 were
contacted by the FT. Ten of them expressed serious doubts about the
government's grip on policy or said their confidence in ministers had
fallen.
Many said Mr Major should be given credit for helping the UK pull clear of
recession. However, several said his leadership qualities were in doubt.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Tory unrest threatens council reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is facing mounting opposition from Conservative MPs opposed
to plans to replace the dual structure of English local government with
single tier, all-purpose councils.
More than a dozen Conservative MPs - more than enough to wipe out the
government's overall majority of 17 - say they are seriously concerned about
proposals emerging from the local government commission, chaired by Sir John
Banham.
Two told the Financial Times on the record that they would vote against the
government unless it dropped proposed changes or maked them more acceptable
to local people. Others made the same threat privately.
The strongest centres of unrest are in Yorkshire and the West Country, where
the commission's proposals are most advanced. But unease is also emerging
among shire MPs from the Tory heartlands in East Anglia and the south-east.
The emerging divisions over local government came as a string of senior
Tories yesterday called for unity behind Mr John Major's leadership.
Backbench opposition is forcing the government to consider watering down
plans to restrict student unions and overhaul the police in the face of
opposition within its own ranks. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922
committee of Conservative MPs, and a Yorkshire MP, says backbenchers are
'generally very concerned'.
The picture is complicated by the High Court's decision on Friday that the
government cannot insist on the abolition of county councils except in
exceptional cases. Tories opposing the proposals are likely to use the
ruling to press the government to reconsider its plans or risk costly legal
challenges.
The strongest signs of rebellion are coming from Somerset. Mr Tom King
(Bridgwater), a former cabinet minister, said he had 'registered deep
concern' with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Two MPs - Mr David
Heathcoat-Amery (Wells) and Mr David Nicholson (Taunton) - said they would
vote against the proposals.
Mr Heathcoat-Amery said: 'The commission has not understood the complexities
of our small but complex county, and we have taken the view that this cannot
go ahead without the support of the public, which it is very clear it does
not have.'
Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams), who will meet Mr Gummer today for talks on
the future of Devon's local authorities, said anxiety was widespread among
West Country MPs.
He said: 'I doubt that the government will be able to implement these
changes because the party will never back it.'
Yorkshire MPs are not yet threatening open rebellion. But Mr William Hague
(Richmond), a junior social security minister, Mr Robert Banks (Harrogate)
and Mr Michael Alison (Selby) all say they oppose the commission's plans to
restore the ancient North Riding. 'I am not prepared to make any warlike
noises yet about voting against the government,' said Mr Alison. 'But Mr
Gummer is aware that there is a lot of disillusionment.'
Other MPs said there was concern about the possible abolition of county
councils or the proposed boundaries of unitary authorities in a number of
other counties, including Lincolnshire, Hampshire, Kent, and Norfolk.
The first orders for reorganisation, in Cleveland and the Isle of Wight, are
due to be presented to parliament next month.
They should be followed within weeks, if Mr Gummer consents to Sir John's
proposals, by much more controversial plans to reorganise Avon and Somerset,
and Humberside and North Yorkshire.

FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (1): Global pressures are
getting worse / An examination of the prospects for young people in a world
where inequality of opportunity is all too common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the greatest achievements of medical science that of the
millions of babies born this year, more than ever before will live to the
age of five. Beyond that, the advances of modern society become harder to
detect.
Whether coping with childhood in a Bombay slum or a Chicago ghetto, the
world's youth faces growing pressures. Unstable communities, inadequate
education opportunities, a lack of adult role models and slim prospects for
employment are hallmarks not just of the developing world, but of the
industrialised world too. The worries are likely to get worse.
According to United Nations reports, more than 6bn people will inhabit the
earth by the year 2000. About half of them will be under the age of 20.
The implications are staggering. The aspirations of young people, from rich
and poor countries alike, will put untold strain on global resources. Yet
the world's policy makers and business leaders have not addressed the
problem of how they will cope with, let alone fulfil, these hopes.
Already the pressures show. In low-income countries, too many children still
lack basic education and health care. The United Nations Children's Fund
(Unicef) has calculated that while more than 90 per cent of the developing
world's children start school, half, in many countries, drop out in the
first few years. As a result there are now an estimated 100m children aged
6-11 not in school. Two-thirds are girls.
Mexico's economic reforms are applauded, but 1m new jobs will have to be
created every year to match the rate at which young people are entering the
work force, according to the University of California Centre for US Mexican
Studies.
Child labour, and the serious exploitation of working children, remain
widespread as families struggle for survival under the pressures of grinding
poverty and growing consumerism. Rural to urban migration adds to the social
problems, placing families under enormous stress as they put up with
overcrowding, unemployment and poor living conditions.
And growing poverty in urban areas has contributed to a dramatic increase in
the number of street children - as many as 100m, according to some
estimates.
The difficulties facing youth are not confined to the poorest countries.
Even societies with the highest levels of income are failing to provide for
the needs of all their young people.
Low academic achievement, school drop-outs, alcohol and drug abuse, teenage
pregnancy, vandalism and violence are on the increase in the industrialised
world. According to Unicef, the US - with 20 per cent of its children living
below the national poverty line - has more than double the child poverty
rate of any other industrialised country.
In the UK, according to a study from Fordham University's Institute for
Innovation in Social Policy, children are worse off today than they were in
1970.
Rising divorce rates and the increase in single parent families, together
with the failure of governments to alleviate poverty through social
services, have also resulted in children increasingly being deprived of
parental time and attention.
The consequences of growing stresses in family life are beginning to show up
in some disturbing statistics. Many nations face a steady rise in teenage
violence and suicide, drug abuse and - harder to quantify - disaffection,
demoralisation and disillusionment.
'We have tended to avoid this issue of values, feeling that it is a
sensitive area, best left to parents and schools,' says Mr James Himes,
director of the International Child Development Centre, for Unicef. 'But
schools do not do a good job of teaching values, and families, particularly
low income families, have such trouble holding together just to survive that
they do not have time to worry about the ethical dimensions of child
raising.'
The economic and business implications of neglecting these problems speak
for themselves.
Few governments have addressed the problem of how their economies can create
enough new jobs to absorb the rapid growth in the number of young job
seekers. Furthermore, there is an enormous price - social and economic -
associated with the increasing number of people born in poverty - and likely
to remain in poverty with little education and few job related skills.
For business, this promises to be a long term problem. Employers rely on
youth to provide a good, dependable workforce. They also represent
companies' future consumers.
'It is enlightened self-interest for us to invest in young people,' says Mr
Joe Stewart, the senior vice president of Kellogg. 'We are investing in them
as future human beings, but also as future strong consumers. How better to
operate than with a strong market around you?'
The long-term benefits of investment in youth for governments and the
private sector are clear. For example, the East Asian countries that have
enjoyed such breathtaking growth over the last decade invested heavily in
human as well as physical capital.
A report from the World Bank shows that in eight east Asian 'superstar'
countries, a bigger share of education spending was allocated to basic
primary and secondary education - vital for a skilled workforce - than to
universities.
For example, in the mid-1980s, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand spent
more than 80 per cent of their respective education budgets on basic
education.
Compare this against the primary and secondary education spending figures in
Argentina and Venezuela, with respective allocations of less than 50 per
cent.
Education - especially for women - is associated with lower fertility. In
turn, children from smaller families tend to have more years of schooling
and perform better at school than those from larger families.
The impact that educating women can make shows in Kerala, the southern
Indian state. Its female literacy rate of 66 per cent is almost double that
of its nearest rival, while its fertility rate has fallen to the
astonishingly low level of 2.3 children per woman - lower than in China,
Thailand, the former Soviet Union, and Ireland. One significant factor in
explaining Kerala's success, says the United Nations Population Fund report,
is the priority given by the state government to spending on education and
health.
But in a world of diminishing financial resources, where the prevailing
economic philosophy in many countries is for governments to scale down state
involvement in society, how are the aspirations of youth to be met?
There is no substitute for caring parents, but supportive adults, good
schooling, proper health care and effective charitable programmes can start
to make a difference. Throughout the world there exist thousands of
programmes which are improving the environments in which young people live -
and raising our consciousness of their needs.
Yet philanthropy alone cannot solve all the problems. Even if young people
are provided with a good education, there is no guarantee that there will be
jobs waiting for them. Likewise, forging ties between young people and their
communities will not ensure that, as adults, they will not be forced to
migrate from their homes in search of a better life.
The growth in the world's population calls for decisive action by
partnerships formed between government, business, non-governmental and
non-profit making organisations, aimed at channelling resources towards
people growing up in the 1990s. Only then will all those who make it through
their first crucial years as babies hope to flourish in youth, leaving in
their place a better legacy for those who come after them.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Maastricht 'should be put off for 10 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union should be delayed
for 10 years, Mr Uwe Jens, economic policy spokesman for Germany's
opposition Social Democrat party, said yesterday.
During a visit to London, Mr Jens said the 1999 target date for Emu should
be extended by 10 years, since Germany and other EU members were not able to
fulfil the economic criteria for membership of a currency union.
According to opinion polls, the SPD stands a good chance of taking power or
sharing it in a coalition with the ruling Christian Democrats after
Germany's elections in October.
Although Mr Jens stressed his remarks were not official SPD policy, they
will strengthen the impression that Emu has slipped well down the political
priorities of both leading German parties.
Mr Jens said he wanted all 12 members of the European Union to join Emu
simultaneously, as Europe could 'split up' if a small group went ahead
first.
He coupled his remarks on Emu with a plea for the Bundesbank to cut interest
rates faster to spur economic growth. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, was less independent than the SPD would like him to be, in view
of his political links to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
If the SPD came to power, it would probably raise some taxes on consumption
and environmentally damaging products to help finance public spending on job
creation.
'Our main goal is to reduce unemployment,' he said. However, he ruled out
heavy deficit spending, as public sector borrowing was already too high.
Reflecting the need to save budgetary funds, Mr Jens said he 'did not rule
out' that an SPD government would seek to renegotiate Germany's
contributions to the EU.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Private View: Ethical debate still at the embryo stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Provided no one gets hurt, does it matter where babies come from? If it does
matter, do we know where to draw the line?
Society, we assume, decides what scientists shall do - hence the latest
alarms about egg-farming and designer babies. But scientific breakthroughs
will themselves re-define social attitudes.
For the next four months the British public is being invited to join an
ethical debate about overcoming the severe shortage of human eggs for embryo
research and the treatment of infertile women.
The Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority, a committee of experts and
prominent citizens, wants to know what the public thinks about taking eggs
or ovarian tissue from corpses and even (when the procedure becomes
reliable) from aborted foetuses.
First reactions have been predictable. For a second opinion, I went to see
Robert Edwards, the Cambridge professor who brought test-tube babies into
the world, at the splendid Jacobean house outside Cambridge where he and
Patrick Steptoe founded their clinic.
It has taken the public 20 years to accept in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and
Prof Edwards, a distinguished scientist, knows all there is to know about
controversy. He has even had to sue for libel.
He gives the impression of one who is immune to criticism but not to
contradiction. Yet from behind the set face and flat northern accent there
gradually emerged a humane and pleasant subtlety.
Not surprisingly, Edwards is a militant libertarian. He seeks the maximum
possible freedom for scientific inquiry and the minimum of statutory
intervention into what he regards as a humane endeavour to satisfy a
fundamental human desire, which is to produce children.
I asked him how the latest outbreak compared with the test-tube baby furore.
'There have been endless controversies, all of them headline news. This is
only the latest. But could I say that we started the ethical debate in the
whole field in 1971.' He was referring to an article he wrote with David
Sharpe, an American academic lawyer, for Nature magazine. There he called
for elaboration of the issues 'in order to give time for defining and
evolving social attitudes on which to base rules of conduct for scientists
and society.'
Some scientists, I said, argue theirs is a pure, untrammelled, discipline
and it's not for them to take the ethical decisions.
'I've never, ever believed that. I've always said that in the early stages
of investigation the crucial roles are played by the scientists and
doctors.'
Would you yourself use foetal ovaries?
'I would grow them at the present time to the stage before fertilisation,'
he said. 'I would want to know they're perfectly normal before I take any
further step. That will probably take years. Then I would probably fertilise
some and grow them as embryos.
'I would not transfer them (into the surrogate mother) because there could
be considerable social backlash to this work.
'In any ethical debate one must always put down a period of two to three
years for social balance to be established. The effect of many scientific
developments on society comes as a shock . . . the 'yuk factor' or whatever
you call it.'
Would you treat single women?
'I would, yes. Provided they had ethical counselling and there was detailed
ethical investigation of their background.' Patients usually came on
referral, their backgrounds known. But he recalled that one would-be patient
turned out to be a lesbian.
Should there be an age limit?
Prof Edwards quoted the Biblical story of Sarah, and observed that the
oldest 'artificial' pregnancy to date was of a woman of 61 or 62. 'Between
50 and 60 the medical risks to mother and child are no greater than those of
a younger woman, with proper care. Had there been medical or scientific
contra-indications I would have said this is out. But I have not seen those
contra-indications.
'It has moved from being a scientific question to a social one. And I feel
very strongly that individual liberties here are being threatened. I see no
reason why a woman of 60 should not have a baby. I don't know if I would go
to 70 or not. I always say: 'Ask the question when you know the work can be
done.'
Should people be able to choose the baby's colour?
'If they say they do not let the colour of skin affect their relationships
with anybody, that they are non-racist, then you should not mind if a white
lady wishes to have a black baby.'
Can't you see any ethical objection?
'Not really. If two white patients come and ask for a black baby I would
wonder about that. But if it's a white man and black woman, as it usually
is, and the colour of the child is very obviously going to be a problem,
then provided they were counselled, I would say very well.'
What about choosing sex?
'Again, I think I must be very liberal: I do not see any great dangers in
choosing the sex of your children provided certain controls are exercised:
the most serious thing that can happen is that you will get an imbalance of
sexes as in China. But the most interesting aspect, which is never
discussed, is what the children would say and feel if they knew they had
been chosen as boys or girls by their parents.'
Edwards himself is the father of five girls, of whom two are non-identical
twins. He would not, however, seek to create twins 'to order'.
We discussed the problems of medical consent and I asked him whether,
paradoxical as it might sound, a child could have rights even before its
conception.
'I am increasingly thinking so. It is quite clear in American law and
increasingly in British law that the foetus has rights.' These rights
'matured' at birth, he explained, and children had been able to sue for
damage in utero, even for 'wrongful birth' if they emerged grossly abnormal.
Do women have a right to bear their own children?
'The right to have a baby is not absolute. There are no absolutes. But I
think the transmission of generations is one of the most fundamental areas
of human activity.'
Our notion of rights and duties has come from the Judaeo-Christian tradition
but in today's secular society it is framed, ultimately, by Parliament.
Edwards said he had been impressed by the sophistication of debates,
especially in the House of Lords.
'I think our democracy does give us the basis for open and fair discussion.
We have to tolerate the newspaper headlines and the pressures. And that, by
the way, is incredibly difficult and exhaust-ing.
'But if you enter a field like this it is part of what you must expect. You
can no longer work in isolation in the laboratory. You must accept the
implications of your own decisions and defend them. It is very wise to take
advice from the ethical committee as soon as possible.'
Have you been accused of bending your ethics to suit your profession?
'As far as I know, the opinions I gave in 1971 and after have not changed at
all. One always fears, being stuck close to a field all one's life, that you
start making decisions that aren't being examined critically enough. You can
get very introverted. So I'm delighted to see the recent debates.'
I asked him to name the things he would never do. Cloning was one. (By
cloning he means not egg-splitting but replicating an existing or deceased
person: 'I've never met anyone in the world who is worth cloning, and that's
been my stock answer for 10 years.')
Another was implanting human embryos in animals. He would also be very wary
of genetically 'typing' foetuses if that meant them being marked down for
abortion. Better, he said, to intervene and attempt to cure the genetic
abnormality.
'I think all of us are striving to improve life, not to do down life.
There's a natural tendency for many people to say No, because they've grown
up in a certain set of circumstances.
'But what amazes me is the intelligence of the ordinary citizen. When it is
explained clearly, they can then ask the same questions we ask.'
We are interfering with nature already, I said finally. Is there some
philosophical absolute here which we call 'the human being' which should not
be further penetrated by medical science?
'We're nowhere near that point yet, if there is a point - nowhere near. The
colour of skin is about the only characteristic you could usefully select.
All the other things about brain, intelligence - these won't come through
molecular biology.
'I don't think the things we can do at the moment are enough to make us
challenge the deep concept of the human because the interference is so
minimal.
'Unfortunately, Man has many deficiencies, diseases and disorders that in my
view do not enhance the value of Man. We have to come to the idea that we
may be able to use all our knowledge to make Man a little better, to avoid
disease, or to confer ability. But, my word, that's when the philosophical
discussion will really start]
'That question will come when we have learned two fundamental steps: how to
put genes into embryos, and how to tell exactly what those genes will do.
And I would say that is probably 100 years away - a lifetime, anyway.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Tunnel of sighs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when I feel sorry for John Major and his doomed government.
Compared with the age of the universe, the duration of these pulses of
sorrow for Major and his government is usually as brief as the neural twitch
that would flash through the brain of a vole if you showed it a Picasso.
But I am prey to them occasionally. I had one this week, a tiny spasm of
sympathy for Major and his government over the way they are being lambasted
for arrangements pertaining to the Channel Tunnel, which, in case you are
out of touch with developments in the world of macro-engineering, has cost
stupendous sums of money and opens shortly, providing a high-speed
connection between England and France: the first connection, via land,
between England and continental Europe since the last ice age, when polar
bears strolled unchallenged between Normandy and Kent.
Critics are vilifying Major's government on two fronts. First, opposition
MPs are furious that the rail connection between Folkestone and London will
be so much slower than the one between Paris and Calais.
A Labour MP claimed this week that, thanks to the brilliance of French
boffins, trains would hurtle between Paris and the Normandy coast at
1,918mph, slow to 90mph while traversing the tunnel, and then skid to a real
crawl - perhaps 14mph - for the journey to London. It was a scandal, he
said: testimony to the impoverishment of Britain's scientific and industrial
preparedness.
Second, there is venomous anger in Kent about the 68-mile route of the
London-Folkestone rail link. Malcontents claim that the route will be
environmentally damaging and untasteful, and house-owners in Kent villages
are squealing about blight and financial ruin.
In my experience, people who live in Kent are a selfish and common sort, so
they can shut up. As for claims that the opening of the tunnel will draw
attention to the technological gulf between Britain and France - so what?
British cheese-makers have caught up with French cheese-makers; in just such
a way, Britain's train-makers will eventually move alongside, perhaps
overhaul, their French rivals.
I have studied the history of macro-engineering, and am aware, more than
most, that the benefits of great projects take a while to be appreciated;
that the glow of pride in human feats they inspire is often at its rosiest a
long time after they have been built and paid for. Often hundreds or
thousands of years.
At the start, there are always niggles and arguments.
Take the Via Appia, originally built to join Rome and Capua but later
extended to the port city of Brindisi. It was started by Appius Claudius in
312 BC, and was still in excellent condition eight centuries later. The road
was famous for the precision of its paving-stones, which were jointed
together, without any use of cement, into a mosaic of stone stretching to
the horizon.
I happen to know, from obscure and ancient writings which I purchased
recently from a waiter on the Orient-Express, that the final cost of the Via
Appia, expressed in modern money, left little change from Dollars 15bn; that
enemies of Appius Claudius claimed, even before work started, that the use
of paving-stones, no matter how cleverly cut and brilliantly polished, was
obsolete technology; that large stretches of the route were for years
plagued by planning blight and advertising hoardings; and that home-owners
on the outskirts of Brindisi, worried that the Via Appia Extension would
slash through their parks and gardens, rioted often, until slain by units of
the Fourth Legion.
Similarly, there was uproar over the projected cost of the Roman aqueducts
in north Africa, especially in the regions now known as Libya and Tunisia.
The aqueducts' construction only got going when local merchants suggested
pouring uncasked olive oil on to the water in the aqueducts, thus reducing,
quite significantly, the per-cask transportation cost shouldered by their
industry. (They separated and recasked it at the other end.)
Like all great projects, the Channel Tunnel will one day be honoured in the
Macro-Engineering Hall of Fame alongside the Pharos of Alexandria, the
pyramids of the pharaohs and the Great Wall of China.
Unfortunately for John Major, this will not happen in time to save his
electoral neck.

FT  29 JAN 94 / A Major diversion off the A1: Dominic Lawson says the Tory
party should foot Gillian Taylforth's libel bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are told, with a certainty and roundness of figure that should
immediately arouse suspicion, that Gillian Taylforth and her lover, Geoff
Knights, will have to pay bills of Pounds 500,000 as a result of losing
their libel action in the High Court against The Sun newspaper.
For those of you who have spent the past few weeks on another, less prurient
planet, Taylforth, an actress, claimed that The Sun libelled her by
publishing that she had fellated Knights across the front seat of a Range
Rover parked on the 'hard shoulder' of a slip road leading on to the A1
motorway.
It is at least questionable whether such an accusation was defamatory of
Taylforth. Most men with whom I have discussed the matter seem to think that
the actress should be proud and not ashamed of the (highly co-ordinated)
accomplishment of which The Sun wrote.
And, more surprisingly perhaps, most of the women with whom I have discussed
the matter have said that Taylforth was using a lay-by for its traditional
purpose.
But, as the judge in the case rightly surmised, the point the jury had to
decide was not whether the alleged actions were such as would lead a
reasonable member of the public to think less of Taylforth.
No, the judge said, it is simply a matter of who was lying to the court: the
policeman who said Taylforth did 'it', or the woman herself, who said that
she did not. One of these two people must have been lying, said the judge,
and the jury, by a majority of 10 to 2, concluded that it was the actress
who was telling a whopper.
If the jury was right, and who could suggest otherwise, then Miss Taylforth
had been committing perjury on a grand scale.
However, as everyone seems to be saying, she must now suffer the anguish of
footing a Pounds 500,000 bill, included in which are The Sun's costs of
finding a private video showing Taylforth doing to a German sausage what the
court decided she had subsequently done to Geoff Knights.
From that figure of Pounds 500,000, if we believe it, we must deduct the
considerable sum Taylforth has received for selling her story to the Daily
Mirror. How should she raise the rest?
I think the government or, more properly, the Conservative Party, should pay
the rest of Taylforth's bill of costs.
Were it not for the fact that the public had been so completely gripped by
the account given to the High Court of her adventures, then there would have
been no other distraction from the awful pounding that Major and colleagues
have been receiving over the matter of increased taxation.
Taylforth has performed a service of incalculable political value by pushing
this enormously embarrassing matter - far more embarrassing than anything
which takes place on the nation's slip roads - off the top of the front
pages.
It is, of course, a mystery why anyone should be surprised at the size of
the tax demands which are now landing on doorsteps throughout the land.
That these demands would be sent, was spelt out in the clearest possible
terms by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech in November.
That speech was cheered to the echo by Conservative MPs, and universally
praised by the press. It baffles me why both these two groups should now be
complaining, when Clarke has done no more than keep his word.
For the Labour Party, however, the matter is strictly analagous to the
Gillian Taylforth libel action. Somebody is lying, and they claim that Major
was telling porky pies during the last election campaign when he pledged
that the Conservatives, if re-elected, would reduce, not increase, taxes.
Major, in the spirit of Taylforth, says that he was telling the truth, but
that his actions have been misinterpreted.
Taylforth says she was merely loosening Knights' trousers to soothe an
attack of pancreatitis. Major says he merely had no idea just how badly the
economy was doing.
What he has not yet admitted is that the economy was in such a terrible
state because the government had been giving the D-Mark the same attentions
that Taylforth once lavished on a German sausage. In public, too.

FT  29 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Remembrance of things to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concept of the Fresh Start rarely makes an impact these days. Indeed, if
politicians want to propose anything along these lines, they usually come up
with something like 'back to basics', as in Britain.
That phrase was coined by John Major, the prime minister, at last year's
Conservative party conference to justify the continued existence of a
government which had been doing 'new' things for 14 years.
I thought it was a jolly good idea until I saw it translated for the benefit
of foreign newspaper readers. 'Retour aux valeurs fondamentales' and 'Zuruck
zu den Grundwerten' gave me a better idea as to why the whole project had
collapsed in a welter of moral and theological dispute, political scandal
and semantic obfuscation.
In English, the phrase lacks the clarity it gains in translation. And yet,
in other languages it raises far more questions than it answers. None of
this, though, detracts from the proposition that turning back the clock is
the best way of tackling the future. After all, it became the basis of the
Republican presidential campaign in the United States in 1992.
This preamble is needed to illustrate the dilemma facing Italy, where an
election will be held on March 27. It will take place without the
participation of all those old favourites, Christian Democrats and so on,
who have decorated the political scene since the second world war. And
electors will use a simplified voting system, which should give a clear
result.
An editorial this week in Milan's Corriere della Sera heralded the occasion
as an opportunity to realise old, universally-held, values. 'There is now a
great opportunity in Italy,' it told readers. 'An opportunity to finally
construct a democracy based on two competing blocs, each legitimately
qualified to govern.' The article was profoundly in favour of alternanza, or
elections which provide the opportunity of chucking out one governing party
and voting in another.
My hopes that Italy could provide a beacon for Britain were dashed, however,
when I remembered what the same newspaper had said a week earlier: 'It is
very likely that Italy will not have a 'civilised' election but a very
tiring competition, just like the election of 1948. It will be a race
between one side, communism, and the other, the far right wing. All this is
wrong - instead of bringing progress, it will slow reform.'
So it is hard to grasp what Milan's leading daily really thinks. Is Italy
facing a choice between two evils, or is it on the verge of a better
democratic society where responsible parties alternate in holding power?
This latter option would be Back to the Future with a vengeance. It was once
the very basis of electoral democracy, but has become nearly as unfamiliar
in the rest of western Europe as it is in Italy. We have progressed beyond
the system of alternating power.
In general, the European Union these days follows the pattern once confined
to the Benelux nations: you can have any government you like so long as it
is the same as the last one.
If Corriere is right, though, Italy does have the chance of being different.
It can provide a democracy of alternating governments, or an enervating
series of communist versus fascist battles. The former is unfashionable and
the latter is popular only in central and eastern Europe, so it is not
surprising that some outsiders believe the Italians should think again
before embarking on a process of total political reconstruction.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung provides a nostalgic corrective, the kind
of conservative view that lays the ground-work for a resurrection of the old
regime. 'What the Christian Democrats delivered on the political front in
the last five decades . . . in achieving the stable restructuring of Italy
as an industrial state, might be praised by future historians.'
Italy is not only creating a new political system but also waging a war on
the old one. It is probably going further than any other country in seeking
a ritorno ai valori fondamentali. The curious thing is that, within a single
Milanese mind, there can be an argument as to what that ritorno will mean.
That is the trouble with going back to basic values: they can be as
unpredictable as the future itself. And, of course, as Italians are the
first to admit, they never existed in their country, anyway.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Why ballet is blatantly heterosexual - The romance of
dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blatantly heterosexual. In using those words, or other words to their
effect, Jane Brown, the head teacher who recently stopped her young students
attending a free performance of Kenneth MacMillan's ballet Romeo and Juliet
at Covent Garden, has stirred up gales of both rage and laughter.
Rage, not least because the kids could easily have seen the ballet on TV in
December anyway. And laughter, of course, because, for heaven's sake, this
is a ballet. Isn't ballet full of sexless anorexics and poofs? The current
Private Eye carries a cartoon of two poncy danseurs indignantly reading the
words 'blatantly heterosexual'; one of them is saying 'I'll sue.'
As a comment on the ballet Romeo and Juliet, 'blatantly heterosexual' is apt
enough. MacMillan's 1965 choreography, probably the ballet version of Romeo
best known across the world today, was inspired in part by the famous
Zeffirelli RSC staging of the Shakespeare play and by West Side Story. This
Romeo jazzes up its crowd scenes with three harlots, who are good at
supplying Verona's men with those things in which the city's honest, drab,
churlish housewives are deficient: ie lusty snogging, frothing skirts, bawdy
humour. (In other Romeos, there are more boy-boy scenes than boy-girl. Here,
however, the harlots flirt with Mercutio, Benvolio and, sometimes, Romeo,
and so keep the hetero- content to the fore.)
And Lynn Seymour, the Juliet for whom MacMillan conceived this Romeo, used
to make it quite clear that in Romeo she discovered her own sexuality.
Gauche until she met him, she became so transformed that when waiting for
him in the moonlight she used to caress her whole upper body against the
balcony - arms, shoulders, neck - in a wave of voluptuous impatience. (Prim
ballet-goers who preferred more pious Juliets used to say 'She's no Juliet,
she's a whore.')
But the intensely sexual nature of many MacMillan ballets (Romeo and Manon -
both of them have been set texts for A-level Dance, by the way  - are among
his milder efforts) obscures the larger issue of sexuality in ballet. What
kind of sexual content exists in classical ballet - the grand formal kind of
ballet, with women in stiff tutus being supported by attentive cavaliers?
Deep down, classical ballet is (a) blatantly sexist (b) essentially
heterosexual. No other art is so profoundly based upon the dichotomy between
male and female. The woman rises onto point; the man may not. He remains
mortal; she becomes in part divine. He is there to partner her; she uses his
support to expand herself yet further. That she might support him, or that
he should rise up onto point too, is inconceivable.
Ballet is an expression of chivalry, of old-style noble heterosexual
etiquette. Yes, there are quite a few gay men in ballet (though, for those
of you who like to know, most of the Royal's current Romeos are straight)
and, yes, the audience has its quota of gay men (though less, I would say,
than opera) and lesbians too. But all of them, consciously or otherwise, are
sharing a vision in which only male-female love obtains. (The choreographer
Mark Morris, when a young dancer, left a ballet company because 'I got tired
of pretending to be a straight guy in love with a ballerina.')
So why do gay men go to ballet? Less, I think, to ogle pretty boys in white
tights than you might suppose. The real spell of ballet lies in its Romantic
core - the sense of radiant erotic doom that unites the Swan Queen's fate to
Siegfried's, that links Giselle to Albrecht even beyond death. Every heroine
finds the hero she has been waiting for; and gay men, watching, can bask in
that.
But the sexual content of ballet goes deeper than the idea of 'Some day my
prince will come'. Though there are feminists who have claimed that women
are being demeaned every time a male dancer lifts a girl off the floor
(which happens in most modern dance too), sexual relations in ballet are
often profoundly expressive.
The great adagios of the classical repertory - those strange formal rituals
in which the danseur stands patiently with extended arm supporting the
ballerina while she, on one point, performs superb feats although scarcely
addressing him - express not only a woman's need for a man but also,
paradoxically, her need to be independent of him. She does not keep on
giving herself to him. In fact, she keeps using him; in some pas de deux,
she keeps eluding him. It is essential that she maintains her own space, and
keeps her distance (arm's length - literally) from him.
There are meanings here for any feminist to investigate. If Jane Brown loses
her job as head teacher, someone should employ her as a ballet critic. She
will have her work cut out.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Mixture of old myth and modern madness - A play which
is like thinking aloud at Scrabble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not make the mistake of reading Caryl Churchill's new play before you see
it. The live performance of The Skriker is infinitely better than the text
suggests. And if I still do not like it, that may be due to a distaste for
fairies, spirits and the underworld, whether they come from the ancient
Greeks or a contemporary British writer. Possibly sheer prejudice on my
part.
The play is a mixture of old myth and modern madness. Two girls, one
pregnant, the other having aborted, become embroiled with spirits. A pagan
underworld, whether real or imagined, is all about them.
Chief among the spirits is the skriker, defined as 'a shapeshifter and death
portent, ancient and damaged'. As skrikers go, this one is relatively
modest: she describes herself as 'one of many, not a major spirit, but a
spirit'.
She has been around 'through all that stuff that you would call history,
Cavaliers and Roundheads, Henry VIII, 1066 and before'.
What she is doing in 1994 is less clear. Anyway, the skriker torments the
two girls with a variety of charms and threats. She is magnificently played
by Kathryn Hunter in one of the most physically and vocally versatile
performances I have seen.
An act of contortion at the start almost takes the breath away. Ms Hunter
keeps it up to the end, having been through several guises, young, old,
male, female. The style may be borrowed from Robert Lepage; the admiration
for the execution must be total.
Alongside the skriker is a large number of presumably lesser spirits. They
include the Kelpie, half-man and half-horse on a huge pair of stilts,
Rawheadandbloodybones, Yallery Brown, Jennie Greenteeth and Black Annis.
Apart from the spectacle and filling up the stage - Philippe Giraudeau on
stilts takes up a lot - their contribution is limited.
True, The Skriker contains an element of dance, especially when the
underworld hots up for dinner, but there is not very much of it. Perhaps
there should be more. There is only one song, when the spirits sing 'Drink,
drank, drunk'. The Skriker is not really a new departure into multi-art
forms; it remains essentially a play.
Easily the most fascinating part of it is the language. Churchill has
steeped herself, consciously or otherwise, in Gerard Manly Hopkins.
There are other allusions. The witches in Macbeth crop up repeatedly, there
is perhaps the Fool in King Lear, and references to nursery rhymes abound.
But it is Hopkins who dominates. The Skriker is studded with multiple
alliterations and playing with sounds and words - almost like thinking aloud
at Scrabble.
Hunter's opening speech lasts 14 minutes, which is another reason for
admiring her performance. It is not much shorter than Hopkins's Wreck of the
Deutschland. And when she says 'a bit a bite a bitter bread and he was
crumbs crumbling to dust panic. Better forget them, not always be talking
stalking walking working them over and understand still' the debt is plain.
Ms Churchill adds some engaging flourishes. There are also comic touches.
One of the girls after kissing the skriker spews out pound coins, the other
 -less friendly - live toads. But it is the linguistics that catch the
memory.
The two girls, Jacqueline Defferary, as the pregnant Lily, and Sandy McDade,
as Josie, are excellent. A curate's egg, The Skriker is worth seeing out of
curiosity. Les Waters directs and the music is by Judith Weir.
In repertory, Cottesloe. (071) 928 2252

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: A perfectly relentless Elektra - David Murray welcomes
this revival of Strauss's opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A drab tunnel of corrugated metal, pierced vertically by a tree trunk that
seems to be upside-down, with a mechanical double door at the back and a
long, shuttered window higher up: not an obvious setting for Richard
Strauss's Elektra. Yet in Gotz Friedrich's 1990 production for the Royal
Opera - now revived for the first time, by David Massarella and Gerlinde
Pelkowski - Hans Schavernoch's grim designs serve very well.
Wednesday's first-night performance exerted a steady, properly dismaying
grip throughout its unbroken two hours (nearly), and was received with awed
appreciation by its well-blanched audience. An Elektra that fails to be
seriously disturbing is a failed Elektra; this one succeeds. What is
especially striking about it is that the whole is so much more than the sum
of its imperfect parts. Judged in the chilly light of long experience, it
hardly begins to qualify in detail as a vintage treatment - and yet its
whole trajectory is focussed so unwinkingly as to hold our sympathetic
attention in thrall.
The new conductor is Christian Thielemann, who encouraged a soft, dense
attack from his orchestra. There were times when more incisive rhythms would
have been better, and the Recognition scene for Electra and Orestes ran
dangerously slow in its later part. Little by little, nevertheless,
Thielemann's long-sighted view of the score accumulated its own weight and
power. For Electra's fatal dance of triumph at the end, we have heard much
more violent, 'seismic' orchestral eruptions; but in Thielemann's hands it
was continuously lyrical, gently swung and perfectly relentless.
The 1990 principals are all back again. The monstrous Electra is Eva Marton,
whose hefty soprano is more than ever inclined to spread (it took her a good
hour to fine down), but her fervid dramatic commitment carries all before
it. Marjana Lipovsek's Clytemnestra is dark, velvety and superbly decadent;
Robert Tear's half-comic Aegisthus is more thoroughly sung than any other
role here; Nadine Secunde's excellent Chrysothemis suffers only from
sounding too close to the Marton model - this hapless creature needs to make
a lighter, brighter, fresher contrast to her obsessed sister.
The matricidal Orestes is also an American, Robert Hale, who fuels him with
a brave, shuddering anxiety beyond the customary stone-faced norm. In
smaller parts, Mark Beesley and Alasdair Elliott make disproportionate
impressions as Orestes' Tutor and the Young Servant, and Jane Webster's
Fifth Maid scores an equal mark. As Clytemnestra's confidantes, Patricia
Cameron and Valerie Robinson get little to sing, but look brilliantly
reptilian.
The First Maid is Elizabeth Bainbridge, who is shortly to retire after
singing almost a thousand performances with the Royal Opera. All Covent
Garden regulars will remember her with admiration and respect. Far more than
just a reliable company hand, she has lent sharp character and musical
insight to a huge variety of roles, from Erda and Amneris to the Grandmother
in Janacek's Jenufa and Tippett's 'She-Ancient': a fine, invaluable
performer.
Further performances, in repertory, to February 17

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: The sickly sweet smell of success - Choc art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the first time exhibitors at Art 94, the leading contemporary art fair
in the UK, was Karsten Schubert. Schubert, 32, runs the avant-garde gallery
recently described by Evening Standard art critic Brian Sewell as 'the most
squalid little gallery in London'.
Among Schubert's artists are Rachel Whiteread, latest winner of the Turner
Prize, and Anya Gallaccio, whose current show offers just one exhibit - 325
bars of Bournville chocolate melted down and smeared over the walls.
At the art fair, which closed last weekend in Islington, Schubert was
displaying his most accessible and accepted artist, Bridget Riley. He sold
five of her gouaches, priced up to Pounds 6,500. Financially, the fair was
good for his gallery but he found it a depressing experience and he will
probably not bother to show again next year. 'My six main customers did not
show their faces'. You feel that Schubert shares their disdain for most of
the decorative and often figurative modern art on display at the fair.
The gap between the contemporary paintings and sculptures for sale at Art
94, designed to enhance living room walls, and the 'cutting edge'
contemporary art promoted by Schubert has never been wider. Most of the time
this hardly matters. Schubert sells to a few loyal customers and to museums:
he is not commercially minded, at least in public, and makes little attempt
to cash in on any notoriety.
This is most obvious with his reaction to the Turner Prize, the only
occasion in the year when 'cutting edge' art intrudes into the popular
awareness. Last November's Prize went to Whiteread, who subsequently filled
the media with the furore over her installation 'House', a concrete moulding
of the interior of a Victorian terraced house.
'The Turner Prize generates a lot of publicity but this is not translated
into additional sales. People who are serious about art don't need the
Turner. The interest in Whiteread was already there. Charles Saatchi bought
three of her works in 1991. Everything she does sells and the Turner has not
affected her prices'.
Schubert sees the destruction of 'House' as 'real short-sightedness, verging
on a Fascist mentality: destroy what you don't understand. Artists want to
resolve certain contemporary problems. When Rachel finished 'House' it was
apparent that it was bigger than she had hoped for. There is now a real
sense of loss.'
In the next year Whiteread might produce 12 pieces, with a medium-sized work
valued at Pounds 15,000. She has half a dozen buyers in the UK, a few more
abroad. The Tate Gallery already owns two of her sculptures and the Museum
of Modern Art in New York is seeking one. Neither Schubert nor Whiteread
seem anxious to capitalise on the Turner.
'We could increase White-read's prices in the short term but must be careful
not to push the market beyond what it can bear'. The demand for her moulded
one-off's is intense but limited: in these rarified reaches, talk of money
seems an embarrassment.
'Artists are not driven by revenue. When it becomes a concern, their
creativity is drying up.' Schubert is as good as his word. He used to give
his young artists stipends, but 'I try not to any more. It creates
dependency, and artists are frightened if they are indebted to a dealer'.
Instead of cash he attempts to strike up a rapport.
The real battle between Schubert and most other dealers revolves around
whether to back the new - which these days consists mainly of conceptual
art, most of which will prove meretricious and ultimately banal but which
will occasionally throw up a new insight on the world - or to concentrate on
selling historically sanctioned art, where prices are sustained by the
patina of time.
Once the distinction is made it is obvious that the 220 collectors, dealers
and museum curators who make up the Patrons of New Art at the Tate, and who
founded the Turner Prize, are actually interested in an entirely different
type of art to that which attracts most people. Often the very size of the
artifacts makes it curatorial, designed for museums or galleries, rather
than the
This does not stop the darts of the critics, notably Brian Sewell, whose
distaste for the new inspired a coven of artists, dealers and academics to
call for his head. Schubert signed the letter of protest. 'Any art critic
who maintains that modernism is a failure, something that went wrong
somewhere between Picasso and Duchamp, between 1907 and 1912, disqualifies
himself totally from talking about contemporary culture in any context.
Brian Sewell has in effect dismissed everything that is truly great in our
century and I somehow cannot agree with that'.
Sewell has, inevitably, expressed contempt for Gallaccio's chocolate walls,
which have been on display for ten days now. Patches of white show through
and the sickly sweet smell is nauseating.
Schubert has not sold the exhibit, or rather he has not sold the
certificate, priced at Pounds 5,000, which enables the buyer to 'decorate a
room to a specified height with plain chocolate, applied with a brush in
three layers'. There has been only one encouraging inquiry but the gallery
owner is unperturbed. After Gallaccio's last show three years ago,
consisting of flowers pressed between sheets of glass, it took 18 months to
find a buyer. Schubert believes in his artists: history will determine their
merit.
Of course there has to be some financial discipline. Schubert could not run
his gallery solely on the certainty that one day Anya Gallaccio, a
30-year-old graduate from that hot-house of conceptual art, Goldsmith's
College, south London, will be recognised as an original and significant
artist. His next show will consist of three new paintings by Bridget Riley,
an established Royal Academician, whose work is already sanctioned by time.
With two of the works, each priced at Pounds 45,000, already spoken for,
Schubert can trawl the degree shows of the art colleges this summer for new
concepts with some confidence.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Raiders of the lost tombs - Antiquities collections
rob us of our history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burglary is often the simple, squalid truth behind collecting antiquities.
Antiquities' robbers are ransacking the countries of the Mediterranean and
Middle East. Why? Because they have a market, the collectors. Most objects
in collections have no provenance. Many of these are stolen goods from
illegal excavations. It is bizarre in the 1990s that the Royal Academy
should appear to condone the practice by hosting an exhibition of the Ortiz
collection, including goods without a provenance. Of course Ortiz, who
purchased many of his pieces in England and Switzerland, has broken no laws.
Provenance, however, remains a sensitive issue.
Times have changed, but not the Academy. The British Museum, the Getty and
other great museums refuse to buy unprovenanced objects nowadays, unless
they have a pedigree to show that they have been in private hands for a very
long time - say, in an English country house or Italian palazzo. The
Metropolitan Museum has handed back to Turkey fabulous silver and
silver-gilt treasures of around 400 BC which the Turkish government has
pressed hard for.
A New York commercial gallery has bowed to a campaign by American and Greek
archaeologists and the Greek government and is donating a collection of
Mycenaean gold that 'surfaced' recently, and probably comes from tombs in
southern Greece, to a charity - The Society for the Preservation of the
Greek Heritage - to pass on to Greece. Many countries have ratified the
Unesco Convention Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and
Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. But the UK, which is a major
clearing house for antiquities, has not subscribed.
In three ways we lose from antiquities theft. First, landowners lose. Ask
John Browning, the Suffolk farmer from whose fields the Roman 'Icklingham
Bronzes' were stolen. He had an almighty battle, ending with a law suit in
New York, to retrieve them. They will eventually come to the BM. In many
Mediterranean and Middle East countries the law is different. The state owns
all antiquities, but it does compensate landowners for finds that are
reported.
Secondly, countries lose their birthright when the pieces disappear abroad.
And finally, all of us, and particularly the home-country, are losing
because the finds are robbed of their historical value. They become a
tantalising travesty of what might have been discovered.
People often ask me what has been my best find, expecting to hear about
gold. I wish I could find some. But archaeology is not primarily about
precious objects. It is about finding out how people lived and developed
through looking at every possible scrap of evidence. The vital concept is
context.
Archaeologists are always trying to see everything in its setting, from the
layers of earth in digging a tomb that show that these jewels go with this
body, to the large issues of how the ancients used the landscape. The
thrills come from new connections that let one rewrite a line or two of
history.
Illicit digs destroy the context in the frantic rush to get the valuable
objects out before dawn. Anger when the objects overtake the history is not
merely priggish or politically correct. We have precious little history left
in the ground. Like coal and oil, it is a finite resource. Any bit we dig up
we must dig properly. Moonlight digging is vandalism. Through a chain of
middle men, the collectors create the demand. If we stop the demand, the
incentive to rob will wither.
And it will cut faking. Robbing breeds faking. When robbed goods are short,
fakes fill the gap. They are not expected to have a provenance either. It
may even be cheaper to pay one man to fake than to send a gang to rob with
picks and shovels - and with a bribe to the village policeman. Take the
third millennium BC marble figurines from the Cyclades. Twentieth century
collectors love them. They influenced Brancusi and Modigliani. It is
surprising how many exist, looted from the islands or, if not looted, faked.
There are some arguable benefits to exhibitions of antiquities collections -
they could, for example, bring the objects to the attention of possible
legitimate claimants. But I am unconvinced. As a long-time Friend of the
Royal Academy, I trust that this is the last time Burlington House holds
such a display.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Here is some good news for the arts. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts,
which was conceived by the pools promoters in a last minute bid to ward off
a national lottery, is to continue when the Lottery finally starts spouting
money next year.
The Foundation has turned into the proverbial Fairy Godmother. Thousands of
arts organisations, from the low-liest amateur dramatic group, like
Peterborough Opera, which has just received Pounds 3,096 to spice up
productions this season, to English National Opera at the Coliseum, which
was given Pounds 2.4m towards computerising its box office and buying its
freehold, have benefitted since the Foundation got going in 1991.
There was a fear that the pools promoters (basically Littlewoods) would wind
up the Foundation when the Lottery began as a competitor for the gambling
pennies of the nation, but now the pools' companies hope to continue to
finance the Foundation, unless, against their best research estimates, they
suffer the loss of 30 per cent or more of their revenue.
When launched the Foundation expected to distribute Pounds 60m a year,
Pounds 40m to sport (there cannot be a cricket club in the country that has
been slow-minded enough not to apply for funds towards a new pavilion) and
Pounds 20m to the arts. In fact it has done better than that. It gets its
money from a reduction in government betting tax and a levy on pools
turnover. This has exceeded expectation and the honey pot totalled Pounds
63.5m last year. Grattan Endicott, who runs the Foundation, expects to
distribute almost Pounds 70m this year, with the arts receiving around
Pounds 23m.
The advent of the Lottery is bound to hit the Foundation's income, perhaps
reducing its funding of the arts to nearer Pounds 15m a year, but it is
already seeking a niche in the new situation. Endicott is talking to the
Arts Council, which will handle the Lottery money earmarked for the arts,
estimated between Pounds 70m and Pounds 200m a year, to map out areas of
interest. It is likely that Lottery money will go towards the major projects
 -a new dance house for London; an opera house for Manchester - while the
Foundation concentrates on grass roots arts, organisations seeking Pounds
35,000 or less.
In preparation for the switch the Foundation has stopped its breath-taking
Pounds 500,000 hand outs, which brought joy to RADA, the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre, and Birmingham Rep, among others, and has fixed a top limit of
Pounds 150,000. Since most pools punters, who finance the scheme, are not
natural opera-goers Endicott thinks it fairer that the Pounds 1.3m cheque he
receives each Thursday should be distributed around sports and arts
activities likely to involve the greatest number of participants at local
level.
Perhaps the most traditionally English fair of the year is the World of
Drawings and Watercolours, which closes at London's Park Lane Hotel on
Sunday evening. This is was the occasion when, in times past, collectors
from the shires invested their Lloyds Bonus in a new watercolour.
That might be only a fond memory, but with interest rates so low, art lovers
are once again preferring to turn spare capital into antiques and business
for the 45 exhibitors is proving surprisingly brisk.
It has been helped by a technical breakthrough, glass which keeps out ultra
violet rays and prevents fading. This could transform the popularity of
watercolours and drawings. The fact that many owners had to hide them away
from sunlight often in folders, detracted from their appeal.
Dealer John Spink has covered all his stock with Tru View, a glass developed
in the US. He reckons that the glass is invisible, and makes watercolours as
easy to keep as oils. It has enabled him to make sales to Spanish and
Italian buyers whose Mediterannean sunshine was anathema to the art form. At
a cost of around Pounds 120 for an average picture it is a modest investment
for peace of mind.
The most expensive picture on offer at the fair, a Turner watercolour of
Conway Castle which Leger Galleries is offering for Pounds 400,000, is also
covered by the new glass, this time a German version. It is a pity that the
British, who pioneered the watercolour, should now depend on foreign
breakthroughs for their continued popularity.
The Tate Gallery's policy of switching around its stock each January a has
done wonders for attendances. They have risen by over half a million, to
1.76m last year, since 1990. What has not changed is the popularity of the
Tate's pictures as reflected in the sales of post cards at its shop. This
beauty parade seems changeless. Last year the list was headed as always by
that popular favourite, Millais' floating Ophelia, followed by Waterhouse's
equally romantic and escapist Lady of Shalott.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Man who laid the golden egg - The Faberge exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more to Karl Faberge than Imperial Easter Eggs - those absurd
gem-encrusted confections concealing miniature 'surprises' that might be
mechanical strutting peacocks or working models of the Trans-Siberian
Express in gold and platinum. The House of Faberge also produced silver
vessels, clocks, carved hardstone animals and flowers, icons, jewels and any
number of exquisitely enamelled petits riens. The tragedy is that all of it
is, to some extent, rather vulgar.
Consummate craftsmanship cannot redeem most Faberge from being simply
ostentatiously expensive trinkets designed to amuse the jaded palates of
Europe. Most offensive of all are those objects that masquerade as
functional items. A tour-de-force is the salt cellar that takes the form of
a miniature Louis XVI bidet crafted in gold and enamel and studded with seed
pearls. A hardstone head of an Indian Brave turns neatly into a vodka cup.
There can be few more eloquent witnesses to their age than Kaiser Wilhelm
II's silver helmet that so conveniently doubles as a cigar box.
What remained of the Faberge business in 1918 was closed by the Bolsheviks.
Last year, the Russian people have had their first opportunity since 1902 to
appraise the Imperial jewellers. The exhibition at the Hermitage in St
Petersburg, which travelled on to Paris and is currently at the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London, was the brainchild of the Faberge Arts Foundation,
an international group of scholars committed to restoring the Faberge house
at 24 Bolshaya Morshaka and establishing within a museum and jewellery
workshops.
No doubt the documentation and designs only recently uncovered in various
Russian archives - the academic underpinning of the show - will be a draw to
Faberge buffs. So, too, will the 150 or so objects on loan from Russian
museums, including a group of fakes or Fauxberge. But the truth is that any
show of Faberge will pull the crowds.
This is one art that is truly popular. Faberge represents an opulence beyond
the dreams of most men. Moreover, the history of so many pieces is the stuff
of romantic fiction - all those gifts to and from beloved royal wives and
mistresses.
It is impossible not to marvel at the craftsmanship, ingenuity and technical
innovation invested in these artefacts. The lustrous enamels, for which
Faberge was world famous, are a case in point. Faberge offered some 144
different hues; the most their competitors could manage was 30 or 40. They
used six or seven different coloured golds; the 18th century had known only
four.
The various Faberge workmasters reveal themselves adept at adapting and
transforming a range of historical styles, from Renaissance to Mughal and
the cloisonne enamel objects in Old Russian style favoured by the Boyars and
rich bourgeois clients of the Moscow workshops. In contrast to all this
historicism is the Art Nouveau of which Faberge was a leading exponent. A
disappointment of the show is that captions make scant reference to the
striking semi-precious and exotic materials employed.
The exhibition also belies the myth that Faberge only worked on minute
scale. Almost the first object we see is a monumental silver-gilt kovsh or
traditional Russian drinking cup used by the Danish kings as a wine cooler.
At the other extreme is the quintessential superior Christmas-cracker
novelty: a miniature replica of the Russian Imperial regalia mounted on tiny
velvet cushions and glittering with over 3,500 diamonds. The regalia drew
vast crowds at the Exposition Universelle in Paris 1900. Almost a century
on, the public is still drawn.
Faberge: Imperial Jeweller, sponsored by Elida Gibbs, continues at the V&amp;A
until April 10. Admission Pounds 4.75

FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: The Breughel of the suburbs - A middlebrow moralist
with a taste for the grotesque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFFLICTION by Fay Weldon HarperCollins Pounds 12.99, 172 pages
Out of the gutter of wild desire on to the smooth lawns of married love' -
that, says Fay Weldon in her famous novel The Life and Loves of a She Devil,
is women's destiny.
Weldon's entire oeuvre, some 20 works of fiction written since the mid
1970s, is a comic, angry scrutiny of how this fate turns sour. In simple
fables, highly coloured, full of larger than life, stock characters, she
depicts the conflicts of sex, power and man's inhumanity to women. She is
unique in contemporary fiction: a feminist who is also a popular,
station-bookstall novelist.
Original visions or politically correct potboilers? Weldon's flare is for
the grotesque, for creating gargoyle-characters like the She Devil, a clumsy
giantess of a rejected wife who leaves her children, burns down her house,
chops herself up to become as dainty as her husband's mistress, and returns
to imprison and humiliate him. When this sort of black fantasy works, Weldon
is our Breughel of the suburbs, exaggerating fallen everyday life into a
blaze of chaos and sin and witty discontent. But when it fails, she is an
unsubtle puppeteer, playing around with hollow figures, spouting cliches: a
dull, too-topical moralist for our times.
Affliction takes an hour to read and seems dated even before one has
finished it. Annette and Spicer, TV researcher and wine merchant, are Mr and
Mrs 1990s: media lunches, recessionary worries, pizzas and videos, Father's
Night at the antenatal clinic. When Spicer suddenly becomes less caring than
expected, they both panic, and each secretly seeks out a therapist.
Their shrinks - you guessed it? - turn out to be a married couple as mixed
up as they are, and intent on making their patients even more miserable.
Confessions, insanities, infidelities, traumas, come tumbling out. Who is
the voice of reason in the Hampstead madhouse?
Weldon of course tips the scales: confused Annette is the vulnerable naive
victim; confused Spicer the feckless vicious manipulator. But the sex war,
the heart of a Weldon novel, here lacks the comic energy which inspired
books like the She Devil or The Hearts and Lives of Men. The jokes in
Affliction are feeble. The money-grubbing, body-grabbing middle European
shrinks are predictable, unfunny stage villains. The absurdist denouement -
haemorrhages, hospitals, quacks, a ride with a truck driver whose fee is sex
every 50 miles - is recounted in flat depressing tones.
'Truck drivers are expected to be brutes. Terrible things happen to girls on
the road . . . but Spicer is meant to be civilised, and you are his wife.
Spicer is worse than the truck drivers,' says Annette's best friend. The
leitmotif of Weldon's novels is that sex and greed win out over
civilisation. Show this through a fantasy of grotesques and caricatures, and
you have a comedy where ideas and images dovetail, and where even Weldon's
notoriously sloppy style fits in with the vision of chaos. Show it through a
middlebrow peep at partner-swapping among media folk, and you have just that
 -a tale as flimsy and artless as a gossip column.

disturbing story of the Birmingham Six

CRUEL FATE: ONE MAN'S TRIUMPH OVER INJUSTICE by Hugh Callaghan Poolbeg
hardback Pounds 16.99, 207 pages; paperback Pounds 4.99, 237 pages
After 16 years in prison for the Birmingham pub bombings, with which he had
no connection, Hugh Callaghan spent his first night of freedom at a
television company's expense in a smart Berkshire Hotel. He opened his
wardrobe door in the morning to receive an unpleasant shock. A 'screw'
(prison officer) was standing in the room. It took Callaghan a moment to
realise that the figure was his own reflection in the long mirror.
The disorientation caused by his terrible 16-year experience has not been
easy to overcome. This book, written with an unaffected simplicity which
gives it disturbing strength, is evidence that he has completed the process.
It is also a humble but devastating indictment of the moral corruption that
can lie at the heart of those British institutions which Michael Portillo
says should command 'social respect.'
Society's respect for the law depends largely on the law's ability to make
itself respected. It is due only to the conscientious work of
'disrespectful' people like Chris Mullin MP that the law, which had for 16
years so complacently refused to listen to their protestations of innocence,
eventually released Callaghan and the five other men.
They were released, however, in a manner which ensured that the full truth
did not emerge of the flawed process which had ruined their lives, and left
the relatives of 21 people murdered in Birmingham equally without justice.
This leaves respect for the law still wanting. People in high places can
whisper that the convictions of the Birmingham Six were quashed 'only on a
technicality.' They are put to shame here by the modesty with which
Callaghan tells his story, in conjunction with Sally Mulready.
The story's force comes from reliance on the power of the unsophisticated
word. By the time Callaghan finds himself, to his bewilderment, in the hands
of the police, you know the sort of straightforward man he is - an Aston
Villa supporter fond of the occasional drink and a bet. His happiest
memories of poor childhood, in the Belfast from which he had emigrated, are
of playing football with a tennis ball in the streets; his worst memories of
being beaten by a drunken father.
After his arrest, though Callaghan never claimed to have been badly beaten
by the police, as were the others, you soon find yourself asking if it can
really be Britain in which such things are happening. For it becomes all too
possible in these pages to see how a man can be brought to confess to a
crime he did not commit. His description is primarily of psychological
torture but he strikes a chill when, on arrival at Lancaster prison for the
trial, still officially on remand, he remarks placidly: 'I began to realise
that I was reasonably safe from assault here.'
The few simple pages describing his bewilderment at the trial portray, as
forcibly as any detailed study of the vast documentation available, that it
was -for all its assumption of authority -a mockery of what authority ought
to be. Not, of course, that there was any shortage of the proper procedures.
The learned judge took three days to sum up. Callaghan writes: 'He lost his
voice at one stage; but he could have saved his breath.'
The same quiet note pervades the rest of the disturbing story - an account,
over many years, of the degradation of prison life as hope and despair
alternate like the seasons, while self-respect and the knowledge that
dishonour is not on his side keeps him going. It is a quietness in which one
can hear a number of pins drop - the second-rate quality of certain of the
higher prison officials, including most of the (Catholic) chaplains, and the
third-rate -and worse -quality of some of the lower officials. There are a
number of ugly sounds too but they are conveyed with a near-poetic touch.
'There were many people in Albany who were mentally unstable. At night I
could hear them screaming and talking to themselves, or sometimes laughing
hysterically. It was a strange, terrible sound, bouncing off the walls of
the prison.'
Yes, this is a book about much more than a monstrous miscarriage of justice.
One for Mr. Portillo in fact.

unconventional women in Victorian fiction

FALLEN WOMEN IN THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL by Tom Winnifrith Macmillan/St
Martin's Press Pounds 35, 178 pages
The serialisation of Middlemarch on BBC-2 currently in progress has focussed
the attention of the nation on the position of young women in Victorian
society. Tom Winnifrith's study of Fallen Women in the Nineteenth-Century
Novel is a timely exposition of not only George Eliot's but of the other
major Victorian novelists' concern with the problem of women making
something of their lives other than as adjuncts to men.
In Victorian Britain 'fallen woman' was a way of referring to a woman who
had eloped and lived in sin with a lover (as George Eliot did) and/or who
bore a child outside of wedlock. Winnifrith finds several among the heroines
and villainnesses of Austen, Bronte, Thackeray, Dickens, Hardy as well as in
George Eliot.
Clare Tomalin's recent study The Invisible Woman showed how closely the
notion was ingrained in the life of Dickens let alone his fiction.
Winnifrith contrasts the crude punitive view of the fallen woman in a novel
such as the highly popular East Lynne by Mrs Henry Wood with the sensitive
attitude of George Eliot to, say, Maggie Tulliver mistakenly accused of
eloping in The Mill on the Floss.
'Maggie's failings (he writes) fade into insignificance when compared with
those of the society that condemns her. She is technically innocent, but
feels herself guilty and tries to make amends for her guilt. Eliot was
technically guilty, but felt herself innocent . . .'
In her Prelude to Middlemarch Eliot lamented the lack of a convenient
yardstick by which to make moral judgments about women. 'If she said' wryly,
'there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to
count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with
scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits
of variation are really much wider than anyone would imagine from the
sameness of women's coiffure and the favourite love-stories in prose or
verse'.
Gillian Beer, in her Darwin's Plots (1983) seized on the word 'variation' in
that passage and pointed out that it is one of the key-terms in The Origin
of Species which George Eliot read when it appeared in 1859, 13 years before
she began to write 'Miss Brooke', the first part of Middlemarch. Beer's
interpretation of the novel as an example of 'evolutionary narrative' hinges
on vastly more than the coincidence of a single term; but one effect of the
television serial is to support her account by giving us a compelling image
of the Darwinian 'complex interdependency' of life in Middlemarch.
Eliot apologised to her publisher George Blackwood for Middlemarch's
excessive length but said it was essential to bring out the complexity of
her project. Seeing it week by week enables us to experience it in the way
it was given to its first readers. Like so many of the great Victorian
novels it was published first in instalments - in Blackwood's Magazine,
1871-2. Eliot was engaged in writing the final parts while the earlier ones
were being serialised.
Two ladies who were avid readers came up to her and one, she tells us, said
'How could you let Dorothea marry that Casaubon?'. The other, 'Oh, I
understand her doing that, but why did you let her marry the other fellow
(Ladislaw) whom I cannot bear?'. Winnifrith points out that this public
acclaim had an inhibiting effect on Victorian novelists. They had to cope
with a censorious Mrs Grundy who had total sway over what could and could
not be described. Frankness about sex was completely forbidden.
Part of the fascination of Winnifrith's study is his uncovering of the
hidden sexual agenda below the surface, from clues planted in the texts of
the novels. On television this can be done by the camera. In part two of the
serial, for example, there was a scene where Anthony Page showed us Dorothea
(Juliet Aubrey) and Casaubon (Patrick Malahide) in bed together - a scene no
Victorian novelist could ever describe directly. She looks thoughtful,
puzzled, disappointed. He sleeps lightly. She turns and kisses him on the
brow. He makes no response except one of faint disturbance and dislike.
The crucial fact about Casaubon is his impotence. He is intellectually
impotent but also sexually impotent. This is indicated in a number of ways
that Winnifrith attempts to decode. One of the earthier minor characters,
Mrs Cadwallader, describes Casaubon as a 'great bladder for dried peas to
rattle in'; among similar descriptions there is a punning clue in the name
of Casaubon's parish. It is called Lowick - a reference to the limp male
member.
In Middlemarch there are hints of illegitimacy but no real fallen women.
Dorothea's problem is that her vast creative energy and capacity for life is
cruelly frustrated by her marriages. But from Lydia Bennet, the eloper in
Pride and Prejudice, to Hardy's Tess the field is large and Winnifrith shows
how greatly attitudes changed to fallen women during the eight decades that
we call the Victorian period. My only reservation about his book is that it
is at times too compressed for comfort.
Winnifrith might well have extended his study to the Edwardian era when the
fallen woman had such a dazzling career on the London stage in plays like A
Woman of No Importance and The Second Mrs Tanqueray. In this manifestation
she survived until the early 1950s. Her final appearance was as Hester
Collyer in Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea where she escapes ultimate suicide,
the fate of so many of her Victorian sisters. Hester's survival was thanks
to some neighbours, one in particular who was a dab-hand at psychotherapy.
We have reached the modern period.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: Flawed visions - Bryan Appleyard's first novel

<TEXT>
THE FIRST CHURCH OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM by Bryan Appleyard Doubleday Pounds
14.99, 272 pages
Those familiar with the journalism and other non-fiction writings of Bryan
Appleyard will expect his first novel to be daring in theme and flawed in
execution. They will not be disappointed.
Appleyard's last book, Understanding the present: science and the soul of
modern man was a sweeping polemic against 'spiritually corrosive'
scientists. Before that came Culture Club: Crisis in the arts and then Art
and imagination in post-war Britain. In between he gave us what must be
judged a bonsai in landscapes of such scale, a biography of the architect,
Richard Rogers.
The intellectual terrain of this novel is also ambitious. Stephen Rix is an
architect in mid-life crisis, using a stupidly fast car to zip between
mediocre projects, a family he has ceased to notice and a mistress who
arouses everything but his curiosity. Then one day, in a field outside his
country house, he experiences, with all the impressiveness of virtual
reality, a vision of a gothic cathedral. When he allows this hopeful
inspiration to be captured by a property developer for whom spirits are
found only in bottles, he is propelled to the edge of doom. A final,
anarchic act of intellectual freedom does not alter the essential bleakness
of this post-modern fable.
Appleyard is an impetuous writer and thus not always master of the novel's
tone. This shifts between dense and heaving passages of gothic imagination,
comic juxtaposition, irony and even brief parody of the pulp romance. It is
presumably meant to be funny that a sculptor Rix meets in the pub spouts
metaphysics and immediately acquires the significance of John the Baptist.
Yet the serious side of the story requires this pre-Messianic intensity to
have some credibility and power to engage.
The church building becomes an occasion for mystical knee-trembling, for
examining the nature of reality, as well as for lectures on the mathematical
perfections of gothic style - 'the precariousness and the disturbing energy
were the point.' But Rix's neglected and over-efficient wife surely scores a
hit when she accuses her husband of 'elevating your own wants and needs to
some great system' or, as his partner puts it, of working in 'adulterer's
gothic.'
Although the book's characters are incompletely established, there is some
shrewd description of life around the architectural practice, whose members
inhabit a millennial society which glumly echoes the style pages of today's
Sunday Times. The author has a talent for arresting images, as when Rix's
two main tormentors park their elaborate cars at his front door in a
T-formation 'as if signalling to passing aircraft that this was the right
house to bomb.'
With Appleyard, however, it is the boldness of the canvas which demands
attention. Some of the ideas stimulate, even thrill, just as others collapse
through rotten rafters of cliche or superficiality. We are led pleasurably
enough into speculation about the origins of religion and the problem of
modernity. But when Rix tells us that at their first meeting his wife saw
straight through his 'vacuous, supposedly intriguing generalisations,' some
readers may encounter alarming gothic visions of Mr Appleyard.
It is no doubt too crude to see the early-40s Appleyard in the early-40s
Rix. Yet I could not help thinking that the advice Rix receives from his
florid partner, Orlando, for dealing with the perils of one's 42nd year come
uncomfortably close to circumscribing the limits of this novel's
achievement. 'The important thing,' says Orlando, 'is not to say or do
anything boring.'
This is a clever novel; some will think too clever for its own good. And it
is certainly less boring than watching Middlemarch on TV.

THE VIRTUAL COMMUNITY by Howard Rheingold Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 25
pages
Three years ago, Senator Al Gore's High performance Computing Act was signed
into law by President Bush. It outlined Gore's vision for 'highways of the
mind' to be mapped by federal research and development and brought to
citizens by private enterprise. Like the railways in the 19th- and the
telephone system in the 20th-century, there is a technological revolution
afoot which stretches wherever a computer can be linked to others via
satellite. The global village is becoming a global desk.
Howard Rheingold has written another first-rate book on computer technology.
In 1991 his Virtual Reality was a clear, comprehensive guide to the
technical and moral issues surrounding the three-dimensional computer-made
worlds we are making in research, business and entertainment.
Now, Rheingold has done the same for computer networks in The Virtual
Community. Using a communication programme and a telephone line, Rheingold
is a world electronic citizen, in touch with thousands of others through a
series of local and interconnecting networks which reaches from home in
California to wherever there is anyone to speak to him.
He calls it The Net, an informal term for the coterie of computer networks
using computer-mediated commun-ications to link people around the world into
public discussions; there is a directory called The Matrix (John Quarterman,
1990); and the shared computer space-time in which networkers communicate is
called Cyberspace, broadly speaking, an electronic version of an
18th-century coffee house. Rheingold envisages an 'online metropolis' where
you make friends (irrespective of race, creed, colour, gender or capability)
according to shared interests rather than chance proximity.
Rheingold has chapters on his own local network in San Francisco, on daily
life in cyberspace, on pornographie in the Parisian Minitel system, and on
online activism in the computer hacking community. He offers printouts of
online discussions, and assembles a credible picture of what it means to
spend two hours a day on a computer talking to other people. His light
liberal touch guides the book through electronic activism and
'Disinformacy', drawing on McLuhan, Habermas, Foucault and Bentham. It makes
a stimulating read. The style is lucid and the issues lively.
Rheingold makes big promises: the Net - 'an ecosystem of subcultures' - will
change our perceptions of ourselves, offer the chance of 'many to many'
communication (opposed to TV's 'few to one'), and alter our models of
representative democracy. Some of these may be partially true for the
computer-literate. The larger questions are those of ownership and control.
The world's first Network was the US Defense Department Advance Research
Projects Agency's ARPANET, designed in the 1970s to allow researchers to
operate computers at a distance.
The Net is fast, cheap, widely available and, commercially and politically,
up for grabs. It breaks down the boundaries between professional and amateur
by making information accessible to a range of people; universities are
already reverting to the 18th century by recognising they have no monopoly
on academic and intellectual property, and the Net will push that
development further, undermining institutions based merely on knowledge.
What emerges from Rheingold's excellent book is a range of information and
issues shaped for the non-specialist; it is deftly written and scrupulously
precise. Rheingold makes space for his wry wit and his social concerns.
Secker and Warburg have yet to publish Virtual Community electronically; it
should be available online within a decade or so.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Gardening: The seeds of recovery - Robin Lane Fox sorts
through the fakes and pseudonyms in Britain's nurseries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Down among the packets, I have just seen evidence which calls the consumer
recovery into doubt. Among the sweet pea seeds and cornflowers, you can walk
away with a pseudo-wisteria, with flowers of a deeper purple and an odder
shape than you have ever seen before. Its leaves are a bit strange, too.
Actually, they are not real but 'simulated' and the accompanying leaflet
advises you to maintain them with the help of your hair dryer.
Pseudo-wisteria is fake from top to bottom. 'Made in England' by Pouliot
Designs, a market leader, it can be yours for only Pounds 155.10 if the
station managers of British Rail do not get there first and buy it as part
of the Pleasure-from-Platforms programme.
What are consumers supposed to be recovering - their nerve or their senses?
Those of us who think they have recovered both already will not be surprised
if sales of pseudo-wisteria are falling below projections. For Pounds
155.10, you could buy a dozen good plants of the real thing. Or you could
buy 120 packets of flower seeds and stock your own garden to maturity by
1996.
Indeed, from now on, you need less of the hair-dryer and more of the seed
packet. In steady progression, each weekend from now until the Chelsea
flower show is an important time for sowing.
Begin with seeds of your own geraniums: sow indoors immediately. They are
vastly cheaper than plants at Pounds 2 each in May and they really are not
difficult if you can start them in a steady heat of 20`C-22`C. At the same
time, remember the electric blue salvia Patens, never a mass of flower but
always a dream of a colour late in August if you sow it now in similar heat.
In town gardens, you could also house cobaea Scandens, the rapid cover for
walls and eyesores. Sow it indoors now and pot it on individually, training
each plant up its own bamboo cane before it goes outdoors up a wall in May
and reaches 15ft during one season. Thompson and Morgan, of London Road,
Ipswich, Suffolk IP2 OBA (tel: 0473-688821) still sell the white form, which
is the best at Pounds 1.99 for five seeds.
Last year, I had a prize-winning, board-sweeping, Sloane-stopping success.
Everybody wanted it; now, the white venidium is available on open stands in
good garden centres. This marvellous annual costs Pounds 1.69 for 80 seeds
from Unwins of Histon, Cambridge, (0945-588522) or Pounds 1.69 for 100 from
Thompson and Morgan. Unwins calls it Black and White and I think T and M
calls it Queen of the Veldt but the reality needs no special name - just
praise for white daisy flowers with a huge, black centre.
White venidium loves a dry, stony soil and opens fully in sunshine up to a
height of 2-3ft. It is one of the few excellent things I have which even
Sissinghurst's white garden has yet to discover - it is a marvellous new
annual and does not need a blow-dryer.
Seedsmen, meanwhile, are extending a silly ploy this year. Well-known forms
are being given dotty names and, unless you see through the folklore, you
might think your best friends have been discontinued. Perhaps Latin is no
longer a language for the semi-educated but, if we are going to be sold
tobacco plants called Fragrant Cloud or flax called Bright Eyes, could not
the botanically-correct be reassured on the packet that the seeds are the
same old Nicotiana affinis and Linum grandiflorum?
I mind about these changes because both these annuals are essential buys for
the summer. Fragrant Cloud is the tall, white tobacco plant which smelt
heavenly when we all were children. Breeders stamped on it, though, because
municipal bedders wanted compact little hummocks which would not be
flattened by rain; something as wide-eyed and monotonous as clones from
Pollyanna.
Be warned, too: when I tried to buy more tobacco plants last May, almost
everyone could offer only the dreaded Domino mix or the even more dreaded
Nikki. They are municipal monsters with no stature. The new breakthrough,
Pink Nikki, will also be marketed widely but it is a beastly colour fit only
for politically faint-hearted councils.
A few plants of the hyper-tall tobacco, Nicotiana Sylvestris, go very much
further and will light up an entire garden if dotted singly around its beds.
I had a crop failure last year but these white giants with thin, drooping
flowers usually reach 5ft by August.
The catalogue for connoisseurs is the one from Chiltern Seeds of Ulverston,
Cumbria (0229-581137), which is offering an improved form of this giant
tobacco called Only The Lonely. It also has the jade-green Brazilian
Nicotiana langsdorfii, an essential tobacco at 2ft. While sold rarely as
plants in May, it is excellent for those who want unusual plants for pots or
expatriate bolt-holes.
Blacks and whites seem to be riding a new wave. Thompson and Morgan is
offering seeds of a remarkable new aquilegia called Magpie, with flowers
that look smart enough for a button-hole in Cecil Beaton's filmed version of
the Ascot races. Black and white nemophila is being marketed as Penny Black
and after my success with Five Spot, its spotted companion, I think I will
have to try it.
To restore the balance, white cosmos daisies will have their usual run of my
garden. Because they are generally sold to lazy gardeners as young plants in
May, you need to order seeds now. The best is still the taller Purity,
although the lists try to tell you otherwise. It is my essential companion
for pots, rose beds, or anywhere which needs height up to 3ft.
You see how white has crept up on me - yet, white gardeners still look to
petunias and leave other white annuals to fend for themselves. I am still
booking my other non-white favourites: blues like Love-in-a-Mist, deep blue
phacelia and dark blue trailing lobelia, a plant of real class if you
segregate it. But I am also trying to outflank the homeopaths.
They have been telling us for years that evening primrose will cure anything
from broken hearts to cellulite. It will now cure over-coloured borders
because we can buy seed of Oenothera pallida, which is sold as Innocence. It
has a slight tinge of pink, like innocence with a lush, but it is a gentle
plant for placing wherever you want soft flowers throughout the summer. And
this evening primrose has a virtue above all the half-hardy annuals which I
have set above pseudo-wisteria: it will grow for anyone who can follow basic
instructions on a packet.
Never believe it is difficult to grow your own annuals. Consumers should
recover their Innocence: if they choose the right ones, they will find it no
more bother than vacuuming the pseudo-wisteria at 100 times the price.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Motoring: Worth every yen - Stuart Marshall predicts UK
success for Mazda's latest luxury model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's quality car-makers have not been best pleased to hear Americans
asking why they should buy another BMW or Mercedes when they can get the
same quality and reliability, and lots more equipment, for less money from
Japan?
They are talking about the posh brands, of course: the Lexus (Toyota),
Accura (Honda), Infiniti (Nissan) and Xedos (Mazda). The Lexus, in
particular, has profited at Germany's expense in the US and, to a lesser
extent, Europe.
Can Mazda do likewise in Britain with the latest Xedos? I think it might. It
will not be due to lack of ambition or product quality if it fails; this is
a car on which any manufacturer would be pleased to put its badge.
Whereas the Xedos 6 (this column, November 29 1993) is pitched against the
BMW 3-Series, the larger Xedos 9 is targeted mainly at owners or users of
the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and, perhaps, the top end
of the new C-Class.
There is a very strong family resemblance between the Xedos 6 and 9. Inside
and out, the styling emphasis is on curves. The body shell is galvanised and
has an eight-year anti-corrosion warranty.
Unlike its main rivals, which have rear-wheel drive, the 168 horsepower
produced by the Xedos 9's 2.5-litre, 24-valve V6 goes to the front wheels
via a silky, four-speed automatic transmission, with no manual gearbox
option. But, even on wet roads, you would never know it was front-wheel
driven. A traction control system - using the same electronics as the
anti-lock brakes - eliminates wheel-spin and, with it, torque steer. (This
is the disagreeable tugging sometimes felt through the steering of muscular
front-drive cars).
The Xedos 9 would take very good care of an aggressive, must-be-in-front
driver because it holds the road and handles securely, whether accelerating,
cornering or braking. Other users, while appreciating its excellent
dynamics, would revel in the quiet, smooth way it progresses.
It might sound like a back-handed compliment but I shall think of the Xedos
9 as Mazda's Lexus. Both are so tranquil that you must pay close attention
to the speedometer on a motorway.
The velour-trimmed seats are supportive (although not as hard as they tend
to be in top-quality German cars). Tall people will discover that the Xedos
9's only real snag is a steering wheel adjustable for reach but not for
tilt. If you stand over 6ft, the rim could obscure the tops of some of the
instruments.
Otherwise, a typical business motorist would find a Pounds 24,399 Xedos 9
difficult to fault. It is equipped lavishly. In addition to automatic
transmission and traction control, the price includes air-conditioning,
cruise control, driver and front passenger air bags, remote-control central
locking with alarm and immobiliser, and a high-class stereo radio/tape
player. Leather trim is the only optional extra.
Mazda claims a top speed of 130mph (210kph) and 0-62mph (0-100kph)
acceleration in 11 seconds. With a likely consumption on a journey of
26-27mpg (10.5-10.9 l/100km) and a 68-litre tank, its refuelling range is
about 350 miles (560 km).

FT  29 JAN 94 / Motoring: Modern cars out of their depth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The floods have gone - for now - but many motorists are still counting the
cost of trying to drive through them. They are faced with bills for
re-building engines wrecked by water sucked through air intakes. The result
can be dramatic.
Water cannot be compressed. If even an eggcup full gets through the air
intake into the combustion chamber - the space between the cylinder head and
piston top - there will be a very expensive noise. It will be the sound of
one or more of the connecting rods bending or breaking, leading to a damaged
cylinder head and, quite possibly, to a hole being smashed in the cylinder
block.
Unfortunate motorists who have had to pay up to Pounds 5,000 for complete
engine re-builds, have complained to the car-makers, dealers and motoring
organisations. They have had little satisfaction.
Many drivers with comprehensive policies have found insurance companies do
not automatically regard engines wrecked by flood water as having been
damaged accidentally. Cars, they are told, are designed to be driven on
roads, not through shallow lakes.
Years ago, cars with lots of space under the bonnet and air intakes high
above their engines could manage a foot (30cm) of flood water if driven
slowly. Not so modern cars, which are shaped by fashion, the need for good
forward vision and minimum aerodynamic drag. Together, this means that
bonnets - and engine air pick-up points - have to be low.
The Automobile Association has been contacted by many aggrieved members,
including one who destroyed the engine of a two-week old car driving through
floods. But Roy Staunton, of AA Technical Services, has simple advice for
any driver of a modern car confronted by water. If it is more than 10in
(25cm) deep at the very maximum, do not even think of driving through.
If, however, you must proceed, drive very slowly indeed so that it does not
splash up under the bonnet or make a bow wave. Says Staunton: 'I don't mean
reducing your speed from 40mph (64kph) to 20mph (32kph) but, literally, to a
walking pace.'

FT  29 JAN 94 / Gardening: Bring on the predators - Country View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unlikely saviours of British cereal farming may be the humble beetles
which prey on aphids, cereal's natural enemy.
The traditional response to the threat of aphids has been spraying, usually
two or three times a year and at enormous cost.
But since 1984, British scientists have been testing ways of stimulating the
population of natural predators, such as beetles, ladybirds, hoverflies and
spiders.
Up to 400 species of useful insect predators live in the hedgerows of
southern England and research has been aimed at identifying which are the
most useful, and how farmland can be managed in a way that benefits them.
Time-lapse videos have shown how efficiently predators thin out pests, how
far they forage, and so on.
Long mounds called 'beetle banks' were built - higher and therefore drier
than surrounding land, and if planted with beetle-friendly tussock grasses
also warmer. From these hospitable surroundings, beetles make forays in
summer to feed, roving up to 100 yards outwards.
The Biology Department of Southampton University has been joined by
scientists from the Game Conservancy, which is interested in beetles and
natural predators as part of its crusade to dissuade farmers from using
'broad-spectum' insecticides which leave areas of land devoid of small
creatures.
Dr Nigel Boatman of the Game Conservancy says beetle banks make sound
commercial sense. Against the savings on insecticides, he calculates that a
beetle bank 400 yards long, big enough for a 50-acre field, would cost only
Pounds 90 (a one-off figure which includes cultivation, seed, and an
adjustment for loss of the crop in the strip).
One must beware of over-simplification. 'Biological controls,' explains
Janice Hickman of Southampton University, 'are not totally predictable.'
There can be marked differences in annual populations of both pest and
predator and 'biological succession' can see some species being replaced by
others.
Hickman has been working on hoverflies, another excellent aphid predator,
but one which needs plenty of nectar and pollen. Hoverflies lay eggs in June
and the larvae are ready to munch into action just when needed for summer
wheat.
Hickman puts predator encouragement into perspective. She believes there
will always be a need for pesticides. She thinks now in terms of integrated
pest management - a mixture of methods including fungus-resistant plants,
phacelias and beetle banks for natural aphid controls, as well as some
fungicides (for mildew) and herbicides (for weeds), neither of which natural
controls can address.
There is certainly huge interest among farmers in encouraging beneficial
insects. The idea has caught the imagination of farmers at a time when
public concern about chemical inputs has coincided with a political
determination to scale down agricultural production.
The instinctive fear that uprooting hedges was harmful is being proved
right. A well-known and successful Essex farmer who has barely used any
insecticides for 10 years, told me his neighbours all agreed their heaviest
yields were in the smallest, hedge-ringed fields. The predator insects have
been playing their part in pest control all along - when not killed off
them-selves.
Beetle banks, after all, are a form of substitute hedgerow, but without the
sheltering benefits. Phacelias are a substitute for old-fashioned
wildflower-infested hedgerows. To advance into the future, today's farmers
may need to step back into the past.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Property: An English Tuscany - A touch of old Italy in
historic Worcestershire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flat river bottoms and stumpy hills make Worcestershire an English version
of Tuscany as we see it in early Italian paintings. But green is the
dominant colour, not white or beige.
Much of that green comes from flooding by the county's rivers. At its core,
they have formed a large plain between hills on three sides. Chief among
them is the Severn, which starts in neighbouring Wales and flows through
Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester to the Bristol Channel. Others include
the Teme, the Stour and the Avon (known better at Stratford-upon-Avon,
Shakespeare's birthplace). The rivers were the main transport link before
the Industrial Revolution brought the railways.
The Malvern Hills bound Worcestershire on the west. To the north-east, the
Clent and Lickey Hills separate the county from greater Birmingham. To the
east are the Cotswolds.
Birmingham, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Bristol are reached easily on the M5
motorway. For London, though, you must take a route that starts in the wrong
direction - north, towards Birmingham. Then it turns east onto the M42 (the
Birmingham southern ring road) and south-east to the M40 for a 2 1/2 -hour
drive to the capital.
Worcester's county cricket ground - among the most beautiful in England -
has been flooded often by the Severn. It is just across the bridge from the
town centre, ideal for spectators fleeing the office on summer afternoons.
If the players flag, they can look to the nearby cathedral for inspiration.
The racecourse is also in the water meadows and just as easy to reach.
It is a fertile county and farming thrives, notably fruit and vegetables in
the Vale of Evesham. Wool from Wales and the Cotswolds made textiles a big
business which survives - just - in a few carpet factories at Kidderminster.
Potting, the other traditional speciality, can be seen at the Royal
Worcester works.
Worcestershire's many handsome Georgian facades show how all the county's
towns prospered in the 18th century. Brick replaced the traditional timber
framing, with its black- painted beams which make a bold check pattern
against the white lath and plaster infill. But some half-timbering did
continue into Victorian times - and the 20th century - as a veneer over the
brick.
Bewdley is one such Georgian town, a place of narrow streets and striking
houses where Stanley Baldwin, prime minister at the time of Edward VIII's
abdication in 1936 and later Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, was born. Quays on the
Severn flank a substantial bridge (designed by Thomas Telford) leading to a
broad market place where people from both sides of the river could trade.
Late in the 18th century, though, it was eclipsed by the new town of
Stourport.
Two grand red brick houses in Bewdley, needing work but both with plenty of
potential, are on offer from Andrew Grant. Tickenhill Manor, listed grade
II* for its history and Georgian architecture, was Crown property until
1873. Henry VII's eldest son, Prince Arthur, married Catherine of Aragon by
proxy at Tickenhill's chapel in 1499. Henry VIII made the house into a place
for his daughter, Mary.
In the Civil War, it was a royalist stronghold (as, indeed, the county was
generally; Worcester itself was 'the faithful city' where Charles II took
refuge, before fleeing abroad, after losing the battle of Worcester in
1651).
The house, on high ground above Bewdley with open country behind, has a
bow-fronted dining room and panelled drawing room, while the main bedrooms
have windows to the floor. Asking price is Pounds 310,000.
The other house, Kateshill, for which Pounds 290,000 is sought, was on the
Tickenhill estate. Originally Hillside House, it was renamed for Catherine
of Braganza, wife of Charles II, who liked its views. It has good-sized
rooms, cornices galore and a double flight of steps to the front door.
The garden is sombre, dark-leaved Victorian but a fine backdrop for the
rhododendrons when in flower. Its glory is a huge Spanish sweet chestnut
planted by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord High Admiral of England, to celebrate the
birth of a daughter.
Priced at Pounds 425,000 is another brick house, Newbury, at Lower
Broadheath near Worcester; this village was the birthplace of Sir Edward
Elgar, the composer. Agent Stewart White (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate)
also offers the brick Manor House at Clifton-upon-Teme, 11 miles from
Worcester, for Pounds 325,000. In Pershore, Grant has a Georgian brick
townhouse, Abbey Place, for Pounds 190,000.
Traditional black and white houses include Tundridge Grange at Suckley, near
Malvern; this is a warm and welcoming house in good condition (Grant, Pounds
550,000) with 35 acres for horses and a badminton court. Then there is
Detton Mill House at Neen Savage, 12 miles from Kidderminster (White, Pounds
235,000).
In Bretforton, near Evesham, Jackson-Stops offers the stone Church Cottage
for Pounds 138,500, and the modern stone and half- timbered Greenacres for
Pounds 210,000.
Broadway, on the west scarp of the Cotswolds, is one of the tourist haunts
of England - a show village where you can browse in antique shops and
recover (expensively) in the Lygon Arms, part of the Savoy Group. Its
architecture is a harmony of building styles dating back to the 16th
century, with houses flanking a long high street descending a hill.
Pond Close Farm, which backs on to nine acres of land, is both Georgian and
pre-Georgian. Rural behind and urban in front, it has a superb stone-flagged
floor in the hall, while the Cotswold teddy bear museum is across the road.
The agent is Butler Sherborn (Pounds 485,000). In the centre of Broadway,
Jackson-Stops is selling the imposing early-Georgian Picton House, now
partly an antiques shop, for Pounds 685,000.
Further information: Butler Sherborn, Burford (0993-822 325); Andrew Grant,
Worcester (0905-24 477); Jackson-Stops, Chipping Campden (0386-840 224);
Stewart White, Worcester (0905-723 438).

FT  29 JAN 94 / Property: Coy sellers frustrate eager buyers - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence is the key to greater movement in the housing market. Agents
report plenty of buying interest since the year began but potential sellers
remain reluctant.
Many are mindful of all the bruises and dashed expectations since 1988/89.
But they know, too, that prices could rise if they are prepared to wait.
The government has not helped. Tax increases in two months may well sap
confidence, along with the local elections in May and the Euro-elections in
June. As a result, the 1994 market might not climb as predicted (although
few agents expect more than a 5 to 10 per cent rise, in any case).
The moral is that it could be wise to sell now to take advantage of all
those applicants while they are still eager.
Vendors and agents in Brittany, France, hope the British will return. They
are popular. 'They leave the gate open. Parisians shut the gate and put up
fences,' says Gilles l'Hermitte, an agent in Dinan. But Mercredi Noir in
September 1992 was a heavy blow.
British buying peaked in 1989-90, according to recent figures from the
Cellule Economique de Bretagne. Now, the Germans are buying, although they
are still far fewer than the British. But they go for the more expensive
properties, with an average price in 1992 of FFr330,000 compared with
FFr160,000 for British purchasers.
Most British (84 per cent over 1988-91) have chosen inland places. In 1992,
the Germans began to follow the trend. The most popular department for
foreigners is Cotes d'Armor (capital, St-Brieuc) which accounted for 35 per
cent of foreign purchases in Brittany in 1992. It was followed by Morbihan
(Vannes, 28 per cent), Finistere (Quimper, 22 per cent) and Ille-et-Vilaine
(Rennes, 15 per cent). Cotes d'Armor is the new, more Breton name for what
used to be Cotes-du-Nord.
In Dinan - an attractive, old, granite-built town which is the gateway to
the Breton megalith country - I saw places 'to renovate' for FFr10-30,000.
Even after rebuilding, such prices should allow plenty of cash for oysters
and Muscadet. But, as l'Hermitte cautioned: 'It does not work if you bring
your problems with you.'
An unstressed way to reach Dinan is by Jersey European Airways from
Birmingham, Exeter, Gatwick (starting at Pounds 115 return), or Manchester -
all flights via Jersey - to Dinard, which is near Dinan and across the mouth
of the river Rance from St-Malo.
The US housing market is picking up fast. Starts in December rose by 6.2 per
cent to an annual rate of 1.54m, and building permits rose by 7.4 per cent.
In November, 'home re-sales' rose by 2.9 per cent, making a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.21m.
With mortgage rates (of around 7-7.5 per cent) at a 20-year low, and an
improving economy, Americans feel steadily more confident about taking on
loans. And, unlike the UK, many homes are on the market.
From London, meanwhile, Cluttons Residential Agency reports the first
increase in property prices in New York since 1987 - all of 1 per cent.
The Byre, near Dittisham, Dartmouth, illustrated in last week's article, is
for sale from Stags, Totnes (0803-865 454).
Tolpuddle, Dorset, is renowned for the 1834 Martyrs, the pioneers of the
trades union movement who were transported to Australia. The squire must
have known them all. Now, his manor house is for sale from Jackson-Stops in
Dorchester (0305-262 123). It is a handsome, mid-17th century building and a
packhorse bridge crosses the river Piddle, which flows through the garden.
Price: Pounds 370,000.
Publicly quoted agents Savills and John D. Wood have reported good business
for April-October 1993. Savills' profit before tax rose to Pounds 1.19m from
Pounds 163,000 and Wood's to Pounds 369,000 from a loss of Pounds 77,000.
Both firms did notably well in London and are optimistic for the second
half-year.
A real Cadogan's place is for sale at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire.
Horn Hill House is 1880s' Queen Anne-style red brick with 20 acres. Owned by
a former Lord Cadogan at the beginning of the century. Hamptons in
Beaconsfield (0494-677 744) is asking Pounds 750,000.

FT  29 JAN 94 / Travel: Australia's bush supermarket - Michael Woods braves
crocodiles and snakes to go hunting with the Tiwi people of Melville and
Bathurst islands, near Darwin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thigh-deep in sea water, Harry struggled to hold his spear, which bucked in
his hands. Tracy heard him call and sprinted back to help, sand spurting as
he pounded along the beach.
Splashing into the sea, he plunged his three-pronged spear into the
underwater object and together, avoiding its flailing tail, the two
Aboriginals lifted the heavy, flapping stingray clear of the surface and
carried it to the beach where Harry disarmed it.
A graceful ripple ran round both sides of its flattened, kite-shaped body. A
second followed and then the fish lay still. It was left to collect when we
returned with a sack of grey-green mud crabs, each with its claws
unceremoniously torn off to stop it grabbing an unwary hand. This was good
bush tucker - wild food - for these Aboriginals, who have little regard for
the final moments of their quarry.
Harry and Tracy are Tiwi people who live on Bathurst and Melville,
neighbouring islands no more than 30 minutes by light aircraft to the north
of Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory. Melville is the second largest
island off the Australian coast.
The Tiwis differ considerably from mainland Aboriginals, lacking their
shyness but also their didgeridoos and boomerangs. I spent a day learning
about their culture when I visited Nguiu, one of three main Tiwi
settlements.
The Tiwis have embraced Roman Catholicism only to the extent to which it
suits them. Their graves are surrounded by decorated totem poles, simply
carved and painted with patterns - spots, lines and dashes - in the
traditional red, white, ochre and black of Australian Aboriginal art.
To the disappointment of many visitors, few of the carved shapes and painted
patterns have any significance beyond a few simple details such as the sex
of the deceased. Most owe their shape and colours to the whim of the carver
and painter; the number of totems around the grave is an indication of the
status of the departed.
Michael, another Aboriginal, has lived on Bathurst Island for five years and
is now considered sufficiently part of the community to be asked to decorate
a pole for a burial. The Tiwis hedge their bets these days and have a mass
as well as a tribal burial ceremony. In addition to the collection of totem
poles, a white cross adorns each grave.
After a morning visiting church and museum, adult education centre and
screen printing works, we crossed the milky channel to Melville Island.
Michael drove me through an open forest of tall gums whose feathery foliage
cast little shade on the bright green ferny heads of primitive cycads
growing beneath. We were heading for Taracumbie Falls and lunch.
Later in the afternoon I flew to Garden Point, on the northernmost tip of
Melville, where I stayed in the closest thing to a safari camp I have found
outside Africa. While the surrounding bush may be benign, any thoughts of a
romantic stroll along a tropical beach at night were quickly banished for
fear of attack by salties - northern Australia's dreaded giant saltwater
crocodiles.
I was lulled to sleep by waves lapping the beach and woken before sunrise by
the vintage car-horn parp-parp calls of red-tailed cockatoos. I walked along
both the beach and the sandy access track before breakfast. The latter was
full of stories of the night. A dingo had come through the camp; lizards and
small mammals had hopped, skipped and trotted across the road; in two
places, sand swept into delicate swerves and curls and thrown into relief by
the low sun told where snakes had woven their way across. How I yearned for
an interpreter to read the signs for me.
Our Tiwi guides turned up after breakfast, knowing just what bush tucker
we'd be going after that day. While the ladies took half the group to
collect mussels in the mud, Tracy led a few of us foraging for meat in the
bush. Armed with a felling axe, a box of matches, a mirror and plenty of
water, we set off through the trees into areas previously burned by the
Tiwis. Like all Aboriginals, they use fire as a tool. It is estimated that
95 per cent of the Northern Territory is burned every year.
They have been firing the woods for so long - many thousands of years - that
the trees seem able to cope. Some grow special bark for protection, but only
as high as they need to; others require fire to germinate their seeds.
The bush is fired so often that there is no build-up of dead matter on the
ground and fires burn coolly and gently. Only when they catch a fallen log
do they smoulder for days, until a line of grey ash is all that remains.
Tracy used the mirror to direct the light of the sun into hollow logs to
look for animals inside. With the axe he broke into the bottom of a hollow
olibud trunk, cutting a hole which he filled with tinder-dry stringy bark.
Smoke curled out of several holes above our heads but no possum made a run
for it. He set fire to the dead lower branches of a pandannis palm in order
to drive out lurking snakes, but without effect. Finally he even felled a
hollow trunk, but it was empty. The shelves of the bush supermarket were
fresh out of tucker.
Had this been our only source of food we would have gone hungry but,
fortunately, the mussel-gatherers were a generous lot and shared their catch
with us. They were good - but no match for the crab of the previous day
which had had everyone, locals and visitors alike, crouched round the fire
picking delicious flesh from pink shells.
Michael Woods flew to Darwin with Qantas (tel: 0345-747 767) and was looked
after by the Australian Tourism Commission, which can provide details of
this and other tours (081-780 1424 for the free Travellers' Guide; 780 2227
for more detailed inquiries).
Tiwi Tours, which is half-owned by the Tiwi people, can be contacted via GPO
Box 1397, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia 0801 (tel: 089-815 144).

FT  29 JAN 94 / Travel: The Anglo barbarians are at the gates - The
advantages of a Fortress Tuscany policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEWHERE in Provence. What a secretive, timorous dateline that is. But
frankly, a little secretiveness these days is not amiss for, since Peter
Mayle popularised this part of the world, I have been receiving barely
veiled threats of bodily harm.
None of my expatriate neighbours here wants to read another word about
Provence. They are fed up with travel pieces about the Luberon hills, ruined
stone farmhouses, goat cheese and olive oil, peasants with gold teeth and
berets, picnics in lavender fields, etc. They complain that A Year in
Provence is superficial and over-romantic.
The real source of their irritation, I suspect, is that Mayle has wounded
their self-esteem: thanks to the book's popularity, British expatriates in
Provence have now become social and literary cliches in their own right.
Worse, in bringing down thousands of curious visitors from Birmingham,
Watford and Ipswich (some of whom - horrors - may buy a house), Mayle has
turned the British expat, once a rare creature, into a common or garden
variety just one step above the British summertime hoi-polloi.
At any rate, it has been hinted that I move on and write about somewhere
else. There is only one other place I can think of that has the same sunny
and sensuous Mediterranean beauty, the same hardy peasant culture, the same
farmhouse-and-goat-cheese appeal to refugee Britons with disposable incomes.
What is more, no one has yet written A Year in Tuscany.
Florence. Good Heavens. And I thought the Luberon hills crowded in summer.
Here the tourist season goes on all year and there is barely room to swing a
guidebook. It took me an hour-and-a-half of tramping around the city last
night just to find a hotel with a room free.
At dinner I was squeezed on to a shared table opposite a large party of
Florentines. How vain and self-absorbed they were in their designer glasses,
their jackets thrown around their shoulders. They pranced and preened and
pouted and tossed their perfect locks, and that was just the men. I had
thought the French went to great lengths to appear sophisticated. The
Italians make them look like potato diggers.
But is this really a city of culture? There is something unhealthy about the
relationship between the purveyors of historical culture and its consumers.
Many fine and noble things remain, no doubt, from one of civilisation's
great ages. But I question their mass-marketing for the delectation of
modern barbarian hordes.
I am not comfortable in places where large numbers of individuals tour the
streets with video lenses screwed permanently into their eye sockets. My
enthusiasm for art wavers when its prerequisite is a two-hour queue outside
the Uffizi. Great masterpieces are a dime a dozen in this city, but try
finding a parking space. When it comes to culture in Florence, I am afraid I
must be counted a philistine.
The Crete. I am not the first person to have discovered the glories of rural
Tuscany, but I feel like it. Suddenly I understand why Tuscany is such a
serious rival to Provence for British affections.
The Crete, the pale, undulating, chalk hill-country that begins south of
Siena, is the most sensuous I have ever passed through. This is a landscape
which, particularly after the summer harvest, is like bare human skin. It is
smooth and rounded and dipping. The feeling of nakedness is enhanced by the
huge, empty sky.
The Crete is also dramatic, its elements of landscape so frugally allocated
on this great and nearly empty sweep of land that the whole is reduced to
the elemental. Here, a single line of dark cypresses dominates the crest of
a barren hill. There, a solid, four-square farmhouse of soft ochre colour
stands silhouetted against a dark sky. This is an idealised landscape, so
striking that it feels more like an archetypal model than a real and
every-day thing.
Montalcino. There is something of the model, too, about Montalcino. It is
the quintessential Tuscan hill town, a collection of sturdy 16th century
stone houses, piazzas, flagged streets, churches and a medieval castle all
held within thick walls on the summit of a narrow ridge. The views of the
Crete from almost anywhere in the town are superb. Once the poorest town in
the region, it is now one of the richest, thanks to the Brunello vineyards
that surround it.
I took a room in one of the town's two hotels. It was surprisingly difficult
to find accommodation in even the most frequently visited Tuscan towns.
Unlike Provence, Tuscany is not geared up for large numbers of tourists. And
unlike Provencal villages, which can become ghost towns when people close up
holiday homes and move back to London, Paris or Geneva, Tuscan villages seem
to remain active, working places. Schoolchildren, bakers, grannies and other
real-life characters can still be found there.
Montalcino was my base for forays to other hill towns. My favourites? One
was Pienza, conceived as a utopian 'new town' and planned down to the last
detail. It does not bear much resemblance to Milton Keynes or other British
new towns, though; built by Pope Pius II in the 1450s, it is so medievally
pretty that it was used for the filming of Romeo and Juliet.
The other is Montepulciano, a scale-model renaissance city, an elegant,
palazzi-strewn mini-Florence built in the hills. In Provence, hill towns
were built by peasants and local war-lords; in Tuscany, popes, kings and
renaissance architects had other ways of building.
Just as pleasurable, though, was a visit to the Montalcino barbershop.
Awaiting my turn to climb into one of its old-fashioned swivel chairs, I
could not decide which was more interesting: watching the flow of evening
strollers on the Via Matteotti outside, or looking at the photos in Oggi
magazine. In peering into private lives, the Italian paparazzi, I would say,
still have the edge over the British tabloids - just.
Sant'Antimo. Enough Oggi. I am feeling clean and uplifted. This Sunday
morning I visited a Cistercian abbey. Not only did I stroll the olive groves
and cypress lanes that surround this austere and lovely Romanesque building,
I attended a mass. The sun slanted in through tall arched windows, aromatic
smoke from the censor billowed, and from the throats of four white-robed
monks came the heavenly hymns and harmonies of Gregorian chant. I think I
could take to the monastic life.
But good clean living builds an appetite. After mass I zipped over to the
walled village of Sant'Angelo in Colle, locally reknowned for its
restaurant, Il Pozzo. What should I discover inside, though, but the dining
room taken over by a coach-load of cheery Cheshiremen collectively known as
the Winnington Wine Club, on their 13th annual outing to a far-flung, winey
destination. And how did they find the local plonk? Jolly good vino, they
said. I sloped off to find lunch elsewhere.
Somewhere in Tuscany. There is no getting around it: the coach-loads in
Tuscany very much resemble the coach-loads in Provence. The Mediterranean
world is firmly on the tourist map and there are very few parts of it left
undiscovered. The great miracle is that Tuscany, like Provence, has managed
to retain its character. The Winnington Wine Club, bless their souls, can do
their worst.
Nonetheless, the local expat community can get rather shirty about
intrusions on to their territory. When you pay a fortune for a ruined
farmhouse you expect exclusiveness. If I have resorted to a cowardly and
imprecise dateline, once again, it is because I have received threats, once
again.
Yesterday, I visited an English family who, in real life, have rather
responsible jobs in London. Their retreat is in the least developed portion
of Tuscany, the green, forested hills that lie between the Crete and the
Tuscan coast. Here in an isolated 16th century hill-top fortress they live
like medieval nobility ready for a siege.
'You're not going to Peter Mayle us]' said the mother in dismay, distracted
from overseeing the family olive grove, wheatfield and sheep herd.
'People should know that there is malaria here,' said the daughter, taking a
moment off from hand-pressing the grape harvest.
'And wolves,' growled the father, gazing beadily out over the battlements.
'Wolves that eat tourists.'
If they were exaggerating slightly, I do not know that I can blame them.
Summer visitors are one thing. But what is the point of having a Tuscan
fortress if all London buys Tuscan fortresses?
Already, Chiantishire to the north has fallen to Anglo barbarians. Florence
crumbled long ago. Far to the west, the Luberon is besieged. The more remote
parts of Tuscany and Provence are holding out, but for how long?
The situation is grave, the future threatening. But I think I may have
learned a thing or two in Tuscany. If anyone knows of a walled Provencal
fortress for sale, would they please get in touch?
Both Tuscany and Provence are less crowded in spring and autumn, when good
weather can make them a delight. Many small companies specialise in home
rentals and self-catering in both areas. A list of some of the better ones
can be had from the Association of Independent Tour Operators, 133a St
Margaret's Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, TW1 1RG. Tel: 081-744-9280.
Information on Tuscany can be obtained from the Italian Tourist Board, No 1
