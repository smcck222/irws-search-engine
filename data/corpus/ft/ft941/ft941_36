FT  28 JAN 94 / A blot on its reputation: Disputes at the UK standards body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The kite-mark, symbol of the British Standards Institution since the turn of
the century, is flying high. But on the ground all is not well.
British Standard 5750, a quality assurance standard which testifies that a
business's management systems are judged effective, has become a worldwide
best-seller and profits and turnover have soared. Yet just when the benefits
of all the work that went into BS5750 are starting to come through, BSI's
success has turned sour.
In the past six months a series of upsets has wrenched BSI off the pages of
the trade journals and into the national press. The problem has partly
resulted from dissatisfaction in industry with BS5750, and partly from the
strains imposed by an attempt to modernise BSI's venerable management
structures.
The constant stream of bad news about BSI has raised fears that its image
and ultimately its effectiveness could suffer. Damage to BSI, whose 29,000
member companies subscribe to its services and help write its standards,
would reduce Britain's ability to get its standards accepted internationally
with all the benefits that brings for UK companies.
For, in spite of Britain's manufacturing decline, BSI has maintained a
powerful position in the European and international forums where most
standards-setting now occurs. Britain leads just under a quarter of the
international committees which draw up specific standards, a similar
percentage to its German and French counterparts, DIN and Afnor.
And in spite of increasing competition in the traditional field of standard
writing and product testing, BSI has grown rapidly in recent years because
of the success of BS5750. Revenues from certifying companies to BS5750 and
the fees BSI charges for ensuring that companies are sticking to the rules,
accounted for 60 per cent of BSI's Pounds 78m turnover last year.
The first hints of difficulty arose in June when Dr Michael Sanderson, BSI's
chief executive for just 18 months, stepped down over what the institute
called 'a deep disagreement on important matters of policy and management'.
This was followed by a row between BSI and a committee which it had helped
set up to review the problems small companies face in implementing BS5750.
Organisations representing small companies have pressed BSI to simplify
BS5750. BSI withdrew funds from the committee and put pressure on it to
finish its deliberations.
At about the same time, the government announced a review of whether BSI
should continue to receive a subsidy for its standards-writing work.
Standards-writing is not lucrative but BSI's other activities - certifying
companies to BS5750 and monitoring them - have become increasingly
profitable in recent years. BSI made a profit of Pounds 7.5m in 1992 and
received a grant of Pounds 4.5m.
BSI's problems reached their climax in November when its members delivered a
humiliating snub to Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, and his board. The
members turned down plans to strengthen the powers of the directors and to
double directors' fees to Pounds 15,000 a year, and the chairman's fee to
Pounds 25,000.
As a result of this setback the board has been forced to delay all its
proposed changes and is now holding meetings with members to improve
relations. But in spite of what some members describe as encouraging
discussions in recent weeks members remain wary. There is no guarantee that
Mr Thomas's proposals will be acceptable if they are put to members again at
a resumed annual meeting on March 8.
Mr Thomas, a pugnacious former chief executive of BP Oil, is at the centre
of the present storm. Brought in as chairman two years ago, he was pushed
centre stage by the sudden departure of Dr Sanderson. Instead of immediately
seeking to appoint a new chief executive Mr Thomas created a small executive
board to run BSI and has since devoted himself practically full-time to
pushing through change.
'It would have taken us four months to find a chief executive,' he says. 'We
couldn't wait that long. We cannot return to the clubby atmosphere of the
past.'
Mr Thomas believes that a wholesale reorganisation of BSI is essential to
give it a more professional management suited to a business which this year
expects to achieve turnover of nearly Pounds 100m. 'You can't run a business
this size like a co-operative,' he says.
Mr Thomas has wasted no time, computerising many procedures, cutting out
layers of committees and shedding jobs.
But the pace of change worries some of BSI's members. There are no signs, as
yet, that the disaffected members are coming round to the board's point of
view. If anything, attitudes are hardening. The Federation of Environmental
Trade Associations has threatened to bypass BSI and to send its members to
the European and international groups which are writing a growing number of
standards.
The Mechanical and Metal Trades Confederation says it may withdraw its
members from BSI's standards-writing committees. 'The directors cannot
expect to benefit from BSI's commercial activities while expecting their
members to provide their services for free,' said Mr John Carruthers,
confederation director-general.
This feeling that the present board is tinkering with a system which has
stood the test of time is widespread. Mr Gordon Gaddes, director-general of
Beama, the Federation of British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers'
Association, is concerned that the abolition of what are known as standards
policy committees has removed a democratic control on the actions of the
board. 'There is a vacuum,' he says.
So where does BSI go from here? Mr Thomas says he is resigned to the
government grant being reduced and turned into a contract with payments tied
to the provision of specific services. This would allow the government to
judge more accurately BSI's value for money.
BSI has also started looking for a chief executive. It hopes the post will
be filled by April. Mr Thomas would then resume his original role of
part-time chairman.
Mr Thomas acknowledges failings in his approach. 'I have been in too much of
a hurry and we have not communicated externally as much as we should.'
However, he remains committed to the need for change. For all the criticism
of BSI, no one has accused it of not writing good standards or of not
delivering value for money, he says.
But the gulf between Mr Thomas and his members remains a large one. So
fundamental are the differences that it is by no means certain that they can
be bridged by the time of the resumed annual meeting in March.

   From Mr LIONEL STANBROOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report 'Cash with order adverts reprieved' (January 22) correctly
draws attention to the compromise text on distance selling proposed by the
Greek presidency of the Council of Ministers. However, the UK's marketing
industries should not assume that the reprieve is permanent. The
Commission's contentious revised draft remains on the table - with its
restrictive provisions on cash with order, telephone selling, credit cards,
information requirements and its inclusion of the financial services and
tourism sectors.
While the Greek text does reflect some of the discussions between
governments, the Commission's text in the main may still be approved by the
European parliament, and still represents a position generally supported by
many of the EU member states. Thankfully, the UK is not one of these. The UK
Advertising Association and its members will continue to defend the UK's
effective consumer guarantees in the face of inappropriate and unwieldy EC
legislative proposals.

<TEXT>
Political discourse entraps the soul, or it is nothing. Nothing-politics
conveys no ethical sense, and therefore conveys no human meaning. Yet this
is what is on offer from growing numbers of parties in the west. Markets,
privatisation, the cult of the individual are all fine ideas, but without a
moral foundation all are empty. This is one consequence of the sudden death
of socialism. It has become fruitless to propound Marxist theory, and
pointless to rebut it. In many countries the passion has been drained out of
the process of choosing and dismissing governments. Democratic
representatives who formerly sought to improve the conditions of life of
those who elected them have become hacks, seekers after office. Voters are
turning away.
In Italy the old parties have dissolved themselves into fresh alliances,
with new names and restated programmes. Former communists may lead a
coalition to victory, but it is a market economy they will manage. If the
electorate's blood is up it is because it demands a change to cleaner
politics, not for the old left-right reasons. In Canada the Conservative
party has been all but obliterated. Germans are said to be once again toying
with the notion of a grand coalition of Christian and Social Democrats with
liberals and greens. At the 1992 US presidential election Mr Ross Perot took
votes away from both the Democratic and the Republican parties. In Britain
the disillusionment with mainstream politicians is palpable.
One reason for the general cooling of politics is that the old questions
about social deprivation are avoided, as if out of embarrassment. The 1994
edition of Britain's statistical annual Social Trends, published yesterday,
indicates that since 1979 the Tories have steadily mulcted the very poor. As
we all know, the rich have become far richer. There were no protest marches,
no riots in the streets, not even a measly squeak from the leader of the
Labour party when he questioned the prime minister about other matters. On
Wednesday, President Bill Clinton delivered a State of the Union message in
which he offered a hand up, but not a permanent hand-out, to America's poor.
Social-Democratic predecessors, like President Lyndon Johnson and his
vice-president Hubert Humphrey, must have turned in their graves.
This is not to say that the 'Great Society' solution to poverty, which was
to spend more money on it, necessarily works, or is the best way to reduce
dependency. In some circumstances it may be, in others not. The argument
will continue. The point about the nothing-politics of today is that it
feels vacuous because social justice is no longer a gut issue. Few
democratic politicians admit to a burning desire to take the 'underclass'
off the pavements, out of tenements and into jobs and decent houses. What we
have instead is dainty deliberation by fat pragmatists who believe that to
get elected they must show a willingness to reduce spending on welfare.
Something else will surely inflame us in the 21st century. One possibility
is that it will be a debate, infused with real feeling, about the limits to
economic growth. The world's population is expected to rise from 5.3m in
1990 to 8.5bn in 2025. The rate of increase of emissions of CO, the most
enduring greenhouse gas, is about 3 per cent a year, a figure less likely to
be decreased by the resolutions taken at the 1992 Rio conference than
increased by the rapid enrichment of China. The danger to the planet has not
receded; only the political response is, temporarily, in abeyance.
We might also be in for another resurgence of dangerous tribalism. This
observation is supported by a pamphlet from Demos*, an independent
think-tank. Its author, Mr Vincent Cable, is director of the international
econ-omics programme at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. He
developed the ideas in his paper as a member of group planning at Shell. We
can imagine them brainstorming about global scenarios.
There is little that is brand new in Mr Cable's essay. Protecting our tribe
and attacking the others has been a practice for shall we say, most of the
last 2,000+ years. He does, however, offer a stimulating account of the rise
in parties concerned with what he calls 'identity politics'. At its best
this produces 'cultural conservatism', by which the author means the
combination of a belief in the market economy with either a strong
religious, moralistic fervour, as in 'born again' Christians in the US, or
an exclusive, nationalistic approach to capitalism, as in Japan. At its
worst it produces Russia's rabidly nationalist Zhirinovsky.
Manifestations of identity politics listed by Mr Cable include the rise of
the Republicans in Germany and the National Front in France, the
preoccupations with Ulster and the Maastricht treaty in Britain, and the
emergence of a strong Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, in India. The
tragedy of the former Yugoslavia and the fragility of the new east European
democracies may also be called in evidence. Again, it could be that extreme
racist and nationalist parties in Germany, France, Italy and Belgium will do
well in this year's elections to the European parliament.
Set against tribalism is pure liberalism, which takes no account of class,
race, national origin or, saving the rule of law, any other impediment to
the freedom of the individual. Liberalism is strengthened by the
globalisation of markets; tribalism - sorry, 'identity politics' - is
weakened if humans everywhere become more like one another.
Contemporary arguments fall on either side of this line. Take, as one
example 'family values'. Libertarians stick by personal choice, Mr Cable
points out. Their opponents insist that family and personal relationships
reflect the disciplines of 'culture, tradition and faith'. This leads
democratic politicians into some murky waters.
The conclusion is that people concerned with politics must learn 'how to
satisfy people's yearning for a sense of belonging and identity without
unleashing destructive political forces'. Mr Cable has a point. Liberalism
is the way, but it requires enhancement. We must get some blood back into
politics, or blood will flow.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Arts: Bold stab at Die Soldaten - Max Loppert reviews the
Paris premiere of Zimmermann's opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited Paris premiere of Bernd Alois Zimmermann's Die Soldaten has
taken place at the Opera Bastille, and the after-shock of its artistic
impact can still be registered all over the city.
This remarkable piece - the composer's own treatment of the revolutionary
1775 play by Jakob Lenz - was completed in the late 1950s, pronounced
unperformable, reworked, and eventually given its premiere at Cologne in
1965; since then it has been tackled by an increasing number of brave
companies across Europe and the US.
The New Grove reckons that Zimmermann's single essay in the form is 'widely
acknowledged as the most important in German since those of Berg'.
Certainly, in the cultural history of the second half of our century it has
secured a position achieved by few other postwar operas.
From the first, the modernists celebrated the many-layered complexities of
its four-act structure and rigorous 12-note idiom, intricately laid out for
a vast ensemble of singers, instrumentalists (including onstage jazz band),
dancers and figurants, with taped and filmed accompaniment in the final act.
The opera's precisely plotted simultaneities - different actions unfolding
on different stage levels at the same moment - parallel contemporary
developments in Stockhausen; the triple-stage devices of We Come to the
River, Henze's 1976 opera for Covent Garden, pale into insignificance in
comparison.
But also from the first, many other audience-members, even those utterly
unsympathetic to the postwar avant-garde, were yet able to submit themselves
to the immediacy and theatrical force of Zimmermann's creation.
In Paris, Die Soldaten packs a mighty punch. The Bastille stage,
inhospitably large for Mozart and even Puccini, comfortably contains its
furthest-flung activities. The Bastille acoustics, whose distancing tends to
dampen the delights of the general repertory, provide here no dilution of
the chamber-music filigree that marks much of the instrumental part-writing,
nor barrier to the contorted eloquence of the voice parts - which, with
their upward leaps, wide intervals and intricate rhythmic notation, must be
hell to get right, but which come together to make in situ an always justly
judged dramatic progression.
Altogether, the best aspects of the Bastille adventure are here favoured for
display - and, since this is an opera that requires maximum amounts of time
and money to mount, that obviously includes providing the wherewithal to
make it happen in the first place. (In Britain Die Soldaten might be deemed
the missing link in the modern-operatic chain: brought to the 1972 Edinburgh
Festival by the Dusseldorf company, it has over the last decade been
scheduled and then, for want of money, cancelled by at least three of our
national companies.)
The Paris performance, a re-creation of the 1987 staging for Stuttgart by
Harry Kupfer and the designer Wolf Munzner, combines stringent
musico-dramatic organisation and abrasively brilliant showmanship. Several
of the original Stuttgart cast have made the journey to Paris, notably the
excellent Franz Mazura (Wesener), Michael Ebbecke (Stolzius) and Ursula
Koszut (the Countess), and the superb conductor Bernhard Kontarsky. As one
may easily judge by reference to the Stuttgart recording (on Teldec), the
new leading lady, the American Lisa Saffer, outclasses her predecessor with
the crystalline beauty of her high soprano.
Lenz's play, a compact vision unfolded in trenchantly ironic stages, tells
of Marie, daughter of Wesener the Lille fancy-goods merchant, a middle-class
girl first seduced and later reduced to whoredom by a succession of army
officers. Zimmermann was (he later wrote) attracted to its operatic
potential not so much because of the socially-critical content, much more
because of the avant la lettre modernity in Lenz's elliptical, jump-cutting
treatment of characters, situations and time-shifts.
Kupfer's production does justice to both the laconically fierce world-view
of Lenz and the 'total-theatre' adventure of Zimmermann. Upon the permanent
set, a two-tier wooden edifice baldly outlined, there play modern lighting
devices - strobe seizures, palais-de-danse swirls, magically winking
hand-held lamps - in sharp contrast to the in-period costumes and props.
During the instrumental interludes making up the pattern of Zimmermann's
Wozzeck-inherited formal structures, the whole company is set a-twitching
like marionettes: a nice theatrical symbol of the dehumanising nature of
military life.
This production flourishes the Kupfer signature at its boldest. As is his
wont, the producer proves unable to resist going the whole final hog: at the
end the whole stage edifice collapses in a Gotterdammerung heap. On this
occasion, however, the device could be defended as an analogy for the
nuclear mushroom-cloud image on which Zimmermann wanted the opera to close,
and a response to the strangely cut-off humanity that lies at the heart of
the work.
Heard on record, the opera seems for this latter reason an artistic
'machine' to be admired, not a fully-fledged experience to be drawn into. In
the theatre, the extraordinary acuteness with which Zimmermann judged
material and dramatic moment amplifies the impression. But in the end, the
inevitable comparisons that one makes with Wozzeck and Lulu suggest exactly
what is missing from Die Soldaten: an emotional openness in the vision which
allows the audience to distil from it more than just an all-encompassingly
harrowing finality.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Arts: Verdi's Messa da Requiem - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We had a good, sound Verdi Requiem from the Royal Philharmonic in the
Festival Hall on Tuesday, much enhanced by the visiting Italians, the
conductor and three members of his solo quartet: all young, and all at the
outsets of their careers.
So was the Puerto Rican tenor Cesar Hernandez, though he sounded hampered by
something like a slight cold. His baritonal timbre was satisfyingly firm and
fibrous (there is no statutory requirement for a tenore di grazia in this
work), but he shaped his heroic rising phrases like someone confident of
attaining a bright, ringing top - which he never quite did. It remained
clouded, and often fractionally below pitch: never unpleasant, but not
thrilling either. I look forward to hearing him on a healthier night.
The solo bass was the 20-year-old Simone Alberghini, manifestly both
well-schooled and full-voiced. No doubt it will take him some years yet to
stamp the intended character upon the voice itself, beyond the vocal
surface-effects; nevertheless everything he did was both tasteful and
telling. The conductor Paolo Olmi, displaying the kind of deportment and
stylised gestures that one associates with an older generation, took us
through the score honestly, without tricks (instead of ear-shattering
thwacks from the bass drum in the 'Dies irae', we got most carefully
modulated punctuation) but with fine, unhesitating fluency.
The Brighton Festival Chorus and London Choral Society were unanimous and
sonorous, though their well-crunched consonants were better than their dull
British vowels. In this work there is really no substitute for open,
Italianate vowels, though the texts are in medieval Latin. It was left to
the women soloists to supply the essential dramatic feeling: breathless,
nervily elevated intensity from the soprano Norma Fantini, against the dark,
well-sculpted line of Luciana D'Intino's mezzo.
We should have heard Miss D'Intino in the recent Berlioz Troyens at the
Barbican (happy though we were with her last-minute replacement, Markella
Hatziano); here in Verdi, her lively maturity and judicious poise suggested
the noble Dido she might have given us.

Radio 3 starts the evening with a live concert from St David's Hall,
Cardiff, where the BBC National Orchestra Of Wales, conducted by Tadaaki
Otaka, plays 'Peinture' by Edison Denisov and Mozart's Concerto for Two
Pianos, then, after an interval talk, Elgar's 1st Symphony (7.30).
What a pity to see comedian Alexei Sayle joining the finger waggers to
present a new BBC1 series, Drive, urging us all to drive safely. No doubt we
should do so, but the world is full of bossy types - Virginia Bottomley,
Jonathan Porritt, 'Jenni' Murray, any number of policemen - who would be
naturals in this role. Worse, Sayle is quoted in his opening sermon as
claiming that we all become predatory animals 'the second we step on a gas
pedal' (8.50 BBC1).
Best series of the week is Further Abroad in which Jonathan Meades explores
the oddness of Britain and the British. Today's subject is pigs (9.30 BBC2).
Oddest 'light entertainment' series for years is The Unpleasant World Of
Penn And Teller, a sort of conjuring show for horror movie fans (10.30 C4).

FT  28 JAN 94 / Arts: Energy on a grotesque scale - The latest exhibition at
the Saatchi gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We may judge our fellows by their wit or politics, or even their husbands or
wives, but we damn them for their taste in curtains at our peril. So it is
with their pictures.
Yet in Charles Saatchi we have a man who has been buying the art of his own
time, which is bad enough, and by the yard, which is worse; and he has set
up for himself the most spectacular gallery in London in which to show it
all off. For nine years he has been parading his judgment, from Andy Warhol
to Damien Hirst, to decidedly mixed applause. How, we ask ourselves, can he
be so persistent, so public-spirited, so, well, insensitive?
Since 1992, every other show has been given to the work of younger British
artists in his collection, this the third in the series. Now again, it
seems, that once one work has caught his eye, he has bought the lot. Good
luck to him, that he can command what he wants, and good luck to the artists
and their dealers. But it remains a disconcerting procedure.
We may well be happy to see the work of any particular artist, shown in
depth and beautifully presented. Yet there is to it all, even so, something
decidedly remote and arbitrary. We miss any sense of a collector's personal
engagement with the particular work, cherished for itself and set against
something else, no less treasured. So it is with the three painters in this
show. Individually they have their points, for and against. They may hang
together without mutual interference, but collectively they make no sense.
The best of them is Simon Callery, the only one who is not concerned with
the human figure. His work is also the most abstract: large canvases of
closely modulated greys and pinks, greens and violets, with simple linear
motifs lightly worked over them in oil-pastel. Strongly horizontal in
emphasis, they inevitably conjure up landscape by association: wide
seascapes, marshes, estuaries. These beautiful works sit comfortably within
a modern tradition that links early Mondrian to Diebenkorn and Agnes Martin
and yet looks back to the 17th century, to Koninck and Ruisdael.
Simon English's work is less happy - his paintings of the figure, set for
the most part on a epic scale, strive for symbolic significance before ever
properly establishing a convincing human presence. Naked, Bacon-esque
shadows stand in line, set into box-like cubicles that fall away in crude
perspective, all cast in a fierce, romantic, highly theatrical chiaroscuro.
So far, so good, for there is nothing wrong in the promise of some
old-fashioned visual drama. The problem is that the promise is all. Come
closer and we find that the technicalities of realisation have been ducked -
look, no hands, no feet, no face. There is the world of difference between
something left undone or removed by choice, and something unattempted,
evaded.
The work of Jenny Saville, at 23 by ten years the youngest of the three, is
superficially the most remarkable in the show, as much for its energy and
scale as for its quality. Her canvases are very large, conventionally so,
but that she should then impose upon them out-size images of the figure that
are often even too big for them, is rather less expected. That these images
should then be positively outrageous - fat, bloated, distorted female nudes,
scratched and scrawled with slogans and graffiti, gleefully flouting all
normal canons of taste and decency - only compounds the visual shock.
But whatever their feminist or fattist programme might be, they are more
interesting for their formal and practical qualities. Simply to control the
paint and sustain such images across these extensive surfaces is to declare
Miss Saville a painter of considerable natural ability. Certainly she
deserves better that to be celebrated only for her imagery. When the
paintings, at their most grotesque, get out of hand, dominated by the image,
they are least successful. The best is the simplest, a nude back-view cut
off at head and legs, subtly observed, delicately modelled and, in certain
passages, almost abstract.
It is a pity she does not show some working drawings. And we must hope she
soon escapes the tyranny of scale and the easy shock.

FT  28 JAN 94 / People: Ford rings some top changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Oldfield, a vice president of Ford Motor and head of all Ford's car
development and engineering in Europe, is retiring from the US carmaker.
He has been appointed executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, the UK
luxury sports car maker.
Oldfield will take over from Walter Hayes, chairman of Aston Martin since
1991, who will be 70 in April, the mandatory Ford retirement age.
Hayes will remain on the board of Aston Martin, which became a 75 per
cent-owned Ford subsidiary in 1987.
Oldfield's move to Aston Martin has opened the way for the promotion of
Richard Parry-Jones, Ford of Europe's chief engineer for vehicle engineering
 -and a rising star in the Ford organisation - to become Ford of Europe vice
president for product programmes and vehicle engineering and design.
Parry-Jones, 42, will become a key member of the new generation management
team that is being formed at Ford of Europe by Jacques Nasser, 46.
Nasser took over as chairman in January last year with the task of halting
the mounting losses of Ford's European operations.
Parry-Jones's position as head of all of Ford's car development and
engineering in Europe will be crucial to determining the US carmaker's
fortunes in Europe during the second half of the 1990s and beyond.
An engineer educated at Salford University, he joined Ford in 1969 and has
held senior positions in product planning, engineering and manufacturing in
Europe and in the US.
He will take over from Oldfield responsibility for forcing the
implementation of simultaneous engineering methods in Ford of Europe with
the aim of wringing greater efficiency and productivity out of Ford's
product and manufacturing engineering operations in the UK and in Germany.
He has previously headed the manufacturing operations at Ford's Cologne
plant, where the Fiesta and Granada Scorpio are assembled, before becoming
Ford of Europe chief engineer in 1991.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology: Sandoz splits the R&amp;D difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many big pharmaceutical groups, Sandoz of Switzerland has lived the
nightmare of discovering a drug in a new category and then seeing another
company bring a competitor compound to market first.
That is one reason why it has split its development department away from its
research activity. Britain's Glaxo announced a similar move last year.
'Once you decide to develop a product, you have to go full out. There is no
room for half measures,' says Urs Barlocher, chief executive of Sandoz.
The other reason for the change comes from the research side, where the
rapid advance of biochemistry is changing the nature of research management.
In the past, pharmaceutical research was chemical-based, and proceeded at a
relatively gentle pace. Now, with the rise of biochemistry, it has become
more fast moving.
Pharmaceutical companies have recognised that the speed of advances in
biotechnology makes it impossible to keep their in-house laboratories up to
speed on all fronts. Consequently, they have tended to set up co-operation
arrangements with independent biotechnology laboratories and start-up
companies.
Sandoz now has more than 30 such arrangements, consuming a tenth of its
SFr1.2bn (Pounds 540m) R&amp;D budget, and Barlocher is convinced the number
will rise. 'We do not yet have a good feel for the right balance, but the
trend is increasing,' he says. He points out that it has always been
difficult to find researchers with management skills, and now the
requirements are much greater.
'You need someone who knows what is happening in basic research, where we
can find leads for new compounds. He has to be able to decide quickly which
co-operation deals we should enter and which ones we should keep. It is a
matter of judgment, and in the past we have been too slow.'
Assuming such a person can be found, he argues that it is now too much to
ask him to look after development as well. In any event, he believes that
the management of development, which involves testing a discovery to the
point where it can be put on the market, demands different skills from
research management.
'In development, it is a question of setting priorities. For the most part
it is systematic, not creative. It should be run in a way very similar to a
production centre. You can measure results and set clear targets.'
Sandoz has had a notoriously slow development department in the past. A few
years ago, it brought in the management consultants McKinsey to try to speed
the process, and last year it set up a project team approach. 'We still feel
we are not among the very best,' Barlocher admits, 'but we are now confident
that we can catch up.'
He claims that the split will not lead to greater bureaucracy. 'We have
tried to segment responsibility by flow of product. We want to give full
responsibility to the heads of different sections, and reduce the matrix to
a minimum.'
Development is by far the most expensive part of the R&amp;D process, especially
the clinical studies. Thus, the group believes it must concentrate its
research efforts on finding what it calls number one compounds, those that
are clearly ahead of the competition.
'It is no longer worth following the other guy. Even if you have a fast
development department, it will become more and more difficult to catch up,'
Barlocher says. 'And you cannot count on the other guy to make a mistake.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Good vibrations from virtual
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The day of the virtual reality one-piece body suit has moved a step closer
with the unveiling of the Interactor body vest, writes Richard Rosen.
Interactor, from Aura Systems, is the world's first system to mimic feeling
as well as vision and sound. The user puts on a body harness, which is
connected to a games console, television, or stereo to receive the sound.
This triggers a magnetic actuator which causes body pulsing vibrations; in
effect, it turns the body into a loudspeaker cone.
A volume adjustor allows the user to adjust the intensity of the vibrations.
Used with a computer game it translates into a buffeting as the player hits
and is hit by the opponent. Interactor is due to be launched in the US in
April at under Dollars 90. Aura Systems: US, 310 643 5300

Lynwood believes its mini-machine, the MC40, will be used by systems
integrators to build the power of the 486 chip into systems where
traditional PCs have been too bulky - in the boot of a car for mobile

thieves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German car thieves look set for leaner times with the introduction of
equipment to immobilise cars and so prevent them being stolen.
Minitronic/SET of Freising has introduced a radio-based system which does
not need a battery to power it. Cars protected by Car-Protect have a small
transponder integrated into the car key and a reader mounted out of sight
near the steering column. When the key is inserted into the ignition a radio
signal transmits a 20-digit code to the reader, where it is compared with
the stored code. Only if the codes match will the ignition start.
Car-Protect uses a transponder from Texas Instruments. The reader sends an
electrical pulse out when the key is inserted and this is picked up by the
transponder in the key to activate the system. Minitronic: Germany, 81 61
925 77.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology: Computers come face to face - New personal
conferencing products allow users to hold meetings through their PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The personal computer industry has for years sought the 'killer app' - a
compelling new application of PCs that would boost sales and draw new users
into the market.
Intel, the world's largest chip maker and dominant supplier of
microprocessors to the PC industry, may have found this elusive prize in the
form of 'personal conferencing'. This week, the company launched PC add-on
products that enable users to conduct video conferences from their desks,
viewing each other in one corner of their computer screens while
simultaneously reading, discussing and updating the displayed documents.
'Personal conferencing will change the way people in business communicate by
bringing the power of the PC to one-on-one communications,' predicts Andrew
Grove, Intel's president and chief executive. 'We are entering an era when
people will use their PCs to make and to receive calls and to solve business
problems together.'
Intel's PC-based technology does not match the standards of dedicated
video-conferencing systems. The video image of participants is small and
rather jerky at 15 frames per minute. But it is a relatively low-cost and
easily installed system.
Intel is already using the technology in its own offices. Colleagues at
distant sites can, for example, edit a report together. With the draft
version displayed on their screens, they may each suggest changes - pointing
to relevant sections, highlighting important words and inserting new text as
if they were sitting at the same desk. Both parties can see each other's
reactions.
Personal conferencing 'addresses the contemporary problems of commerce,'
says Grove. It improves the flexibility, helping employees in separate
locations to collaborate more easily. It eliminates time-consuming shuffling
of work from one individual's computer to another. It can cut travel time
and costs, and facilitate 'telecommuting'.
Personal conferencing 'is very processor intensive,' says Grove. 'Clearly,
it works better on high-performance personal computers.' That should
translate into a sales boost for Intel's latest Pentium microprocessor, he
believes.
Intel is spending Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) a year on developing personal
conferencing technology, says Grove. The market may be huge. 'We will play a
part in it, we hope a big part, but if this is going to be as big as it can
be, it will require the work of dozens, if not hundreds, of companies.'
Intel has already secured the support of software developers Lotus
Development, Microsoft, Novell, Software Publishing and WordPerfect, which
have announced their interest in developing personal conferencing software.
Computer manufacturers AST, Compaq, Digital Equipment, Dell and Gateway 2000
have also endorsed the technology.
'We believe this is going to be a very important new PC application,' says
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq chief executive. Sales of computer-based
videoconferencing systems will grow from Dollars 70m last year to more than
Dollars 3bn by 1997, market researchers predict.
To take full advantage of Intel's new technology the user needs a
high-performance personal computer, based on either an Intel 486DX or a
Pentium microprocessor and an ISDN (integrated services digital network)
telephone line.
In the US, Intel has forged marketing agreements with AT&amp;T and several
regional telephone companies, which will provide ISDN telephone services
along with Intel's ProShare software and hardware package. This includes
video and communications PC add-in circuit boards, a monitor-top video
camera, hands-free headset with microphone and ProShare software. Prices
will range from Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 2,500.
Intel plans to launch its personal conferencing products in Europe this
year, and has already made an agreement with one European telephone company,
says Grove.
For those willing to sacrifice video telephone features, personal
conferencing will cost much less. Intel will offer its ProShare software
alone for Dollars 99. The program can be run on a standard 386 model
personal computer equipped with a 9600 baud modem. The software includes a
tool set with pointers, markers, highlighters and text tools. A 'jumpstart'
feature allows another user to take part in a conference without buying the
ProShare software.

FT  28 JAN 94 / People: Fresh breath sweeps into Welsh aviation sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man usually associated with the introduction of the breathalyser
setting up a small charter air business is not so far fetched as it may
seem.
Welsh Dragon Aviation, launched in Cardiff yesterday, brings to fruition a
dream Tom Parry Jones had when he was a schoolboy in Anglesey, north Wales,
50 years ago.
He then lived not far from the RAF base on the island 'and the sight of the
jets taking-off and landing fired in me the sort of boyhood enthusiasm for
flying that has lasted all my life.'
But instead of taking up flying he became a chemist, took a doctorate in
Canada and while lecturing in Cardiff in the late 1960s was introduced to an
engineer who had an idea for an advanced form of the breathalyser.
The breathalyser had been introduced in the US in about 1940 but it was a
cumbersome affair which needed a laboratory to produce results.
Jones - with his speciality in alcohol chemistry - and his colleague set up
Lion Laboratories to develop the first hand-held electronic breathalyser in
the world.
'That was 1971,' he says, 'and it changed everything. We produced a piece of
equipment the size of a cigarette packet which allowed police to test
drivers at the roadside instead of having to wait for samples to be
analysed. Our success was immediate. We captured not just the British market
but a big share of the world market with sales to the US, Scandinavia and
the rest of Europe.'
Three years ago Parry reached the point where he 'looked for other
challenges' and sold out to MPD, of Kentucky.
At the age of 56 he learnt to fly, entered a round-the-world race - 'we were
respectably placed in the middle of the field' - and subsequently bought a
bigger plane, a Cessna twin 340, the basis of his new company Welsh Dragon.
The company has bought the trading name and on-going business of Brenair
International, for a sum Parry Jones declines to disclose, and intends to
tap the business and sporting market with the Cessna and a larger Piper
Chieftain.

FT  28 JAN 94 / People: Motorway course for BAe technocrat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawrence Haynes, right, currently project director at British Aerospace, has
been appointed to the high-profile position of chief executive of the
Highways Agency, which will be established in April, within the department
of transport. The DTI made the appointment known yesterday, adding that
Haynes is due to start work on February 14. He was unavailable for comment.
The Highways Agency is part of the government's Next Steps programme of
setting up agencies, thereby changing the structure of the civil service,
with the aim of increasing efficiency and providing greater value for
taxpayers' money.
The job is bound to be sensitive. According to last November's budget
statement, total spending on trunk roads and motorways in England will
average nearly Pounds 2bn over the next three years, and a number of
controversial decisions - such as widening the M25 motorway circling London
 -are still pending. Moreover, Haynes will also be in charge of bypasses,
which are always politically sensitive, particularly so in marginal
constituencies.
This particular agency will be responsible for a 6,600 mile network of
motorways and other trunk roads, which represents fractionally less than 4
per cent of the UK's total roads but which accounts for one third of all
traffic and more than 50 per cent of heavy goods traffic.
Haynes, 41, served as a technician in the Royal Air Force from 1969 until
1978, when he studied for a Business Law degree at Heriot-Watt University.
He joined British Aerospace in 1983, eventually becoming managing director
of Microtel, a joint venture company put together by BAe in the
telecommunications field. He implemented the disposal of Microtel in 1992
and rejoined BAe, becoming project director dealing with 'special
assignments'.
As chief executive of the agency, with a salary in the region of Pounds
100,000, Haynes will be responsible for ensuring that it achieves financial
and quality of service targets. The stated aim of the agency is to 'promote
an efficient, reliable, safe and environmentally acceptable trunk road
network.'
The government argues that creation of the agency 'should help to speed up
delivery of the current substantial programme of road improvement.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Management: Dismantling the office - Chiat/Day is banishing
desks, phones and filing cabinets in a radical move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few hundred yards from funky Venice beach, the most bohemian stretch of
sand in Los Angeles, stands one of the city's most surprising pieces of
architecture: an office building with two completely dissimilar halves - one
rather like a ship and the other resembling a factory - linked in the middle
by a giant pair of binoculars.
This is the headquarters of Chiat/Day, the US advertising agency known for
its unconventional, cutting-edge campaigns. Inside the building, Jay Chiat,
the agency's iconoclastic chairman, is pushing through an organisational
upheaval which could prove just as radical as the architecture.
He is redesigning the way his staff work and the space in which they do so.
It is, he says, an attempt to make the business leaner, more nimble and
creative, and is a response to the tougher business climate of the 1990s and
changing relationships between agencies and their clients.
Some observers say it is a significant early example of a move by American
business towards a much more fluid structure - the so-called 'virtual
corporation'. Cynical advertising industry rivals dismiss it as an elaborate
smokescreen to hide cuts at Chiat/Day following the loss of some big
accounts.
Whatever the motivation, the move is unusual - and traumatic for staff:
individual workplaces are being abolished. No more will photographs of
smiling, gap-toothed children adorn parents' desks, or favourite cartoons
decorate their walls.
Chiat has always been an innovator. In 1976, he abolished formal offices at
the agency, replacing them with small, open-plan cubicles, even for senior
members of staff. Now he is doing away with the cubicles, replacing them
with a number of public meeting places. These include:
Project rooms, dedicated to a particular client, where staff will attend
account meetings.
A central library, equipped with the latest computer equipment, with files
stored on CD-Rom discs.
Locker rooms, where staff can store personal items, and work cubicles, which
they can use on an ad hoc basis.
A large common room/restaurant, with comfortable armchairs, a pool table and
ping pong. Says Chiat: 'It will be warm and welcoming, a place to hang out .
. . to go and get information.'
If this sounds rather like a university campus, so it should. Chiat argues
that conventional businesses are run too much like schools, where pupils sit
at desks all day and are subject to close supervision. He wants Chiat/Day to
be more like a college, where 'you can say 'Here is the assignment. Go do
it. Come back and you'll be graded'.' In other words, staff will be given
greater responsibility for their work and movements, or 'empowered', to use
the management jargon.
They will be mobile, and when they do not need to be in the building they
will be free to work from home, their car or a client's office.
The new system, which is also being introduced in Chiat's New York office
and will eventually reach its London branch, follows a study of work
patterns within the agency and has been made possible by recent innovations
in mobile communications.
Instead of having a desk with a fixed phone and computer, staff will be
equipped with their own personal phone numbers, cellular phones and notebook
computers. Filing cabinets will also disappear, as documents and letters
will be scanned into the firm's computer network.
Chiat argues that this is a much more efficient use of time and space.
Chiat/Day's staff already spend much of their time away from their desks, in
meetings or on the road, and it takes a long time to contact someone by
phone.
'The phone,' he says, 'has become a symbol of non-communication rather than
communication because people are never in their offices.' With a cellular
unit, they are always in touch.
The redesign is unique to Chiat/Day, though when it was planning the move
the agency discovered a Finnish company, SOL Cleaning Service, which had
already implemented a similar scheme, apparently with considerable success.
Chiat hopes the new system will keep the agency 'ahead of the curve' as big
changes rock the advertising industry. Advertisers, he says, are reassessing
the cosy relationship they once had with a single agency, and are looking
for greater creativity at lower cost.
Chiat reckons that 'it is just a matter of time before everyone is reviewing
their relationship'. And to succeed, agencies will need to show they
understand a client's businesses and are contributing to its success, as
well as holding down their costs.
He argues that the new office plan - which he calls 'team architecture' -
will encourage more interaction between staff members, leading to better
teamwork and creativity.
He is anxious to dispel the widespread notion that the scheme is designed to
make staff work from home. 'It is not about telecommuting. It's about
working differently while you are in the office.'
He hopes the lack of a desk will encourage staff to spend more time out of
the building with clients. 'We want them focused on the client's business,
not internal issues of who has the better office.'
In spite of the initial cost of new capital equipment, the system should
have a financial pay-off since it requires less office space.
Chiat reckons he can service around 200 staff with roughly 30,000 sq ft of
space, compared with around 100 employees under a conventional layout. The
system is also more flexible, so he can increase his headcount without
raising leasehold expenses.
But the move to team architecture seems a considerable gamble. The
disappearance of desks - a form of office security blanket - could hurt
staff morale, which is particularly critical in advertising.
Chiat acknowledges the transition will not be easy. 'The change is
monumental. I don't think any of the people implementing it have any sense
of how much despair there's going to be, how much trauma there's going to
be, and the period of time it is going to take for people to feel
comfortable with this concept.'
But he's convinced that they will eventually.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Management: New logic is here to stay - Edward Lawler
condemns the latest theories as passing fads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD LAWLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management has always been beset by fads and fashions, gurus and demagogues.
But never before has there been such a sheer volume of new approaches.
This has led many managers to reach one of two incorrect conclusions: that
the new approaches are all hype with no substance, or that a particular
programme is the answer.
The reality is more complex and challenging: that the traditional logic
about what makes for high-performing organisations is no longer valid, and
that a new logic is emerging piecemeal in its place. Some early implementers
of it are already gaining a competitive advantage.
What is the new logic? It has a number of elements and is not fully
articulated by any single approach - certainly not by the very popular
re-engineering movement, as James Champy acknowledged in this column on
January 14.
Value Added: Top to Bottom. Fundamental to the new logic is the belief that
value can be added at all levels of an organisation. In the conventional
logic, the assumption is that organisations, if structured properly, add
value primarily at the top.
The new logic suggests allowing individuals throughout the organisation to
co-ordinate and control their own work, and so reduce the need for layers of
management and bureaucracy. This cannot mean the elimination of
co-ordination, because without it an organisation is unlikely to add value
above and beyond what an individual can add. Thus it is critical to put
individuals in structures that allow them to exercise lateral co-ordination
and self-control so they can add the value that, in the old logic, is added
at the top
As Champy pointed out, a self-control environment needs managers who act as
leaders and direction setters. His attack on 'empowerment as traditionally
advocated' for being tantamount to abdication, is largely a straw man
argument, because few proponents of empowerment have argued that managers
should just get out of the way. Managers need to provide employees with
information, training and power, and hold them accountable for their
performance. This cuts costs, as well as creating a workforce that is more
responsive to customers and has a greater focus on quality.
Pyramids to business unit structures. The old logic stresses that control
requires hierarchy. However, as the experiences of Xerox and Motorola have
shown, true empowerment often requires a major organisational restructuring
which destroys the traditional pyramidal structure.
It is not enough just to create problem-solving teams, as total quality
management programmes do, or organise around processes, as re-engineering
advocates. The new logic requires the flattening of an organisation, and the
creation of one which, instead of being structured into functions, is
organised around small groups or mini-businesses. With this architecture,
numerous free-standing businesses can be created which have their own
accountability and their own customers.
Individuals to teams. In order for lateral processes to work, individuals
need to be grouped into multi-functional teams. Thus, while the old logic
suggests that individual accountability and responsibility are of supreme
importance, the new logic assumes that individuals can do little in complex,
inter-dependent situations. As a result, it is best to hold teams
accountable, and to organise around teams and their structures. So managers
need to be conscious of how their behaviour affects team performance, and
what they can do to make teams more effective.
Reward systems also need to be changed. Instead of individuals being
rewarded for how well they do their jobs (this has not even been effective
in traditional organisations), they need to be measured and rewarded for the
success of their team and their business unit. Finally, instead of paying
employees for the size of their jobs and their altitude in the hierarchy,
individuals need to be paid for their value-adding competencies.
I am often asked what is beyond the new logic of organising. What is the
next wave? At this point, I think this is the wrong question. It incorrectly
assumes that the principles which I have called the new logic represent a
transitory phase. The new logic is still a work in process, and is likely to
be the dominant logic for many decades. It is the logic of globally
competitive information technology-based organisations which look for
competitive advantage through their organisational competencies. As such, it
is likely to continue to evolve, and to be in place for decades until a new
world order and/or new technologies emerge.
The implications of this for managers are clear. The old organisational life
which may be comfortable and predictable is disappearing rapidly. The new
logic outlined here is not like the fads and fashions that have gripped
management over the decades. Instead it represents fundamental change in the
way organisations will operate. People who develop the skills to be
effective in organisations which follow the new logic will thrive. Those who
do not will be just as obsolete as poorly skilled production workers in a
high-technology manufacturing facility.
The author is professor of management and organisation at the University of
Southern California School of Business Administration and director of the
Centre for Effective Organisations.
Christopher Lorenz's column will resume on February 11.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Alcan may join bid for coal mine: Canadian company links up
with Ryan Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan of Canada yesterday became the first overseas company to declare an
interest in bidding for part of British Coal.
It is considering joining a bid to buy the north-east section of British
Coal as a means of securing cheaper supplies for its aluminium smelter at
Lynemouth, Northumberland.
British Alcan Aluminium, its UK subsidiary, yesterday announced a joint
venture with Ryan Group, the coal mining company, to evaluate the operations
which are likely to include the Ellington pit, the last working mine in the
area, and seven opencast sites.
Alcan is the first company not already involved in coal mining to declare it
is interested in buying part of British Coal.
Ryan is thought to be considering bids for others among the five British
Coal regions that the government has said it will sell off, particularly
Scotland and Wales. It already operates opencast sites and underground
mines, mainly in south Wales and the north-east of England.
Alcan's interest in bidding for the north-east follows attempts to force
down the price at which British Coal supplies it with coal, mainly from
Ellington.
It recently signed a deal to buy 1.25m tonnes of coal until March next year
at prices subsidised by the govern-ment.
British Alcan's plant was built in 1972, and the choice of site was
influenced by the availability of low-cost coal. It says that difficult
world markets for aluminium and high power costs have caused successive
reductions in output.
Mr Paul Belanger, managing director of Alcan Primary and Recycling UK, said
the plant had been unprofitable since 1990. His company wanted to preserve
jobs at the smelter, which employs 355 people.
Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan chief executive, said there was a good chance the
evaluation would lead to a bid.
Alcan's Lynemouth is the only remaining coal-fired electricity plant in the
north-east apart from Blyth power station, whose long-term future is in
doubt.
Mr Ian Lavery, secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers at Ellington,
said the union remained opposed to privatisation, but the chances of
stopping it were increasingly remote.
'It's a small crumb of comfort to have the knowledge that any prospective
buyers are interested in the colliery,' he said. 'I would rather people show
their interest before any possible hasty decision by British Coal to close
the colliery.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / Development agency to change project funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English Partnerships, the Treasury's new regeneration agency, is to take
advantage of a relaxation of constraints to change the way future projects
are funded.
Sir Idris Pearce, deputy chairman of English Partnerships, told executives
from the private and public sectors, meeting in Birmingham, that the agency
is thinking in terms of investment in projects fostering economic revival,
not of disbursing grants.
The Treasury has in the past funded regeneration either through grants or
through programmes with an annual spending limit. It has been been reluctant
to allow unspent grants from one year to be carried over into the next. It
has also previously refused to permit the use of financial instruments and
the flexibility common in the private sector.
'I see no bar whatsoever in our holding equity in particular projects,' said
Sir Idris, who believes that English Partnerships will be a catalyst in
encouraging the Treasury to accept a more flexible use of government funds.
'We want to develop the concept that we can use assets as a guarantee for
other forms of development,' he added. He said the agency might use
financial devices such as sale and lease-back arrangements on property. It
would also explore means of using funds from foreign banks.
The agency is taking over the administration of City Grant and Derelict Land
Grant, two subsidies to encourage development, as well as English Estates,
the government's factory building agency. It is in the process of recruiting
staff, so its economic impact is unlikely to be felt for two or three years.
With Lord Walker, the former cabinet minister, as chairman, the agency has a
wide brief aimed at wealth and job creation in rundown areas. Funds will be
used to help finance projects conceived locally.
Behind English Partnerships' concern with financial ingenuity is its limited
budget. It will receive between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m a year, meaning,
said Sir Idris, that 'our monetary headroom is very restricted'.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Investment trusts double savings inflow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flow of money into investment trusts through savings schemes more than
doubled last year, reflecting private investors' switch to equities in an
attempt to beat low interest rates.
A total of Pounds 239.61m was invested through savings schemes last year, a
107 per cent rise from 1992. The shift was particularly evident in the
fourth quarter, when a record Pounds 73.12m was invested, a 13 per cent
increase from the third quarter.
Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the Association of Investment Trust
Companies, said: 'Investors are clearly looking for good value alternatives
to increase returns over the long term, especially in the light of low
interest rates.'
The figures offer further evidence of the fierce competition for savings
which has contributed to building societies suffering a net outflow of
retail deposits in the second half of last year.
They come just one day after it emerged that private investors accounted for
Pounds 5bn of the record Pounds 9.1bn invested in unit trusts last year.
Societies point out that for 1993 as a whole they recorded a net inflow of
Pounds 2.2bn in retail funds - a clear improvement on the Pounds 295m inflow
in 1992. Even so, this is significantly below the Pounds 5.8bn and Pounds
6.6bn inflows they received in 1991 and 1990 respectively.
Investment trust shares are traditionally bought in batches through
stockbrokers, in the same way as any other company's shares. But 10 years
ago the largest investment trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial, introduced a regular
savings scheme which allowed investors to put relatively small amounts of
money - from about Pounds 25 a month - towards building up a holding in the
trust. Schemes are now run by 36 management companies, covering 155
investment trusts. The average monthly saving is Pounds 80.
Savings schemes spread purchases across the peaks and troughs of the stock
market, so that savers do not risk putting all their money in at the top of
the market and seeing their investment fall in value immediately. The
schemes also tend to prop up trusts' share prices by providing a steady
source of demand.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Still drilling the N Sea wishing wells: The harsh climate of
tax and pricing that challenges oil exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drillers on oil rigs exploring in the North Sea are an optimistic breed.
A positive attitude helps when only a third of exploration wells drilled
find significant traces of hydrocarbons and only a few of those prove
economically viable.
The drillers' optimism will be tested this year as the effects of low oil
prices and tax changes made last year threaten a lean 12 months.
A recent study from consultants Arthur Andersen suggests that companies have
firm plans to drill only 100 exploration or assessment wells this year
compared with 121 last year and more than 200 in 1990, when tax policies
encouraged exploration. About seven onshore wells are likely to be drilled
this year.
The decline in exploration comes as UK North Sea production reaches levels
last seen in 1988 - before the Piper Alpha disaster led to large-scale
shutdowns for modifications to platforms and the installation of new safety
equipment. Oil production last year was an average of 1.98m barrels a day, a
five-year high as 14 new oilfields came on-stream, compared with nine in
1992. Gas production was 20 per cent higher.
Average daily oil and gas revenues rose by nearly 13 per cent to Pounds
33.5m, helped by buoyant gas prices and foreign exchange rates which offset
somewhat the steep fall in oil prices, down from about Dollars 20 a barrel
for the benchmark Brent crude in January last year to a current level of
about Dollars 14.
The production surge gave a strong boost to the UK economy last year,
contributing 0.2 per cent of the seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent increase
in total GDP for the fourth quarter, according to government figures. The
development of new reserves continued to account for about a fifth of UK
industrial investment in the first half of last year, official statistics
show.
Oil output is likely to rise again this year as additional fields come
on-stream as a result of investment decisions taken a few years ago. Ms Kate
Jackson, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie consultants in Edinburgh, says five
new oil fields should begin producing in 1994. That, say provisional
estimates from Wood Mackenzie, will increase UK offshore oil production for
1994 to an average of 2.5m barrels a day.
Revenues, however, will come under pressure unless oil prices recover, a
prospect that divides analysts. City forecasts for the average price of
Brent crude this year range from Dollars 14-Dollars 18 a barrel compared
with Dollars 17 a barrel last year.
The short-term effect of low prices on North Sea output is surprisingly
small. A recent Wood Mackenzie study concluded that a barrel of North Sea
oil costs on average Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) to produce. In spite of the
North Sea's reputation as a high-cost production area, most existing fields
should remain profitable even if the oil price struggles to rise above the
present depressed Dollars 14 a barrel. Even a collapse to Dollars 10 a
barrel would lead to only a marginal decline in production to the year 2000,
the study said.
Analysts say this is because cost-cutting and technological innovation is
helping companies find and recover greater amounts of oil at lower costs.
The extensive infrastructure of North Sea pipelines and land terminals means
new discoveries near existing fields can be easily and cheaply connected to
pipeline net-works.
The ownership structure of most North Sea fields is another factor likely to
keep even marginal fields producing, according to Ms Jo Armstrong, economist
with Royal Bank of Scotland.
It is common for a dozen companies, ranging from very small exploration and
productions companies to the integrated majors such as Shell and British
Petroleum, to have stakes in individual fields. 'The different financial and
tax positions of the partners militates against early shut-ins,' she says.
The high cost of maintaining an idle North Sea platform is another deterrent
to early closedowns.
It is therefore no surprise that companies seeking short-term financial
relief find it easier to postpone or cancel exploration projects.
But those that can afford to continue drilling should find that costs have
fallen sharply. Current day rates for drilling rigs are at the bottom of the
usual Pounds 17,000-Pounds 22,000 range, according to Robert Steven of the
FT's North Sea Letter. High lay-up costs mean that many drillers may simply
grin and bear it by accepting contracts below their operating costs while
waiting for oil prices to rise.

Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, last week fired a salvo against
out-of-town developments.
Putting the heart back into cities 'means discouraging development on
green-field sites on the edge of cities', he said in a speech to the Town
and Country Planning Association, a group of business and planning
interests.
Mr Gummer promised to consider revising PPG6 - a planning guidance note
issued in October 1992 which stresses the need to revitalise town centres
rather than promote out-of-town stores - if developers' proposals and the
response of local authorities failed to reflect its broad thrust.
Mr Gummer's message was clear but it was patently counter to the approach
taken by other ministers in the DoE, the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Department of Transport.
His position is in contrast to the DoE's long-standing policy of supporting
out-of-town proposals. Last year, Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister,
stated that PPG6 did not constitute a shift in policy for town centres and
retail developments. In another speech, Mr David Curry, planning minister,
advocated the need to promote sites on the periphery of towns.
This apparent confusion over out-of-town development is symptomatic of a
deeper problem in government policymaking: the chronic lack of co-ordination
between its planning and transport policies.
The case for co-ordinating transport and land-use planning goes back 30
years to the publication of the Buchanan report on the long-term impact of
traffic growth. One of the report's chief conclusions was that land-use
development needed to be planned in conjunction with road and public
transport provision.
Shortly afterwards, the DoE was created to oversee both planning and
transport functions. This was reinforced by several other innovations in
strategic thinking that brought planning and transport under the same wing.
However, this new approach was never properly implemented. The DoE was
separated from the Department of Transport, and land-use and transport
planning became increasingly independent of each other.
The division between land-use and transport was epitomised in the
development of London docklands. Encouraged by the Thatcher government,
which rarely put transport at the top of its agenda, the LDDC was forced to
attract jobs to docklands with little thought given to the provision of
public transport.
The chickens came home to roost when it was realised in the late 1980s - at
the height of the property boom - that in one development alone there was
enough office space to house 55,000 workers who would be serviced by a light
railway that could only accommodate 11,000 passengers an hour. This anomaly
eventually led to a government announcement last October to extend the
Jubilee line, linking Docklands with central London.
Another example of the split between transport and land-use planning is the
transport department's decision to proceed with plans to widen the western
sector of the M25 to 14 lanes, where policy constraints such as the need to
preserve the green belt, are at their greatest.
This contrasts with policy in the East Thames corridor which covers large
tracts of east London and the Thames estuary - an area suffering from
problems such as unemployment.
In spite of the government's claim that it is trying to promote growth in
east London, there has been little obvious progress on public or private
transport schemes in the region. This is partly due to the appalling
confusion arising from 'on-off' decisions on projects such as the Channel
Tunnel rail link, the East London river crossing or Crossrail.
Too often, public transport schemes have to depend on securing private
sector funding. This demand is not imposed on road building, which arguably
enhances property values still more. When the private sector is asked to
look at road or rail schemes, the plethora of choices and the uncertainties
of government policy make a constructive response difficult.
The transport secretary, Mr John MacGregor, and his cabinet colleague Mr
Gummer must tackle this inconsistency of approach towards transport and
planning policy. If they can then they will go a long way towards helping
the government attract private-sector finance. They must:
set out which modes of transport they favour;
prioritise the infrastructure projects needing finance;
indicate the complementary pattern of urban development schemes they favour;
and
ensure that this approach is followed through by both their departments and
local authorities alike.
Investors cannot work in a vacuum. They need a framework and not a black
hole. And this framework must be shown to work.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Property: Index hits new high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Investment Property Databank, a research group, recorded a 16.4 per cent
total return from its monthly all-property index in 1993. For the month of
December, the index rose by 3.6 per cent, the highest single monthly figure
ever recorded by IPD.
Further big yield cuts brought the aggregate equivalent yield to 8.9 per
cent at the end of December, more than one percentage point below the 10 per
cent levels that prevailed less than a year earlier.
Aggregate rental values fell by only 0.3 per cent in December, but the rate
of decline for the calendar year, at 8 per cent, was barely an improvement
upon the 1992 results.
All sectors showed improvement in capital growth and shorter yields in
December. Retails remained the best performing sector with a total return of
4.1 per cent, compared with 3.0 per cent in November. Offices remained in
second place, with a total return of 3.3 per cent, followed by industrials
at 2.9 per cent.
For the quarter to December, all sectors showed improved returns. Retails
returned 8.9 per cent, a 5 percentage point improvement over the quarter to
September. At the year-end, offices recorded the most improved 12-month
total return, reaching 15.0 per cent for 1993.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Scott to hear QC's evidence in private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott has decided to hear evidence in private from an important
witness on the issue of disclosure of government documents.
The judge said yesterday that he would take oral evidence from Mr Andrew
Collins QC in private next Wednesday to avoid doing anything that could
prejudice a possible re-trial of four businessmen convicted in 1992 of
illegally exporting arms to Iraq.
Mr Collins is counsel for Customs and Excise in a pending appeal by the
businessmen, who were involved with the Reading-based company Ordinance
Technology. The Ordtech case involved the use of public interest immunity
certificates by ministers to withhold Whitehall documents of relevance to
the defence, as in the Matrix-Churchill trial. The businessmen are appealing
against conviction on the grounds that the government knew one defendant was
working for the intelligence services and that the arms sold to Iraq were
being routed via Jordan.
Lord Justice Scott could still bring Mr Collins' evidence to the attention
of the Court of the Appeal 'in the interests of justice'.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Ford sets up factory for used-car venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford is setting up a 'used-car factory' to prepare and sell to its dealers
up to 85,000 nearly new vehicles a year.
The venture, called Ford Direct, is believed to be the first used-car
retailing scheme in which the manufacturer is taking direct responsibility
for preparing vehicles for sale and providing warranties for them.
It also represents a response to research carried out by Ford during the
past 18 months which, the company admits, shows motorists to be 'deeply
cynical' about the integrity of the motor trade - frequently with good
reason.
The high level of complaints from consumers about used cars has led the
Office of Fair Trading to start an investigation into the trade and its
dealers.
The Ford Direct venture, which starts next month and in which the company is
investing about Pounds 10m, initially is being confined to cars less than
one-year-old. All will be returned vehicles from short-term rental companies
which Ford has supplied, or from Ford's own company fleets.
This means initial maximum yearly sales through the scheme of about 45,000
vehicles. Yet if it is well received and proves commercially viable, it may
be widened to embrace other sources of similarly aged cars and total about
85,000 cars a year.
Even at the 45,000-a-year level, the scheme would account for about 10 per
cent of total annual sales of 'nearly new' cars under a year old.
Most of Ford's rivals run their own dealer-based 'manufacturer-approved'
used-car retailing schemes, such as Vauxhall's Network Q operation, and may
dismiss Ford's initiative as little different from their own schemes.
Yet Ford maintains that its scheme eliminates the three most serious sources
of concern aired by consumers about other operations: that dealer-based
'independent' pre-sale checks and tests are neither properly independent nor
rigorous; that warranties offered are not comprehensive enough; and that too
often dealers try not to honour them.
The fundamental difference, however, is the manner in which cars are to be
processed for sale.
In the opening weeks of the scheme Ford has contracted three independent
outlets to prepare the cars for inspection by its own personnel and RAC
inspectors.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, said the company was
identifying a final site for the single 'used-car factory', which will
process cars on flow-line principles similar to a normal assembly line.
The final stage will remain an RAC inspection after which the car is
identified with what Ford insists is a non-forgeable Ford Direct hologram.
The cars' specifications will be entered on Ford's computer network as they
are being processed, and the company's 1,000 dealers will bid for them via
their Viewdata terminals.
Ford says that as part of the scheme, which includes the company's 12-month
warranty, buyers will be able to exchange any car with which they become
dissatisfied up to 30 days after purchase.

Labour yesterday called for a public inquiry into the collapse of Astra
Training, accusing the government of squandering a precious national asset.
Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow employment minister, said the training provider, set
up when the government privatised the Skills Training Agency, had
'systematically milked' the training funding system.
The Department of Employment said there was no need for an inquiry.
Setting out his concerns in a letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, Mr Lloyd said the government could not dismiss its
responsibilities by claiming that Astra was a private company.

Lautro said its disciplinary committee accepted that Laurentian had since

FT  28 JAN 94 / Watchdog may bar six from securities

<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is
considering barring six individuals permanently from the securities
industry, Norma Cohen writes.
It is the first time SIB will have used its powers to ban people under
Section 59 of the Financial Services Act.
SIB said it would consider banning those whose actions over time revealed
they should not participate in the industry or those who, with a single
action, demonstrated they were unfit to conduct investment business.
There has been industry speculation that the SIB would attempt to bar former
officials of Inescomim for their role in connection with the disappearance
of assets from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
The six, who have not been identified, will be given one month to challenge
the order.

FT  28 JAN 94 / SIB to spend more in crackdown on City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, NORMA COHEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, plans to
spend an extra Pounds 1.3m next year as it intensifies supervision of other
financial regulators and enforcement of rules.
SIB's management plan, published yesterday, warns that the higher costs will
mean that 'significant increases in fees' are likely to be proposed for some
bodies.
The rise from an expected expenditure of Pounds 17.46m in the 12 months to
the end of March 1994 to Pounds 18.76m in the following year represents an
increase of 7.5 per cent.
The expected establishment of the Personal Investment Authority, the new
retail financial regulator, in July and the subsequent drop in the number of
organisations that the board regulates directly and from which it receives
fees accounts for some of the increased costs.
The board, however, will expect to receive a levy from the PIA as it does
from the other regulators it oversees.
A paper setting out new proposals on its fees is due to be published by the
board around the middle of next month.
This first publication of its annual management plan reflects a shift
towards greater emphasis on enforcement and supervision. The enforcement
division will roughly double from its present size of 20 staff, although it
will have a slightly different function as a result of a wider
reorganisation.
The plan also details new techniques for supervising other regulators, such
as unaccompanied visits by SIB officials to firms regulated by other bodies.
The board also intends to develop qualitative measures to assess other
regulators' performance, drawing in part on the standards set for the PIA.
The new authority is due to submit its application to be recognised by SIB
early next month.
The board's management plan also spells out four key areas that it intends
to concentrate on in 1994-95.
These are: reviewing transfers and opt-outs from occupational pension
schemes to personal pensions; clarifying the definition of market abuse and
improving the means to detect and punish it; approving the proposed Crest
system for paperless equity settlement; and monitoring the results of
commission and product-disclosure for life insurance products.
The report highlights progress on reviewing the sale of personal pensions to
people leaving occupational schemes.
The steering group which the board set up in December will, in February,
make recommendations on how to ensure high standards in future. The board
plans to publish draft proposals in March or April.
Proposals for remedying what harm has been done to people buying such
pensions after wrong advice are due to be published in July.
A Commons committee agreed yesterday on the terms of reference for its
inquiry into the regulation of financial services, James Blitz writes.
The Treasury and civil service committee said that it would examine the
operation and the adequacy of the Financial Services Act 1986, the cost of
the current regulatory structure and the impact of EU directives, among
other issues.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Major attacks opponents on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday attacked Labour's credibility over public spending.
He said the party's claim to have no spending commitments showed that nobody
should believe a word it said outside the Commons.
The prime minister said the claim - made earlier this week by Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow chancellor - meant that it was now known that Labour would
earmark no extra money for the National Health Service. 'All their promises
are obvious rubbish - as the opposition front bench have told us,' Mr Major
said.
His comments came in stormy Commons exchanges after cabinet ministers had
discussed tax, spending and public-sector pay at their weekly meeting. Mr
John Smith, Labour leader, sought to brand the government as one 'of high
taxation'. He said this was because it was also the government of 'waste and
incompetence'.
Mr Smith, however, has been attacked from the left of his own party over the
tough line on spending pledges.
Thirty four Labour leftwingers have signed a parliamentary early-day motion
calling for a 'clear socialist commitment to be made now' on a range of
policy objectives.
These include the recovery of full employment, planned defence
diversification, rebuilding of Britain's infrastructure, extension of public
services and the regeneration of industry.
Meanwhile Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, sought to back up Mr
Major's attacks, using a letter to Mr David Blunkett, her opposite number,
to ask for 'clarification' of Labour's health policies. Referring to
newspaper reports that Mr Blunkett had been 'severely reprimanded' by his
colleagues for producing a policy document full of uncosted spending
pledges, Mrs Bottomley said the 'dressing-down' he had received exposed the
'deceit' at the heart of Labour's health policy.
In a separate development last night Labour accused the government of trying
to 'gag' discussion on the controversial Child Support Agency by removing a
planned Labour-led debate from next week's parliamentary programme.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Mining pension transfers continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mineworkers' Pension Scheme said yesterday there had been no let-up in
applications to transfer out of its scheme and into personal pension plans
in spite of recent adverse publicity over such transfers.
Mr Paul Trickett, the scheme's secretary, said about 500 applications to
transfer had been received since December 8 when news broke of a government
investigation into widespread mis-selling by insurance sales agents.
'Nothing has changed,' Mr Trickett said. The average value of sums to be
transferred from the scheme is Pounds 27,000 and the aggregate value of
current applications about Pounds 13.5m. The scheme said more than Pounds
700m had been transferred in the past few years, most of it into personal
schemes which often offer benefits inferior to those offered by British
Coal.
Mr Trickett said all those seeking a transfer had been contacted and urged
to take independent advice, paid for by the scheme. They have also been told
about the government investigation into mis-selling of personal pensions.

the manufacturer's dealers will mark up their prices by at least Pounds
200-300 more than us.'
Mr Terrence Puleston (above), co-owner of T &amp; T Autos, also in east London,
said: 'I think Ford will come unstuck the way business is going. The trade
is so bad that it comes in silly spasms, one week you might sell three cars
and then another three weeks you might not sell any.'
One of Ford's biggest selling points for the scheme is its 12-month
warranty. But most independent dealers already offer private warranty
schemes. Mr Richard Davis, who bought a used Ford Fiesta from John's Autos
yesterday, said: 'I have bought about 10 cars from used-car dealers and I
have been happy.'
A woman who had brought a male friend to help her look for a car at
Westcombe Carriage agreed with the Ford finding that dealers prefer to talk
to men.
She said: 'Used-car dealers think they can pull one over on the women.
'But I don't mind because it is the car I am going to drive not the person
selling it.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / US urged to keep ban on Adams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night sent a clear signal to Washington that any
decision to lift its ban on Mr Gerry Adams entering the US would be
unwelcome, unless the Sinn Fein president renounced violence.
In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the ban is due,
Downing Street said it hoped a visa would not be given to Mr Adams unless he
made 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence'. It was 'deeds not
words' that were required. It said the government had been in talks with the
US on the subject.
The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores in London.
Yesterday also saw two sectarian murders in Ulster. The attacks came on the
eve of the first session of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference
since the two governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December.
The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to
reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative.
A display of unity over the progress of the political talks co-ordinated by
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, may be harder to engineer.
London has indicated that it intends to act, as promised, to give focus to
the talks fairly soon, although this may come in bilateral and private
sessions. Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace process.
Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy in Dublin after
receiving an invitation to attend a conference in New York on Monday.
Under US immigration law, he is still officially ineligible for a visa but a
waiver can be issued by the attorney general on recommendation from Mr
Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. It is understood that President
Bill Clinton has been involved in the decision-making process and that a
series of meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of
Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf.
The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline Democratic Unionist
party have already declined an invitation to attend the conference.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, are expected to
attend.
Unionist politicians and leaders of loyalist terrorist groups in Northern
Ireland have met to discuss the Downing Street declaration, according to the
BBC television programme Spotlight, which is shown only in Northern Ireland.
According to the programme, the paramilitaries, represented by the combined
loyalist military command have been seeking clarification of the opposing
views on the declaration taken by the Democratic Unionist and Ulster
Unionist parties.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Radioactive waste 'should be buried'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highly radioactive nuclear waste should be buried deep underground, one of
the authors of a new report on managing nuclear waste said yesterday.
But Mr Peter Saunders, an energy consultant formerly with the UK Atomic
Energy Authority, said that 'time is on our side' as much of the high-level
waste produced in the past 20 years would have to cool for several more
decades. This would give scientists time to evaluate the best techniques.
The report, compiled by a panel of chemists and energy specialists for
Brunel University, London, surveys the methods used for storing nuclear
waste in Europe.
The government has not yet announced whether the forthcoming review of the
nuclear industry will cover the controversial question of the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Renewable energy projects criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government projects on 'renewable' energy technologies have not focused
enough on their export potential, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry has also concentrated on too few
projects and technologies, the office added in its review. But it concluded
that the programme, which has cost Pounds 340m in 1992-93 prices, is
'soundly based'.
The programme was set up in the 1970s following the oil crisis. A government
advisory group concluded a year ago that within 30 years renewable energy
could 'plausibly' provide 5 per cent to 20 per cent of electricity supply at
1991 levels.
Three projects used a third of the Pounds 340m: wind turbines, barrages on
the Mersey and Severn rivers, and investigations on Cornish granite rocks.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Agency aids jobless graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mandy Glucksman graduated from Liverpool John Moores University in June
1992 with an upper second in business studies, she expected to step straight
into a career.
Instead she encountered the dole, four low-level temporary clerical jobs,
and a series of rejections at final interviews for work that matched her
qualifications.
Ms Glucksman then heard through friends about Prospectus, an experimental
centre for unemployed graduates being set up in her native Manchester. She
became one of its first clients last October.
Six weeks later - after assessment, tests and training - she was taken on by
JD Williams, a Manchester-based catalogue and mail order company in the N.
Brown Group. She is now in charge of a team of 15 telephone salespeople.
Prospectus, which says it is the first agency of its kind in Britain, was
formally opened yesterday. It already has about 200 unemployed graduate
clients and another 450 have made inquiries.
Its Pounds 75,000 annual budget is being met jointly by Manchester Training
and Enterprise Council and the European Social Fund.
Greater Manchester was chosen for the experiment because with four
universities, two graduate schools and an array of colleges of higher or
further education, it houses one of the largest concentrations of full-time
students in Europe - more than 55,000 of them. However, jobless graduates
have been turning up from as far afield as Devon.
Mr Martin McNally, the manager of Prospectus, estimates graduate
unemployment at between 12 per cent and 15 per cent, with many of those in
employment doing jobs well below their qualifications, some of them menial.
The centre offers free counselling, psychological profiling, and
psychometric testing, as well as coaching through videos to help graduates
perform better at inter-views.
The idea is to define their skills and aptitudes so they can target jobs
where they will have the best chance and then sell themselves to the
employers more effectively.
Clients have been equally split between the sexes, while 43 per cent have
been graduates in the sciences, 33 per cent in the arts and 24 per cent in
business studies.
Ms Glucksman's problem was not being memorable enough at interviews. 'I was
shown how to rewrite my curriculum vitae to highlight points that would
attract questions. I then prepared answers to those questions which would
help make me stand out in the interviewer's mind.'
A project on job satisfaction in a regional health authority, which she had
done as part of her degree, thus enabled her say something unusual about
herself at interviews.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Bank seeks code for debt sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is to try to develop a voluntary code of practice to
regulate how banks sell debt in troubled European companies, Mr Pen Kent, an
executive director of the Bank, said yesterday.
Mr Kent's proposal follows a growth in the sale of debt at a fraction of its
face value by banks. They have increasingly chosen to dispose of it rather
than risk losing value when the finances of the company concerned are
restructured.
Although the market in London is less developed than in the US, many of the
buyers of debt have been US venture capital funds seeking high returns if
the company recovers.
Sale of debt in London has grown rapidly in the past year.
Mr Kent said yesterday that he would explore with banks in the next few
weeks whether they could establish a code of practice requiring buyers of
distressed debt to comply with the Bank's approach to debt restructuring.
He said that banks might also agree to a 'closed season' during company
restructuring talks when debt would not be sold.
Mr Kent told a conference in London organised by the Association of
Corporate Treasurers that he wanted to continue developing the 'London
Approach', a set of principles for company restructurings established in
1990.
He said that in spite of concerns that distressed debt sales might undermine
the London Approach, this had not occurred in the small number of cases
involving debt sales which the Bank had helped to co-ordinate.
Among other ways of developing the London Approach, Mr Kent suggested:
Trying to promote greater trust among parties to a restructuring by full
sharing of information. He said that it was important that all banks
involved 'put their cards on the table at an early stage in the
negotiations'. Involving creditors other than banks in negotiations. Mr Kent
said that a weakness of only banks taking part was that they were 'generally
protecting their own positions at the expense of other creditors and
shareholders'.
Encouraging investors to put fresh equity or mezzanine debt - structured
finance which has a higher claim to company assets than equity - into
troubled companies. This was currently avoided by risk-averse investors.
Trying to marry statutory insolvency procedures under the 1986 Insolvency
Act with the voluntary London Approach.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Labour calls for probe into Astra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called for a public inquiry into the collapse of Astra
Training, accusing the government of squandering a precious national asset.
Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow employment minister, said the training provider, set
up when the government privatised the Skills Training Agency, had
'systematically milked' the training funding system.
'Clearly ordinary audit procedures - and three successive secretaries of
state for employment - failed to protect public money,' he said.
The Department of Employment said there was no need for an inquiry.
Setting out his concerns in a letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, Mr Lloyd said the government could not dismiss its
responsibilities by claiming that Astra was a private company.
'It was a public asset, paid for and built up with public money,' he said.
'It was sold off at a loss by the government and it has been milking the
public purse.'
Astra, which went into receivership last July, was paid Pounds 11m to take
over most of the government's skill centres.

</HEADLINE>

A group of leading religious figures yesterday said that anti-semitism was
'alive and literally kicking' in Britain, and called for a change in the law
to protect religious minorities.
The call came in a report for the Runnymede Trust, a body that monitors
trends in social affairs, by a commission that included Rabbi Julia
Neuberger and the Rt Rev Richard Harries, bishop of Oxford. The report says
that between 1984 and 1992 there was an 85 per cent increase in anti-semitic
incidents reported to the synagogues' Board of Deputies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewable energy industry has suffered its third setback in south Wales
in a fortnight with a planning committee's rejection of a 45-turbine wind
farm.
Port Talbot councillors voted to reject the application by TriGen Windpower
for a 20MW wind farm on a forested hillside 500 metres up. They decided its
appearance would be detrimental to the area.
The decision, after the rejection by councils of two other wind farms in
Dyfed earlier this month, reflects increasing public opposition.

The government came under fire in the Commons yesterday over the delay in
opening up the milk market in England and Wales to competition.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said getting the scheme right
was more important than meeting deadlines. She was answering questions a day
after the Commons agriculture committee announced plans to examine why
liberalisation had been postponed until November.
Her assurances were brushed aside by opposition MPs, with Labour saying the
government should accept responsibility for the 'disarray' in the market.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Major soothes Tory critics of council reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has acted to reassure backbench Tories concerned at the
government's reforms of local government.
Meanwhile social services directors attacked the policy of replacing the
two-tier system of counties and districts with all-purpose unitary
authorities, saying it would make the job of protecting children at risk
more difficult.
The prime minister assured MPs that the status quo for county councils
remained an option in the proposed local government reorganisation - in
spite of statements from environment ministers that this should happen only
in 'exceptional' circumstances.
In a letter, the prime minister told Sir John Stanley, Tory MP for Tonbridge
and Malling in Kent: 'The maintenance of the status quo is an option that
the local government commission can consider in carrying out its review of
local government structure in the shire counties.'
Sir John said he was delighted with the response. 'For a considerable time I
have been very doubtful whether unitary authorities are the right answer for
such a large, complex and diverse county as Kent,' he said. 'The cost of the
local government reorganisation is bound to result in a sizeable one-off
bill falling on Kent council tax payers.'
He said the local government commission for England, which has not yet made
formal recommendations for Kent, did not appear to be considering the status
quo. Instead, it 'was saying that the choice for Kent was effectively
between four and eight unitary authorities'.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has so far not accepted any of
the proposals to retain the status quo put to him by the commission.
The Association of Directors of Social Services said abolition of the
counties could result in 'a series of mini-Orkneys' - a reference to the
1991 row over the small, unitary Orkney Islands Council's reaction to child
abuse allegations.
It said the commission had not looked seriously at the problems for
protecting children at risk under a series of smaller authorities.
Ms Denise Platt, president of the association and social services director
for Hammersmith and Fulham, said: 'To steal a phrase - every small authority
is a mini-Orkney. Child protection services can only be developed if there
is a reasonable sized department.'
She said that problems in Orkney, when social services wrongly took children
into care after allegations of 'ritual sex abuse', had been caused because
there had only been a small group of social workers, who could not develop
breadth of knowledge or experience.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Pounds 135m spent on scrapped rail link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail has spent up to Pounds 135m on parts of the Channel tunnel
high-speed rail link that will not now go ahead, Mr Roger Freeman, public
transport minister, said last night.
Mr Freeman, in a Commons written answer, said BR had spent Pounds 89m on an
abandoned section of the link's southerly route. The government announced
last week that the route through London would be north of the Thames to a
terminal at St Pancras.
Mr Freeman said Union Railways, the company promoting the high-speed tunnel
link, had also 'assigned' Pounds 46m to the plan, now dropped, to site a
terminal at King's Cross.
'A more detailed assessment is not possible because the King's Cross project
was not conceived solely for the rail link,' Mr Freeman said. 'A proportion
of the southerly approach is still part of the route.'
Much of the money spent on the southern link went towards buying property,
particularly a large swathe in Peckham, south London, and most of the
village of South Darenth in Kent. 'It remains to be seen what additional
reduction in net cost will be achieved through further property sales,' Mr
Freeman said.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Critics poised to defeat forest privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers responsible for the Forestry Commission are expected to recommend
soon that its plantations and woodlands should not be privatised.
A review group reporting to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture secretary,
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the Welsh
secretary, is believed to recommend dividing the commission's woodlands
between commercial forests and those for recreation whose value is primarily
as part of Britain's natural heritage.
It is expected to propose creating an executive agency within the commission
to manage the commercial forests with greater financial transparency.
It is also likely to recommend greater involvement of the private sector in
Forest Enterprise's activities, for example in providing more woodland
chalets and recreational facilities. Forestry Enterprise is a division of
the commission.
Ministers have long recognised that the idea of privatising the commission's
woodlands, which cover 5 per cent of Britain, is unpopular with the public
and especially with many backbench Conservative MPs, who have been bombarded
with letters by constituents. The changes to the commission proposed by the
review group could have the advantage for the govern-ment of not requiring
legis-lation.
The group, set up last March, is likely to submit its report to ministers in
the next few weeks. It has been advised on the options by the merchant bank
Samuel Montagu and the land agents John Clegg.
The three ministers will decide what policy to adopt and issue a
consultation document, probably not before early summer.
The review group will also report on the effectiveness of government
incentives for private tree planting, which are criticised in the forestry
industry as leading to the planting of too few commercially useful trees.
The group may recommend better targeting of incentives but has been told by
the Treasury that no extra money is available.
At present all Britain's state forests are managed by Forest Enterprise. It
manages its forests on a multi-purpose basis, combining profitability with
environmental and recreational aims, and maintaining heritage forests such
as the New Forest.
Separating out purely commercial forests and managing them as an executive
agency, which might present accounts on a commercial basis instead of the
present civil service system, could counter arguments that Forest
Enterprise's objectives are confused and its accounts incomprehensible.
But many forests fall into both commercial and recreational categories,
which could cause problems in dividing them.

FT  28 JAN 94 / CBI seeks reform of EU subsidy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday unveiled a six-point plan to
reform competition policy in the European Union. It also called for the
European Commission to be given more effective powers to control state
subsidies.
The CBI's call is part of its wider review of EU law. The confederation
wants to save unnecessary cost and effort for companies and regulators.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said an efficient and effective
competition policy was vital for the single market, but 'companies too often
meet delay and legal uncertainty when they seek to clear their business
plans with the commission'.
Mr Laurence Elks, of the legal firm Nabarro Nathanson, said administration
of EU merger policy was 'moving in the right direction'.
However, the prompt and realistic approach to decision-making under the
commission's three-year-old merger taskforce and its fast-track approach to
certain joint ventures needed to be emulated across the remainder of the
union's competition enforcement.
Mr Elks chaired a group of CBI members which put forward the six-point plan.
It advocates:
Applying EU competition rules only where business agreements have a genuine
effect on trade between member states.
Excluding agreements which are insignificant in terms of their competitive
effects from possible prohibition under the Treaty of Rome.
Reflecting commercial needs rather than bureaucratic convenience in
so-called 'block exemption regulations' which cover entire categories of
agreements, such as patent licensing and franchising.
Limiting commission interference in 'vertical' agreements, such as those
covering distribution or purchasing, to those where the businesses involved
have real power on the relevant market.
Directing action under the treaty only against dominant companies which are

The CBI says EU policy on state subsidies is broadly on the right lines in
encouraging a shift away from supporting particular business sectors to
schemes aimed at assisting needy regions. But the execution of policy must
be improved to make competition fair, it says.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Fraud charge total rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount involved in fraud charges rose 11 per cent to Pounds 704m last
year, according to figures released yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm.
The KPMG 'fraud barometer' showed a rise from Pounds 637m in 1992, although
fraud cases fell from 83 to 53. The increase reflects charges of false
accounting for more than Pounds 480m against Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former head
of treasury in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The
amount of the next largest charge was almost a tenth of this.
The fraud barometer is based on reported cases of criminal fraud with
charges in excess of Pounds 100,000 brought in a UK court.

<TEXT>
A MORI poll today puts Labour level with the Tories among the upper,
professional and middle classes for the first time since the organisation
started polling in the 1970s.
Both parties were on 37 per cent among the so-called ABCs, traditionally
rich Tory pickings, according to the poll in The Times.
The poll also showed that Tory support may have bottomed out at about 28 per
cent - the same as last month. Labour was well in front on 48 per cent, with
the Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Man in 'homes for votes' row found dead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Westminster city councillor who was one of 10 people named in the
district auditor's report alleging gerrymandering in council house
allocations, was found dead in his flat from gunshot wounds, police said
yesterday.
Dr Michael Dutt, former chairman of the council's housing committee, was
found at his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on Wednesday. An inquest will
be held on Monday.
His death comes two weeks after a district auditor's report into allegations
that the Tory flagship council ran a homes-for-votes scheme. Dr Dutt, a
43-year-old single man, recently pulled out of legal moves to clear his name
from the vote-rigging scandal.
The auditor, Mr John Magill, accused Dr Dutt, five other serving and former
councillors and four officers of being involved in 'disgraceful, improper
and illegal' behaviour which cost Westminster taxpayers Pounds 21m.
Dr Dutt was a member of the Royal College of Physicians who had worked as a
consultant specialising in the care of the elderly at St Albans City
Hospital for the past 10 years.
Mr Alan Harris, director of operations at the hospital, said Dr Dutt had not
been at work since the Westminster report appeared two weeks ago.
Dr Dutt served on the council from May 1986 to May 1990. He stood as Tory
parliamentary candidate for Leicester South at the general election in 1992,
coming second to Labour. In the 1989 Euro-elections he failed to win
Strathclyde East.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Broad mass bears the cost of breaks for the wealthy: Philip
Coggan, in the first of a series on the tax base, analyses the effect of
shelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxpayers face a hefty bill in 1994-95. Mr Kenneth Clarke imposed rises of
Pounds 1.68bn in his November Budget on top of the Pounds 6.73bn set in
train by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor as Chancellor.
But the need for this increase may partly stem from the government's
generosity in offering tax breaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s -
measures at odds with its philosophy, most vigorously pursued by Lord
Lawson, of 'lower taxes and fewer breaks'.
Shelters introduced since the Conservatives returned to power in 1979
include the Business Expansion Scheme, the Personal Equity Plan (Pep) and
the Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa). Long-standing shelters such
as pension funds have been relatively unscathed.
The effect of the tax shelters in any one financial year may be small. But
their cumulative effect is substantial and the economic benefits have been
questionable. Lost revenue from Tessas is about Pounds 500m according to the
Inland Revenue. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Tessas have merely allowed
those with building society deposits to transfer them into a tax-free form.
Peps were introduced in 1986 by the then Mr Nigel Lawson to encourage
savings in equities. They were initially unpopular and cumbersome but a
series of reforms and the fall in interest rates has led to a sharp increase
in popularity, with unit trust groups recording record Pep sales in 1993.
Again, the cost in an individual year is small - Pounds 150m in 1993-94
according to the Inland Revenue and Pounds 300m to date.
But the nature of an equity-based tax shelter is that it will grow sharply
over time. In the 1992-93 tax year almost Pounds 3.5bn was invested in Peps,
bringing the overall total up to Pounds 9.9bn. Judging by the fast growth in
unit trust Pep sales the amount invested in Peps in 1993-94 may be Pounds
5.3bn. If that continues until the tax year 1999/2000, and if the return on
equities continues at the historical average of 12 per cent, the cost to the
Revenue in lost tax on dividend income alone in 1999/2000 could be almost
Pounds 1bn a year. That figure does not account for lost capital gains tax
revenues.
The economic benefits of Peps are harder to judge. Money is undoubtedly
being attracted into the equity market from new investors, who had
previously stuck with building societies.
This may provide new sources of funds for British industry. But the main
beneficiaries have undoubtedly been the wealthy, who have been able to
transfer existing portfolios into Pep form. A couple who have been putting
the maximum in a Pep each year could have accumulated a portfolio of Pounds
100,000 by now.
The Business Expansion Scheme is now abolished. But in its last year there
was a flood of money as investors sought to take advantage of a generous tax
relief. According to Allenbridge, a BES advice service, the amount raised in
1993-94 was more than Pounds 1.1bn. Since the vast majority of this money
came from top-rate taxpayers, the cost in lost tax revenue will probably be
about Pounds 400m, making the cost of the BES over its life to about Pounds
1.7bn.
So the BES, Peps and Tessas have had an overall cost of Pounds 2.5bn and
have mainly involved a transfer of wealth from the broad mass of taxpayers
to the better off.
Other changes may also have eroded tax revenues, although with more obvious
justification. Independent taxation of married women was generally hailed as
a much needed reform of an antiquated and unfair system. In practice it has
prompted many middle-class households to shift savings from husband to wife,
enabling the wives to take advantage of their annual tax-free Pounds 3,445
personal allowance.
The shift was accompanied by the abolition of composite rate tax, making it
relatively easy to receive a tax-free return from a bank or building society
account. Even assuming that their husbands are only 25 per cent taxpayers,
that represents a tax loss of Pounds 860 a year for every couple who adjust
their savings. The Inland Revenue has no overall estimate of the costs of
this change, although some of it is being recouped by the running down of
the married couple's allowance.
The tax privileges of pension funds are the biggest single tax break, with
the cost of relief in 1993-94 about Pounds 9bn, according to the Treasury.
This is offset to some extent as private and corporate pensions save the
government from having to provide a far more generous state pension.
In addition, the favourable tax regime for pensions influences the amount
saved under it. If pensions did not have those advantages people might save
less.
The current system allows tax relief on contributions, and money within a
fund to roll up tax free. The final pension is taxed.
Labour had one shot at exploiting the tax loopholes issue in November, but
if the tax debate continues to gain momentum the subject could resurface.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Carsberg criticises delay in reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, criticised the
government yesterday for failing to introduce reforms of restrictive trade
practices legislation.
De-regulation bill measures announced last week would help reduce burdens on
industry of complying with competition law, but reform of the law on
anti-competitive agreements would have 'reduced the burdens on business
generally while also creating a more effective protection of competition',
he said.
Sir Bryan outlined changes to OFT competition procedures in support of the
government's de-regulation initiative. These included setting up a register
to cope with an expected rise in the number of undertakings negotiated by
industry as an alternative to a monopoly or merger reference.
Widening the 'fix it first' approach by allowing companies to offer a wider
range of undertakings is designed to reduce the number of merger references
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Numbers have already declined to a
low level.
Presenting the MMC's annual review yesterday, Mr Graeme Odgers, MMC
chairman, said work had been dominated by monopoly inquiries in 1993 -
though at the end of the year it only had two merger inquiries in progress.
Mr Odgers said the MMC also supported the government's de-regulation
initiative in an attempt to reduce the burdens of MMC inquiries on business.
The commission has produced a video to try to demystify the inquiry process
for businesses which have not been involved in an investigation before.
But he refused to be drawn on recommendations for changes to commission
procedures made by a review last year by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse.
The firm called for changes to cut out unnecessary overlaps in the roles of
the OFT and the MMC.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Patten set to dilute student reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday looked set to water down plans to restrict the
rights of student unions amid growing pressure from Tory peers to abandon
key parts of the education bill.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday held a 25-minute meeting
with Tory peers opposed to the legislation in an attempt to win support for
his proposals.
These would end the closed shop over student union membership and give the
government a greater say in deciding how unions spend their funds.
However, leading Tory peers told Mr Patten that they refused to give up
their plans to alter the bill. Earlier this week four leading Tory peers
tabled amendments to the legislation that would in effect give university
authorities - and not the government - a greater say in how students spend
their funds.
Mr Patten assured the peers that the long-delayed committee stage of the
bill would take place very soon. However, ministers cannot look forward to
the debates with any confidence.
The bill was attacked at its second reading last month by a number of Tory
peers as an infringement of the rights of student unions. That was followed
by a second challenge from a Lords procedure committee which complained the
bill had been poorly drafted.
Even if the bill moves to the Commons in its present form, it would probably
be opposed by two former education ministers - Mr Robert Jackson and Sir
Rhodes Boyson - and by the Conservative chairman of the Commons education
committee, Sir Malcolm Thornton.
Mr Jackson said recently that the proposals to restrict the rights of
student unions were so unjust that they might infringe the European
Convention on Human Rights.
National curriculum tests now seem certain to take place in most schools
this summer, following advice from the National Association of Head Teachers
that its members should implement the tests, John Authers writes.
Last year, NAHT members jeered and hissed Mr Patten at their annual
conference, and supported the three main teachers' unions which boycotted
the tests.
The ATL and NASUWT teachers' unions have advised their members to abandon
the test boycott. However, advice by the two unions to continue boycotting
teacher assessments which create excessive workload means that heads must
try to ensure that the workload is reasonable.
The NAHT also recommends that test results should not be published if they
do not 'reflect properly the performance of the schools'.
Heads have been advised that there may be no point in trying to set the
tests in some schools if the NUT, the largest teachers' union, continues its
boycott.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Pounds 75m cash call for a northern Wembley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester is to ask for Pounds 75m from the government's millennium fund
and the National Lottery to help build a stadium.
The application for a 'Wembley of the north' will be supported by various
sports bodies including the Football Association, the British Athletics
Federation, the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union.
The stadium and associated infrastructure would cost Pounds 187m. It would
seat 65,000 people, be on the site planned for the Olympics and be based on
the same design.
The public sector has already contributed Pounds 72m to land acquisition and
a new road linking the stadium site to the motorway network. The aim would
be to complete construction by 1998 if funding could be agreed.
Parts of the Millennium Fund and National Lottery are intended to encourage
sports projects and help celebrate the millennium.
Mr Terry Venables will today become manager of the England football team.
The Football Association, governing body of the national game, will hold a
press conference at Wembley Stadium this afternoon to announce the
appointment of the manager.
Sources at the FA said: 'There will not be any surprises, everyone seems to
know already.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / DTI blunder costs Barnsley dear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, is to lose around Pounds 450,000 from its
provisional standard spending assessment after the Department of Transport
over-estimated the length of its roads, John Authers writes.
Other authorities lost out when the final revenue support grant figures for
local authorities in England were announced by the Department of the
Environment yesterday. Barnsley appears to have lost more than any other
metropolitan authority.
Corrections to mistakes in government data mean that a number of standard
spending assessments have changed since the first announcement in December.
Funds will still be distributed using the principles announced in the
department's consultation paper, which was published last month.
Arrangements to 'cap' the budgets of councils which make what the government
considers to be 'excessive' increases in spending, and to compensate
authorities which will suffer sharp reductions in their spending assessments
compared to last year, also remain unchanged.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's economic stabilisation programme, proposed by finance minister
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, last night faced its first serious challenge
after Congress failed to approve a key tax increase due to the lack of a
quorum.
The measure, raising corporate tax from 25 to 26.25 per cent, needs approval
by Monday to take effect this year. But persuading congressmen to stay in
Braslia on a Friday, or return from home states on a Monday, is difficult.
The tax increase is needed to help balance this year's budget. Several tax
measures have already been approved, but observers are cautious as to
whether Mr Cardoso's overall programme will provide a lasting cure for
inflation which runs at about 40 per cent a month.
Congress did succeed in approving measures including a small increase in
existing tax bands for individuals. But Mr Cardoso's plans to raise Dollars
5.6bn by setting aside 15 per cent of the transfers central government makes
to states and municipalities has been criticised by Brazil's state
governors. The set-aside can only be approved via a constitutional amendment
and looks likely to be watered down.
The government is likely next month to start negotiating alternative
measures and may propose a reduction in export incentives and further cuts
in development programmes. The social security contributions estimate may be
increased again, and public servants' tax go to the federal rather than
state governments. All this would let the government claim a balanced
budget, but some observers fear the balance will be cosmetic.

Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, yesterday
announced one of the most significant joint ventures between a western and a
Russian company with a deal to make turbines and other power plant in St
Petersburg, Andrew Baxter writes from London.
ABB is teaming up with Nevsky Zavod, a big Russian manufacturer of gas and
steam turbines, to form ABB Nevsky, which will be 80 per cent owned by ABB
and 20 per cent by its Russian partner. ABB Nevsky will be producing
complete gas turbines based on ABB's latest advanced technology. These will
be used to modernise old power stations in Russia.

Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said yesterday Israel had decided
to go-ahead with a deal worth up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to buy 20
specially adapted F-15E jet fighters from McDonnell-Douglas, the US aircraft
maker, writes Julian Ozanne from Jerusalem.
The decision ends a fierce two-year bidding war between McDonnell-Douglas
and Lockheed to supply Israel with its next-generation fighter. The cost of
an F-15E is estimated at around Dollars 100m each, although Israel has
apparently negotiated a substantial discount on the entire order.
Sweden has asked to buy 500 AIM-120 air-to-air missiles made by Raytheon and
the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors for Dollars 465m (Pounds
310m), the Pentagon said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The
missiles would be used on the new Swedish JAS-39 Gripen multi-role military
jet.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Call for end to embargo on Vietnam: Senate vote marks a big
step towards closer relations
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US took a big step towards closer relations with Vietnam yesterday when
the Senate voted to urge President Bill Clinton to lift the US trade embargo
that has been in place since the fall of Saigon in 1975.
Led by a group of senators from both parties who served in the Vietnam War,
the Senate adopted by 62-38 a resolution that is expected to provide Mr
Clinton with the political support necessary for an early move to lift the
embargo.
Both the State Department's senior Asia experts and the military commanders
in charge of the search for the remains of US servicemen listed as missing
in action (MIA) have recommended lifting the embargo. However, such a move
remains anathema to many organisations representing veterans and families of
MIAs.
Vietnam's United Nations ambassador Mr Le Bang hailed yesterday's resolution
and urged US companies to to take advantage of investment opportunities once
the embargo was lifted.
The US has been edging towards more normal relations with Vietnam along the
lines of a 'road map' sketched out by former President George Bush, which
linked US diplomatic and economic concessions to the restoration of a
democratic government in neigbouring Cambodia and co-operation in accounting
for more than 2,000 MIAs whose fate is not known for certain.
Mr Clinton last year ended US opposition to lending by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and decorated Vietnam veteran
who was one of the principal sponsors of the resolution, said the vote was
'not a test of patriotism', but a judgment on how best to achieve further
progress in accounting for MIAs.
'If we don't move forward we could lose the ability to get the accounting we
are getting today. The people in the field are saying to us: lift this
embargo; you will help us to get answers,' he said on the Senate floor
yesterday.
Mr Kerry was joined by other decorated Vietnam veterans from both parties,
including Senator John McCain of Arizona, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: UK-insured exports up by 80%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of exports insured by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, the
UK's national export credit agency, increased to its highest level for
nearly a decade in the 12 months to March 31 last year, signalling a strong
performance by British exporters.
The value of new business insured amounted to Pounds 3.8bn, up 80 per cent
compared both with 1991-92 and the average level since the onset of the debt
crisis in the early 1980s.
Premium income on new business rose sharply, reaching Pounds 133m, 60 per
cent up on 1991-92, while the ECGD's trading surplus increased to Pounds
740m, as an improvement in the economy led to a reduction in provisions and
claims.
Mr Brian Willott, chief executive, said the figures represented a 'dramatic
change around. UK industry has been very successful at increasing its
business, particularly to the Far East'. He said the strong upward trend had
continued into the current financial year.
Four of the five markets in which UK companies were most successful were in
the Far East - Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The other was the
United Arab Emirates. The value of guarantees involved in the Black Point
power station project in Hong Kong, the biggest single deal covered last
year, amounted to about Pounds 800m.
Mr Willott said the substantial reductions in premium rates and the
increases in cover announced in the 1992 autumn budget gave 'the ECGD and
its customers for the first time a clear three-year growth path'.
The ECGD had benefited from a fall in its provisions, which were reduced to
Pounds 8.49bn compared with Pounds 8.60bn. This partially reflected an
improvement in economic conditions in Latin American and some other heavily
indebted countries. Provisions against Brazil, Mexico and Egypt were all
reduced by between 15 and 20 per cent. Provisions for Cuba, Angola and for
some countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union were increased
by about 50 per cent.
The agency's trading surplus on its old and new business combined reached
Pounds 740m, up from Pounds 340m. Claims paid fell by 23 per cent to Pounds
739m, compared with Pounds 954m.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Deputy quits in fall-out with Reno
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's acute personnel problems were compounded
yesterday by the abrupt resignation of Mr Philip Heymann, number two at the
justice department.
Mr Heymann, appearing alongside Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, at a
regular weekly press conference, cited differences in 'operating and
management style' with his boss. Both insisted there were no philosophical
or political disagreements but that the personal chemistry, in Mr Heymann's
words, 'was not right'. He said he had told the White House of his intention
to resign on Wednesday night.
The deputy attorney general, a veteran of the justice department in
Democratic administrations over the past 30 years, a former member of the
Watergate prosecution team and a Harvard law professor, had been considered
the experienced but overworked rock in a department headed by an attorney
general with no previous federal record and with many of its senior
positions still unfilled.
His departure is certain to reflect badly not only on the White House but
also on Ms Reno, the former Miami state prosecutor and President Bill
Clinton's third choice as attorney general after two earlier candidates had
fallen foul of Nannygate problems. She took the country by storm with her
blunt acceptance of responsibility for the violent end last spring of the
siege in Waco, Texas, of the Branch Davidian religious cult.
Though still very popular outside Washington for her forthright views on
social issues, she has come under growing capital sniping for alleged
administrative shortcomings and for failing to mobilise her department on a
variety of issues.

FT  28 JAN 94 / More power to the investor: The SEC's review of share
trading in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New York Stock Exchange has seen its stranglehold on trading in US
shares progressively eroded in recent years. In 1986, the 'Big Board'
handled 86 per cent of all the trading in the stocks which it lists: by last
year, that had fallen to 79 per cent. The rest is being funnelled into a
wide array of competing trading systems, some run by regional exchanges,
some by broker-dealers.
The bosses of the 'Big Board' refer to this as the 'fragmentation' of the
equity markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, has a
different view. A 79 per cent market share (and the 87 per cent market share
enjoyed by the competing dealer market, Nasdaq, in the unlisted shares that
it trades) 'would be envied in any other industry'.
The SEC yesterday, in its first thorough review of the regulation of the US
equity markets since 1971, gave broad support to greater competition between
market trading systems. It proposed a deluge of detailed regulation and rule
changes to make sure that competition operates fairly, and allows investors
to place orders with their brokers in the confidence that they will get the
best prices available in any market.
The rapid rise in share trading in the US in the past two years has
intensified the competition for investors' business, and led to some
practices which the SEC now wants to see better controlled. Last year, 67bn
shares were traded on the NYSE, a huge increase over the record 51bn the
year before. The previous peak, in 1987, was 47bn.
The SEC's proposals fall into four broad areas. First, it is calling for
greater transparency in the markets to give better disclosure of the prices
at which shares are traded. It might be argued that the US already has the
world's most transparent stock markets.
The regulators have asked for all 'limit orders' (instructions placed by
investors for their brokers to buy or sell shares once the price hits a
certain level) to be listed electronically, giving a clearer view of the
supply and demand for shares. Also, they have re-opened a contentious topic
first tackled in the early 1980s: that all buy or sell orders, no matter
where they are placed, should be made public to allow traders in any market
to bid for them.
The SEC has also asked the exchanges to reduce the minimum price spread on
stocks to Dollars  1/16 , rather than the current Dollars  1/8 . This is
meant to produce finer pricing of shares, leading to lower spreads between
buying and selling prices and so saving investors money. (It would also cut
into dealers' profits.)
Second, the regulators want to reinforce the rules which ensure that
investors get the best price when placing their orders with a broker. At
present, a broker may channel an order to a particular dealer in return for
a cash payment (known as 'payment for order flow') or other goods and
services (known as 'soft commissions', or soft dollars.) The SEC has
resisted calls to ban these arrangements, but says that they should all be
fully disclosed to investors.
Third, the SEC is trying to make competition between stock exchanges and
other trading systems fairer. It has proposed better reporting to regulators
of trades carried out on private, automated trading systems to allow them to
be properly regulated - though it has stopped short of demanding the same
full publication of trades that exchanges have to adopt. These suggestions
fall short of the sort of full-scale extension of regulation called for by
the NYSE and others.
Fourth, the changes would remove some of the barriers which prevent some of
the trading in NYSE from moving to other trading systems. Under NYSE rule
500, companies listed on the premier market cannot de-list unless a
two-thirds majority of their shareholders approve the move. This could
prevent companies from moving to other markets, the SEC says: the NYSE rule
should be amended to leave it to directors.
The changes will be made through amendments to the SEC's own rules and those
of the exchanges and self-regulatory organisations. They will amount to the
first overhaul of securities regulation in the US since the more
wide-ranging deregulation of the early 1970s.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese protest at US phone call
discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A telecommunications trade war threatened yesterday following complaints by
Japanese groups about US companies' trading practices.
The Japanese carriers have asked the country's post and telecommunications
ministry to investigate discounts offered by Fibercom Network and
International Telecom of New York, and USA Global Link of Iowa.
The three US groups, which provide discounts of up to 40 per cent on
international calls, said they would file a complaint with the US trade
representative in Tokyo if restrictions were placed on them.
The dispute comes at a delicate moment for the US and Japanese governments.
They are negotiating framework arrangements to reduce Japan's trade surplus
with the US and make the country more accessible for goods and services
exporters.
The US companies have negotiated bulk contracts with large carriers such as
AT&amp;T. Callers phone a switching centre in the US and hang up after the
number rings twice. The switching centre then automatically calls back,
leaving the users to dial their ultimate destination. The companies claim
international call-back schemes, which have been running in Japan for two
years, are legal, because technically the calls originate in the US.
The Japanese complainants are KDD, which used to hold a monopoly of
international services in Japan, International Digital Communications and
International Telecom Japan. They claim the US groups are making free use of
their domestic lines.
The US discounters said they would be willing to pay reasonable charges for
the lines, and were willing to hold friendly talks with the Japanese
carriers. So far they have gained only 1 per cent of the Y250bn (Pounds
1,497m) telecoms services market.

FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Spares lead the way in India car parts
exports - Components makers take advantage of trade liberalisation reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lumax Industries, a Delhi-based company, is one of India's most recent
entrants to export markets, selling spare-part lights for Volkswagen,
Mercedes and Rover cars and for Italian-made Iveco lorries.
'They're half the price of the original manufacturers' equipment,' says Mr
A. K. Sethi, the export manager. 'Our labour is cheap but we have to watch
our other costs.'
Lumax is among scores of Indian vehicle parts makers that are taking
advantage of the government's efforts to open the economy to international
trade and promote exports. From Dollars 60m in 1988-89, parts exports jumped
to Dollars 190m in 1992-93 and are set to rise to nearly Dollars 250m in the
year to March 1994.
'Everybody is talking of the Indian components industry getting more and
more competitive,' said Mr Giancarlo Boschetti, the president of Iveco, the
truck-making arm of the Fiat group of Italy, on a recent visit to India. 'We
see India not only as a source of exports (of vehicles) but also as a source
of supply for components.'
Mr Boschetti was speaking last month during India's first motor show in
seven years at which 600 companies showed their wares, many of them hoping
to attract export orders. The potential foreign buyers included teams from
Britain's Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Japan Auto Parts
Industries Association, and Ford and General Motors, the US carmakers.
However, large-scale orders from the big western and Japanese vehicle makers
could still be some time away. Only a handful of Indian companies have
struck such deals: among them are Sundram Fasteners, an affiliate of TVS, a
diversified south Indian engineering group, which last summer started
supplying radiator caps to GM.
Sundram makes 5m caps a year for GM - 85 per cent of the US group's needs.
Sundram also has permission to stamp the letters TVS on every cap, which,
Sundram officials say, is the first time an Indian company has established a
global brand-name in motor components.
Sundram Fasteners was helped in establishing its operation by GM which
transferred second-hand machines and other equipment from a British
supplier. Other companies face the choice between waiting for a similar
opportunity or taking a risk by expanding capacity before securing orders.
'We are not yet geared up in this country for volume production,' says an
executive at one electrical parts maker.
India's main advantages in the market are low-cost labour, lax environmental
controls for 'dirty' industries, and a long engineering tradition. Indian
industry executives say India is a cost-effective country for hot and dirty
operations, among them casting and forging of heavy components such as axles
and transmission drives. It could also be a competitive supplier of
electrical components, particularly those that might require manual
assembly.
However, Indian suppliers suffer from serious disadvantages, including
inadequate infrastructure and a reputation for poor quality, which blights
Indian exports generally. For these reasons large western and Japanese
groups have often shied away from buying Indian components. Indian
manufacturers have relied instead on the spares market, where buyers have
been more easily swayed by low prices.
Mr Shiv Nair, an assistant vice-president at Bharat Forge, a diversified
forging company, says the export of low-cost low-quality Indian spare parts
has undermined efforts to supply original equipment.
Bharat Forge, which supplies axle beams and other parts to big lorry
manufacturers, including Mitsubishi Motors in Japan and Rockwell in the US,
has deliberately avoided the spares market for fear of having its reputation
tarnished by the low quality of some other Indian companies. Even so, Bharat
Forge suffers, says Mr Nair.
He estimates it takes four to five years to finalise a large original
equipment supply contract; it would take only two years if Indian companies
enjoyed better reputations. 'The Japanese even question the quality of steel
we use. They want to check it.'
But there are signs that Indian companies' prospects are improving rapidly.
The slow-down in car demand in industrialised countries has forced big
groups to cut costs further than before, so the pressure to find reliable
low-cost sources of parts has increased. At the same time, Indian executives
are steadily learning what they must do to meet foreign buyers'
expectations.
One US car company executive visiting Delhi said India as a whole had no
particular advantage over other countries as a parts supplier. Low-cost
labour was no use if it meant low productivity and poor quality, he said.
What mattered was how a company made use of low-cost labour.
'When we source components we don't think in terms of countries but of
companies. We have seen companies in India we like and we are talking to
them.'

New orders for US durable goods rose 2.2 per cent in December compared with
the previous month, providing further confirmation of the surge in economic
activity at the end of last year, official figures indicated yesterday,
writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
Orders rose 8.6 per cent during 1993 as a whole, the largest increase for
five years. The figures were the latest in a series of buoyant statistics
indicating the US recovery is gaining significant momentum. Most analysts
expect gross domestic product data due today to show growth at an annual
rate of about 6 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
Orders rose in all main industrial sectors with the largest gains registered
in capital goods, mainly electronics and electrical machinery. Excluding
defence, orders rose 1.8 per cent from November.

China and Russia yesterday signed an agreement covering 21 border crossings
to facilitate booming two-way trade worth nearly Dollars 8bn last year.
Both countries are anxious to strengthen regulations covering trade and
other exchanges along their common boundary where criminal activities are a
serious problem.
The agreement to improve cross-border co-operation was signed by Mr Qian
Qichen, China's foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his visiting
Russian counterpart.
The two men also discussed a forthcoming visit to Moscow by President Jiang
Zemin, security issues, and ways in which Russia might assist Chinese
economic development.
Mr Kozyrev said Russian contractors were anxious to participate in the
Dollars 20bn Three Gorges project on the Yangtze - the world's largest
hydro-electric engineering scheme. He also sought to assure the Chinese that
threats of political unrest at home would not be allowed to affect
relations.
'Further development of Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's
foreign policy and would not be affected by domestic political change in
Russia,' he was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency.
Sino-Russian two-way trade increased by about 30 per cent last year compared
with the year before. Eighty per cent of business is now channelled through
border crossings along a remote frontier.
Mr Kozyrev was accompanied by senior defence officials who have been
discussing with the Chinese ways in which technical co-operation might be
expanded.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Japanese urged to back reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday passionately
appealed for public support for his plans to reform the electoral and
political system.
'We must show the world that Japan has become a mature democracy whose
people are able to make wise decision,' he told a meeting of 100 politicians
and academics.
The public would lose confidence in party politics and Japan would lose the
international community's trust if the reform bills failed, Mr Hosokawa
warned. 'We can no longer hope that economic stimulus measures can succeed
without realising political reform,' he added.
He urged Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic
party, to meet him in a final attempt at a compromise on the plan which was
voted down in the upper house of parliament last week.
Mr Hosokawa asked voters to 'express your feelings through actions' and
telephone or fax Diet members.
The Japanese leader has staked his job on winning agreement to scrap Japan's
unique multi-seat constituency system and to curb corporate political
funding, both factors in recent corruption scandals.
Mr Hosokawa hinted yesterday that he would, after all resign if his four
political reform bills fail to reach parliamentary agreement by their
Saturday deadline. 'I would not insist on the post of prime minister if I
could not deliver on my promise. . . to realise political reform,' he said.
The seven-party coalition appears divided on strategy as these statements
contradicted a senior government official who earlier insisted Mr Hosokawa
and his cabinet would stay. According to an opinion poll by JNN television
news yesterday, Mr Hosokawa's support rating fell from 63.4 per cent at the
end of last year to 54.8 per cent in the days before the upper house vote.
A joint panel of the upper and lower houses of parliament met yesterday to
examine the latest compromise plan offered by the coalition. The LDP agreed
to study it with a view to reconvening in the evening but LDP officials said
they did not want to accept Mr Hosokawa's invitation to a summit meeting
while the panel talks were continuing.
Failure to get agreement in the panel makes it more likely Mr Hosokawa will
call a snap vote on the plans in the lower house today, his final chance. He
has little chance of winning such a vote, but the move would further split
the LDP.
Meanwhile, speculation is growing that public prosecutors are considering
the arrest of three former cabinet ministers on suspicion of accepting
bribes. These would be the first national figures to be detained in a
widening inquiry into bribes for contracts in the construction industry.
Legally, politicians can plead immunity while parliament is in session, but
it will be in recess on Sunday, the one day between the closure of the
present session and the opening of the next.

Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday said the annual
growth rate could reach 4 per cent or more in the near-future, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
Consensus forecasts for Australia's growth are around 3.4 per cent this
year, rising to 3.6 per cent in 1995. An improvement in the forecasts would
reinforce an increasing cheerful view of the Australian economy.

Algeria's conference for National Reconciliation has ended without naming a
president to replace the five-man High State Council which has ruled the
country since the suspension of elections two years ago, writes Francis
Ghiles in London.
The meeting was boycotted by Algeria's main political parties, including the
lay Front des Forces Socialistes, led by Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, and the former
ruling Front de Liberation National Party. Both urged Algerian leaders to
open negotiations with the banned Islamic Salvation Front which was poised
for victory at the polls two years ago.

<TEXT>
A group of creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International is threatening to sue the government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's
majority shareholder, for a larger settlement, writes Andrew Jack in London.
Creditors owed about Dollars 2bn by BCCI yesterday agreed to push for 'a
just and immediate' payment from Abu Dhabi. A meeting in Cairo included
representatives from the Islamic banks in the Middle East and was convened
by Mr Adil Elias, a member of the BCCI creditors' committee and one of three
creditors who opposed in the courts the previous agreement between BCCI's
liquidators and Abu Dhabi.
Mr Elias said yesterday that unless Abu Dhabi contributed Dollars
3bn-Dollars 4bn to the creditors, his group would sue to recover their own
claims plus damages through the courts in England, and possibly Luxembourg
and the US.

FT  28 JAN 94 / S African leaders postpone constitution deadline again
</HEADLINE>

   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African politicians last night stepped back from the brink of
confrontation when they postponed for the third time this week a deadline
for final agreement on a new constitution, and agreed to meet again on
Monday for further negotiations.
Negotiators from the right-wing Freedom Alliance held out little hope for
agreement on Monday, saying they were battling with the government and the
African National Congress for the moral high ground, with no party willing
to take the blame for the failure of talks.
The extension of the deadline raised doubts over whether this weekend's
conference of the Inkatha Freedom party would take a final decision on
whether or not to participate in April's all-race elections.
On the eve of the talks, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi appeared to indicate he
personally favours boycotting the poll, though senior leaders in his party
argue strongly for participation. The party central committee held heated
debate at an all-day meeting on Wednesday, but said it was unable to decide
one way or the other.
It deferred the decision to this weekend's Inkatha conference at the KwaZulu
capital, Ulundi, to be attended by 8,000 delegates.
Chief Buthelezi told the central committee that he did not expect talks to
succeed in yielding the constitutional amendments Inkatha is demanding -
changes which would give greater powers to regional government - and that it
would be morally wrong to contest the elections under a flawed constitution.
To do so would mean 'betraying the sacred charge history has bestowed on me
as a democrat and traditional prime minister of the Zulu kingdom'.
However powerful Inkatha leaders argued in the meeting that Inkatha would be
destroyed if it boycotted the poll, and that it could more effectively fight
the constitution from within the new parliament than from outside it. They
also argued that Inkatha, which has no army (even the KwaZulu government
which it controls has only a police force), would not be able to put up
effective armed resistance to the central government, with its powerful
armed forces.
The central committee decided to make no recommendation to the weekend party
conference, which begins tomorrow.
However Inkatha sources said that this might favour the position of Chief
Buthelezi because the conference will be packed with rural delegates who
have a strong tradition of obeying their leader's recommendations, and among
whom Chief Buthelezi remains very popular.

South Africa's future hung in the balance last night as negotiators from the
right-wing Freedom Alliance met the government and African National Congress
for talks. All three sides said these represented the last chance to ensure
the right wing joined in April's all-race elections.
On the eve of the meetings, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi indicated his
preference for boycotting the poll, though senior leaders in his Inkatha
Freedom Party argue for participation. The party's central committee
deferred the decision until this weekend's Inkatha party conference at the
KwaZulu capital, Ulundi, to be attended by some 8,000 delegates.
Chief Buthelezi told the central committee he did not expect talks to yield
the constitutional amendments Inkatha is demanding (changes which would give
greater powers to regional government); it would be morally wrong to contest
the elections under a flawed constitution. To do so would mean 'betraying
the sacred charge history has bestowed on me as a democrat and prime
minister of the Zulu kingdom'.
Powerful Inkatha leaders argued Inkatha would be destroyed if it boycotted
the poll; it could more effectively fight the constitution from within the
new parliament than from outside. Inkatha, which has no army (even the
KwaZulu government it controls has only a police force), would not be able
to put up effective armed resistance to the central government, with its
powerful armed forces, they argued.
Other Inkatha officials said the party should take part in elections, but
fail to take its seats in parliament to protest against the constitution.
The central committee decided to make no recommendation to the party
conference, which begins tomorrow. But Inkatha sources said this might
favour the position of Chief Buthelezi, because the conference will be
packed with rural delegates who traditionally obey their leader's
recommendations. Those Inkatha leaders who favour participation have less
backing within the conference.
Chief Buthelezi warned of violence if the current constitution is accepted:
'We will never have peace, stability and prosperity if we repeat the failure
of Russia and east Europe to recognise that centrist constitutions imposed
over a plural society ..can only give rise to disruption, violence and
finally civil war.'
Separate talks were being held last night on a homeland for right-wing
Afrikaners, recognition of the status of the Zulu king in the new
constitution, and general constitutional amendments to strengthen regional
government.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Kazakhstan offered IMF, Japanese loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to lend Kazakhstan a total of
185m special drawing rights (Pounds 170m) to support the government's
economic reform programme.
The first SDR62m will be available immediately as Kazakhstan's second
drawing on the Systemic Transformation Facility, a fund set up with looser
conditions by the IMF to help former communist countries overhaul their
economies, but the remaining SDR124m have been authorised under a normal IMF
standby arrangement, which is conditional on a tough economic stabilisation
programme.
In a further boost to the Kazakh government, Japan has agreed to provide
Dollars 145m (Pounds 97m) of financing in parallel to the IMF loans, the
first for a standby arrangement.
The agreements follow a meeting of donor countries in Paris two weeks ago at
which Kazakhstan received pledges of aid totalling Dollars 1bn this year. US
officials have praised the country for its commitment to free market
economics and for its willingness to give up Soviet nuclear weapons based on
its territory.
Although Kazakhstan has been viewed by some western lenders as a model among
the republics of the former Soviet Union for economic reform, its economy
still faces severe problems. Mr Daulet Sembayev, central bank chairman, said
this week the country's gross national product fell 13 per cent last year
while inflation rose by 2,270 per cent.
Following the introduction in November of an independent currency, the
tenge, Kazakhstan is now aiming to cut monthly inflation to 3 per cent by
the end of this year, and to reduce the fall in output to 3 per cent over
the course of 1994.
The IMF said yesterday the standby programme included particular attention
to the provision of a social safety net for the most vulnerable segments of
the population.
The government aims to limit its fiscal deficit in 1994 to 4 per cent of GDP
through measures that include new import tariffs and export duties, a
simpler structure for value added and income taxes, and significant
reductions in tax exemptions.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Hassan speeds business ventures in Morocco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King Hassan of Morocco has established a committee to help foreign investors
who encounter problems setting up business in Morocco. The 'Comite de Suivi
et d'Impulsion des Investissements' (CISI) will include Morocco's leading
commercial banks and be chaired by Mr Mohamed Seqqat, central bank governor.
Moroccan officials say the CISI is not a substitute for existing ministries
but an effort to speed decisions by submitting problems directly to the head
of state, thereby simplifying a process taking up to eight months.
An important factor behind the fast-track committee is the growth of foreign
investment which last year reached Dollars 500m, (Pounds 333m), covering the
whole of the current account deficit. In 1992 and 1991, foreign investment
covered 50 per cent and 23 per cent respectively of the deficit.
The flow of investment from abroad is being encouraged by the privatisation
programme initiated 13 months ago. Observers in Casablanca expect that
programme to be accelerated in the next few months because of this year's
budget deficit, estimated at about Dollars 500m. The privatisation programme
brought the state a foreign income of Dollars 250m last year, a figure which
the authorities hope to boost to Dollars 340m in 1994.
The four petrol and oil products distribution companies are being
privatised. Petrom was sold to a Moroccan investor a few weeks ago while
Shell has just bought the distribution company which bears its name. The
Mobil and Total distribution networks are next on the list.
Other key privatisations this year will include four leading banks in which
the state owns more than a 50 per cent stake: Credit Industriel et Hotelier,
Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, Banque Populaire and Banque
Nationale du Commerce et de l'Industrie. But the state is expected to retain
a core holding of 33.3 per cent of shares in each institution.
The privatisation programme and recapitalisation of Moroccan companies have
boosted activity on the previously sleepy Casablanca stock exchange.
Transactions last year increased by 365 per cent to DH 25.7bn (Pounds
1.79bn).

South Africa's yearly inflation fell to 9.7 per cent in 1993, down on the
1992 figure of 13.9 per cent and the lowest since 1973, writes Matthew
Curtin in Johannesburg. Although December month-on-month inflation rose 0.3
percentage points to 9.5 per cent, economists believe inflation could fall
as low as 6 per cent in April. Good summer rains and buoyant business
confidence are expected to assist growth during 1994 after a four-year
recession.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Qatar discusses Dollars 1bn Israeli gas deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Qatar has confirmed it is negotiating a natural gas deal with Israel worth
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 671m) and that is also considering moves to
ease the Arab economic boycott of Israel.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jahr al-Thani, Qatari foreign minister, said in
Washington that the Gulf state had started preliminary discussions with
Israel. Further development, he added, would depend on a feasibility study
and progress in Middle East peace talks, particularly negotiations between
Israel and Syria.
The minister said also that Qatar was considering taking action to lift the
Arab boycott of Israel and would discuss the issue with Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, who has been pressing Arab states to
ease sanctions.
Mr Hamad al-Thani's statement follows a secret meeting in London last Sunday
with Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Moshe Shahal, respectively Israel's foreign and
energy ministers. Mr Peres yesterday confirmed the meeting had taken place.
For months Qatar had categorically denied Israeli reports it was discussing
the gas project with the Jewish state.
The Israeli-Qatari gas project involves supply of natural gas to Israel and
the use of Israel as an export terminal for Qatari gas through the
Mediterranean Sea to Europe. Qatar has reportedly pledged to supply the
Israeli market with natural gas for a 25 years.
Israel needs 6.7m tonnes of oil equivalent a year to convert its electricity
generation from coal and oil to gas. It is also looking for cheaper energy
sources to supply its petrochemicals industry in the Negev Desert. The
Qatari project could also sell natural gas to the Palestinian
self-government region.
Israel says Qatar has agreed to pay Dollars 1m for a feasibility study. One
option is to build a gas pipeline from the Gulf state to the Israeli port of
Ashkelon, where Qatar would construct a gas liquefication plant. Another is
to ship gas to the Israeli Red Sea port of Eilat and pipe the gas from there
to Ashkelon. A third component of the project might be to build a pipeline
under the Mediterranean to transport Qatari gas via Israel to Europe.
Mr Shahal said Israel was talking to more than one Gulf state about
importing gas. It had made progress in its project to link its electricity
grid to Egypt's; an early project would be to connect Eilat with the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba and the Jordanian port city of Aqaba.
Israeli officials believe the Qatari project is a step towards regional
co-operation and integration in the Middle East.
In the energy sector, Israel says other projects are being considered,
including a gas pipeline from Egypt, an Israeli-Jordanian solar energy
scheme, a possible oil export terminal, and exploiting the difference in the
levels of the Dead and Mediterranean Seas to produce electricity and
desalinate water.

<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday ended 20 years of financial backing for the African
National Congress. Funding from Sweden had previously accounted for up to 40
per cent of the South African group's budget, according to Swedish
officials.
The right-centre coalition government of Mr Carl Bildt last year decided to
stop the aid flow which had been started in the early 1970s by a Social
Democratic government. Saying that the ANC had become a political party
which no longer qualified for government assistance, the cut-off date was
set at three months before South Africa's first multiracial election
scheduled for April 27.
Officials said aid to the ANC was SKr110m (Pounds 9.1m) in the 1992-93
Swedish budget year, out of total Swedish development aid to South Africa of
SKr240m. It is being maintained at last year's level in the current budget
year, despite the cut to the ANC, but will fall to SKr220m in 1994-95.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Israeli parties greet Hussein-Rabin links

<TEXT>
In a rare display of Israeli political consensus on the Middle East peace
process, leaders across the political spectrum yesterday welcomed the
announcement by King Hussein of Jordan that he is ready publicly to meet Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister.
The prospect of growing economic and political contacts with neighbouring
Jordan before a formal peace treaty will bolster the domestic political
standing of Mr Rabin in face of growing public opposition to territorial and
'security' concessions to the Palestinians and Syria.
Mr Rabin said he was ready to make the necessary preparations to meet the
king without pre-conditions; the king's offer represented 'significant
progress' in the peace process.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the time had come 'to
legitimise public peace with Jordan'.
Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing opposition Likud party, said
he fully supported peace with Jordan, as an important step to a permanent
solution with Palestinians in a confederal arrangement with Jordan. Even the
ultra-right wing Tsomet party, led by Mr Rafael Eitan, endorsed the move.
Israeli leaders have been delighted with the king's statements in the US
this week where he has outlined a vision of peace with Israel.
The Jordanian monarch continues to insist he he will not sign a formal peace
agreement ahead of Syria, but he intends to go ahead unilaterally with
political, diplomatic and economic contacts. King Hussein has said that
unless peace agreements are concluded this year, the region faces the
prospect of deep instability. He has called for a Middle East which holds
the prospect of an entirely different future.
'The talents that are available, the resources that are available, the
opportunities that are available I believe will transform the entire
region,' he declared. The removal of physical and economic barriers could
produce what he called 'a Middle East Nafta'.
Israeli officials believe a Hussein-Rabin summit will lead quickly to
economic co-operation, including the opening of borders to stimulate
regional tourism and trade; joint Israeli-Jordanian development of the
Jordan Valley between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea; the development
of a tourist project between Jordan, Israel and Egypt around cities on the
Red Sea; joint energy in projects in electricity and solar power, and new
road networks.
Mr Peres, who met secretly with King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan last
November, says a peace agreement has been prepared in detail under which
Israel will cede disputed Israeli-held areas of the Dead Sea and Arava
valley to Jordan and then lease them back at a nominal price. Mr Peres,
however, says he believes that Israel and Jordan will move as close as
possible towards full peace in 1994 without a formal signing ceremony.
A major business conference sponsored by President Bill Clinton is due to
take place in Amman in March, bringing together Arab, Jewish and
international business and political leaders on Arab soil.
For Mr Rabin, unfolding peace with another Arab neighbour will shore up
public support for the government's peace policy. Since last September's
peace accord with Palestinians, many Israelis have expressed concern about
security and have not seen any tangible benefits of peace.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Disquiet over CFA franc fall: The lament within France's
'Africa lobby'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many in France's 'Africa lobby' of traders, investors and a few older
politicians are still fuming about the 50 per cent devaluation two weeks ago
of the CFA franc, used by 13 French-speaking countries of west and central
Africa.
Politically, they accuse the French government of betraying its old colonies
and friends in Africa. Economically, they see an end to a good market in
which African ability to purchase French goods was kept artificially high by
a parity unchanged since 1948. Financially, they are reeling from the
implications of having their African assets halved and cash flow severely
disrupted.
'Two categories have been cheated - the African people and French
companies,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Prouteau, head of the Conseil des
Investisseurs Francais en Afrique (CIAN). He has complained to the prime
minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, that the devaluation's damage to the French
private sector will amount to FFr10bn. The Balladur government's failure to
provide speedy help to French companies is, according to Mr Jean-Louis
Vilgrain, head of the French employers' Africa committee, 'deeply damaging
because it gives the impression that there is more devaluation to come'.
The general French reaction seems to be along the lines that 'Africa was
living above our means', that French aid to the CFA countries was doing
little good in economies whose currencies had got so out of line with their
real competitiveness, and that devaluation was, if anything, overdue.
But the speed with which Mr Balladur, within five months of coming to power,
set about altering a parity between the French and CFA francs that had not
changed for nearly 50 years, has disquieted some Gaullists around the party
leader, Mr Jacques Chirac.
Nonetheless, Mr Michel Roussin, who came to the job of aid minister after
serving Mr Chirac and a spell in the French secret service dealing with
francophone Africa, insists that overtly France took no sides in the
devaluation decision which was one for sovereign African states.
But the alternative to devaluing was not rosy. French aid would have been
entirely swallowed in helping CFA states to service their foreign debt
because without devaluation these states would not have got fresh credit
from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other donors. The
relationship between CFA members and France would have been increasingly
like 'that of Cuba and the old Soviet Union', says a Roussin aide.
Since the devaluation on January 12, however, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and
Niger have signed 'letters of intent' with the IMF on adjustment programmes,
and other CFA states are due to follow. France, for its part, is increasing
its budgetary aid (as distinct from aid for development projects) to CFA
countries from FFr3.4bn (Pounds 382m) last year to FFr5.2bn this year, while
writing-off of FFr25bn of CFA debt to France will be a budgetary cost to
Paris of FFr1.5bn a year over the next three years.
In addition to setting up a FFr300m 'social fund' for CFA countries, Mr
Roussin is also trying to persuade French pharmaceutical and publishing
companies to reduce the now much-raised cost of imported drugs and school
books to francophone Africa.
But there are other adjustment costs for the French private sector, which
employs 45,000 expatriates in the CFA zone. Devaluation will not affect
petroleum sector employees of Elf-Aquitaine and Total who are paid in
dollars or French francs. In the latter category are French government aid
workers, and Mr Roussin has said they will have to take a pay cut in
solidarity with the Africans who carry only CFA francs.
Speaking for CIAN, whose 100 member companies have more than 1,000
subsidiaries in CFA countries, Mr Prouteau says the devaluation has halved
the value of their FFr10bn local assets, which will force many of them into
making extra provisions on their 1994 balance sheets.
Similarly halved is the value of unpaid CFA commercial debts to French
companies, which Mr Prouteau puts at the equivalent of Dollars 7bn-Dollars
8bn. Increasing CFA central bank restrictions and liquidity shortage in the
local banking systems has much delayed repayment of these debts, which are
now caught by the currency change.
'Many smaller French traders could now go to the wall,' says Mr Prouteau.
But for all his protestations, he is not hopeful of getting much redress
from a French government that insists the devaluation was not its doing.

Indications emerged yesterday that the worst might be over for Japan's
domestic property market, according to the Government Housing Loan
Corporation of Japan.
The average price of a newly built home rose in October for the first time
in two years, standing at at Y43.96m (Pounds 264,000), a 3.8 per cent
increase on the corporation's previous survey last April.
However, the corporation noted the recovery was confined to provincial
Japan. Average prices in the central region around Tokyo fell during the
six-month period by 0.4 per cent, to Y53.1m.
Sales of new condominiums in Japan's largest cities rose by 39.2 per cent in
1993, the first rise in three years, said a separate study by the Real
Estate Economy Institute. It predicted another big rise, from last year's
104,621 units, to at least 130,000 condominiums in the current year, helped
by continued low prices and falling interest rates on home loans.
Consumer spending remains weak, however, according to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry's latest count of sales by department
stores and supermarkets. The turnover of large stores fell by 4.9 per cent
to Y21,490bn last year, after recording the 19th consecutive month of
decline in December.
Miti said growth in sales of all commodities had slipped below 1992 levels.
Clothing sales have been down particularly because of slack demand for
business suits and high-fashion apparel. The statistics cover 424 department
stores and 2,062 supermarkets.
The economic slump has made consumers more sensitive to prices, the ministry
said. With corporate profits down, large-scale demand has fallen
significantly, it added.

FT  28 JAN 94 / The Soviet insider, the gold, and Kyrgyzstan's political
innocents: The western Mr Big with top-level connections in four former
Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Birshtein, a Soviet emigre who runs a Zurich-based trading company,
enjoys the rare distinction of having caused the resignation of one
country's government and of being involved in the downfall of another's
vice-president.
As a result of the scandals which have erupted around him, his Seabeco
group, with annual turnover of Dollars 500m, has attracted more publicity
than otherwise warranted by its size. Since the Soviet Union's collapse, he
has gained impressive access to the leaders of at least four of the new
republics, offering them foreign trips and practical help in running their
affairs.
Not surprisingly for the state-dominated economies of the former Soviet
Union, where good political connections have always been essential to clinch
deals, Mr Birshtein was able to expand his business with their assistance.
As the political leaders struggled with the problems of trying to establish
functioning governments and market economies on the ruins of the monolithic
Soviet system which concentrated expertise, resources, and talent in Moscow,
his help came as a godsend.
But their inexperience and low pay made them prone to the corruption and
incompetence which have fed nostalgia for the old Soviet Union - the
sentiment on which Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian neo-fascist,
campaigned to win a large chunk of the vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.
Mr Birshtein can certainly point to simply being good at business in a
half-reformed system where high-level political connections have long been
essential for clinching deals. The information unveiled as a result of the
scandals around Seabeco says more about the officials who have treated state
property as their own and, in the case of Russia, exploited false
allegations against him to settle political scores.
'It's not a secret for anybody that there is corruption in Russia but I'm
not a policeman. I never in my life did anything illegal,' says Mr
Birshtein.
A native Russian speaker who started building up business contacts in Moscow
after emigrating to Canada in 1979, Mr Birshtein was in a unique position to
exploit opportunities offered by the Soviet Union's collapse in December
1991.
As Mr Birshtein told the Financial Times: 'From 1982 ..I spent a lot of
time, step by step, meeting a lot of people, building connections and
relations. These connections led me to the top.'
As the president of Kyrgyzstan, Mr Askar Akayev, then one of his eager
partners, recalls: 'Boris Birshtein made a big impression on us. First of
all through his respectability. He had his own private jets, and when in
Moscow, he stayed in places to which only the most powerful Politburo
members had access. Birshtein did not hide this and was proud of his ties
with the great and powerful of this world. Secondly, his commercial
proposals corresponded to what we were looking for.'
Nowhere is the inexperience of his partners clearer than in Kyrgyzstan, one
of the smallest and poorest republics, where the entire cabinet resigned
last month over allegations that Mr Tursun Chyngyshev, the prime minister,
personally profited from a joint venture set up with Mr Birshtein to develop
the republic's gold wealth.
In 1992 Mr Birshtein's private jets ferried 1.6 tonnes of gold concentrate
from Bishkek, the remote Kyrgyz capital, to Zurich. In Switzerland, the gold
was refined by a Swiss company called Metaux Precieux SA Metalor, and stored
in the vaults of Union Bank of Switzerland as collateral for a Dollars 13.8m
credit line to Kyrgyzstan. A parliamentary investigation claimed
irregularities appeared in the spending of this money, as well as in the
amount of gold finally put at the disposal of the Kyrgyz public purse in
February 1993.
It also asked whether the gold was used secretly by Kyrgyz officials to
raise funds for their own benefit before the credit line was made available
in February 1993. Until then, ingots produced by Metalor from Kyrgyz
concentrate were kept for an annual fee of 0.2 per cent at Banque Indosuez
in Zurich in the gold deposit account of a Liberian-registered company
called Wico International - in which 50 shares were held by Seabeco, and the
remaining 450 by Kyrgyzstan.
But Mr Chyngyshev has come under particularly harsh scrutiny for joining the
board of a joint venture called Seabeco Kyrgyzstan, whose founding documents
describe its aims as 'trading in goods of all kinds ..financing of
investment projects ..consultancy in economic and financial matters ..and
purchase of real estate'.
Illustrating the government's dependence on Mr Birshtein, who was even
appointed head of an official committee for the reconstruction and
development of Kyrgyzstan, the government said it paid Dollars 1.96m to
Seabeco out of the Dollars 13.8m credit line. It said this was repayment for
items including weapons for the leadership's bodyguard, four Volvo-940
limousines to ferry around the president and other high officials, and
equipment to upgrade Kyrgyzstan's gold mining industry.
Again, as part of Mr Birshtein's helping hand strategy, Seabeco helped set
up Kyrgyzstan's first international business school, which last month
produced its first 40 graduates. It was also instrumental in bringing to
Kyrgyzstan the man who devised its first market reform programme, Mr Charles
McMillan, previously an adviser to Mr Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian
prime minister.
But parliament challenges the government's version of how the government
spent the Dollars 13.8m, including the payments made to Seabeco. Parliament
said the weapons and cars were given to the Kyrgyz leadership by Seabeco but
were subsequently described as a purchase to help the government plug holes
in its account of how the money was really spent.
Although it is still not clear exactly how much money was pocketed by
officials, Mr Akayev does not disagree with an estimate that at least
Dollars 4m went missing.
'Even if it was just Dollars 4m, that is a substantial amount for a small
republic like Kyrgyzstan,' said Mr Ramazan Derildayev, deputy chairman of
the commission which conducted the investigation.
'If people who are supposed to be monitoring the use of resources decide to
enrich themselves, then you have to say they are corrupt. We hope that the
fact the president understood us and that parliament supported us means
there will be less ugliness in future.'
In trying to unravel the Seabeco inheritance, the Kyrgyz parliament is also
keen to review the contract for the development of Kyrgyzstan's Kumtor gold
deposit awarded to Cameco, a Canadian mining company introduced to the
Kyrgyz leadership by Mr Birshtein. Cameco is a well-known Saskatchewan
company which is the world's largest uranium producer and has been looking
for ways to diversify into other metals, such as gold.
Although they said they would now think twice about using Mr Birshtein as
their agent because of the controversy which has erupted around him, Cameco
executives said he did a good job in helping them arrange the deal. Since
then, however, the repercussions of the Seabeco scandal have sufficiently
alarmed Cameco to prompt its local representative to defend the deal in a
Bishkek newspaper article.
The article said that Cameco had signed the deal only after verifying that
it was in line with Kyrgyz law, that it had revised the terms of the deal
several times to satisfy the Kyrgyz side, and that it had already invested
Dollars 6m in the project and hoped to go ahead - but only on condition that
the Kyrgyz side removed 'uncertainty' over the deal. Parliament has set the
new government - which includes many of its old ministers - a February 18
deadline to satisfy its queries. These include parliament's claim that the
government should have sought tenders from rival companies before picking
Cameco.
The Kyrgyz prosecutor's office is now examining the commission's findings to
determine whether it has enough evidence to bring criminal charges against
the ex-prime minister and other high officials.
Although he said he did not exclude greed, President Akayev, who has not
been implicated in the affair, has blamed most of the losses on inexperience
and incompetence of officials.
'I am sure that International Monetary Fund and World Bank's programmes fail
in 90 per cent of cases because of bureaucrats,' he said in a recent
interview.
On Sunday, Mr Akayev is putting his own prestige on the line by asking for a
vote of confidence in a nationwide referendum. Although he is expected to
scrape through in a vote he initiated to avoid holding early parliamentary
and presidential elections, the poll may well reflect disillusionment with
his reformist but inexperienced rule similar to the results in last month's
parliamentary elections in Russia.
That Mr Birshtein's deal-making success was commensurate with his access to
the politicians is borne out by his achievements in Moldova, another small
republic on the periphery of the former Soviet Union. There, Mr Birshtein's
joint venture is headed by the republican president's son-in-law, Mr Artur
Gherman. The former Communist party hotel, now called the Seabeco Hotel and
the only place to stay for western businessmen and visiting officials in the
capital Kishinyov, belongs to the joint venture, which also enjoys various
import duty exemptions, and the rare right to set up casinos.
Mr Birshtein boasts that he arranged a meeting between the then Russian
vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, and Moldova's President Mircea Snegur,
which helped defuse a fierce conflict over Moldova's Russian-speaking
enclave of Dnestr. 'I had a meeting with the Moldovan president. He was very
depressed. I said I see how you are suffering. I said I could arrange a
meeting with Mr Rutskoi as I knew him.'
It was in Russia that Mr Birshtein's practice of cultivating political ties
to promote his business interests backfired against him spectacularly. Mr
Birshtein's contacts went so high in the polarised Russian political world
that by the summer of 1993, he found himself at the heart of a ferocious
power struggle between Mr Yeltsin and two powerful opponents by then in open
alliance, Mr Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker.
Concerned about the effects of Russia's political instability on business,
Mr Birshtein says he tried to mediate a truce between Mr Yeltsin and Mr
Khasbulatov ('I got a meeting with the president. It's much simpler than you
think'). Within weeks, however, the president's men produced allegations
that Mr Rutskoi had received kickbacks from official imports of babyfood
with Mr Birshtein's help, which were then used as a pretext to expel him
from his Kremlin office.
A presidential decree suspending Mr Rutskoi 'pending clarification' of the
allegations proved little more than a manoeuvre to clear the way for Mr
Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of parliament on September 21. This
was followed by Mr Rutskoi's leadership of the armed parliamentary rebellion
on October 3, for which he is now awaiting trial.
However, four months after the initial corruption allegations were made, Mr
Gennady Ponomaryov, the Moscow city prosecutor in charge of the case, has
found 'no evidence' to charge Mr Rutskoi with corruption. Now he wants to
prosecute for slander the presidential officials who made the allegations in
the first place.
The case provides the clearest illustration of how Russian politicians,
including Mr Yeltsin, have used corruption allegations to discredit
political rivals rather than to fight the corruption that is gnawing at the
heart of Russian society.
Mr Ponomaryov did, however, launch a criminal investigation into Agrokhim, a
state-owned monopoly producer of mineral fertilisers, over its use of a
joint venture with Mr Birshtein's Seabeco.
Mr Ponomaryov has queried a transfer of Dollars 5m from Agrokhim to the
Seabeco Trade and Finance joint venture in the final years of the Soviet
Union's existence, when managers of state enterprises began using foreign
partners to keep state funds out of the country. The investigation appears
to be trying to make the case fit a pattern. In other cases managers of
state-owned companies have made money by fudging figures on the value of
imports and exports and siphoning profits to joint ventures in the west.
Mr Yuri Orlov, a senior Agrokhim executive at the time, explains that the
joint venture with Seabeco was a convenient vehicle for marketing fertiliser
exports in the west and importing western equipment and consumer goods
needed by the corporation at home. Claiming that state funds channelled
through the joint venture were 'strictly controlled' by the Soviet
authorities, he said he saw nothing wrong with the fact that Agrokhim
received part of the commission fees it paid to its own joint venture for
selling its own fertiliser.
For his part, Mr Birshtein, who deplored damage done to his business by the
allegations against him and Mr Rutskoi, says his only mistake was getting so
closely involved in politics. 'I'm never going to do anything like that
again,' he said. 'Everybody has to know their place. If you're a
businessman, don't touch politics.'

FT  28 JAN 94 / German workers pay for past deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German engineering workers, threatening warning strikes in pursuit of higher
pay, were yesterday offered grim reminders of the cost of deals in the past.
Figures published yesterday showed the car and mechanical engineering
industries alone shed 240,000 jobs last year. Ms Erika Emmerich, president
of the VDA vehicle makers' association, said the loss of 70,000 automotive
industry jobs, after 60,000 in 1992, was only partly due to a 23 per cent
slump in 1993 output.
'The need to restore international competitiveness through a reduction in
costs is just as important,' she said. Labour costs in a German car factory
last year, at DM49.60 (Pounds 18.9) an hour, were still almost double those
in the UK, according to VDA officials. Wage costs had to be reduced and
working times made more flexible. 'That is the only way we can maintain
Germany as a vehicle production base,' she said.
Mr Wolfgang Koch, a regional leader of the VDMA mechanical engineering
association, reported the loss of 170,000 jobs in 1993 and said the erosion
would continue.
While both officials, representing Germany's biggest industries,
acknowledged the worst of the recession was past, they held out little hope
of a speedy recovery. Ms Emmerich predicted 'stagnation' in the motor trade.
Regional negotiations on the IG Metall union's 6 per cent pay claim ended
without any apparent movement from either side last night. The national
leadership is expected to decide today whether to go ahead with threatened
warning strikes starting on Monday.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Case of deja vu on EU travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over the most recent delay in implementing the computer system
underpinning the Schengen free-travel accord reeks of deja vu to those
involved in sophisticated information technology projects. The technology is
rarely at fault; the management usually has a lot to answer for.
In this case the failure to appoint a prime contractor has led to an
acrimonious squabble over responsibility for coordination of the project.
The row is over the failure of the nine European Union signatories of the
Schengen accord to meet a February 1 target for ending passport controls.
The Schengen system is simple in essence. A central computer in Strasbourg
holds police and immigration records. Officials in the nine member countries
of the Schengen accord - the UK, Denmark and Ireland have excluded
themselves - have access to the information over telecommunications links.
The technology is tried and tested. Siemens Nixdorf, the German computer
manufacturer, is initially providing one, then a pair of mainframe computers
to manage the central records.
Bull, the French computer manufacturer, is providing the telecommunications
infrastructure, and Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company,
is developing the applications software. It also takes overall
responsibility for the system.
Each of the nine countries has responsibility for developing its own system,
linking police and immigration authorities, and ensuring it is ready for
connection to Strasbourg.
It is not much of a challenge by modern computing standards, yet the system
has been delayed repeatedly and now is certain to miss the most recent
target date of February 1 for ending passport controls.
If the present rate of progress is maintained, it could be 12 months before
the system is ready. Even when the links are established, each national
system will have to be thoroughly tested.
What has gone wrong and, more important, why? Everybody agrees the central
system is in good shape and has been for some months.
The problem is that the essential links between the central system and the
national systems are not all ready. Until the links are in place, system
testing is impossible. At least three national systems must be connected if
the system is to be tested realistically.
So far Belgium and the Netherlands have their links in place; France is
expected to follow. Germany, however, is not ready to connect. Who is at
fault? The Schengen authorities yesterday blamed Sema, arguing that it was
contractually obliged to provide the linking software. Sema rejected the
criticism.
Europe still seems to have some lessons to learn in project management.
Schengen is not an episode to promote confidence that the EU can co-ordinate
its efforts to create information superhighways or other large information
technology systems.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Recession and blunders derail SNCF: Attempts to regain
passengers and freight and reverse the rail network's losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The line of sleek high-speed trains pointing out from the Gare de Lyon in
Paris provide a shining image of modern and efficient rail travel. But for
users of the SNCF rail network the image has been tarnished.
The state-owned railway is struggling to win back passengers and freight
after one of the worst years in its history. In 1993, traffic fell by 7.5
per cent to 48bn passenger kilometres (the number of kilometres travelled by
passengers) and the volume of freight fell by 10 per cent to 43.5bn tonne
kilometres.
Final figures are expected to show total losses for the rail system of about
FFr8bn (Pounds 900m), the biggest for more than a decade.
The reasons for the decline are partly to be found in the effects of
recession which have reduced demand for rail travel and the transport of
goods. However, the fall also reflects a series of commercial blunders,
which have disenchanted passengers, and a structural decline in the
attraction of rail freight.
Stung into action, SNCF's managers have launched a commercial strategy aimed
at restoring the railway's image and reversing its financial performance. A
new team, headed by Mr Jacques Berducou, took charge of SNCF's passenger
operations at the end of last year, and has sought to identify and rectify
the railway's problems.
Mr Richard Ange, chief assistant to Mr Berducou, estimates that more than
half the decline in passenger traffic in 1993 could be put down to economic
factors.
'Commuter services were hit by the effects of rising unemployment and
depressed demand,' he says. Inter-city traffic fell by about 9 per cent,
while cross-border travel to Italy and Spain fell victim to the effects of
currency depreciation in those countries.
It is the non-economic factors, however, which have really worried the SNCF.
'We lost customers because of commercial problems and a damaging of our
relationship with passengers,' admits Mr Ange.
The principal culprit was an automated booking service, known as Socrates
but which proved to be one of the railway's most unwise investments.
Problems in the system's software quickly became apparent after its
introduction at the beginning of last year. This, combined with a lack of
training for SNCF staff, resulted in chaos at the ticket office.
'It was a catastrophe,' says Mrs Simone Bigorgne of the FNAUT, the French
federation of transport users. She cites the example of one member of her
family who was forced to fly to Barcelona because Socrates did not recognise
the Spanish city as a destination.
The problems with Socrates have now largely been resolved. Improved software
and training means that that the system is now operating as planned,
reducing transaction times and increasing information to passengers. But
Socrates was not the only problem.
'There was a feeling we were too rigid in terms of price and access to
trains,' says Mr Ange. In particular, passengers complained about the
cumbersome system of compulsory reservations for journeys on SNCF's Trains a
Grande Vitesse and the complex pricing structure of rail fares.
On both counts, Mr Ange cites progress. The reservation fee on TGV lines has
been reduced from FFr18 to FFr3, and it is no longer an automatic offence to
board a train without a ticket.
As of this week, the pricing system has been simplified and a series of
discounts has been introduced on high-speed lines.
Attempts to improve services are, however, complicated by the group's
financial position. The need to cut jobs, which has resulted in annual
reductions in the workforce of more than 5,000 over the past few years, has
sapped employees' morale. Strikes in protest at job cuts and the difficulty
of investing in new trains, particularly on new lines, has caused delays and
dissatisfaction, says the FNAUT.
Responding to economic conditions is also hard. With French economic
recovery expected to be only gradual, SNCF is counting on the effects of new
routes and more attractive prices to offset depressed demand. A high-speed
circle line to the east of Paris is due to start operating in June, while
the Channel Tunnel to Britain will provide a new source of revenues. Fare
increases, announced this week, are being limited to an average of 1.2 per
cent, to lure passengers from the roads and the airlines.
The combination of these various measures, says the SNCF, should allow
passenger traffic to rise by its target of 5 per cent this year and to allow
these operations to break even.
Ambitions in the freight services are still more modest, with a reduction in
losses from last year's FFr2.5bn as the goal. In terms of market share and
volumes, rail freight has been in steady decline since the early 1970s. The
rise of competition from road hauliers and the shifting structure of
France's economy away from products such as coal and steel has reduced the
advantages of the railways.
SNCF is seeking to stem the decline in freight by developing its so-called
combination operations, services which allow containers to be transported by
both road and rail. Again, freight activities should receive a boost from
the extension of the rail network.
SNCF estimates, for example, that about 6m tonnes of freight will travel
through the Channel Tunnel every year from the second half of the decade.
But the problems facing freight run deep. Wooing disgruntled French
passengers is delicate, but manageable. Seducing French industry is an
altogether more difficult task.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Rexrodt plays for big stakes in energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
By drafting legislation aimed at opening up Germany's energy sector to more
competition, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, is taking on part of
the country's establishment, officials said yesterday.
Mr Rexrodt wants the country's electricity grid and gas networks to be
thrown open to foreign and domestic competition. This would reduce energy
prices, which for some categories are the highest in the European Union and
break the political and economic influence held by giant utilities such as
RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk.
Officials from RWE, the largest utility, said Mr Rexrodt's plan were not
surprising. 'Its not really a new theme (from the ministry) we are hearing.
Let us see the final draft legislation,' he said.
But officials from Veba, the energy-based conglomerate whose electricity
subsidiary, PreussenElektra, holds a fifth of the market in western Germany,
said the measures should be matched by greater competition in the rest of
Europe. 'Everyone says the energy sector in Germany is a monopolistic
structure. But what about other EU countries,' he said.
What makes Germany different is that there is no single formal regulatory
body overseeing electricity pricing. The regional utilities, or the
distribution companies, must agree their tariffs with local municipalities,
which often own part of the utilities.
However, officials in Bonn and Brussels are sceptical that Mr Rexrodt can
succeed, particularly in an election year, although they realise he has to
try.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin's supporters have told him he is courting disaster
at the next elections if he endorses the government's change in economic
policy and fails to crack down on organised crime.
Mr Sergei Yushenkov, a leader of Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc which
includes some of the president's oldest supporters, said Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, would 'try to curb economic reform and his
latest steps prove it'.
Amid reports that Mr Chernomyrdin has already ordered more state credits for
ailing enterprises, Mr Yushenkov called for his dismissal.
'We hope the president will at last realise the danger of curbing economic
reforms and take the necessary decisions.'
Mr Yeltsin's spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, hedged his bets on how Mr
Yeltsin would respond to the warnings. 'The president did not expect such a
bitter reaction from the democratic wing of society,' he said.
Although he admitted that some of Mr Chernomyrdin's statements had been a
cause for concern, he said Mr Yeltsin would watch how the new government
behaved in practice.'
The president was also advised yesterday by Mr Pyotr Filippov, one of his
senior aides, to create special security forces to fight Russia's mafia.
Otherwise extremists like Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky might win presidential
elections in 1996 by promising draconian measures to fight a breakdown in
law and order.
Meanwhile, on a two-day visit to Rome, Mr Chernomyrdin, was quoted as vowing
to keep his country on a reformist course.
He told Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi he hoped Russia would be
admitted to the Group of Seven industrialised nations this year, and that
his country aimed to work towards full membership of the European Union.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Berlusconi the politician makes a poor debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decision of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, to enter politics
has provoked a stream of hostile comments and received scant support.
The negative reaction came yesterday both from politicians and the media.
The only positive comments came from within Mr Berlusconi's own media empire
whose leadership he formally renounced on Wednesday when he threw his hat
into the political ring.
The only political grouping to welcome Mr Berlusconi's move was the National
Alliance, the recently re-baptised MSI neo-fascist movement headed by Mr
Gianfranco Fini. The Alliance looks the most likely ally for Mr Berlusconi.
In contrast, Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League,
and another potential ally, reacted coolly. He dismissed Mr Berlusconi's
movement, Forza Italia, as 'not a real party'.
The most consistent criticism directed against Mr Berlusconi was on the
grounds that he would split the Liberal-Democrat vote rather than bring it
together as he promised. This fear was repeated both by newspaper
commentators and by Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the Referendum movement.
Mr Eugenio Scalfari, editor of La Repubblica and long-standing critic of Mr
Berlusconi, said Mr Berlusconi's claim to represent a new force in Italian
politics was spurious. His business fortune had been based on a virtual
monopoly in commercial television permitted because of his close links with
discredited politicians such as Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader.
Mr Berlusconi has has declined to relinquish ownership of his empire, merely
daily management.
Meanwhile Mr Luciano Benetton, head of the clothing business, said he would
not stand again as a senator. He stood for the Republican Party in the April
1992 elections, but said his obligations were to running his business.
A Milan judge ruled yesterday that ex-prime minister Bettino Craxi must
stand trial for corruption, Reuter reports from Milan. The former Socialist
leader will go on trial on March 29, with Mr Severino Citaristi,
ex-treasurer of the disbanded Christian Democrats, and eight others accused
of taking kickbacks for a contract with Eni, the state energy group.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Spanish strike 'backed by 8m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spanish riot police clashed with pickets across the country yesterday as
trade unions staged a 24-hour strike in protest at the government's plans to
reform the labour market.
The unions claimed that 8m workers took part in the stoppage but employers
insisted that some 70 per cent of businesses operated normally.
The government was maintaining a low profile, however, as it became
increasingly clear that the strike had failed to have as serious an impact
as expected outside the heavily industrialised areas.
Clashes between strikers and police took place in Madrid and the cities of
Burgos, Malaga, Zaragoza, and San Sebastian. One person was killed when a
car was driven into a picket line and dozens were injured in clashes. More
than 100 strikers were arrested. Traffic in Spain's large cities fell off as
many people preferred to take a day off rather than face hundreds of pickets
spread about the country by the two main Spanish unions, the General
Workers' Union and the Workers' Commissions.
But the government appeared to have been able to guarantee minimum public
transport services in most cities and the prime minister, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, now seems likely to offer only token recognition to the strikers
in the next few days. This will probably take the form of a government
statement applauding the lack of serious violence.
It is likely the lower than expected impact of the strike means the
government will stick to its resolve not to renegotiate the reforms.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Bank of France sets money goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The newly-independent Bank of France made a cautious start yesterday by
setting a general goal for money-supply expansion of 'around 5 per cent' for
the medium term, rather than any more precise target for this year.
The French central bank said the aim underlying this goal for M3, a broad
definition of money that includes short-term mutual funds, was to raise
growth in the French economy to between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent a year
by the late 1990s, while keeping inflation at 'no more than' its current
annual pace of 2 per cent. The banks' new monetary stance - which Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor, said had been decided 'collegially' with
his eight fellow members of the new independent monetary policy committee -
is unlikely in itself to put a break on the Balladur government's hopes for
an early economic recovery.
Indeed, some economists commented yesterday that the bank was perhaps being
optimistic because investment cutbacks in recent years may now have reduced
France's low-inflation growth potential to below 2.5 per cent a year.
But the bank also said yesterday that, as well as providing scope for
economic recovery, it placed equal weight 'on stabilising the external value
of the currency' in line with its central rate in the European Monetary
System, which was left unchanged by last August's crisis.
Mr Trichet said that since then the bank 'has followed a policy of prudent
and gradual reduction of short-term interest rates . . . aimed at preserving
the external and internal value of the franc and letting the economy benefit
from the best medium-and long-term financing conditions'. It would continue
the same policy, he implied.
Asked to what extent the newly-independent central bank was taking France's
record unemployment rate of over 12 per cent into account, Mr Trichet said
the fact that France could now borrow over 5-10 years at rates which, Japan
apart, were 'among the lowest in the Group of Seven countries', should
ensure 'fairly substantial medium-term growth'.
Mr Trichet was at pains to stress that there was nothing new about the
central bank's decision not to set a precise spread for M3 money growth in
1994, as it had done a year earlier in setting a 4-6.5 per cent target range
for 1993. Other central banks had sometimes been similarly vague, he said.
But what is new is the bank's evident mistrust of M3 as a reliable sole
indicator of the country's money supply, as a result of last year's
experience when M3 actually shrank by 1.6 per cent between end-1992 and
end-1993. This contraction was far greater than that in the real economy,
and was caused, according to the bank, by massive shifts of money out of
mutual funds (which are included in France's definition of M3) into
non-monetary assets like 'Balladur bonds' and shares of privatised
companies.
The bank warned that the savings shifts could reoccur or be reversed in
1994, and 'this is why no range has been specified either side of the medium
term objective'.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Turkey tightens monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey yesterday unveiled measures to bolster faltering confidence in the
lira in the wake of a 11.97 per cent devaluation of the currency.
The changes, announced by the central bank governor, Mr Bulent Gultekin,
represent a tightening in monetary policy. The move is likely to create
further upward pressure on interest rates, as banking authorities seek to
soak up the lira liquidity to support the currency.
Turkey's leading retail banks yesterday introduced new rates, with one-year
deposits now earning around 88 per cent. Overnight rates have been pushed as
high as 180 per cent in the wake of the currency crisis.
Under the reforms, the central bank redefines its reserve requirement to
reflect a bank's total liabilities, not just the volume of time deposits as
before. The measures, which appeared to have slowed the fall of the lira
yesterday, were broadly welcomed by Turkish bankers. However, they penalise
wholesale non-deposit banks, particularly foreign banks.
The moves aim to restore currency stability around the central bank's newly
announced rate of 17,250 to the dollar. The changes will add considerably to
the costs to banks of raising funds, but they will help the government
finance the budget deficit as banks move to meet the new reserve
requirement.
After hectic trading yesterday, the Istanbul stock exchange closed at
19,581, down around 7 per cent in lira terms. In dollars terms the market
has lost close to 35 per cent since the run on the lira started 13 days ago.
There was reported heavy selling of most bank shares.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said the measures were 'in line with
the rules of the free market'. The moves nonetheless mark a significant
reversal of policy, with Mrs Ciller forced to raise interest rates, adding
to budget costs, through increased interest payments on government debt, and
raising the working capital costs of private industry.
The lira realignment was initially triggered by the announcement of US
rating agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's that Turkish credit rating had
been downgraded.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Commission proposes to extend immigrants' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Immigrants legally resident in any country of the European Union should have
the right to travel and seek employment in all other member states, even if
they are not citizens of any EU member, according to a forthcoming document
from the European Commission.
The idea, contained in a policy document the Commission is expected to send
to the Council of Ministers of the 12 next month, is certain to meet fierce
resistance from an EU still unprepared to grant free movement to its own
citizens, although the latter is a legal requirement both of the single
European market and the Maastricht treaty.
The draft Commission position is contained in a 'communication' to the
Council of Ministers on immigration and asylum policy. This does not yet
have full Commission support, nor will it have the force of a legislative
proposal. But under Maastricht, the EU is called upon to play a bigger role
in immigration and visa policy, hitherto the subject of secretive, and
frequently inoperative, intergovernmental co-operation between the 12.
The recent scale of immigration into the EU - especially from the former
Yugoslavia and central Europe - has spurred EU governments to seek more
co-ordination on curbing this influx. The 12 are also groping towards a
common definition of political refugees as opposed to ordinary immigrants,
many of whom seek a new life in western Europe under asylum procedures which
vary throughout the EU.
The Commission paper also addresses the need to combat the recent upsurge in
racist attacks against immigrants, and policies to promote their integration
into host communities.
Intra-EU mobility for legal residents is part of this integration process,
according to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU commissioner responsible for social
policy and immigration issues.
'I know that's a big step, and it may be necessary to take smaller steps in
that direction, but that's what I'm aiming for,' Mr Flynn says.

FT  28 JAN 94 / UK arms in Saudi deal exempt from export regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS, and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is under no obligation to give details of the end users of
defence equipment supplied by Britain under the Pounds 20bn Al-Yamamah
defence deal, the government said yesterday.
The potentially embarrassing disclosure, came in a parliamentary written
answer by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister.
Mr Aitken said defence equipment exports under the Al- Yamamah deal had
'Crown status', in common with all government defence exports, and were
'therefore not subject to export licensing requirements'.
It also emerged last night that the disclosure had earlier been brought to
the attention of Lord Justice Scott who is conducting the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry.
Evidence before the inquiry shows that the government pressed ahead with
defence deals with Saudi Arabia in spite of being warned by intelligence and
some officials that the country was possibly being used to divert military
equipment to Iraq.
Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the Scott inquiry, said the judge was looking
at the potential loopholes inherent in Crown status arrangements, which are
believed to cover a number of other potentially sensitive defence deals, and
the extent to which the government had adhered to restrictions on exports to
Iraq directly or through a third country.
Al-Yamamah is a two-stage government-to-government deal covering supplies of
British arms, infrastructure, and defence services worth more than Pounds
2bn per year.
Mr Jim Cousins, the Labour MP who tabled the parliamentary question, said
yesterday that the government's answer was 'of very considerable
significance' in the light of evidence given to the Scott inquiry.
Mr Cousins said the answer showed there was 'a great hole' in the export
licence control system.
The Ministry of Defence said last night that there was no requirement for
transactions with Crown status either to have export sales licences or for
end-user details to be provided.
Mr Aitken said sales under Al Yamamah were subject to 'the normal foreign
and defence policy considerations'.
The Al-Yamamah deal dates from 1985 and was reinforced in 1988. Although
signed by defence secretaries Mr Michael Heseltine and his successor Mr
George Younger, now Lord Younger of Prestwick, it had from the outset the
strong personal backing of Lady Thatcher, the then prime minister.
A year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured the latest order for
arms estimated to be worth Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn total.
Full details of the deal have never been disclosed. British officials and
industrialists have said this was at the insistence of the Saudi
authorities.

FT  28 JAN 94 / NYSE dominance challenged as SEC overhauls market rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The New York Stock Exchange's dominance of share trading in the US is likely
to come under greater attack following yester day's unveiling of an overhaul
of the rules governing the US equity markets.
The changes are the result of a two-year study by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, set up to investigate whether the framework of
securities regulation in the US has kept pace with changes in the way the
markets operate.
While promoting greater competition between the NYSE and others for share
trading, the SEC backed away from full-scale deregulation. Mr Brandon
Becker, director of market regulation, said: 'We concluded that the US
markets are working very well as they are.'
The regulators have instructed the NYSE to amend two rules which prevent
trading in listed companies from being conducted on other markets. Companies
will no longer need the support of two thirds of their shareholders to
abandon their listing on the NYSE, but will be able to make the move subject
to board approval.
The big broking firms who are members of the NYSE, the world's biggest
exchange, will also no longer be forbidden to transact business elsewhere
when the exchange is closed, though the rule will remain in force while the
market is open.
This change should help attract back to the US share trading business which
is handled abroad, particularly in London, the SEC said.
The SEC also backed away from the imposition of heavy new regulations on the
private trading systems and broker-dealers which are already handling an
increasing amount of business away from the NYSE and other exchanges. These
alternative trading mechanisms have spurred the exchanges to improve
services and bring down costs for investors, it said.
The review, known as Market 2000, was the SEC's first extensive look at its
rules since the early 1970s.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Attack on public sector waste: Errors cost millions, says
MPs' report - Labour hits at 'fall in standards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unprecedented attack on the level of waste and corruption in Britain's
public sector yesterday forced Mr John Major to deny that public standards
had declined under the Conservative government.
The House of Commons public accounts committee, one of parliament's most
powerful bodies, said there had been 'a departure from the standards of
public conduct' established during the past 140 years.
The committee catalogued numerous examples of 'inadequate stewardship of
public money' by bodies such as the Welsh Office, the Wessex Health
Authority and the Ministry of Defence. In some cases, mistakes had cost tens
of millions of pounds of public money.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said there are
'large numbers of people who tell me how they want to get rid of
corruption'.
He added: 'Once you have corruption you are in trouble and it is very
difficult to break out of it.'
The report was seized upon by Mr John Smith, Labour's leader, as another
example of how the government was failing to meet the standards of conduct
that it was encouraging in the public.
He urged Mr Major in the Commons to explain the 'devastating catalogue of
incompetence, mismanagement and waste of public money' by the government and
its agencies.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said people 'are being asked
to pay unprecedented levels of taxation only to see your government hand
that money over to quangos and executive agencies, to throw away on waste,
corruption and fraud'.
However, Mr Major said the report clearly showed that there had been 'no
decline in standards' and that the PAC welcomed the government's recent
drive for efficiency.
Downing street officials rejected Labour calls that Mr Major should broaden
the appointment system for positions to quasi-government bodies, arguing
that the government was 'perfectly capable of choosing honest and competent
people'.
The PAC's report crystallised the investigations into the accounts of
government departments and quangos that it has carried out in recent years.
Committee members felt the report was needed to highlight the range of
failings uncovered.
The report said there had been 'inadequate financial controls' exercised by
bodies such as the Foreign Office, the Department of Social Security and the
National Rivers Authority. But it reserved its greatest condemnation for
errors by the Wessex Health Authority and the Department of Employment.
It said there was 'grave concern' that the health authority had wasted at
least Pounds 20m trying to implement a regional information systems plan. At
the Department of Employment, 'doubtful and incorrect' payments to training
providers had amounted to nearly Pounds 80m.
Mr Sheldon said the fall in public standards had become particularly
apparent in recent years, and was partly associated with the government's
civil service reforms. 'It is hard to keep standards when you have
revolutionary changes and people coming in from outside,' he said.
The creation of executive agencies and more than 140 quangos had meant
people were coming into government who were used to taking short cuts. 'That
doesn't make sense when you are dealing with public money,' Mr Sheldon said.

FT  28 JAN 94 / Row may cloud Murdoch's move into Polish TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A row last night threatened to cloud Mr Rupert Murdoch's breakthrough into
eastern European television after a consortium in which he has a minority
stake won the licence for Poland's commercial channel.
The licence for the new national channel was awarded yesterday to Polsat, a
Polish-owned satellite television company which has been broadcasting into
Poland from the Netherlands.
Mr Murdoch, who has been trying to expand his television interests
worldwide, is believed to have taken a stake that could be up to 33 per cent
in the new consortium - the maximum allowed for foreigners under Polish
regulations.
The decision to award the 10-year licence for the national channel was taken
unanimously by the Radio and Television Council, the broadcast media
regulatory body.
But last night the council appeared not to know of the interest of Mr
Murdoch's News Corporation in Polsat. Mr Marek Markiewicz, the council's
chairman, explaining the decision on television last night, said: 'Polsat
showed that it is almost 100 per cent based on Polish capital, that it is
independent and has real money at its disposal.'
One bidder said there would be 'grounds for taking the decision to court' if
the News Corporation involvement had been kept from the council.
Another said 'every legal means' would be used to have the decision
overturned 'if this is the case'.
The 33 per cent limit on foreign investment suggests that the foreign input
would be valued at around Dollars 23m (Pounds 15.3m). The initial outlay for
the channel is expected to be Dollars 50m-Dollars 100m, while the Polish
market's total television advertising revenues are estimated at Dollars 130m
a year.
Polsat fought off competition from mixed Polish and foreign groups which
included Bertelsmann, Time Warner and CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcaster,
to win the licence.
Mr Piotr Nurowski, a Polsat executive, said his company planned to raise its
250bn zlotys (Pounds 7.7m) capital to 1,000bn zlotys through private
placements among domestic investors.
It is not clear what role News Corporation will play in the Polish channel,
although the company holds considerable film and television rights through
Twentieth Century Fox studios and Fox Television, the US network.
Mr Murdoch's previous moves into eastern Europe have involved newspaper
investment, in particular the ill-fated Super, a tabloid newspaper aimed at
the former East Germany.

FT  28 JAN 94 / O'Reilly tables Pounds 32m offer for stake in Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman and newspaper publisher, formally
tabled an offer yesterday worth about Pounds 32m which could lead to a stake
of just under 25 per cent in Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent
and The Independent on Sunday.
The offer, from Mr O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland, involves
Pounds 21m in convertible loan stock which can convert into ordinary
Newspaper Publishing stock at Pounds 3 a share.
If fully converted, this would give Mr O'Reilly's company a 24.99 per cent
stake in the British newspaper group.
Following the issue of the loan stock, the Irish company would make a
separate offer for 20 per cent of existing shares at Pounds 2.50 a share in
cash.
The Irish group said last night that following completion of the
subscription and the offer, the maximum stake would be 40 per cent.
The detailed offer was considered yesterday by Newspaper Publishing's
non-executive directors, who will meet again this morning.
It is likely that a rival bid will be put forward formally today by the
consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, the main existing
shareholders of The Independent - El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of
Italy - and Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of the paper.
It is believed that the consortium, which has promised to make an offer for
the 52 per cent of the company it does not already hold, is considering
bidding between Pounds 2.40 and Pounds 2.80 a share.
The Independent's non-executive directors are understood to look favourably
on the O'Reilly offer, although it is not clear how much can happen without
the support of the two continental European groups.
The Irish group also believes it can reach a contractual deal with United
Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, to provide printing and other
back-up facilities for The Independent.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low shares hit as sales and margins fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wm Low dropped 17p to 174p yesterday as the Dundee-based grocery
chain said growing price competition had pushed its like-for-like sales and
gross margins down, and it was cutting 41 jobs.
Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, said sales for the first 20 weeks of the
financial year had increased by 3.1 per cent, but excluding store openings
and closures sales were down 1.5 per cent. Turnover for Christmas and new
year had shown a similar overall pattern.
He added that the group was 'cautious' about profits for the full year, and
was adopting cost-cutting programmes including compulsory redundancies at
all levels.
'I've been in food retailing for 30 years, and 1993 was one of the toughest
years I have known,' he said.
He said the rapid expansion of Shoprite, the Isle of Man-based discount
chain which operates mainly in Scotland, as well as price promotions by
national superstore groups, had forced a reduction in gross margins to
compete.
The industry was also hindered by very low inflation - with price deflation
in some product areas.
Mr Spicer said although the company had not lost many sales directly to
Shoprite, its presence in the market had had a knock-on effect.
Moreover, while Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocer, had only two superstores
in Scotland, its price campaign launched in November had forced other
competitors to respond, which in turn had put pressure on Wm Low.
Mr Spicer said there was evidence of 'more realism' in pricing since the new
year. He added that the company was continuing to close older, smaller
stores leaving it with more efficient larger superstores, and more savings
would come from extending scanning into the 50 per cent of stores where it
had not been introduced.
Wm Low's statement is one of the starkest pieces of evidence yet of the
increasing pressures in the grocery market. Tesco, the UK's second largest
grocer, said last week it was cutting back its store opening programme and
its gross margins had fallen as a result of price competition.

BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's biggest retail banks,
yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in consolidated net profits in
1993 to Es22.6bn (Dollars 128m), despite the depressed economic conditions
and falling financial margins.
The increase represents a 2 per cent rise in profits per share to Es205.6.
BCP leads the Portuguese share market, with a market capitalisation of
Es292bn at end-1993 and a bigger price rise than any other share.
Total assets grew 27 per cent to Es1,927bn. Credit extended to clients rose
28 per cent to Es807bn but remained stationary as a proportion of total
assets at 41 per cent.
Cash flow rose 34 per cent to Es75bn. The contribution of subsidiary
companies to the consolidated profits rose 24 per cent to Es3.9bn, 17 per
cent of the total, benefiting from cross-selling and the promotion of new
products in Portugal, Spain and France.
BCP more than doubled its provisions against non-performing loans to
Es13.4bn.

Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the Monte Carlo-based hotel and gaming
group, yesterday warned that its net profits were likely to fall by 20 per
cent to 25 per cent in the current financial year.
SBM, which is the largest company in Monaco and owns the famous Hotel de
Paris as well as the Monte Carlo casino, has been affected by economic
recession and the strength of the French franc against other European
currencies.
The group said it was just starting to detect signs of an improvement in the
economic environment. However, it anticipated a reduction in turnover of
between 9 per cent and 10 per cent in the year to March 31 from FFr1.75bn
(Dollars 297m) in the last full financial year as well as the fall in net
profits from the previous year's FFr135m.
Gaming is expected to register a decline in net profits to FFr200m from
FFr250m. Hotels will suffer a fall in earnings as the occupancy level has
fallen by 8 per cent to 57 per cent in the current year.

<TEXT>
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retail group, has
agreed to purchase the Leybold vacuum technology businesses from Degussa of
Frankfurt for DM100m (Dollars 59m).
The deal, subject to clearance by the German cartel authorities, would make
Buhrle, whose Balzers subsidiary has a large vacuum business, a leading
supplier in this specialised field.
Vacuum systems are used for coating various products, including
architectural glass, semiconductor wafers, compact disks, erasable optical
disks and liquid crystal displays.
Balzers had turnover of SFr430m (Dollars 287m) last year and was profitable.
Leybold, with sales of DM868m, has been in heavy loss for some time.
Mr Heinrich Fischer, Buhrle's corporate development director, said the two
together had a large share of the German market, but that was no reason to
block the deal. Last week Buhrle revealed it had placed 362,500 registered
shares privately in December at market value to help finance the
acquisition.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Slovo dismisses business fears

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Slovo, the national chairman of the South African Communist party,
yesterday said that business concerns that the ANC and its allies were bent
on nationalisation were unwarranted. At a meeting of prominent businessmen,
he emphasised that there should be no cause for concern about the future
independence of the mining industry.
Mr Slovo, fourth on the ANC's electoral list and a strong contender for a
seat in the non-racial parliament, said the organisation did not advance 'a
mechanistic policy of across-the-board nationalisation' because it would
prove too costly and counter-productive. He described the 'hullabaloo' about
'nationalising' mineral rights as alarmist because the ANC's intention was
to only ensure a new government had room for intervention in the sector.
'The Chamber of Mines knows perfectly well it is not going to lose its
mines,' he added. However, nationalisation remained a policy option and the
SACP retained its ultimate vision of achieving 'socialised means of
production'.
The long-standing dispute between the ANC and South Africa's mining houses
gathered momentum last week after the publication of the organisation's
reconstruction and development programme. Mr Paul Jordan, the ANC's
co-ordinator of mineral and energy affairs policy, proposed that a new
government would seek the return of mineral rights from the private sector
and intervene in the management and marketing of minerals.
On Tuesday, an ANC briefing on its mining policy provoked an angry reaction
from industry leaders. Representatives from Anglo American, Johannesburg
Consolidated Investment and Gencor said the ANC's proposals flew in the face
of economic reality.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Israeli, PLO officials adjourn Cairo talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Israel focused on peace talks with Syria, Israeli and Palestinian
officials yesterday adjourned their hastily arranged talks in Cairo, writes
Mark Nicholson.
The talks were called on Tuesday evening to try to hammer out an agreed
document that would break the deadlock on implementation of Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
Palestine Liberation Organisation negotiator Nabil Shaath said: 'We are
making progress,' but did not elaborate except to say: 'All the day we have
been drafting.'
The main disagreements are over security arrangements at the border posts
between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and Jericho, how much land the
Israeli army will retain to protect Jewish settlers in Gaza and the size of
the Jericho area.
Israeli officials sought to dampen hopes that Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman, would sign an agreement when they meet in Switzerland at the
weekend.

   SIRTE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Libya's economy minister yesterday demanded that foreign countries pay back
money they owe or risk losing the assets of their companies working in
Libya, agencies report from Sirte.
Mr Omar Mustafa el-Montasser told a session of the General People's Congress
that Libya was owed from abroad a total of Dollars 1.353bn (Pounds 900m) and
FFr22bn (Pounds 2.47bn) , including interest on delayed payments.
The minister said his government had asked the countries involved to
reimburse cash. Those unable to do so would reimburse Libya in various ways
from the assets of their companies in Libya, or through imports of goods and
products from their countries, or by Libya taking stakes in their companies.
The source of the minister's figures was not clear. It was not known whether
he meant Libya would seize the assets of some foreign companies in Libya.
Many foreign firms work in Libya's oil industry.
His statement appeared to mark retaliation for UN sanctions imposed on Libya
because of its refusal to hand over for trial two agents suspected of
carrying out the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. The sanctions were tightened in December to include a freeze of Libyan
assets abroad and a ban on imports of certain oil equipment.
Prime minister Abouzid Omar Dourdah said on Sunday that Libya had sharply
cut its budget forecast for 1994 because of difficulties caused by the
sanctions.
'The cut amounts to several billions (of dollars),' he said after a
commission of the Congress had adopted the draft budget. 'As a result of the
unjust UN sanctions, we have been forced to cut our expenses in several
domains like education and health.'

Teodor Melescanu, Romanian foreign minister, told a meeting of Nato
ambassadors.
He signed the Partnership for Peace Framework Document, an initiative agreed
at Nato's summit in Brussels this month.
Mr Amedeo de Franchis, Nato deputy secretary-general said the signing of the
document was a 'starting point', but he declined to give his view on Romania
achieving full membership of the organisation.
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, nervous of nationalism in Russia,
is to sign a similar document today.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Mercedes faces third loss at truck division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial vehicle operations of Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading
truck maker, will suffer a third successive annual loss in 1994, Mr Helmut
Werner, chief executive, warned yesterday.
The car division, which also suffered an operating loss in 1993, was
expected to return to profit, however, helped by a forecast 12 per cent
increase in sales to 570,000.
Mr Werner said Mercedes, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, had
embarked on a 'radical rethinking' of its production structure and would
increase the share of its car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in
the medium-term from 2 per cent at present. Production would rise in
countries such as the US, Mexico, South Korea and India. Mercedes expected
shortly to sign a deal with Tata, the Indian vehicle maker, to assemble up
to 15,000 E-Class cars a year from 1995.
The company would also cut the level of in-house manufacturing from 45 per
cent at present to below 40 per cent by 1998, making greater use of outside
components suppliers.
Mr Werner said Mercedes planned to enter more co-operative ventures with
other vehicle makers and suppliers. It was also seeking a significant
increase in productivity, not only in labour but also in capital and
organisation. Capital spending was being cut to DM18.7bn (Dollars 10.6bn) in
the five years from 1994 to 1998 from the DM21bn previously planned for 1993
to 1997.
Turnover was forecast to rise by 5 per cent this year to DM68bn following a
3 per cent fall last year to DM64.6bn. Daimler-Benz, of which Mercedes
accounts for about two-thirds of group turnover, made a loss of DM2bn in the
first nine months of 1993 under US accounting rules.
'We shall be able to achieve more with our available funds than in the
past,' Mr Werner said. 'High investment expenditure is not always a sign of
efficient performance.'
Capital productivity had fallen steadily in recent years leading to 'a
dramatic increase in depreciation', he said. 'We have to deploy our
investment more efficiently.' The company had cut costs by DM4bn in 1993,
and planned to close the cost gap with Japanese producers by 1998.
Mercedes planned to cut its domestic workforce by a further 8,000 jobs this
year to 151,000 by the end of 1994. Passenger vehicle production - cars and
four wheel drive vehicles - was forecast to jump to 850,000-900,000 by 1998
with the addition of new ranges.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (27): Now for a world trade body - Dr Gunther
Rexrodt, German minister of economics, says the world trade body agreed on
by the Gatt negotiators must now be given real meaning and purpose / Guest
column / Dr Gunther Rexrodt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr GUNTHER REXRODT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations marks another
big step on the road to trade liberalisation and a considerable
strengthening of the multilateral trading system, thanks particularly to the
agreement to establish a new World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Attention now focuses on other issues of importance for trade policy that
have not yet been dealt with fully but that nevertheless require
consideration.
Some results of the Uruguay Round were disappointing. For example, the
framework agreement on trade in services was undeniably a negotiating
success. But if we look at the tertiary sector's extraordinary growth
potential, the overall negotiating results for initial commitments on
financial services, audiovisuals, basic telecommunications, and maritime
transport were disappointing. For civil aircraft and steel, the multilateral
agreement sought by negotiators was not attained.
These issues not resolved, either partly or fully, by the negotiations will
now have to be conducted under the new WTO. Meanwhile, meaning and purpose
must be instilled into the WTO.
On the internal front, the main priority is to work out an integrated
dispute settlement procedure; on the external front, the main effort must be
to intensify relations with other international institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Because of the heavy agenda that already faced negotiators, the inclusion of
additional questions of relevance to trade would have overburdened the
Uruguay Round. One of the most important of these topics is the
trade-environment interface. International trade and trade policy are
interrelated to the environment and environmental protection policy in a
number of areas.
Environmental protection policies can distort trade and, conversely,
commerce can affect the quality of our natural surroundings. Furthermore,
many of a given region's environmental problems can no longer be addressed
without regard to similar problems in other regions. Air and water
pollution, noise, waste, the endangering of rare animal and plant species,
and the destruction of the ozone layer are ecological problems whose impact
transcends national boundaries and are most likely to have global
significance. On the other hand, there is also the danger of environmental
protection measures being abused in order to protect trade.
Scant progress has been made to harmonise measures within worldwide
environmental protection agreements. International organisations such as the
OECD, Gatt, and Unctad, however, are in the process of analysing interface
problems, although they have yet to arrive at common results or conclusions.
In the absence of binding common rules, the Gatt procedure for settling
disputes in this area is in its infancy. With its official commitment to
protecting the environment and its broad range of functions, the WTO has a
solid foundation for this discussion. The problems should now be addressed
in the WTO without delay within an agreed working programme laid out on the
basis of the success achieved in the Uruguay Round.
Previous Gatt practice and negotiations in the Uruguay Round have shown that
not all trade-relevant problems can be covered by the trade policy rules
already on the books. With the increasing internationalisation of markets,
there is an increased overlapping of policies on trade and competition in
the international context. We are particularly challenged by efforts by
companies to restrict competition; and we are faced by government toleration
of such practices.
Private restraints on competition such as orderly marketing, managed trade,
export cartels, mergers to attain commanding market positions, and
displacement strategies by industrial targeting or laser beaming can lead to
serious trade barriers, thus undermining the value of agreements and
concessions made under the Gatt. This can generate political pressure to
react to such competitive distortions by trade policy measures.
Conversely, the employment of legal trade policy instruments such as
safeguards, anti-dumping measures or countervailing duties can distort
competition and restrict trade at both the national and international level
if applied contrary to competitive principles.
If we are to prevent or overcome drawbacks for companies in the European
Union and elsewhere, the following questions must be dealt with:
how can the interest of exporters or investors be protected in the face of
conduct that is contrary to competition?
how can a systematic application of existing national competition rules be
assured and improved so that the present multilateral trading system may be
made even more open and conducive to competition and use of trade policy
measures for competitive reasons may be prevented?
should international rules for competition be established, and, if so, what
elements should they incorporate?
The demand for a discussion of social standards continues to be voiced. This
topic has not yet been addressed in trade policy bodies; it has, however,
been the topic of particular attention by UN bodies. Since a link between
social standards and international trade is undeniable, the discussion will
also have to become part of the agenda of trade policy bodies. Developing
countries suspect that calls for social standards mask protectionist
attempts to reduce the advantages conferred on them by developing status.
Since such discussions are politically sensitive, it would be prudent to
proceed with caution.
The problems listed here are of political interest to many participants in
the multilateral trading system. It is most important to begin consultations
on them as soon as possible at the international and multilateral level and
from the very outset to acknowledge the interdependence between trade, the
environment, competition, and social standards.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (25): When the experts falter - Ian Hamilton
Fazey, who acted as moderator in a series of regional forums for UK
businessmen and bankers, says they revealed widespread uncertainty about the
nitty-gritty of export financing / The Natwest Bank/FT Exporter Forums

The questioner was annoyed. He had an agent in Nigeria who would only accept
payment in cash and in dollars. The exporter had opened a dollar account at
his clearing bank branch in Manchester but had been told if he wanted dollar
bills, he would have to buy them separately and pay in sterling from his
normal account.
What was the point of having a foreign currency account if he could not
withdraw foreign currency from it?
The answer - that foreign currencies are not legal tender in the UK, that
any money in them is not 'real', and the banks do not keep a supply of
dollars, marks, francs, lire or whatever to service them - did not go down
well with the questioner.
Nor did it impress many of the other exporters present at the forum
organised by NatWest Bank, the FT Exporter and the Institute of Export.
Geoff Able, a senior NatWest manager who had gamely stood up in the audience
to try and explain, got a rough ride.
Foreign currency accounts, which can sometimes reduce exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations if a currency is bought when cheap against sterling, are
for 'book' transactions only, he explained. Bank managers should make this
clear when customers concerned opened them.
But, as many members of the audience made clear, some bank managers - and
this applies to all the UK clearers - clearly do not.
They are generalists, not specialists, and some of them are more attuned
than others as to whether they should refer exporting customers to experts
employed in other parts of any bank's array of business banking services.
The issue illustrated a general point that emerged from the seven forums
held in October and November in Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Bristol,
Birmingham, London and Belfast. They were attended in total by more than 500
people actively involved in exporting.
At the end of the seven forums, the inescapable conclusion was that there is
a worrying degree of ignorance throughout industry and commerce, mainly
about the mechanics of exporting and many of the banking, legal, taxation
and other financial issues associated with it.
My own role in the forums was to be a neutral chairman and questionmaster,
ensuring audiences were not intimidated by the experts on the platform. Each
forum covered six areas: VAT and the single market; customs planning;
currency risk management; export trade finance; agency and distribution law;
and international marketing.
Some experts, like Barry Price, from Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, Andy
Nemes, of NatWest's international trade and banking services, Mike Thorpe,
an international marketing specialist, and Ian Campbell, director-general of
the Institute of Export, spoke at each forum. Others from KPMG Peat Marwick,
NatWest Treasury, and Laytons, specialists on export law, shared the task
between them.
Three 90-minute sessions were split between two 20-minute addresses by a
relevant expert and 50 minutes of questions. The format ensured audiences
were reasonably able to get what they wanted out of each day, with much of
the real learning coming from questions, answers and ensuing discussions.
Questions - and sometimes fierce arguments - ensued about such topics as:
registration for VAT in other EU countries;
appealing against customs decisions in the UK and abroad, particularly in
Japan;
whether the banks are greedy or not;
why companies dare not tell their bank managers how much export debt is
hidden in their overdrafts;
foreign currency accounts;
the role of correspondent banks;
problems over letters of credit (90 per cent of which are wrong on first
presentation);
the variable speed of monetary transmission through the world banking
system;
the shortage of credit insurance for exports to placers such as Mexico,
Tunisia and China;
how to trade in non-convertible currencies;
the cost and implications of changes to UK agency law;
the usefulness or otherwise of government departments and agencies;
how to do basic market research abroad - and many other topics more specific
to individual companies.
NatWest's senior managers, who attended each seminar in force, were uneasy
at what emerged, since it not only revealed widespread ignorance among some
of its customers, but also among branch managers.
By the time the London and Belfast forums were taking place, Andy Nemes was
already assuring audiences that training programmes for bank managers and
other staff would take lessons learned into account to try and improve
things in the future.
To me, as the person responsible for getting the questions out of the
audiences and answered properly, without evasion, by the experts, it seemed
clear that much export policy and supporting services - including the
media's own coverage - is sometimes too erudite.
While this may be fine for big companies which have experts of their own,
many medium-sized and smaller companies - the bulk of business and, indeed,
exporters - need a much more 'nuts and bolts' approach, with lots of 'how
to' information and simple explanations of the implications of trade and
foreign policy, changes in the law, and European union, for their finances.
International trade appears to be a minefield for most managers. The advice
they can get from their banks and the government is patchy in quality, and
sometimes wrong.
Although the experts at each forum knew their stuff and generally proved
well able to help, other members of the audience often gave better answers
and more practical advice.
For example, a good way of doing business in a non-convertible east European
currency may well be to open an account with one of the main Austrian banks
in Vienna. These banks have long experience of successful trade with the
former Soviet bloc countries around them and how to help their customers
finance it.
This course might well not be recommended by a British clearing bank because
it would lose business in doing so. Even trying to arrange things through a
UK bank with its Viennese correspondent bank might not work. At one forum an
exporter said that his most effective approach had been to open the relevant
account with the Viennese bank's branch in London, which then treated it as
though it were based in Austria.
Other exporters had useful advice on the foreign currency issue: open the
account with your bank's branch in the country where the currency is legal
tender; that is, New York for dollars, Frankfurt for marks, and so on. If
your bank has not got a branch, use the relevant correspondent bank in the
country concerned.
Generally, the need is for export education and training. Ian Campbell sees
the Institute of Export playing an increasingly important role in this,
particularly as regards industry and commerce recognising the institute's
own exams and training programmes more widely.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (26): Three in front but it's Bonas by a nose -
Why one of the world's top pharmaceuticals companies was pipped at the post
by a small textile machinery maker in northeast England / Natwest/FT
Exporter competition results

It was almost a three-way dead heat. The mighty Zeneca Pharmaceuticals - the
former ICI drugs business - looked as though it was going to win the first
NatWest/FT Exporter award for export excellence when it was pipped at the
post in a last round of point scoring.
The winner was Bonas Machine Company, a textile machinery manufacturer in
north-east England, but by only half a percentage point over Richardson
Sheffield, the well-known kitchen knife maker.
'I'm sorry anyone had to lose at all,' Ian Campbell, chairman of the judges
and director-general of the Institute of Export, said afterwards, 'but there
could only be one outright winner.'
The competition was organised by National Westminster Bank, FT Exporter and
the Institute of Export. The seven finalists were all winners of regional
heats, announced at the series of forums held in London, Belfast,
Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle during October and
November.
These export awards were different. Unlike most prizes in the exports field,
neither the size of a company's export order book nor rapid growth in
foreign markets were necessarily qualifications to win.
Independent assessors from the Institute of Export, NatWest and KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm, rated the finalists on efficiency,
innovation, training, quality control, and whether exporting was part of
each company's main thrust, rather than a bolt-on function.
This enabled very small companies such as Magstim - which makes medical
instruments in Dyfed, South Wales, and has only a Pounds 1m turnover - to
compete equally with Zeneca, the north-west winner, or Richardson Sheffield,
which has annual sales of more than Pounds 25m.
Another small-sized finalist was Valpar Industrial of Bangor, County Down,
the Northern Ireland winner. It turns over only Pounds 3m, selling a cooling
system which ensures beverages like lager, beer or cola stay cold between
store-room and tap. The other two finalists were Apollo Fire Detectors, the
Hampshire-based London regional winner, and Staffordshire Tableware, which
claims to be the world's largest mug manufacturer, winner of the Midlands
prize.
Bonas received its award at a dinner in London from Baroness Chalker, the
overseas development minister, Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, and David
Bell, chief executive of the FT.
Mr Campbell said: 'The excellence awards were designed to test exporting
philosophy and ethos in depth, rather than just acknowledge turnover and
profit. Bonas demonstrated extensive customer contact, new product
introduction, staff training and an attempt to raise standards year on
year.'
Bonas, which was founded in 1957, is based in Team Valley, Gateshead, and
has offices in Charlotte - in the US - Hong Kong, Bombay, Frankfurt and
Milan. It makes electronic jacquards - devices attached to looms that enable
figures to be woven into fabrics.
With 383 employees worldwide, it exports to more than 75 countries, but
particularly to the US, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Italy and India. About
90 per cent of the present Pounds 35m of annual turnover is exported.
Mr Gordon Bridge, chief executive of Richardson Sheffield, was disappointed
at losing by 65 per cent to 64.4 per cent but said coming so close would
only inspire the company to try harder next time.
Richardson came top in three of the five categories - innovation, education
and thrust. Bonas was top in efficiency and quality, but was equal second
with Zeneca for education and third on thrust. Richardson's chances were
spoiled by a third place on efficiency and an equal fourth in the quality
category, where only 3.5 points out of 18 separated the seven contestants.
Zeneca won no category outright, but was second or third in four of them and
fourth in the remaining one. The final scores were decided by marks out of
10 for overall impression - a subjective measure, but one where the judges
were rightly called on to display some judgment. Valpar and Apollo scored
equally with Zeneca here, while Magstim and Staffordshire tied just one
point behind. This meant, in effect, that none of the finalists did badly,
as might be expected from companies which had already beaten off strong
regional challenges to reach the last - and necessarily merciless - stage of
judging.
All said just entering was worthwhile in itself, since it forced critical
self-examination. In Zeneca's case, senior managers used it as a means of
pulling their team together at a time when the business was establishing
itself, after ICI split its 'bio' and 'non-bio' businesses last year.
The most interesting individual exporting story came from Magstim, last but
no means least of the finalists. As a Welshman, Robin Davies, the
international sales director, naturally has Welsh as one of his languages.
Had he ever sold in Welsh? Well, yes. He was making a presentation to senior
doctors in a Canadian hospital when one of them, in exile from Wales for 25
years, asked him a question in Welsh. Davies replied in kind and the
discussion continued in the language. The order was clinched on the strength
of it.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (24): A rude awakening in Britain - European law
on of commercial agents is finally in force in the UK. But many companies
have been slow to grasp the changes and, in doing so, have had a rude
awakening / European law and the UK / Commercial agents' status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Since January 1, commercial agents throughout the European Union have never
had it so good. That was the date the UK became the last EU country to
implement a 1986 directive harmonising agency law.
The changes relate to people or companies selling goods on commission.
Suddenly, all such agents in Europe have comparable levels of job security,
rights under law and compensation for loss of office to those enjoyed by
employees - and possibly better. In many cases, they are now entitled to be
paid commission before their principal has been paid by the customer.
They also have more right to inspect a principal's books than the
principal's employees or shareholders. The changes fit with the trend in the
last 30 years for European laws which formally protect the individual
against the state, corporation or any other institution with power to impose
upon people's lives.
Under old UK law, most agents had the thin end of the stick if anything went
wrong, facing costly legal process if they sought redress through the
courts. Other EU countries, however, have long since seen being an agent as
similar to employment, particularly if the agent was an individual.
The implications have taken a long time to sink in with many British
companies. Despite warnings from the Institute of Export and seminars run by
several leading commercial law firms, many senior managers have seen the
changes in the law as technical and nothing much to worry about.
When the message started getting through, therefore, it came as a shock.
There was telling evidence of this at the seven NatWest/FT Exporter meetings
held around the UK during the October and November. Lawyers from Laytons,
which specialises in export markets, elicited gasps of dismay and anxious
questioning from every audience. Articles in the FT since have brought many
phone calls and letters from disbelieving, sometimes anxious readers, who
have been urged to see their solicitors.
If the government believes it carried out a successful consultation process
on the new laws, this apparent ignorance throughout UK industry and commerce
should give pause for thought. Even the final form of the directive -
published two weeks before Christmas - complicated the regulations on
compensation for sacked agents and was sprung on industry too late for
amendments. The Institute of Export has protested to the DTI about
inadequate consultation. The root of the problem is that the DTI's consumer
affairs and small firms section handled the process - most agents are small
businesses - instead of the trade section, where more attention would have
been paid to exporters.
Many companies realised in the nick of time they should look carefully at
all existing agency agreements - including those in UK domestic markets -
tear them up if necessary, and take specialised legal advice to redraft and
agree them before January 1 so the new laws should operate fairly for both
sides if there is a dispute in future.
Michael Thornton, of the Manchester office of Laytons, is co-author of a new
edition of Schmitthoff's Agency and Distribution Law, which has been
published jointly by Sweet &amp; Maxwell and the Institute of Export at Pounds
26 to bring everyone up to date on the changes. He frightened many in the
audiences at the Leeds, Newcastle and Manchester forums when he spelled out
what they meant.
'Many companies don't want to spend money on their lawyers because we don't
come cheap,' he says. 'But the consequences of not doing so could be very
much more expensive. Many British sales managers have been content to
appoint agents on the basis of an oral agreement and handshake or at most an
exchange of letters. This may be OK, but not if there is a disagreement, and
especially not now.
'The law is now codified and weighted much more towards the agent. The
cheapest option is to get things as right as possible from the outset
because it will be much more expensive if you end up in dispute later,' Mr
Thornton says.
For any companies which have not yet realised the potential problems, it is
now probably too late to terminate existing agency agreements and start
again without buying their way out if they cannot obtain mutual consent.
Agents are now protected against being unilaterally fired. Since January 1,
they have been entitled to one month's average commission for each year they
have acted for a principal, up to a three-month maximum if they sue in the
UK, up to seven months if they operate in Italy and take action there.
This latter point emphasises one value of specifying in any agreement that
disputes will be dealt with under UK law. Now, if an agent suspects a
principal of secretly doing business directly with customers the agent
originally brought in, the agent can demand to inspect the principal's books
to check - and then claim commission on the sales. Even if an agency
agreement has been terminated, former agents can still claim for continuing
sales to any customers they introduced years before.
What has troubled many companies is the timing of payments of commission.
Under the new European law, commission is due when a transaction has been
completed, but 'completion' now means delivery of the goods, not when the
customer has paid. It can even mean when delivery should have been made: if
the principal is late on delivery, or puts the order to the back of the
queue to do something else, or even fails to deliver at all, the agent is
still entitled to commission from when the order would otherwise have been
completed. If the customer never pays, then a principal may be able to
demand repayment from an agent, but whether the debt turns out to be good or
bad, there are cash-flow implications for the principal.
Patrick Kelly, who is in charge of Layton's European practice in London,
also points out another serious potential problem. If an agent buys new
equipment, sets up an office or makes any other sort of capital investment
to carry out duties for his or her principal, then the principal now has to
pay any outstanding amortisation costs if the agency agreement ends. 'You
must be very careful about agreeing to your agent buying anything - even
though the agent pays - in order to carry out your agency agreement,' he
warns.
All of this assumes, of course, that things will eventually go wrong between
agent and principal. In many cases, they will not. Many principals have
happy, longstanding arrangements with agents that have worked to their
mutual benefit for years. Nevertheless, this did not stop many companies
from tearing up all their agency agreement worldwide before January 1 and
starting afresh by codifying and standardising their own approach.
This process of re-evaluation has generally been beneficial all round, often
strengthening relationships with good agents and improving prospects. In
some cases, agents have been dropped because companies have decided agency
is not the best way to carry on. Others, though, have been taken on as
employees, or offered distribution agreements instead. This has appealed
where regular sales of relatively low-value items have been involved.
Distributors take risks where agents do not - they pay for goods and take
title to them, assuming responsibility for bad debts in the process. Agents
earn commission, do not take title to the goods they sell and bear no risk
from bad debts. Distributors make their money by selling for higher prices
than they themselves paid for the good they took.
Lawyers say the problem with many agency agreements is that they are made by
sales managers, often without legal advice, and with no assessment of
downside financial risks for the company as a whole. Solicitors say they
must be part of mainstream general management's function, with vetting of
agreements, whether in-house or bought-in.
One company at a NatWest/FT Exporter forum woke up to this, but had no
budget for it in 1993. It has made a provision for next year's budget, which
runs from April - too late for the December 31 deadline when the cheapest
option expired.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (23): Mobilising the export armies - Following
the birth of the North American free trade area, the US commerce department
is exhorting Americans to boost exports with all the fervour of a war
recruitment drive / Government promotion / United States

The management of Counter Technology Inc., a Maryland security services and
technology company with 200 employees, had given little thought to exporting
even though its Mexican-American owners were interested in the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
'Nafta was just pie in the sky until we got approached by Commerce,' said Mr
Julian Martinez, a company spokesman. 'We felt we had barely penetrated the
domestic market, so we couldn't see going off to another country. Now I'm
glad we did.'
Under Export Mexico, one of the US government's numerous export promotion
schemes, Counter Technology was invited to be part of a delegation of US
minority-owned companies exhibiting in a trade show in Mexico. Company
representatives were thoroughly briefed about their prospects and given
appointments with likely customers in Mexico.
'The door was half way open for us. It opened our eyes to other
possibilities,' Mr Martinez said. The company is now studying two lucrative
opportunities - with the US embassy in Mexico and a Mexican airline.
Hundreds more small and medium size businesses - which once would never have
considered expanding beyond the US market - are being prodded to export by
the Commerce Department. Its Secretary, Mr Ron Brown, the former Democratic
party chief, seems personally to have taken over the Administration's
mantra: 'exports exports exports ..'
Commerce secretaries have long preached government-business partnerships and
the necessity of boosting small business exports. But Mr Brown and his
colleagues spent their first year in office preparing to make good on the
talk.
One of the Secretary's first acts was to convene a Trade Promotion
Coordinating Committee (TPCC), a group authorised by law during the Bush
Administration, which largely ignored the statute. Mr Brown, however, saw
the TPCC as his opportunity to play a prominent role in trade policy.
He appointed Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, to
chair a TPCC working group, and together in September they presented 60
specific recommendations for improving US export promotion programmes. Since
then, the two men have methodically set about instituting the proposals.
As a result, high technology companies, shackled for years by stringent
export controls, have been liberated. Export finance has been increased.
Export promotion programmes spread across 19 government agencies are being
strengthened and coordinated.
'Our government is stepping up in a way it hasn't before to help US
companies create and maintain jobs by being export winners,' says Mr Brody.
One TPCC priority is to make government aid easily available to novice
exporters, who might never otherwise find their way through the labyrinth of
government schemes.
This month and next Eximbank, Commerce, the Small Business Administration
and other agencies are rolling out the first four of a string of 'one stop
shops' to be located in major cities around the country. Eventually all
domestic field offices related to federal trade programmes will be
consolidated, located with other private and state export programmes and
their computer capacity upgraded. Information for programmes such as Export
Mexico will be disseminated along with other 'how to' data.
Export data are also available through the Commerce Department's new Trade
Information Centre, which has been receiving more than 1,000 calls a week
over its toll free telephone number. In response to requests, the centre's
'punch in' telefax has been churning out pages of information on the Uruguay
Round, Nafta and environmental technology trade (another new specialised
trade programme scheme).
US business finds even more on offer for the Export Mexico programme:
counselling from desk officers from the Office of Mexico in Washington;
export specialists from the US and Foreign Commercial Service to help
develop market strategies; and, for a price, customised market surveys, a
service providing credit and financial information about Mexican companies,
and government-organised trade missions.
In Mexico City, the Commerce Department has a US Trade Centre and library.
It has posts in Guadalajara and Monterrey. To help neophyte traders feel
more at home, the Commerce Department has set up a Gold Key Service which
for Dollars 350 for the first day arranges appointments with pre-qualified
potential Mexican agents, distributors and business associates; provides
interpreters and assistants and meeting spaces.
The US Small Business Administration has expanded its own programmes for
exporters. Minority owned companies can get loan guarantees. An Export
Revolving Line of Credit loan guarantee programme can be used to finance
labour and materials for manufacturing and wholesaling for export, to
finance foreign accounts receivable or to penetrate foreign markets.
For all the activity, there has not yet been a pay-off in export statistics,
Administration officials acknowledge. But unquestionably the US now is
gearing up for competition in a way it once prepared for wars and the space
programme. In the end, the investment will pay off handsomely.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (21): Putting out more flags - The DTI is
coopting 100 businessmen to aid it in boosting exports. If the drive fails
the private sector concedes that it will have to share the blame /
Government promotion / United Kingdom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The chorus from British exporters has been very much the same for most of
the past decade: Government neither understands their needs, nor listens to
their views on how they might best be helped.
Until about 18 months ago, that is. Since then, the shared aim of Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, his
terrier-like trade minister, has been to get industry working alongside
Whitehall to define the country's export strategies.
Perhaps the most potent and ambitious departure has been the 'export
promoter' initiative. Moving beyond the idea of consulting industry leaders,
export organisations and chambers of commerce, the Department of Trade and
Industry is in the process of recruiting business executives to work inside
government - 100 of them, most on two-year secondment. 'We have virtually
doubled our export promotion capacity overnight. We're thrilled about it,'
said one senior DTI official.
But will industry have reason to be similarly thrilled? What role are these
seconded troubleshooters expected to play? How will their 'successes' be
measured? How well equipped are they to advise small and medium-sized UK
companies when their career experience has been inside large multinationals?
The initiative, launched by Mr Michael Heseltine early last year, is one of
a number of recent government innovations aimed at sharpening Britain's
export effort. At a stroke, it has provided a means for the government to
harness the knowledge and skills of UK industrialists, and silenced industry
complaints that the government never listens to it.
Nine months into the programme, just 60 of the 100 export promoters have
been recruited from the ranks of the UK's top 100 companies: 'Recruitment
has gone slower than we expected, but we have been pleased with the quality
of executives seconded,' says Ms Helen Deas, who is responsible for the
Export Promoter scheme at the DTI: 'I had some doubts about whether industry
would release top people, but I have been pleasantly surprised.'
The task of defining a particular export promoter's role has been difficult.
For large countries such as the US or Japan, a team of export promoters has
been brought together, each specialising in a particular industrial sector.
For smaller markets such as Thailand or Turkey, one export promoter faces
the task of becoming a 'jack of all export trades', regardless of his or her
corporate background.
All promoters are expected to have a deep working knowledge of the market
for which they are responsible, and to have spent a considerable amount of
time working there. Regions hardest to find candidates for have been China,
South America and the former Soviet Union - no doubt because companies are
reluctant to release staff in these key growth areas where rare language
skills are needed.
Beyond that, the problem likely to face export promoters has been one of
having too much freedom to define their role rather than too little: 'It is
clear that they need to be team players, but they have to build on, rather
than compete with, what we have already got either in the DTI, or in
embassies overseas,' one DTI official said. 'There is nothing to stop an
export promoter from completely redefining an area: it is their initiative,
energy and enthusiasm that will drive the programme forward.'
For Peter Jenning, seconded in February from the chemicals group Siebe to
work on boosting exports of environmental products and services to the US
market, this has involved mobilising UK consulates across the US to complete
a study of the Dollars 120bn north American environmental services market.
It has also involved careful thought about the sort of British company that
might look seriously to the US: 'The UK environmental services industry is
still immature by comparison with US industry, which has been structured by
strong environmental legislation,' Mr Jenning said: 'It has been a matter of
finding innovative companies and bringing them forward.' His third
initiative has been to examine export opportunities arising from the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which has committed considerable funds to
cleaning up the environment along the industrially-polluted US-Mexico
border.
'We have to convince industry that this is not just another series of
fruitless exercises,' he said: 'In some areas, the reputation of the DTI is
not that good.'
Peter Bacon, seconded from Philips to concentrate on Japan's electronics
sector, is adopting a different tack: helping UK components manufacturers to
penetrate the UK-based subsidiaries of Japanese companies such as Sony,
Panasonic or Mitsubishi.
'Many Japanese companies may operate in the UK, but are headquartered in
Japan, with most decisions taken there,' he notes: 'When design is done in
Japan, and many components chosen at the design stage, we have to find ways
of influencing thinking in Tokyo before we can succeed in supplying their
UK-based offshoots.'
He plans to use his own market knowledge, and that of UK mission staff in
Japan, to improve access to decision makers in Japan - not to win export
orders (at least initially), but to replace imports: to demonstrate that UK
companies can supply Japanese subsidiaries operating in the UK and Europe
more effectively and reliably than component-makers based in Japan.
By contrast the first priority of Ian Paterson, seconded from Thorn as
export promoter for Singapore and Malaysia, has been to draw up 'sellers'
guides' to key growth sectors in Malaysia. In contrast to DTI efforts, he
sees his role as 'specific action- and deal-oriented  .. we have learned
that the DTI has much more information available than most companies are
aware of. They could often hit the ground running just by using the
information that's available here.'
Starting from sector overviews drawn up by British embassy staff in
Malaysia, Mr Paterson's 'sellers' guides' are intended to be hands-on 'how
to' guides for sectors ranging from transport, power, oil and gas, and
telecommunications to water and health services.
All three promoters dismissed concern that their 'big industry' experience
left them ill-equipped to appreciate the problems of small and medium-sized
exporters: 'Most big companies are aggregations of small operating units,'
said Ian Paterson.
Measuring the success of the export promoter initiative is likely to be a
complex matter. In very few cases will a company clearly attribute a sale,
or establishment of a foothold in a market, to a promoter. Gains may only be
made over a long period. DTI officials acknowledge the speciousness of
measuring success in terms of the number of trade missions arranged, or the
number of executives on a particular mission, but are at a loss to offer
alternatives: 'It is for export promoters - and their energy and enthusiasm
 -to drive the initiative forward,' one noted.
To provide focus, promoters may draw on DTI 'market plans' for the UK's top
80 export markets: 'It is the forecasts of these plans that will drive DTI
desk staff, embassy staff in the field, area advisory groups, and export
promoters,' one explained. Promoters will also answer to 'god-fathers' -
heads of the DTI's various area advisory groups. For the head of the
European group, that will mean integrating 20 export promoters into his
department's operations - a formidable management challenge.
Whether the export promoter initiative generates new exports or not, its
ultimate virtue might lay elsewhere. First it will make companies better
aware of the DTI's services, and the help it can offer exporters. Perhaps
most important, it undermines the basis for industry complaints that
government is to be blamed if exporters fail. One industrialist conceded:
'If in future we fail to win export orders, we will have no-one to blame but
ourselves'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (22): Whitehall plays the marriage broker - A
scheme to arrange suitable matches between UK companies and potential
overseas partners / The DTI'S Strategic alliance scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We have made three attempts to get involved in the US market, and none of
them has worked,' says David Lever, managing director of Stampiton, a small
private company in Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire which makes self-adhesive
labels.
For him, the UK government's newly-launched 'strategic alliance' scheme has
been a godsend. As he enters stage four of this five-module programme,
intended to find his company a US partner, he comments: 'Previously, we
didn't feel we quite had the right contacts. Now, we are getting straight to
the people who could really be interested.'
The strategic alliance scheme is one of a number of radical export promotion
initiatives taken by Britain's department of trade and industry early in
1993. The scheme is subsidised by the government, but managed and operated
by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy and management consultancy group. It is
aimed at companies employing fewer than 500 people, with a turnover of
between Pounds 5m-Pounds 50m.
Stampiton is one of 50 UK companies which, the government hopes, will be
targeted each year under the scheme. So far, about half that number have
joined. If the scheme works as an effective matchmaker, it will increase
exports and foreign earnings from a market which many UK companies find
complicated and daunting.
Tony Ellam, who was seconded in June from National Westminster Bank as an
export promoter to oversee the strategic alliance scheme, notes: 'Companies
don't realise the size and complexity of the US market. This scheme is cost
effective both in terms of time and money. To set up in the US oneself will
take a lot of time, and can be hit-or-miss. To employ a consultant from the
outset would be prohibitively expensive for many small and medium-sized
companies.'
Sheila McGregor, director at London's City and Guilds Institute, would
wholly endorse Mr Ellam's views: 'I wish we had had the strategic alliance
programme when we set up in the US,' she mourns.
She admits that the institute (which owns the Pitman Examinations Institute
specialising in teaching shorthand, as well as specialising in educational
assessment and standards) effectively chose a partner because the US company
approached it. She recalls a list of errors which eventually led the
institute to put their own executive in the US to sort matters out: 'Now,
two years after putting in our own executive, we are making great strides,
but it has been an expensive way of finding out.'
Even now she is keen to join the strategic alliance scheme - potentially to
start afresh with a US partner.
After selecting an applicant company as a suitable potential participant,
Price Waterhouse conducts an initial business strategy review with each
selected company. After this second 'module', most companies will move on to
prepare an 'alliance proposal' - a document circulated to potential partners
which describes strategic aims, but not the identity of the UK company.
Stage four involves Price Waterhouse staff across the US, bringing together
details of three or four US companies, and ranking them in terms of
potential suitability as partners.
In the final, fifth, module, Price Waterhouse will introduce the UK company
to up to three potential partners. Here the scheme ends, approximately 44
weeks after initial acceptance.
At Stampiton, Mr Lever has just entered module four. Over the Christmas
break, Price Waterhouse delivered its report identifying potential US
partners: 'We have now reached the exciting stage,' he comments. He is
excited not just because of the speed with which he has reached this stage,
but because Price Waterhouse have been able to trawl a much wider range of
potential partners than Stampiton could have managed alone.
Even more critically, potential US partners have taken the approach
seriously because it has been filtered both through Price Waterhouse and the
UK government: 'Our approach carries much more authority because of going
through the vetting process. Our bona fides have already been established
with the potential US partner,' Mr Lever says.
The scheme has not been free: each company will pay a total of Pounds 14,000
if it goes through each of the five modules. But this is considerably
cheaper than would have been possible without the government scheme.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (20): New Year shakeup in Europe - The
deregulation of Europe's haulage rates is a boon to exporters. But truckers
claim it will put the skids under them / Distribution in Europe / Truckers'
dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any German entrepreneurs considering New Year resolutions will know that one
is not to become a haulier. Deregulation of the country's trucking business
was to come into force this month and could cause mayhem, especially among
smaller operators, as rates are predicted to fall by up to 30 per cent.
Until now, the industry has been protected by the government, which set
fines for shippers seeking discounts or transportation companies giving
them.
Whilst this staggered dismantling of protection will be good news for
shippers, who will be able to buy their transportation more cheaply, it is
likely to wreak havoc among truckers already contending with an economy in
recession.
As if that were not enough, they will still have to continue to fight off
competition from hauliers in the Netherlands, who are recognised as being
the most innovative and entrepreneurial truckers in Europe.
The Dutch internal market is small but a big proportion of GDP is accounted
for by transportation. The industry gets strong government support,
including what are said to be the most lenient internal regulations
concerning size and weight limits.
The government also actively promotes the Netherlands as a European
distribution centre, making much of the fact that if a 500-kilometre radius
circle were drawn around Amsterdam it would contain 70 per cent of Europe's
GNP.
Like Belgium, the Netherlands transport industry also benefits from the
presence of the European head offices of many multi-nationals. Forty-six per
cent of them are in one of these countries.
Some companies have Benelux distribution centres, but the practice is fairly
uncommon. They generally use either Belgium or The Netherlands and, once
again, the Dutch benefit in that the majority of those head offices are in
Holland.
An increasing number of companies are clearly adopting a pan-European
outlook, using regional distribution centres. Brian Bolam, managing director
of TNT Contract Logistics (Europe), based in England and the Netherlands,
said, 'Despite European governments' lack of progress in developing the
market as a single entity, businessmen are making it happen. Competition has
made companies seek economies of scale.'
Scandinavia has been particularly resourceful in this respect with the
creation of Nordic Distribution Centres. Now it is planned to have a similar
centre in the EU to service Scandinavian trade within the Single Market. The
location is still undecided, although it is likely to be in Denmark.
Industry experts first have to consider the 'physical flows', ie, a study of
inbound and outbound deliveries, looking at where they would be coming from
and where they would be going.
But, as the system of regional distribution centres spreads, another
development is also occurring: specialisation. David Howes, managing
director of Christian Salvesen Distribution, which has a pan- European
network, said that, increasingly, the bigger companies in his field were
setting up centres to cater for particular products.
They already exist for food, textiles, industrial products and hi-tech
goods, and Christian Salvesen itself has five centres in Belgium and Holland
set up just to handle frozen and chilled foods. Howes believes that
exporters approaching four or five multi-national operators for a quote
should also be asking about their particular strengths.
Among countries with the biggest distribution problems are Ireland and
France. Ireland is a major centre for selling into mainland Europe largely
because of the number of big US companies that set up there attracted by
subsidies. But, because of the country's geographical location, distribution
is a problem.
Some companies based there have now established central European depots with
a number of satellite warehouses. Final shipments are then made in dedicated
vehicles or by express carriers.
However, among smaller companies, it is often still the practice to book a
'backload' to the continent.
France's problem is that it has an unwieldy and fragmented trucking industry
consisting of 35,000 operators, most of them with fewer than five trucks.
No other European nation has so many operators and if the industry is to be
truly competitive it may have to be less nationalistic in outlook. Its
future lies in joint ventures with operators in other countries or, at
least, looking for more cross-border business.
Exporters in Spain, Portugal, Greece and even Italy are hampered by the
distances their goods have to travel to central Europe and operators know
that return loads are not always easy to find.
Shippers take advantage of the fact that, at the time of the Spanish orange
harvest, when the fruit has been brought north, some operators will sell
southbound carriage for next to nothing.
Trade to and from Italy is also affected by hardening attitudes towards
hauliers in Austria and Switzerland. Both countries have become increasingly
fed up at being used as arterial highways and have imposed a number of
restrictions on night time and weekend driving and the size and weight of
trucks.
One of the most effective and advanced countries where distribution is
concerned is Britain. Knowledge of regional distribution was gained in the
UK more than 20 years ago thanks to the policy of the big supermarket
chains, which hit on the whole concept of centralised inventory holding and
frequent deliveries to their retail outlets.
But more than a highly-sharpened expertise in regional distribution will be
required in Europe as it heads towards the next millennium. Freight traffic
within the EC alone is forecast to grow by 40 per cent by the end of the
decade and the present infrastructure is already groaning.
But, as Brian Bolam of TNT points out, 'it takes 15 years to take a mile of
railway from thought to actuality'. So time is not on the side of the
European transport industry.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (18): Dried milk for Egypt's onions - Helen
Mingay describes some of the intricate multilateral deals, involving several
countries, pulled off by international traders / Countertrade focus / Trends
in east-west trade

Six years ago, David Little had 15 colleagues dealing with countertrade. Now
he sits alone, holding the title of managing director of countertrade at
Rank Xerox, but managing and directing just himself.
Before the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, Rank Xerox organised
extensive countertrade transactions in the area, particularly in Poland and
Bulgaria. However, political and economic changes across eastern Europe have
resulted in Rank Xerox establishing a network of dealers covering the entire
region, who sell and service copying machines on conventional commercial
terms.
There have been a few countertrade deals in Romania, but generally Rank
Xerox has found that the east European purchasers are able to provide hard
currency to purchase their machines. 'We have had an extremely good year,'
says Mr Little. 'Our sales have gone up dramatically, well over what we
planned.'
Even in Romania, where there is a chronic shortage of hard currency, Rank
Xerox finds that buyers are often somehow able to convert their money
locally into hard currency. There are always exceptions. Rank Xerox has, for
example, arranged countertrade agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,
where it made counterpurchases of raw cotton as the basis of payment for
copying machines.
Maurice Banfield, formerly of Rank Xerox Kazakhstan office, described the
project as being '60 per cent goodwill and 40 per cent for profit'.
Meanwhile the food company Salads Etcetera Holdings has set up complex
arrangements in Poland, which meet its individual needs.
The company, based near Hull, is setting up an office in Warsaw, and expects
to export Pounds 10m of produce in the next two or three years. Although the
Poles will pay in hard currency for some of the products, managing director
Paul Wright has been able to expand the size of the contract by securing
countertrade arrangements.
Salads Etcetera has contracts with Egyptian suppliers, who ship salad
onions, new potatoes and oranges to the UK. Egypt needs to buy milk powder,
and Mr Wright has arranged for Polish producers to supply the Egyptian
market with dried milk powder in exchange for UK products.
This arrangement allows the UK company to make full use of its transport
fleet. Lorries will drive to Poland full of salad produce and return with
dried milk powder. Vessels then leave Hull for Egypt laden with milk powder
and return to the UK with Egyptian produce.
'We are interested in developing a serious long-term business in Poland,'
says Mr Wright. 'We have the technical expertise to help the Poles. If we
did not have a market for the products we could not do it. The Egyptians are
required to buy the milk powder, and we are also very interested in
developing some business there.'
Mr Wright is looking to develop further business in Poland, possibly through
joint ventures and in other areas of the food distribution business. He adds
that the initial contract has full financial guarantees. The Polish office
is seen as a springboard for business in other east European countries,
particularly Ukraine, which has large-scale capacity in salad production, as
well as Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.
Currency instability in the countries of the former Soviet Union has also
fuelled some countertrade in the region. Over the past two years, Russian
businessmen have organised the exchange of aluminium for sugar and
countertrade in raw materials, such as titanium, bauxite and timber. Many of
these commodities found their way out to the west through the extremely
porous Baltic borders. The Russian government has increased border controls,
and as the stockpiles of these materials diminish, supplies could begin to
dry up.
Bill Newman, assistant general manager at Moscow Narodny Bank, pointed out
that western bank deposits from the former Soviet Union doubled last year
from Dollars 9.1bn to a recorded Dollars 17.9bn in June 1993. 'My personal
guess is that most of that is legal', he says. 'In the past hard currency
was retained outside illegally, but now people can put it into bank accounts
in Russia. If they stabilise the rouble, then I think the money would go
back quite quickly as investment.'
Illegal or not, the scale of this outside investment indicates that hard
currency has been generated, which should reduce the need for countertrade
in the future.
Meanwhile, Moscow Narodny Bank has been instrumental in organising an
innovative countertrade deal with Russia secured by the British Health Care
Consortium, under the chairmanship of Sir Ronald McIntosh in Ekaterinburg.
After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Sir Ronald saw opportunities for
financing required imports to resource-rich regions, through the sale of
local commodities.
Export licences have to be acquired for such exports, but the consortium
deals directly with the Urals regional government, rather than going through
Moscow. The collapse of the Soviet Union means that local enterprises do not
have to send all their output to fulfil state procurement orders as in the
past.
This was where Moscow Narodny bank came in. The bank advises on the
selection of the most saleable products, obtains the most advantageous
prices and handles the hard currency management on behalf of the regional
government. The consortium, is then paid through the hard currency generated
by the sale of precious minerals and metals.
Mr Newman says that the bank is now trying to broaden the allocation of
goods to service the contract for 1994, as stockpiles of the non-ferrous
metals are beginning to run down. The bank has gained the regional
government's trust and is able to secure the best prices for their goods
because of the expertise in the market, he says. The consortium consists of
six core companies: Glaxo, Wellcome, Zeneca Pharma, Amersham International,
Smiths Industries Medical Systems and Vickers Medical, which also does
business elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, on their own behalf.
For instance, Glaxo does limited countertrade in other countries in the
region, but generally through a third party. Jane Penn, the operations
manager for the consortium says that the group is now discussing new
contracts in the Greater Urals and Kazakhstan and will be venturing into
Eastern Siberia this year.
But problems arise when organising countertrade. The British Food
Consortium, for example, has attempted to instigate contracts in Ukraine, to
be paid for by the export of steel, but it was unable to by-pass internal
supply problems. Now the group is looking at three regions in Russia and
also in Kazakhstan, where it hopes to establish contracts on a similar basis
to those enjoyed by the British Healthcare Consortium.
Countertrade is still used for trade between east European countries, but
the collapse of the Soviet Union has led to severe difficulties. At the
Hungarian International Bank's countertrade subsidiary in Budapest, Hibex,
an official confirms that deals are scarce. 'We do get enquiries for spare
parts, but when we ask if they can pay or exchange a commodity, then there
is no answer,' he says. 'It is very difficult to obtain reliable offers.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (19): Long price freeze bears fruit - Sweden's
top maker of office furniture has outgrown its home market and pins its
future on overseas expansion / Exporter Profile / Kinnarps of Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away in what was once a small village from which the company took its
name, Kinnarps, Sweden's leading manufacturer of office furniture, was for
years content to concentrate on its home market and Norway.
But just as the company's huge 93,000 sq metre factory has expanded to
dominate the village in the countryside 120km east of Gothenberg, so
Kinnarps (pronounced Shinnarps) has outgrown its domestic market and is now
embarking on a big export drive to sustain growth and competitiveness.
The crunch came with the sharp Swedish recession of the past three years.
Before then, a booming economy, in which commercial property raced up in
value, allowed Kinnarps to more than double annual sales from SKr415m in
1985 to SKr875m in 1990. Since then Kinnarps, a private company still owned
by the family that founded it 50 years ago, weathered the slump better than
many.
Despite a 50 per cent drop in the office furniture market in Sweden over the
past three years, Kinnarps used its financial strength to good effect. By
freezing prices for four consecutive years, it has increased its market
share in Sweden, kept sales on an upward trend and stayed in profit.
But the days when Kinnarps had a return on capital of approaching 30 per
cent and won an award (in 1987) as the best company in Sweden, have long
gone. The impressively automated factory, with more than two-dozen
driverless robotic fork-lift trucks criss-crossing the plant from delivery
area, to assembly to despatch, is only working at about 50 per cent
capacity.
The strategy has therefore become crystal-clear. 'Our future expansion must
be outside Sweden, because this is a limited market,' says Mr Soren Persson,
brought in in mid-1993 to direct the new export drive. Mr Henry Jarlsson,
the chief executive and eldest son of the founders Jarl and Evy Andersson,
says: 'We will concentrate on Europe where deliveries can be made from the
factory here. We like to ship direct to the customers where we can. The UK,
France and Germany will be the main centres. That is where we have to be
very, very strong. Around these we will serve the other countries.'
The aim is that exports should account for 50 per cent of turnover - which
last year totalled around SKr1bn - within five years, compared with 30 per
cent today. To do that, Kinnarps needs to take a three per cent market share
in Europe. 'We aim to be one of the leading actors in the office furniture
market in Europe in five years - and no company will have as big a share of
their home markets as Kinnarps in Sweden and Norway,' says Mr Persson.
Kinnarps' selling points are its expertise in wooden and
ergonomically-developed furniture, its 'green' production and its office
planning service.
Kinnarps has a long-established outlet outside Sweden and Norway - in
Britain.
Kinnarps UK is separately owned from the mother company in Sweden but has
been selling Kinnarps products for 20 years, accounting for the bulk of
existing exports. That is set to continue, but Kinnarps is setting up
wholly-owned sales operations in France and Germany.
Kinnarps admits that its strategy is expensive, especially in the the
initial stages. Mr Jarlsson says the company is spending between SKr50m and
SKr100m a year on development costs, including keeping its production at the
forefront of technological development. But the company has eschewed
acquisition or franchising as the way to expand abroad because it wants to
keep full control of its operations, from manufacture to customer service.
As Kinnarps undertakes its export drive, it provides an interesting insight
into the regulatory climate now facing Swedish companies as they seek to
move into European markets. From January 1 this year, Sweden - along with
fellow Efta members Norway, Finland, Iceland and Austria - gained freer
access to European Union markets through the Efta-EU European Economic Area
agreement.
Kinnarps says this has provided immediate benefits. One is that it is much
easier and cheaper to base Swedish staff around EU centres, thanks to the
free labour movement section of the EEA deal. Mr Jarlsson says the time and
costs involved in securing work and residence permits for expatriate staff
were significant.
Another big potential bonus is the right now gained for Swedish companies to
bid for public sector contracts in EU countries. Last year, Kinnarps
achieved the first of these for the company when it won a contract to fit
out the British Department of Health offices in London. It hopes more public
contracts will now follow.
Until Sweden's application for full EU membership is successful, however,
Kinnarps faces the barrier of customs bureaucracy which its EU-based
competitors do not. The cost of completing customs documentation amounts to
between one and two per cent of export value, according to Mr Persson, a
figure that translates into a weighty SKr10bn a year for Swedish industry as
a whole.
Aside from that, Kinnarps chief concern over export costs is the diversity
of standards application across the EU. In line with most manufacturers in
Europe, the company looks forward to the day when standards are harmonised
within the EEA.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (17): Vienna is still the crossroads - In an
echo of its past, Vienna is still the cradle of numerous bizarre barter
arrangements between eastern and western Europe, and far beyond /
Countertrade focus / Austria's pivotal role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When Gerhard Vogt heard that Indonesia was planning to use countertrade to
boost its exports, he got on the first flight to Jakarta.
He arranged a meeting with the trade minister, presented his credentials,
retired to the Austrian embassy and two days later drew up a countertrade
proposal which was very quickly transformed almost word for word into
Indonesia's counter trade legislation.
That happened in the early 1980s and since then Centrobank, where Vogt heads
the board of directors, has cornered most of the booming countertrade
business in Indonesia and nearby Malaysia.
Mr Vogt followed a long line of Viennese bankers who for decades have been
among the acknowledged masters of countertrade in all its many variations.
Vienna's countertraders learnt their skills in the years after World War Two
when product clearing became the standard form of business between east and
west at a time when cash remained in short supply and Communist economies
needed plant and know-how to rebuild their industries.
Straddling the divide between western clients and Comecon producers
desperate to improve their export statistics, Viennese trade-oriented banks
worked as go-betweens constructing deals so fanciful that, in one case, rock
breaking machinery was sold to the former Soviet Union and oranges were
taken in payment.
Although Indonesia hardly fits neatly into eastern Europe, Mr Vogt's
experience in prising open eastern countertrade markets made him a natural
choice to assist Indonesia's trade minister. Other Viennese trading houses,
such as Bank Austria's Handelsbank, do business in Indonesia and other areas
of the Pacific, but Centrobank leads the way with up to Dollars 500m worth
of business per year, almost five times more than it used to do within the
former Comecon trading bloc.
While countertrading in Indonesia still involves straightforward barter
deals - an exporter may, for example, ship industrial plant and receive
payment in plywood - the trade with parts of Comecon have become more
complex on account of the higher risk.
While some business in eastern Europe and many parts of the Middle East is
still done through state-owned foreign trade associations, most of the
countertrade is driven by regions of the former Soviet Union. Alternatively,
they are single companies trying to break into western export markets or
trade within what used to be Comecon, but lacking marketing or financing
skills.
According to Helmuth Bohunovsky, a member of the managing board, Austria
Handelsbank, many deals are now pre-purchases where the trade bank deposits
the revenues from the imports in an escrow account before the western
trading partner releases his goods to the exporter. More complicated
countertrade deals are done through so-called blocked evidence accounts and
involve vast amounts of field work to check the eastern partner's
credentials, Mr Bohunovsky says.
Many of Vienna's smaller countertraders have gone under since the business
became more complex and ceased to be the mainstay of east-west trade. Among
bigger banks, Vienna Commerz, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GiroCredit,
closed down its trading branch which handled standard barter deals in 1992,
and now makes its money buying state and enterprise debts, providing
pre-export financing and other devices necessary to bridge the gap between
the mismatched markets.
'All of this is still countertrade,' says Alexander Waldstein, the managing
director of AWT International Trade and Finance AG, one of the oldest and
best-known countertraders, which belongs to the Creditanstalt group. 'In
this case export finance is just an instrument to make it happen.'
While some Viennese banks argue that business in the former Comecon area is
now less lucrative because more currencies are convertible in countries such
as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Mr Waldstein says that eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union nevertheless represent up to 80 per cent
of AWT's business.
He admits that deals are now more complicated since the demise of the
foreign trade organisations, where one visit was enough to clinch a massive
trade. Now, he says, it is more a question of helping a Ukrainian company
sell its products in Greece where it has never done business before.
Vienna's countertraders also argue that some business in the former Soviet
Union reflects the fact that the senior positions in what used to be
state-owned enterprises are still staffed by people who know nothing but
countertrade. Growing economic problems in some areas of the former Soviet
Union provide a further incentive for countertrade.
'Take the Ukrainians,' says Konrad Reich, special projects manager at Vienna
Commerz. 'Now that they have run out of coupons (designed to replace the
rouble) they have reverted to the only currency - goods,' he says. Other
bankers point to areas outside the former Soviet Union, including China
where several Viennese banks are involved in countertrade transactions.
But after decades as the turntable between the two mismatched economic
blocs, will Vienna remain the world's countertrade capital? Centrobank's Mr
Vogt says that the old-school Viennese countertraders have died and that the
necessary expertise can now be deployed anywhere in the world, rendering a
particular geographical location like Vienna's redundant.
Others point to Dutch banks as notable countertraders, adding also that
Berlin has taken advantage of its geography and is increasingly becoming a
competitor to Vienna. Some also see London as another rival, partly due to
its traditional role as a major commodity trading centre.
However, attempts by banks and others to set up specialist countertrade
departments in the 1980s were not followed through as demand dissipated.
Most Viennese bankers, however, are convinced that, as a launch-pad for
emerging markets in the former Soviet Union, Vienna enjoys an advantage
which it will maintain for several years to come, not least because of its
excellent airline connections to the region.
They also agree that Viennese have contacts built up over decades and that
the city's history at the crossroads of Europe has taught them to scheme and
be flexible, making them ideal go-betweens in difficult markets worldwide.
'The Viennese are very complicated creatures,' says Vienna Commerz's Mr
Reich, telling the story of a German client who turned to the bank for help
with a countertrade in Egypt.
'All they saw was a straight line,' he said of the Germans. 'We Viennese can
see the line differently,' he added, laughing. 'It need not be straight at
all - it could be baroque.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (16): When expertise is no luxury - Krystyna
Krzyzak writes that countertrading is a costly as well as complicated
activity. The services of specialist consultants are in regular demand, and
they can be choosy about the deals they handle / Countertrade focus / How to
find a consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KRYSTYNA KRZYZAK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Countertrading can be an extremely costly undertaking, absorbing anything up
to 30 per cent of the value of the original export order. On top of that,
many of the large specialists, including banks, would find the size of a
countertrade deal proposed by a small or medium sized enterprise (SME) too
small to contemplate.
Third party specialists can also be choosy. One consultant says that he
charged a daily fee of Dollars 500-Dollars 600, which most SMEs would find
prohibitive. Finding a specialist can thus be almost as frustrating as
completing the export order.
The role of the outside specialist in countertrade transactions varies. It
can, for instance, involve bringing a consultant to help negotiate the
countertrade component of an export contract. Alternatively, the specialist
may be responsible for assembling the entire arrangement or, more
specifically, organising the sale of the countertraded product.
Locating or providing financing to make countertrade arrangements work are
other key functions. The UK clearing banks were more helpful providers of
countertrade services in the 1980s, the heyday of countertrade, when every
leading financial institution had its dedicated unit.
Now many have scaled down their operations and will only arrange a deal if
it is large enough. The banks may, however, for a finder's fee, put the
company in touch with a suitable trading company that can handle the goods
or commodities on offer. Ministries and departments of trade are another
possible port of call.
The Projects and Export Policy Division at the UK's Department of Trade and
Industry publishes a booklet, Countertrade: a guide for exporters 1993/94,4
which provides an overview of countertrade techniques, lists current
countertrading policies and legislation throughout the world, including in
some cases contact names, addresses and telephone numbers of relevant
governmental bodies.
There is also a contact list of nearly 30 consultants, trading companies,
bank units and political credit risk insurance services offered in the UK.
The list is by no means comprehensive, and one company contacted denied all
knowledge of the practice, but certainly in the case of the banks the time
saved in being able to get through directly to the right person could cover
the cost of the publication.
Meanwhile, since the clearing banks reduced their operations many of their
switchboards appear to be under the impression that countertrading is part
of the accountancy department.
Canada's Department of External Affairs, Germany's Federal Association of
Wholesale and Foreign Traders, and Federal Association of German Exporters
and the US Department of Commerce have also produced similar publications.
The extent of official support given to smaller companies depends more on
the government's view of the state's role in economic planning than its
attitude towards countertrade. Both the UK and the US view countertrade as
contrary to free trading. As the DTI stresses, the department itself will
offer general information about countertrade but advises exporters to seek
professional advice.
France is more dirigiste and enthusiastic. In addition to its trade
ministry's specialised countertrade department, the Bureau des
Compensations, it established as far back as 1977 the Association pour la
Compensation des Exchanges Commerciaux (ACECO), generally regarded as one of
the world's best government-sponsored countertrade organisations. ACECO
organises seminars, provides clearing arrangements, and runs a computerised
data bank on national policies, legislation and useful contacts in French
and English.
Lists and data banks are useful up to a point, and can narrow the field down
to regional and industrial traders and advisers. Rarely to be found on lists
are highly specialised consultants who became fascinated by trading in
difficult markets and branched off on their own. They are found by word of
mouth, but the chances are they once worked for a company in the same line
of business. The countertrade round tables provide an alternative first port
of call to government departments. As the industry's network, they are in
the best position to know who, if anyone, is in a position to dispose of
unfamiliar goods or arrange trade financing for unfamiliar CIS companies -
if not both.
The London Countertrade Round Table has 40 members consisting of a
cross-section of companies using and offering countertrade services (small
manufacturing industries, trading houses, consultancies, banks, insurance
brokers, and a few multinationals). The annual membership fee is Pounds
40.00, and it can be reached via the secretary Alan Linger at Standard Bank,
London.
The London CRT meets quarterly; it is also a member of the European
Organising Committee, alongside the Munich and Eindhoven Round Tables, and
ACECO; this body also arranges meetings. International equivalents include
the Asian Pacific Round Table, their Australian and South African
counterparts, and the largest body, the American Countertrade Association,
which is organising the 1994 World Countertrade Conference in Philadelphia.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (15): A different kind of market place - Goods
swapping has been hit by economic changes, such as the fall of Soviet
communism, writes Paul Melly. But it is far from dead / Counter trade focus
/ Developing world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Talk to any trade finance house in the late 1980s and you were likely to
find that it had a specialist countertrade department. Although very much an
affair for experts, the technique was an important part of the banking
repertoire, when it came to financing exports to the Third World or eastern
Europe.
But changing economic policies, above all the loss of faith in centralised
socialist systems, have pushed the whole concept of barter out of the
limelight. Many bankers hardly ever handle countertrade deals now, and many
developing countries are wary of the technique - Sudan even banned it late
last year.
One could be forgiven, therefore, for thinking that countertrade was hardly
used at all today in most of the developing world. The truth is more
complex. Straightforward barter arrangements, with basic commodity exports
shipped abroad in return for imports of industrial goods, are now probably
less common, but there are still circumstances where countries opt for
countertrade in some form: when they do so, this is often to support broad
trading objectives rather than simply because they have run short of foreign
exchange to pay for imports in cash.
In recent months a number of institutions took steps to encourage certain
forms of countertrade. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has invited
companies to propose deals in its member states, while Spain's official
export credit insurer, CESCE (Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la
Exportacion) has designed a special form of cover for these deals.
Several factors underlie the declining popularity of traditional barter
among many Third World countries. They all reflect one basic fact - intense
financial pressures that drive countries to maximise the foreign exchange
they can earn from their exports.
That usually means selling them on world markets, for payment in hard
currency. For example, Ghana, which used to swap cocoa for manufactured
goods from eastern Europe no longer tends to do so.
The World Bank tends to discourage barter because it conceals the real costs
entailed in trade. It is hard for an African country to know whether it is
getting a fair price for its exports of, say, coffee, cocoa or bauxite, if
payment is made in the form of goods. It is even harder to ensure that the
goods obtained in return represent good value for money.
Changed political circumstances come into play as well, particularly the
disintegration of the communist system in eastern Europe, and the declining
popularity of so called-socialist systems in the developing world.
Fluctuations in the price of commodities have also conspired to undermine
the popularity of barter arrangements. During the 1980s, Uganda arranged
large deals exchanging coffee for various imports. Several of these
collapsed when the coffee price declined sharply, leading to disputes over
whether Uganda was obliged to provide extra shipments to compensate for
their reduced value.
Practical problems also led Nigeria to abandon attempts at oil countertrade
in the 1980s. However, while such simple barter arrangements have fallen out
of favour, there has been a steady growth in the use of 'pre-export
financings'. These are bank loans made to countries which are secured
against expected outbound commodity exports. They give countries access to
hard currency much earlier in the production cycle. The money is often used
to meet the costs of production and export - payments to farmers, purchase
of fertilisers and so on.
Alternatively, it may be reserved for an essential import need, such as fuel
oil. Proceeds from sales of the Third World exports - typically cocoa, oil
or coffee - are paid into an escrow account in a Western financial centre
and used to pay off the original loan.
Bankers Trust was a pioneer in the field, arranging several facilities for
Tanzania; Grindlays is active in Zimbabwe. Other banks thought to have been
involved include Union Bank of Switzerland, Chemical Bank, BHF (Germany) and
ABN-Amro. Many others have been arranging minor transactions.
So far, the larger syndicated transactions have only been arranged for a
limited number of countries with a strong export track record - such as
Ghana and Zimbabwe. There are still risks, of course, even if these are less
than in a traditional barter deal. Bankers are particularly worried about
current oil price fluctuations. One says that he now looks for a 40-60 per
cent safety margin on oil-based deals compared with only 25 per cent a year
ago.
The Third World exporter's reliability and the quality of the promised end
buyer also come into play. Countries with a patchy record may find that they
are limited to relatively low levels of financing; on the other hand, a
country with many other difficulties, but a strong reputation for reliable
exporting, may be able to borrow funds on a scale it could certainly not
obtain for conventional import finance. Take Nigeria. Says one banker:
'Nigeria has a fantastic record in meeting its crude oil delivery
commitments.'
New versions of countertrade are also emerging in transactions between one
developing country and another. These are partly a reflection of Third World
nations' attempts to reduce their dependence on imports from the
industrialised world. They are also born out of force of circumstances:
sometimes a country has to import from whoever is prepared to supply on
barter terms, because it lacks the foreign exchange to buy on the open
market, or because it is trying to export products which are not yet fully
competitive in international terms.
Many countries are unwilling to barter their traditional commodity exports
because they know they can sell these for hard currency. However, as they
develop an industrial base, they may use barter as a way of securing sales
of manufactured goods which they know many world buyers would not yet be
prepared to pay for in hard currency.
The IDB has begun to help with funding and guarantee arrangements for
countertrade deals between countries in its member states, to assist them
develop cross-border trade in manufactures and broaden their economic bases.
Another variant on the countertrade theme, popular among the more
industrialised developing countries, is 'offset'. Normally, this is
associated with the supply of advanced technology or military equipment from
the West.
Countries buying aircraft or other high-tech goods on a large scale will
often insist that this is counterbalanced by the injection of new foreign
investment to develop their own industrial base. The technique has been
widely used in south-east Asia and the Middle East.
For example, Malaysia is acquiring Swiss light aircraft know-how, as part of
an offset related to purchases from British Aerospace. Hughes Aircraft
Company of the US has promised offset production of components as part of a
deal to supply Indonesia with two satellites. There is also an offset
element to the recent sales by German-Dutch group Fokker of 15 passenger
jets to Indonesian regional airlines.
In Saudi Arabia, British companies have become closely involved in
industrial developments, as part of the offset programme related to the
Al-Yamamah project, under which British Aerospace provides aircraft and
support for the Saudi airforce. In the United Arab Emirates, agreement has
been reached on the first batch of offset projects associated with France's
sale of 399 Leclerc tanks and armoured vehicles to Abu Dhabi.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (14): Ensure the goods are not rubbish -
Krystyna Krzyzak offers some advice to small and medium companies
contemplating a move into countertrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KRYSTYNA KRZYZAK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The publicity generated by large military offset and oil barter deals often
gives the impression that countertrading is the preserve of multinationals
and governments. But small and medium sized companies (SMEs) that export
into certain regions may also be offered products or commodities, usually
bearing no relation to their business, in lieu of cash.
For certain export markets, notably the former Soviet Union, a lack of hard
currency may make countertrade inevitable. A number of newly industrialised
countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines, use countertrade as a
means of increasing their own export markets.
Either way, the SME's willingness to countertrade may make the difference
between winning or losing an export contract. Colin Heritage, director of
Stemcor Trade Finance, a London-based specialist financial services company
focusing on barter and countertrade services, believes that countertrade is
both more practicable and more likely to succeed if approached as a means of
trade promotion rather than trade finance. 'Offer to help the importer sell
its products into the West, but get its bank to provide the necessary
letters of credit and guarantees,' Mr Heritage advises. 'But the performance
of each contract must be kept separate.'
This type of initiative can give a company a competitive edge because it can
generate additional foreign exchange for the importer's country. However, it
is just as likely that the exporter will be offered goods with which it is
totally unfamiliar.
How an SME approaches this type of transaction can decide whether it comes
out with a profit. If countertrade, including something as conceptually
simple as barter, was ever straightforward, money would never have been
invented. The pitfalls fall broadly into two groups.
The first concerns the goods taken in lieu of payment. Is the quality high
enough, and if not, who is liable when they are on-sold? Are they subject to
a quota agreement, in which case where is the recipient going to sell them?
Will the official body responsible for the commodity give permission for the
goods to be part of the transaction and at what price? If an exporter sells
these unfamiliar goods to a trading house, how can it be sure that it will
get a fair price?
The second group of problems concerns the standard payment risk associated
with exporting which countertrade magnifies. Government export credit
agencies take differing views on insuring the countertrade leg of a deal,
but no agency will cover the risk of unsaleable goods.
The private insurance market, meanwhile, has scaled down its capacity. It is
feasible for SMEs to arrange their own countertrade transactions - if it is
a fairly straightforward counterpurchase deal and the company obeys the
golden rule of keeping the two sides of the contract separate and ensures
that the counterparty delivers its goods first. Few transactions are that
simple, and not many counterparties that obliging. The do-it-yourself
approach also can incur escalating trading costs. The exporter may well be
offered a commodity that is in oversupply which it will then have to sell at
a discount - the disagio, which may be as high as 25 per cent - into the
market.
This is the point at which many DIY deals turn sour, notes Alan Linger,
assistant general manager at Standard Bank London and secretary of the
London Countertrade Round Table. 'Companies find that they can't afford to
sell the countertraded product at the price they need, and they can't afford
to absorb the disagio,' Mr Linger notes.
This highlights another rule for successful countertrading by SMEs: keep the
cost of the arrangement of the transaction and the subsidy separate. 'In a
lot of countertrade deals the company may not even know at the beginning
which goods will be offered, so they should agree the arrangement fees and
leave the decision on subsidy costs open until later as part of the
negotiating process for the products being offered,' counsels Mr Heritage of
Stemcor.
Most smaller companies are best advised to seek help, preferably at the
beginning before the costs start escalating. Clearing banks are not now very
interested in arranging smaller transactions - nor are many trading
companies - although they can provide the payment mechanisms. There are,
however, specialists who can tie together the financing and trading legs.
Nigel Adams of Adams and Co, a Daventry-based countertrade consultant
specialising in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, believes that
the consultant's role has additional advantages for the exporter. These
include the exporter maintaining direct contact with the customer, which
would not be the case if the transaction was passed to a countertrade house,
and a customised service from the consultant which has a vested interest in
ensuring that the deal is profitable.
There are also a small number of specialist houses offering one-stop
shopping such as New York-based GreficoMees, a joint venture between the
Dutch bank Mees Pierson and the French countertrade specialist Greficomex.
Many of the venture's customers are SMEs, according to Neil Caplan, the
company's president. The company can provide switch agreements for exporters
and importers, obviating the need for hard currency.
However, where the importer cannot come up with the necessary confirmed
letters of credit or bank guarantees, it can arrange pre-export finance
against a suitable guarantee from the exporter.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (13): Small firms air their woes - Rod McNeill
talks to small and medium-size exporters who complain of slow or inadequate
backing from their banks, and to banks who view the matter differently, but
say that changes are afoot / Bank watch / United Kingdom
</HEADLINE>

Small and medium-sized UK companies looking to boost exports point to
continuing obstacles and hidden costs in securing assistance from banks.
John Sweet, chairman of Semitron Industries, a Swindon-based manufacturer of
semiconductors looking to step up exports to the Far East and Europe, says
'on the whole, the banks have not been terribly interested'.
He adds: 'It took us five weeks to get clearance on (a factored) account in
Italy - the customer was one of the biggest telecommunications companies in
Italy. While you are waiting, the product is sitting on the shelf waiting to
be shipped.'
For Mr Sweet, the banks do not help ease small companies' concerns over
international payments. 'We are spending so much time as the business
expands chasing around making sure we get paid.'
Sonix, Cirencester-based designer and manufacturer of data communications
equipment formed 18 months ago with venture capital backing from Schroders
and Boston-based Greylock Management, illustrates the challenges facing even
successful start-up ventures.
The company, which expects sales of Pounds 5m for the year to March 1994, a
10-fold increase on first year sales, is about to launch an aggressive
export campaign across western Europe which it hopes will boost sales to
Pounds 9m by March, 1995.
Bob Jones, founder and managing director, highlights several difficulties
with the banks: 'We look for normal banking facilities, such as money
transfer and cheque clearance. But obviously we look for a lot more.
However, the banks are indifferent towards exporting.'
He adds: 'The banks look for the ultimate in security these days. They are
very good up to the point where they actually have to take risks.'
Factoring invoices is often the only route for start-up companies looking
for flexible funding, but there are hidden costs. 'Inevitably, because of
the hassle factor, companies do not apply themselves with the same vigour to
collecting international debt as they do in the UK', believes Mr Jones.
Furthermore, some factoring companies reduce the amount companies can draw
down against factored international debts unless the debts are covered by
export credit insurance.
According to Mr Jones: 'If we factor a foreign invoice, the factoring
company insists that we insure it through export credit insurance - so there
is an extra cost and penalty to us. So the factoring company is almost
admitting that it is going to have problems collecting the debt.
'Not only are we not being encouraged to export but we are also being
hindered by factoring companies making it more difficult for us to export.'
On the question of export credit insurance, the director of one factoring
company comments: 'It is not in our nature to insist. We recommend they do
insure open-account debt, that is, exports without the backing of letters of
credit or bank guarantees.'
Meanwhile, UK banks scored poorly in a recently completed survey by Coopers
and Lybrand. Roger White, one of the leaders of the survey team, says: 'The
two big issues companies face are late payments and export credit insurance,
which is expensive and hard to get, but assistance to exporters is still a
problem and nobody seems to come out particularly well, including the banks.
'It is hard work for small and medium-sized enterprises and there is a major
opportunity for the banks to help those businesses, but at the moment they
do not seem to be very forthcoming.'
The banks refute such criticisms yet admit that changes are afoot. Kevin
Jennings, NatWest's Director of Commercial Banking Services, says: 'If there
is a credible business plan, the finance is there in various formats. We
have no doubt that many more of our customers could get their products into
overseas markets.
'In fact, in 1994 we shall be approaching all commercial customers -
especially our medium-sized businesses - with a checklist of key criteria to
help them consider whether they could and should start to export their
products.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (12): Start with a sweet smile - Alan Spence
reviews the numerous options, besides going to law, available to suppliers
worried about possible non-payment of bills / Debt Recovery / Chasing the
late payers
</HEADLINE>

Delayed or lost payments are now a common feature of recession-hit
international trade. Infuriating, but usually manageable for major
corporations, they can nevertheless pose serious problems for
small-to-medium-sized companies (SMEs).
A delay or a loss too many for an already heavily-indebted SME could push it
over the edge if its bankers finally take fright.
Given the availability of instruments to help secure payment and indemnify
exporters against losses - ranging from various types of letters of credit
and export credit insurance to specialist collection and funding services,
such as those offered by factoring companies - companies should, at least in
theory, be well-protected against delays and losses.
In practice, however, this is often not the case. Protection comes at a
cost, which many exporters are not prepared to pay, especially if recession
is already squeezing profit margins.
Some exporters are simply unaware of the types of security available; others
argue that in addition to costs, they impose other constraints - factoring
companies may take up valuable exporting time deciding on a buyer's credit
worthiness; claiming on a credit insurance policy may be viewed as a
time-consuming and lengthy process.
Whether there is merit in their arguments or not, the result is that many
exporters finish up with delayed or even delinquent payments as a result of
unprotected open account trading. At that point there is no going back to
credit insurance companies or, for example, factoring companies or invoice
discounters.
Lombard Natwest, which provides both factoring and invoice discounting
services, says that under no circumstances would it provide a collection or
discounting service for debts which are overdue. As is the case with
providers of similar services, David Kilburn, marketing manager, stresses
that exporters seeking factoring or invoice discounting services must
establish their requirements prior to exporting, thus allowing Lombard
Natwest the opportunity of assessing buyer risk.
So what are their options in terms of taking steps to secure eventual
payment and protect cashflow? James Fairrie, manager, banks and exports, at
UK credit insurer Trade Indemnity, advises that companies caught with
unprotected debts should initially examine the possibility of gently
mobilising personal contacts within or associated with the buyer
organisation.
'Very often the major non-paying culprits are the bigger companies and the
sufferers are the smaller companies. They are in a weak position to rattle
the sabre; if the big company feels it's getting hassled, it may merely
further delay payment and go elsewhere for future supplies', Mr Fairrie
adds.
'Make use of personal contacts, make use of friendships, contact other
suppliers to the same client and try to enlist their help.' Mr Fairrie also
suggests that the exporter should consider requesting part payment. He
cautions against applying legal pressure at an early stage. 'The last thing
to do is go to a lawyer. It's expensive, you have little direct control over
what the lawyer might say and it could upset future relations with the
buyer.'
However, he does advise the exporter to discuss the situation with its banks
with a view to the latter applying gentle pressure. 'If the bank is helpful,
then it could send a letter to the buyer pointing out that its client is
expecting funds and enquiring whether payment has been made or perhaps
inadvertently misdirected. Depending on the bank's international presence,
the buyer may take such a letter to be a potential reflection on its overall
credit rating if news of its slow payment spreads around the banking
community - and pay up.'
A more usual alternative may be for the exporter's bank to approach his
client's customer's bank in a similar manner designed to create a similar
effect. At this point the exporter is probably beginning to risk upsetting
future relations with the buyer and must take a view on the outlook for the
latter's future custom and balance it against current cashflow
considerations.
If the exporter decides to apply more pressure it could, for example,
harness the help of a specialist debt collection service such as Trade
Indemnity Collections or Graydon International. Trade Indemnity Collections
will seek payment on quasi-delinquent corporate debts - usually defined as
debts more than 180 days overdue - at costs ranging between one and five per
cent of the recovered amount, though it can be higher, depending on the time
and the amount involved and the country.
The exporter is also liable for additional legal expenses. According to
Graydon International, chasing unpaid debts is a common problem - even for
larger companies. Charges vary according to the value and location, but
normal commissions would usually amount to between 10 and 15 per cent of the
amount recovered. If Graydon needs to use local agents, that could involve a
lot more expense for the exporter - perhaps up to a further 10-20 per cent
of the recovered amount, depending on the country.
Again, incurred legal expenses will be additionally applied. In the event of
non-recoveries by collection services a handling charge is common. Finally,
there is the pure legal option - litigation. Given the expense involved,
this approach may only be viable for larger companies with substantial
debts.
Selecting which law firm to use can be important. Some specialise in certain
markets, such as, for example, London-based solicitors Hartwig in Germany
where it is highly experienced at pressing for payment through local courts.
But suing a company outside its local courts may be a more practical option
in certain cases.
Take the case of an unpaid bill in Iran. Roger Baggallay, of London-based
law firm Clifford Chance, says that priority should be given to suing the
client outside the Iranian courts. The main procedure would be to try to go
after any assets outside the buyer's own country. The legal option, on the
other hand, may only produce a big bill. In either event, it will probably
curtail future dealings between exporter and client.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (11): Draft directive offers no joy - Europe's
exporters fear that current negotiations will leave them competitively
weaker than Japan and the US / Brussels / Harmonisation of credit cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY

<TEXT>
This spring promises to be tense for Europe's top project exporters and the
small companies that win business on their coat-tails.
Negotiations in Brussels will decide the shape and cost of government credit
cover central to their ability to win orders overseas, in the face of tough
international competition.
A draft European Commission directive is expected before the summer.
Official export credits play a key role in financing the sale of big capital
installations, such as bridges, power stations and metros. Government
insurance allows much longer repayment periods than a commercial bank would
offer, especially for important, but potentially risky markets in the
developing world and the former communist bloc.
The European Union is now aiming to harmonise existing national systems, so
that exporters in all member states enjoy broadly similar levels of state
support. But industrialists and their bankers fear that the new system may
leave them at a disadvantage vis-a-vis their rivals in Japan, Canada and the
US, who will not be bound by the EU agreement.
The most contentious suggestion is that national export credit agencies
should be limited to providing 95 per cent insurance cover for buyer
credits, leaving the exporter or his bank to take the remaining slice of
risk.
The UK, where the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) currently
provides 100 per cent cover, has strongly opposed this idea, pointing out
that it will leave European businesses at a disadvantage as non-EU rivals
will probably continue to cover 100 per cent.
Banks and manufacturers already have to share the risk by arranging finance
of the initial 15 per cent front-end contract costs between themselves and
the foreign buyer.
A delegation of industrialists from six EU member states, organised by the
British Exporters Association, visited Brussels in mid-January to outline
their concerns. Commission officials agreed to pass details to the
inter-governmental commission which has been discussing export credit
harmonisation. The delegation included officials from some of Europe's
leading capital goods exporters, including Siemens-Plessey (UK and Germany),
Cegelec (France and Belgium), Dragados (Spain) and Daf and Philips
(Netherlands). Samuel Montagu, part of the HSBC group, also participated.
It pressed officials for a number of features to be incorporated into the
new directive. These included:
routine 100 per cent cover, rather than 95 per cent;
an independent system of risk analysis to reach common agreement on the risk
rating, and thus the premium level, to be accorded to each foreign market;
common rules on bank provisioning and capital adequacy cover;
common rules for the proportion of foreign components that can be covered;
and common rules for the scope and structure of insurance cover, exchange
rate risk cover and claims waiting periods.
The proposal to limit all cover to 95 per cent of insured business is a
worry not just for UK companies, who would see their cover drop from 100 per
cent, but also for French and Italian concerns at a time when many banks and
industries are due to be privatised and thus lose government backing.
Spanish business is also worried, because it has difficulty competing in
Latin America against US rivals who enjoy 100 per cent cover from the US
Export-Import Bank. The Germans had been initially preoccupied mainly with
the shift by Hermes, their official export credit agency, from the single
premium system to one which could set higher rates for riskier markets. But
they are now thought to be increasingly concerned about the structure of
cover as well.
Sources close to the negotiations concede that, because they have been held
under the aegis of the Council of Ministers rather than the European
Commission, they have been shrouded in a degree of confidentiality.
Consequently, consultation with industry may not have been sufficient.
The talks have been driven by finance ministry officials, with a tendency to
go for the lowest common denominator, pulling together the cheaper aspects
of the various national export credit systems. The end result, exporters
argue, is a set of harmonisation proposals that is rather less supportive
for industry than most of the existing national schemes.
The confidentiality issue notwithstanding, sources close to the negotiations
argue banks and industry have been slow to tell politicians and national
administrations what they wanted the harmonised system to look like. The
present attempt to reform export credit began in mid-1991 and both
governments and EU international trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan are
anxious to reach an accord before long.
The chances of business forcing fundamental changes at this stage seem
limited, although some amendments can probably be made. It may be
particularly hard to win a change of tack on the 95 per cent issue, as only
the UK currently offers 100 per cent cover.
Samuel Montagu has calculated that the cost of taking on this extra five per
cent risk and making provisions against it could be as high as Pounds 1.5m
on a Pounds 25m export contract in a fairly high risk market. Even for an
export to a country which posed no big payment worries, the cost of
financing the extra slice could be Pounds 430,000. These costs would be
passed directly to the exporter in the form of extra charges.
The other issue at the heart of the Brussels talks is the level of premiums
charged by national export credit agencies for providing medium-term cover.
At present there are still wide disparities. At one extreme, Germany sets a
flat rate charge for covering exports to any country in the world. This is
in contrast to the UK's ECGD, which uses a sophisticated risk assessment
system to set premium levels for each individual market.
Some governments, such as Italy, continue to charge fairly low rates, even
for difficult markets, because they see export credit as a justifiable form
of state support for industry. In contrast, ECGD, with a mandate to break
even, had set fairly high charges; but over the past two years the UK
government has allowed it to make a series of cuts - the latest in the
November budget - which have brought most premiums close to the European
average.
High premiums for markets recently brought back on medium-term cover, such
as Argentina and Slovakia, have been quickly reduced; banks hope for a
similar approach to Vietnam, which is expected to be brought on-cover in the
near future. No one expects EU governments to agree a single set of premiums
to be adopted by all agencies; but negotiators do hope to set some
parameters, and Germany would certainly be forced to abandon its single
premium system - something Bonn was preparing to do anyway.
One widely canvassed outcome is to copy the French model of categorising
export markets into several risk groups. There would be EU-wide maximum and
minimum premium levels for each category, while individual governments would
be free to set exact rates within these bands.
The premium issue has become particularly important to exports because the
scope for other forms of subsidy has been gradually pruned back. For
example, the Consensus agreement embracing all OECD states has already
banned interest rate subsidies for export sales to developed and better-off
developing countries. Meanwhile, the scope to subsidise export bids by
incorporating official development aid into the finance package (as an
add-on grant or to soften loan rates) has also been limited by the domestic
budget strains in western exporting countries.
Most governments are not in a position to increase aid spending
significantly at present. With domestic demand squeezed by recession,
governments have been under pressure to help industry to capitalise on these
overseas project opportunities, which tend to be in the high tech sectors,
such as process plant and power engineering, where western companies can
still match competition from the new Pacific Rim industrial powers.
With little room for direct subsidy, governments have sought other ways of
helping exporters. Canada, for example, has been redrafting the terms of
reference for its Export Development Corporation (EDC). The aim is to allow
EDC more room for manoeuvre to develop flexible and competitive financing
packages that will help its export clients to win more business.
In the UK, President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine and Minister
for Trade Richard Needham have successfully persuaded the Treasury to
approve increases in ECGD cover for large and high risk markets of between
Pounds 2.8bn and Pounds 3.2bn for each of the next three financial years.
This represents a fundamental reversal of the policy which prevailed before
the last election, when both the Treasury and Mr Heseltine's predecessor,
Peter Lilley, were deeply sceptical about the value of official export
credit support. This has coincided with the relative weakness of sterling
and a sharp drop in both inflation and interest rates to put project
exporters in a much-improved competitive position.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (9): An inherent flimsiness - UK exporters are
currently losing Pounds 180m a year because of letters of credit which fail
to ensure payment / Letters of credit / Analysis and credit watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK RUNIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Letters of credit (l/cs) are commonly regarded as a secure method of payment
but, since payment cannot be guaranteed, many banks do not accept them as
security for advances.
The protection afforded by an l/c can easily be lost when exporters do not
strictly comply with its terms. Moreover, there is the additional question
of country risk. All the compliance in the world will not guarantee payment
if a country runs short of foreign exchange.
For example, payment delays of up to a year are currently affecting Iranian
trade paper, including l/cs backed by central bank guarantees. Currently
almost 70 per cent of documents presented by UK exporters under l/c are
rejected due to a lack of compliance. This costs exporters around Pounds
180m per annum in lost goods and additional expenses.
Moreover, the figure is likely to rise this year following the introduction
of significant revisions of the international rules which govern l/cs - the
so called Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits issued by the
Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
The new rules, known as UCP500, came in to force at the beginning of January
this year and involve a cluster of technical changes. For example, there is
a new regulation that a bank which confirms an l/c can withdraw its
confirmation if the l/c's expiry date is subsequently amended.
Many companies engaged in international trade will probably be unaware of
UCP500 and thus the number of discrepant presentations will rise further,
along with the associated costs to exporters. Ironically, many companies
insist that orders will only be dispatched when they receive an irrevocable
l/c without checking their success rates in presenting correct documentation
to banks.
Many exporting companies fail to have any input into the wording of the l/c
and fewer still understand the crucially important difference between an l/c
payable in the exporter's country and one payable in the importer's country.
This can have potentially significant financial repercussions. For example,
a UK company recently received an l/c from Hong Kong valued at Pounds
350,000. Documents had to be sent to the bank in Hong Kong for payment. The
goods were shipped on November 2, 1993, and documents submitted to the UK
advising bank on November 9 and forwarded to the buyer's bank in Hong Kong
on November 11. The UK company was reimbursed on December 2, some 21 days
later.
The exporter had two options on November 9: to sell the documents to the UK
bank which would charge interest at 7.5 per cent (2.5 per cent over UK base
rate) for a period of 28 days to allow for any delays in receiving the
payment, generating a cost of Pounds 2,014, or to await receipt of the
proceeds from Hong Kong and fund the waiting period from working capital.
Neither option would have been required had the l/c been payable in the UK.
Many companies fail to specify the type of l/c which would be most
advantageous to them or, alternatively, build the negotiation costs into the
sales price. Also many exporters do not have a clearly defined country risk
strategy and often request the advising bank to confirm the l/c, which means
the latter accepting both the buyer's risk and the country risk.
However, advising banks are under no obligation to confirm l/cs.
Consequently exporters should ascertain if banks will accept particular
country risks before they request an l/c from the buyer and not leave it
until the l/c arrives. At that point it is often too late to redirect the
l/c to another bank.
Essentially, in addition to being totally informed on technicalities of
l/cs, exporters should adopt an organised strategy for their utilisation
beginning with the fundamental question: 'Do I need a letter of credit?'
While many exporters do not use l/cs when the latter would provide
much-needed security, there is also another group which habitually uses l/cs
in situations where they are unnecessary.
For example, an exporter recently requested a major UK bank to confirm an
l/c issued by its South East Asian subsidiary, adding an additional Pounds
350 in avoidable bank charges, given the minuscule risk involved. If an
exporter decides not to use an l/c, it has a variety of other options
available, including payment in advance, export credit insurance and
straight open account trading.
If, on the other hand, it indeed decides on the l/c option, it must then
additionally address other questions, including whether the l/c will be
unconfirmed or confirmed and, if the latter is the case, will banks accept
the associated country risk?
The flow chart (above) covers some of the areas that exporters should
consider when seeking an l/c. It is designed to reduce some of the areas
which cause discrepancies and to assist exporters in obtaining the security
that letters of credit are designed to provide.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (10): Oil states hit a sticky patch - The credit
standing of Iran and a number of other oil producers is being undermined by
low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slump in oil prices to a five-year low is bad news for companies doing
business with hydrocarbons producing countries. These include some markets
where the needs of growing populations and ambitious development programmes
have attracted substantial financing, but where ongoing or potential
payments problems are now driving some exporters away.
Oil price worries have compounded the concerns of exporters and creditors
about IRAN, whose backlog of letter of credit (l/c) payments continues to
mount. The weak oil market also bodes ill for NIGERIA'S mounting trade debt
arrears, as do recent reversals of market-based reforms which have upset the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
Low prices have cut ALGERIA'S projected oil and gas income for 1993 by an
officially-estimated Dollars 1.5bn, raising new doubts about the country's
ability to meet payments, despite Algiers' strenuous efforts to do so and
thus avoid a multilateral rescheduling. Even wealthy GULF STATES have seen
their credit ratings reduced. European export credit agencies (ECAs)
generally report tightening terms for major producers, such as SAUDI ARABIA
and KUWAIT.
IRAN has now arranged bilateral refinancings of its trade debt with France,
Germany and Japanese trading houses, but its payments problems look set to
drag on into 1994-95 with arrears now estimated by leading credit insurers
at Dollars 7bn on debts of around Dollars 20bn.
Delays of around one year are widely reported by banks and are affecting an
ever wider range of paper, including l/cs carrying central bank guarantees.
In recent negotiations, Tehran has asked for a two-year rescheduling of
bilateral debt repayments, compared with one-year in the first accords, with
French and German banks. It rejects a multilateral Paris Club rescheduling.
The situation, meanwhile is complex and experience is mixed: some arrears,
such as those insured by Japan, have been reduced recently.
While many exporters are losing heart over mounting arrears and ECAs
including Hermes of Germany have started paying indemnities, several
companies with regular export contracts report their payments remain on
time. However, they are concerned about their clients' ability to finance
future sales.
ALGERIA continues to make prompt payments on its Dollars 26bn external debt,
according to bankers in Paris, London and Tokyo. This is despite repayments
exceeding Dollars 9bn in 1993 and bankers' estimates of a prospective debt
service ratio of 83-85 per cent. According to a leading French bank, there
are, unusually, no arrears - indeed, payments have been brought up to date
in recent months.
Despite its good payments record, Algeria is being starved of credit as
banks and ECAs pull back. In the early 1990s the country accounted for an
estimated Dollars 3bn in annual l/c transactions alone and drew in much more
still from supplier credits. Many ECAs, like the UK's Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD), have effectively suspended cover, or - like
major creditors such as Coface of France and SACE of Italy - have reduced
the amounts available.
Short-term credit is now the rule, with country limits generally
constrained. L/c confirmation is problematic, with leading French, Italian
and Belgian banks offering the service only in selected cases. In London,
UBAF Bank offers confirmation for deals of up to 360 days.
NIGERIAN external debt arrears have reached Dollars 6bn and are set to
continue to rise while oil prices stay low. This is severely constraining
ECA cover. Nigeria has long been difficult for exporters, with problems
including the presence of fraudulent l/cs, regularly offered to the market.
Despite these drawbacks, flows of short-term trade finance - usually on
restricted confirmed irrevocable l/c (CILC) terms - have been maintained to
established clients.
Maturities are short, with 180-day sight drafts and CILC business the norm,
Standard Chartered reports. Cash cover is usually required before
confirmation. Nigeria is on the list of UK national interest markets, which
are eligible for commercial short-term insurance (usually provided on CILC
terms) reinsured by the state. Confirmation is best through leading banks,
including Union Bank, United Bank for Africa, First Bank of Nigeria, in
which the UK-based Standard Chartered Bank has a stake, and Nigeria
International Bank.
ANGOLA'S interminable civil war has undermined the south-west African oil
producer's credit rating, but it is still considered a UK national interest
market for CILC reinsurance. Other national ECAs are active in oil projects,
as are Swiss and some other banks whose operations are structured as oil
major risk (rather than country risk) with payments secured against export
receivables paid into escrow accounts. Securing other forms of commercial
finance is highly problematic, with little appetite even among those most
interested in Angolan business, such as Portuguese and South African banks.

specialist form of financing / Forfaiting

<DATELINE>
   ONE form of specialist trade funding
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
forfaiting - could provide an increasing source of support for exporters
this year.
Forfaiters, usually operating from a separate unit within a bank, provide
non-recourse finance to exporters seeking to boost and secure foreign cash
flow. The good news is that the range of export markets for which they are
prepared to provide this service is expanding.
This essentially reflects forfaiters' perceptions of improved political and
commercial risk in a number of key markets - principally in Latin America,
the Asia-Pacific region, and eastern Europe. Funding for deals in Brazil,
China and Slovakia have all featured in forfaiters' books in recent months.
Moreover, forfaiting is also providing a way in to markets as difficult and
diverse as Romania, Vietnam and Peru. Forfaiters provide exporters with
non-recourse finance (essentially funds which are only repayable in the
event of supplier default) by buying trade debts from the exporter at a
discount. The debts are guaranteed (or, in technical parlance, avalised) by
an acceptable bank.
But despite the guarantees - and the additional practice of managing
exposure by selling debt paper in a secondary market - forfaiters must
closely monitor country risk developments. Happily for exporters,
forfaiters' risk antennae are detecting a growing number of positive
signals.
Brazil is emerging as an increasingly acceptable risk with some fundings
extending for up to five years. Forfaiters are encouraged by the country's
growth rate (over four per cent forecast as the final figure for 1993),
growing foreign reserves (now around Dollars 24bn) and positive current
account flows.
Brazil is indicative of a generally improving Latin American risk. 'Levels
of Latin American business have gone from minimal to significant,' says
Stephen Rothwell, a director of London Forfaiting Company (LFC). A leading
Zurich-based forfaiter agrees. 'The markets have totally opened up for Latin
America,' he says. China is a mounting attraction among Far Eastern risks.
Providing transactions carry the guarantee of a leading state bank - such as
that of the Agricultural Bank of China which, for example, has avalised a
five-year deal arranged by West Merchant Bank - forfaiters are happy to help
fund the country's vast imports of capital goods.
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are key eastern European markets
where forfaiters are now more likely to provide funding. 'There has been a
deepening in the market in front-runners in eastern Europe,' says Mr
Rothwell.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (6): A cold wind that blows no good - The
climate for export credit has worsened, writes Alice Rawsthorn. France's
small and medium-size companies are the principal sufferers / Bank watch /
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past year or so, as the French economy has sunk into recession, one
of the hottest topics on France's corporate agenda has been the
deterioration in relations between companies, particularly small businesses,
and their banks.
Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) have so far borne the brunt of the
French recession. As the economic pressure has mounted, complaints about
banks being too slow and too unsympathetic in their response to companies'
cashflow problems and other financial hiccoughs have become commonplace.
The chief problems are, predictably, that the banks are, or so companies
claim, too cautious about advancing credit to tide them over difficult
periods and too quick to pull the plug when things go wrong. But
unfortunately for France's exporters the chilly economic climate has also
prompted the banks to cut back in the field of export credit guarantee
products such as short term and medium term contract insurance.
'The situation has not reached a critical stage,' said the Conseil National
du Patronat Francais, or Patronat, which is the mouthpiece for French
industry.
'But there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of funds that the
banks are willing to commit to export credit guarantee products and it has
already caused difficulties for some French companies.'
Small businesses are, yet again, the main victims of the squeeze in the
export credit guarantee market. The French government's official export
credit guarantees are distributed through Coface, the state-controlled
export credit agency. However the Coface system is extremely bureaucratic
and, in practice, most of its customers tend to be large companies. Smaller
concerns often do not have the time, or the resources, to cope and are
forced to turn to the private sector, generally to their own banks, to find
alternative products.
Until the late 1980s the market for such products was dominated by Banque
Francaise de Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the specialist commercial bank now
owned by a group of French financial institutions including Assurances
Generales de France (AGF), the insurance concern, and Credit Lyonnais, the
banking group.
The market was liberalised in 1989 thereby enabling other banks to offer
export credit guarantee-related products and services. Credit Lyonnais
itself is now a sizeable presence in the sector together with Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), Societe Generale, Banque Indosuez, Compagnie
Financiere de CIC et de l'Union Europeenne, Banque Paribas and Credit
Commercial de France. The Association Francaise des Banques (AFB) estimates
that these banks, together with BFCE, now account for 86 per cent of the
market.
The Patronat has detected little evidence among its members of complaints
about the quality of the export credit guarantee products supplied by French
banks. 'The regulations for most aspects of such services are now more or
less harmonised across Europe,' said an official. 'And France, like every
other country, complies with the rules.'
Instead the problems seem to be restricted to the banks' willingness to
commit funds to such products. This 'supply problem' has, according to the
Patronat, intensified over the past two years as the banks have felt the
strain of the French economic slowdown.
France's banks have undoubtedly had a tough time in the early 1990s. The
combination of relatively high commercial lending rates and low inflation
has left French real interest rates among the lowest in Europe thereby
depressing demand for credit both from consumers and the corporate sector.
At the same time the banks have had to make steep provisions for sour loans
and on the reduced value of their property portfolios.
The most exposed banks, notably Credit Lyonnais which had embarked on a
frenetic expansion programme on the brink of the recession, have also been
forced to make painful provisions on big corporate collapses.
This tough trading climate has made the banks much more cautious about their
dealings with their clients in almost every area of activity.
However, they have become particularly cautious in the parts of their
business that they have traditionally found to be less profitable, notably
in the sphere of export credit guarantee products.
The profitability issue had already emerged as a problem even before the
economic recession. But it has loomed even larger as the general pressures
on the banks have escalated. Local chambers of commerce and small business
associations, as well as the Patronat, claim that it is becoming
increasingly difficult for their members to secure financial protection for
export orders.
The problem has been magnified in the wake of the French franc's volatility
during the European currency crises in autumn 1992 and summer 1993 which
served as a stern lesson to France's exporters as to just how vulnerable
they could be to sudden swings in exchange rates and as to the value of
currency risk cover.
'We recognise that even after the recession ends there will still be a
problem with the poor profitability of export credit guarantee products,'
said the Patronat. 'It's a complicated issue but we've got to find a long
term solution. At some stage we're all going to have to sit round the table
and talk.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (7): Elastic but not enough - The French agency
wins a mixed verdict / Customer feedback / Coface of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are risky times for French exporters. 'The only certainty now is that
markets are more competitive and less predictable,' says the managing
director of one electronics group. For him and for his counterparts across
French industry, such trials raise their reliance on Coface, the French
export credit agency. They also raise the question of how the organisation
has responded to the challenge.
For most exporters, the answer is largely positive. A series of reforms and
the introduction of new policies has increased the flexibility of the
organisation. An international expansion has increased the range of its
services and its expertise. But there remain areas where users believe
improvements can be made.
In the field of exchange rate risk cover, for example, clients see
improvements and the scope for further progress. 'For most of our overseas
contracts, Coface provides an attractive means of covering exchange rates,'
says Mr Jean-Paul Marangone, attache in the financial department of Merlin
Gerin, the electrical engineering group.
Like many other French companies, Merlin Gerin has found a greater need for
protection against the vagaries of international currency movements. Before
the departure of sterling and the lira from the EMS and last summer's
reforms to the exchange rate mechanism which brought a widening of
fluctuation bands for all of the member currencies, the US dollar accounted
for between 80 and 90 per cent of the group's exchange rate cover. 'That
proportion has now decreased,' says Mr Marangone.
The flexibility of Coface's exchange rate products has increased in line
with demand. In 1992, the organisation introduced its CIME policy which
allows clients to benefit from favourable movements in exchange rates during
the term of their contracts. The response has been positive. 'It is more
flexible and obviously we are anxious to gain from currency movements,' says
one customer.
But some companies feel there is room for further improvement. 'At the
moment we can receive a maximum of about 70 per cent of any currency gains,'
says Mr Marangone. He believes it should be possible to receive a higher
proportion of the profits.
Coface has also become more flexible and responsive in its core credit
guarantee operations. A series of marketing efforts, which have included
greater contact with clients, has made the organisation more responsive.
Similarly, rationalisation measures have simplified and accelerated the
process of applying for policies. 'They have made a lot of progress, and
become much more dynamic,' says Mr Herve Bazire, head of international
affairs at the French operations of Otis, the elevator manufacturer.
He believes, however, that more can be done to smooth dealings between
Coface and its clients, particularly where the contracts are relatively
small. 'Coface is still a very big organisation and is very competitive on
big contracts,' he says. 'But we don't do very big contracts, perhaps
between FFr200,000 and FFr300,000 each, and there is still a lot of
bureaucracy which adds to the cost.'
The nature of Mr Bazire's business means that he is interested principally
in Coface's short term credit guarantees. For periods above three years,
medium term guarantees, the clients and the contracts tend to be larger.
For such customers, Coface is regarded as a strong competitor in the
international credit guarantee market. An executive of one French-based
multinational company says that Coface is often preferred to rivals such as
Hermes of Germany or Britain's ECGD.
With respect to credit risk analysis, Coface's operations have been
strengthened by its process of international expansion over the past few
years. The French organisation now has operations - either through minority
or majority stakes - in countries ranging from Ireland to Argentina. This
process is welcomed by many clients. 'With competition in our traditional
markets so tough at the moment, we are being forced to diversify, to look
for new customers,' says the export manager of one manufacturing company.
'We are often strangers in these markets so we have to use Coface to give us
information about our potential partners.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (4): From the middle of nowhere - Merloni, known
for its Ariston brand, is the only big white goods company still in Italian
hands. Its success was built on design flair and efficiency. David Lane
examines its overseas impact / Exporter profile / Merloni of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large household appliances rank high in any list of Italian manufacturing
strengths. For many years Italy's white goods industry has been a European
leader, leaving little space for foreign intruders in its home market and
aggressively capturing market share abroad. It has provided jobs for tens of
thousands and a wealth of case study material for business school students.
Refrigerators and washing machines were in the forefront of goods that
contributed significantly to export success during the 1960s 'economic
miracle'. They continue to do so. The shake-out in the sector during the
1980s has left fewer, but stronger, large players. Merloni Elettrodomestici
is one of them.
Known for its Ariston brand, Merloni recorded consolidated sales of about
L1,700bn last year, of which about two thirds were outside Italy. Holding
market leadership with 22 per cent of its home market, Merloni has nearly 10
per cent of the white goods market in both France and the UK, as well as
almost 4 per cent in Germany. 'France and the UK together generate the same
turnover as Italy,' notes Vittorio Merloni, chairman.
'We were helped by the exchange rate last year. But we do not want, or need,
to compete through devaluation,' claims Mr Merloni. He adds that the company
gained a full point of European market share in 1993. Profits also
increased. The group posted L14bn on L726bn sales at the end of June,
doubling 1992's L7bn half-year result on L631bn sales, and the year-end
figures are expected to show further improvement.
Merloni is one of Europe's four big white goods makers, keeping company with
Electrolux, Whirlpool (Philips) and Siemens. It is now the only
Italian-owned maker in the top league, the 1980s shake-out in the sector
seeing Zanussi taken over by Electrolux and Ignis taken over by Philips.
Merloni itself contributed to the rationalisation by absorbing Indesit six
years ago.
The company has come from behind to take a place among today's leaders.
Established in 1930 by the present chairman's father, Merloni was originally
a maker of weighing machines. Diversification took it first, at the
beginning of the 1960s, into the manufacture of gas cylinders, and then into
gas cookers and water heaters.
'We made our first electrical appliances at the end of the 1960s. Being a
latecomer to the sector we faced the disadvantage of being small when
competitors were already large. But we benefited from the advantage of an
established and growing market,' says Mr Merloni.
'In shifting into electrical appliances we were able to draw on our existing
technologies, processes and distribution systems. Design was, however, the
aspect that marked us out from our competitors. 'Merloni has been in the
forefront in design,' he explains.
Italian industrial design seemed to take the world by storm during the 1960s
and 1970s. 'Merloni rode this wave,' says the company's chairman. He adds,
'Ten years ago we launched the 'Margherita' range, and this was very
influential. A new generation of appliances is currently being designed by
Giugiaro to re-launch the Indesit brand.'
Design is an important factor. 'But costs and the cost/quality ratio are
crucial,' says Mr Merloni. He explains that, while the competitive edge of
low labour costs enjoyed by Italian manufacturing during the 'economic
miracle' has long since been eroded, labour is now a smaller part of total
costs.
'It was about 25 per cent in the 1960s. Today the wage bill represents less
than 15 per cent of our total costs. It is no accident that we have invested
heavily in production processes to reduce the impact of labour costs.
Directing investment into new and more efficient equipment has been
encouraged by Italian tax laws which permit a significant level of
accelerated depreciation,' says Mr Merloni.
Design flair and efficiency in production help explain Italy's leadership in
white goods. Can this be maintained? Mr Merloni is confident that it can. 'A
highly competitive system has developed. Alongside the small number of large
well-known manufacturers there are many lesser-known and small makers. My
brother's company is an example. It makes 1.5m refrigerators and washing
machines each year for leading brands. Behind the white goods makers there
is a robust and flexible network of component and machinery manufacturers,'
says Mr Merloni. He believes that Italy's position is not at risk in the
short or medium term.
Mr Merloni says that transport costs are one of the reasons why the company
will return to manufacturing in Britain. (It decided to close its Colston
subsidiary at the end of the 1980s.) Merloni currently makes almost one
quarter of its annual production of 4.3m units - split about equally between
cookers and ovens, refrigerators and freezers, and washing machines and
dishwashers - in its French, Portuguese and Turkish subsidiaries.
Although manufacturing may increase abroad, the importance of the Italian
home base will not diminish. Merloni's main factory is at Fabriano in the
Marches. 'It is in the middle of nowhere,' remarks Mr Merloni. He adds:
'Marchigiani have always been forced to look to distant markets. Ten years
ago 70 per cent of Merloni's sales were in Italy and 30 per cent abroad. Now
the converse is true.'

children's playground equipment.
That is no mean achievement in a widely-dispersed, fragmented and highly
competitive market where many buyers, especially in the public sector, tend
to view foreign suppliers with suspicion.
Kompan, whose annual sales in Canada now exceed CDollars 4m, has gained a
reputation as a supplier of top-quality and innovative - though high-priced
 -playground apparatus. 'They've made phenomenal inroads,' says Mr Rolf
Huber, president of Sportbau Canada, which surfaces playgrounds for Kompan
and its competitors.
Kompan is the world's biggest maker of playground equipment. The Danish
parent has broadened its base in recent years by buying Speelhout, a Dutch
company which specialises in outdoor 'furniture' for young teens, and
BigToys Playstructures, a US-based manufacturer. Kompan Canada acquired a
BigToys agent (including a components factory) in British Columbia late last
year.
Mr Troels Engholm, Kompan Canada's general manager, says that a key to
success has been 'to stay closely in tune with local markets'. Although
Kompan has a total staff of only 25 in Canada, they are scattered in seven
sales offices throughout the country. With the addition of four agents, that
gives it a presence in each of Canada's 10 provinces.
Mr Engholm says that different regions require different marketing
strategies. French-speaking Quebec, for instance, has proved to be more
receptive to a foreign-made product. Similarly, day-care facilities are not
as popular or sophisticated on the west coast as in the industrial heartland
of Ontario and Quebec. Most of Kompan's business in British Columbia is for
municipal playgrounds.
The separatist movement in Quebec helped persuade Kompan to broaden its
presence in English Canada through the purchase of BigToys, based in a
suburb of Vancouver. The head office is in Gatineau, Quebec, on the
outskirts of Ottawa. But Mr Engholm says this location has created the
impression among customers elsewhere that Kompan's first loyalty is to
Quebec. 'It's important to make people understand that we're equally
committed throughout the country,' he says.
The Danish company has helped pioneer a transformation in children's
playgrounds over the past decade. Modern playgrounds are designed with a
more sociable dimension than their predecessors, shifting the emphasis from
children's physical prowess to social interaction.
The trend now is to divide play areas into separate zones, each with its own
cluster of relatively small, colourful structures, designed to be as
unintimidating as possible. Mr Engholm says the entire group has made 'a
relentless effort' to educate municipalities and child-care centres on the
need for higher-quality equipment for young children, aged eight and under.
Many of its sales representatives have a background in childhood education,
including one in British Columbia with a master's degree in child
psychology.
Kompan's product line includes a colourful den and castle for toddlers,
unusually small play-houses, and mini-seesaws. It has persuaded many (though
by no means all) municipalities and child-care centres to move away from
traditionally steel play equipment to wood.
Kompan's high prices deter some buyers, especially those which put their
business out to tender. Furthermore, some North American cities still prefer
installing vandal- and fire-proof steel structures rather than Kompan's wood
products.
Mr Kim Mullin, an engineering assistant at the Vancouver Park Board, has
high praise for Kompan's quality, calling some of its apparatus 'the
Cadillac' of playground equipment. But Vancouver has bought very little from
the Danish company. 'Often the Canadian and US product comes in a little
cheaper,' Mr Mullin says.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (3): Financiers take the long view - The economy
of mainland China risks overheating, raising questions about debt levels and
its ability to meet payments. But the prospects of the world's largest
nation are too important to ignore and financiers are being remarkably
pragmatic over credit cover requests by China's suppliers / Market Profile /
China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Financing Chinese projects and capital goods imports has become a priority
for export credit agencies (ECAs) whose support is critical for would-be
exporters to this major growth market.
With a 14 per cent rise in gross national product in the first half of 1993,
and similar levels of growth expected in 1994, ECAs and banks are well aware
that the Chinese economy risks overheating. They are watching carefully to
see if payments can be kept under control, given that they estimate China's
international debt at Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn and they are further
concerned by a lack of clarity in local debt data.
But few banks shied away from the Chinese market in 1993 due to concerns
about the future. 'With a population of 1.2bn people it is a market you have
to look at very seriously,' says David Moleshead, head of export finance at
Banque Paribas in London.
Exporters' enthusiasm has not been dampened by fears of overheating; by the
slowdown in contract awards which followed the appointment last June of
vice-premier Zhu Rongji to control economic policy; nor by the concern of
the International Union of Credit and Investment (Berne Union) ECAs over
Chinese demands for export credit at below consensus rates.
Beijing has consistently called for interest rates of around 5 per cent on
insured credits, well below the prevailing OECD consensus rate, currently
6.85 per cent. Banks and ECAs report offering interest rates of 5 per cent
and below to secure contracts. This is despite the call of the Berne Union
in October to cease providing sub-consensus export credits.
For all this, the scope for Chinese contracts makes the market extremely
attractive to a wide variety of exporters. Forfaiters (specialist providers
of trade finance) and other trade financiers report, for example, that
margins can be very attractive and demand is high as exporters shop around
for credit.
Letters of credit (l/cs) account for more than two-thirds of all
international transactions. The prevailing view is summed up by a leading
official of a leading European ECA: 'We are totally open for China; demand
for cover is heavy and we are trying to meet all the demand we can.'
Belgium's OND, for example, plans to double its ceiling for Chinese cover to
BFr60bn, despite its resistance to providing sub-consensus credit. Agencies
from Canada to Italy have adopted a similar line, arguing that lending must
return to consensus rates - but only when all Berne Union members and the
Chinese reach formal agreement.
Even more rigid ECAs, such as the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD), are following this line on China. This pragmatism has produced a
climate of intense competition for Chinese contracts, exploited by Beijing
in recent months by demanding interest rates as low as 4.5 per cent.
Beijing has built low-cost credit into its trading system: Chinese companies
whose contracts are financed from international loans repayable at rates
over 5 per cent must pay a 35 per cent tax. Lower paper interest rates 'do
not necessarily cost much in lost profits', a European banker argues. 'The
contractor just hides the difference in his price. The Chinese know this, as
they understand the consensus.'
To some extent the explosion in Chinese demand for credit has compensated
exporters and trade financiers for the loss of other major markets. Italy,
for example, has seen its credit-driven business with Algeria, Iran and the
ex-Soviet Union collapse under payments pressure. In response, it has
focused more export credit support through Sezione Speciale per
l'Assicurazione del Credito all'Exportazione (SACE) on new markets,
particularly by China.
These, for example, recently backed loans worth Dollars 74.12m for the
Urumqi ammonia plant, arranged in Hong Kong by Credito Italiano and China
Development Finance, and a Dollars 25.19m loan from the same bank  - also
for China Petrochemical International Company (Sinopec) - to part-finance
the Lanzhou urea plant under construction by Technimont. The Urumqi
development has also secured British soft funding.
The UK government has partly sought to counter rising political tensions
over Hong Kong with a concerted campaign to build Chinese trade. But this,
in any case, is a central element in the export drive promoted by Minister
for Trade, Richard Needham. China is a leading member of the UK's group of
so-called 'amber markets', which have been allocated increased ECGD cover
and lower premiums in recent budgets.
The UK export community lobbied hard for additional credit support to be
converted into major contracts - notably the Guangzhou metro scheme,
targeted for support from the third in the series of UK/China soft loan
agreements. In the event, German companies signed the main Guanzhou metro
contracts during a visit to Beijing in November by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
British companies may still pick up some orders from the scheme, but another
project must now be agreed for the UK soft loan facility.
ECA and other forms of conventional financing look set to remain the norm
for most projects. However, in a market as big and risky as China there are
limits to just how much capacity exists for big ticket project financing.
Limited-recourse and non-recourse project financing offer an alternative
route.
For smaller contracts, China is a growing market for forfaiters, specialist
providers of non-recourse finance. For major projects build-operate-transfer
(BOT) techniques have made their entry, pioneered by the Hong Kong
entrepreneur Gordon Wu. BOT based projects allow the international promoter
to arrange financing and secure repayments from income streams generated by
the project, which the promoter generates for an agreed period prior to
handing it over to the appropriate authority.
In markets like China, where high growth rates contribute to a pressing need
for infrastructure but financing from conventional ECA routes is limited,
BOT-based projects could play an increasingly important role. This was
recognised by the authorities in Guandong province, with whom Mr Wu's
Hopewell Holdings launched its BOT programme. Hopewell established a track
record with two power plants at Shajiao and is continuing with the Dollars
1.2bn super-highway running 123 km from Canton to Shenzhen, bordering Hong
Kong.
China's coastal regions have been the focus of development and continue to
attract most financing, not least due to the perception that Shanghai,
Guangdong and other centres are most creditworthy. China differs vastly from
its smaller neighbours, but for short-term business l/c confirmation rates
are now very similar. European banks report accepting 180-day Chinese, Hong
Kong and Taiwanese l/cs all at confirmation rates of 1.5 per mille.
Hong Kong has suffered a downgrading of its risk-rating due to growing
political tension in the run-up to 1997. In December, Moody's Investor
Service downgraded the rating of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway
Corporation (MTRC) from A1 to Aa2. MTRC is a major borrower, with strong
cashflow and an annual financing need of around HKDollars 1.2bn.
MTRC's HKDollars -denominated debt was downgraded, Moody's said, because
'China is likely to go through a period of uncertainty. This could affect
political stability in Hong Kong.'
For project financing, Hong Kong remains a more attractive prospect than
China. Lending maturities are much longer than for the People's Republic.
Bankers note that loans for Hopewell's Shajiao-C power plant carry only 7.5
years' maturity, while the Black Point power plant financing, arranged
during the same period, has 19 years' maturity.
Macau looks set to attract substantial project financing in the run-up to
1999, when sovereignty over the Portuguese colony reverts to China.
This handover has avoided the conflicts which dog Chinese/Hong Kong
relations. Among schemes in the pipeline are a new airport, ferry terminal,
transport links to Guangdong and Zhuhai and the Dollars 1.4bn Nam Van Lakes
(also known as Praia Grande) project, increasing Macau peninsula's land mass
by 20 per cent on completion in 1999. Nam Van Lakes is to be part-financed
from syndicated loans.
Taiwan has a very strong liquid position with foreign reserves of more than
Dollars 80bn. The majority of project-based borrowing is on-shore. Most l/cs
are unconfirmed and a substantial amount of trade is account-based.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (2): The mood and rhythm improve - Market
Profile - Argentina / Successful policies are making Argentina an
increasingly attractive market for imports with which to rebuild its
shattered industries, writes John Barham. But it is not yet out of the wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until very recently, Argentina had a nightmare economy. But three years of
rigidly orthodox economic policies have transformed it into a star
performer, with high growth rates and low inflation.
As a result, Argentina has become a rapidly-growing market for foreign goods
that range from chocolates to computer-controlled machine tools. Last year
Argentina imported an estimated Dollars 16bn-worth of goods, double its
imports two years earlier. Even so, imports still only account for 6 per
cent of GDP, which suggests that sales opportunities for foreign companies
should continue multiplying.
Growth seems set to continue for several years, driven by decades of
repressed consumer demand and revived investment rates. The government
expects the economy will expand by one-quarter in the period 1993-1995.
Companies are only slightly less optimistic.
Argentina is having to rebuild its obsolete industry and public utilities
from the ground up. The public sector and privatised companies alone are to
invest at least Dollars 30.04bn between 1993-95.
Argentina is therefore importing machine tools, computers and work stations.
Packaging equipment for the food and drinks industries is expected to grow
steadily. Demand for consumer electronics and white goods is also strong.
The local car industry, once a temple of import substitution, in some cases
now imports 90 per cent of its components. Privatised companies have become
big buyers of everything from aircraft to gas meters.
Gemplus, a medium-sized French company that makes smartcards, signed a three
year contract in May to supply Telecom Argentina, the privatised telephone
operator, with phonecards. Sales in May-December 1993 were FFr30m, 4 per
cent of Gemplus's worldwide sales. It now sells 1m cards a month in
Argentina and an unspecified quantity through another privatised telephone
company, Spanish-owned Telefonica de Argentina, which buys its cards from
Gemplus in France.
Last August Gemplus opened an office in Buenos Aires, its first in Latin
America. It will be followed by offices in Caracas and Mexico City. This
year it plans to start selling smartcards to the private health insurance
industry, banks and operators of toll roads. Traditional obstacles, such
corrupt and inefficient bureaucracies, are less of a problem now, following
President Carlos Menem's deregulation and privatisation policies. Mr
Bertrand Moussel, Gemplus sales director for Latin America, says 'Argentina
is not a paradise but it does have below average problems in fraud and
corruption. Transport and customs clearance are not a problem.'
Competition, though, is fierce. Mr Frank Behrendt, is president of Buenos
Aires-based Behrendt-Mattel, a Dollars 35m company that represents European
and US engineering companies including Krupp, Decker-Maho-Gildemeister and
Cincinatti Milacron. He says: 'It's a free for all. (Companies) are breaking
their heads to make a deal. There are discounts of 40 per cent for machine
tools.'
Bidding even for small orders is intense. Mr Behrendt says few orders from
Argentine companies exceed Dollars 300,000.
Nearly all Argentina's public companies have now been privatised. Hardnosed
private managements no longer pay the suspiciously above-market prices paid
by government officials. Privatised companies say they have won price cuts
of about 30 per cent.
Financing has become a crucial sales factor. With the return of stability to
Argentina and the signing last year of a foreign debt-reduction plan,
country risk premiums have declined sharply and maturities extended.
Trade finance rates are usually set by the exporting country's government
export credit agency. Medium term trade finance for Argentina carries
interest rates that vary between 6-9 per cent a year.
British exporters, however, must pay 12 per cent a year for five-year ECGD
cover, about one-third more than US companies pay for Eximbank cover. A
British banker commented that 'most industrial products have become
commodity items, so you are competing on price and finance. With Argentine
companies able to borrow at 7.5 per cent a year, they are not going to touch
UK financing with a bargepole.'
Import tariffs vary from zero for capital goods to a top rate of 20 per
cent. Companies must also pay a 3-10 per cent 'statistics tax'. Exporters of
capital goods are exempted from this charge. However, the government has
begun adopting a more aggressive trade policy, imposing quotas and
countervailing duties for products ranging from chemicals to track shoes.
The government eliminated import barriers for capital equipment to encourage
companies to modernise rapidly. Mr Jorge Herrera Vegas, undersecretary for
economic integration, said '(capital) goods should be bought as cheaply as
possible in the international market. Argentina is preparing for a leap in
exports. It needs the most technologically advanced goods.'
Executives tend to be more formal and less effusive than elsewhere in Latin
America. Many speak good English and travel widely. Mr Behrendt says
'Argentine industrialists are surprisingly well-informed. They read a lot,
subscribe to technical magazines and travel to trade fairs a lot. They have
a good understanding of high technology. They are sophisticated and want the
newest equipment.'
However, Mr Francisco Gascon, commercial counsellor at the Spanish Embassy
in Buenos Aires, says few Argentine companies are sufficiently advanced to
use state of the art technology. He says this makes intermediate-level
equipment on offer from Spanish companies more appropriate to Argentine
company needs.
Brazilian companies are also fearsomely competitive suppliers of
intermediate industrial equipment. Brazil is now one of Argentina's most
important suppliers and its chief partner in the Mercosur customs union.
Mercosur, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay, calls for a steady
reduction in tariffs on trade between the four member countries. Tariffs are
to be completely eliminated on nearly all goods by the end of this year.
However, Argentina has retaliated against 'unfair' Brazilian exports with
protectionist measures against agricultural equipment, chemicals, textiles,
paper, refrigeration equipment.
Despite the enthusiasm of many sales executives, Argentina's economic
miracle is still far from being consolidated. One salesman predicts that
one-third of Argentine companies will fail soon. He doubts many
manufacturing companies will survive - although the outlook for service,
food and energy-related industries is good.
Decades of political upheaval and economic chaos have left their mark.
Argentina's business culture is unsophisticated compared with Chile, Brazil
and Mexico. Corruption - even in private companies - does remain a problem.
The government often changes import, tax and standards regulations by
decree. Winning redress in the slow and corrupt judicial system is
frustratingly difficult.

FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (1): A muted sigh of relief on Gatt - Exporters
see brighter prospects than a year ago. But growth is generally slow and it
is too soon to celebrate / Comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exporters across the globe face brighter prospects this year than they did
at the beginning of the last. But after a year of feeble growth in the
industrialised world, that is not saying much.
Growth in the world's 24 richest countries amounted to a meagre 1 per cent
last year, as much of Europe and Japan struggled with recession and the US
emerged only slowly from its downturn.
Industries struggling to sell their products into sluggish markets may find
little comfort in the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) forecast for output. It predicts that overall growth for
the industrialised world should reach just 2 per cent.
However, the worst is probably over. While activity in Japan looks likely to
continue its decline, an increasingly strong expansion is taking place in
the US; European Union countries have seen the worst of their recessions,
and moderate recoveries are continuing in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.
The economic outlook for growth in eastern Europe has also improved -
economic recovery in the Czech Republic and Poland is gaining strength.
Furthermore, economists are forecasting that the improvement in the US
economy, together with post-Nafta investment in Mexico, will raise the
average growth rate in Latin America. They are also optimistic about a
continued strong expansion in Asia. Analysts at JP Morgan believe that
so-called 'emerging' Asia will grow by 7.5 per cent this year in spite of
the authorities' attempts to cool China's overheated economy.
More important: the Gatt deal, agreed in December, will bring benefits to
almost everybody, even if these are not immediately recognisable in the
short-term.
The OECD has estimated that the agreement on the Uruguay round deal could
increase the world's welfare to the tune of Dollars 270bn (at current
prices) by 2002. This is just one of several analyses - including others
from the World Bank, and the secretariat of the Gatt - which have estimated
the increase resulting from the deal, in global economic welfare, at between
Dollars 213bn and Dollars 274bn by 2002, roughly  3/4 -1 per cent of gross
global income.
On inflation, the global outlook is generally good. The trade agreement  -
and the extra competition it brings - seems likely to help shore up gains
already made on inflation in the industrialised world. According to the
OECD, inflation in 20 of its 24 member countries has fallen to 4 per cent or
less, and in most of these countries it is below 3 per cent.
Although the OECD has pointed out that, in Europe, the rate of price
increases in Germany could remain stubborn, it forecasts that the trend in
inflation will be downwards. Excluding Turkey, inflation in the area is
expected to fall to 2 1/4 per cent by 1995.
The outlook for employment, however, is bleak, especially in Europe. The
OECD expects that the European unemployment rate will rise to 11.5 per cent
next year (when more than 22m people will be out of work) from 8.6 per cent
in 1991 (when 16.5m Europeans were unemployed).
Perhaps the brightest spot for the world economy remains the successful
completion of the Uruguay trade deal and the banishment of fears that
countries will revert to a new round of trade protectionism.
But while almost all global forecasters concur that the trade liberalisation
measures agreed in the round will be good for the world economy, no one
knows precisely what the measures will mean. Many analysts, for example,
believe that even the top end of the forecasts - which show an increase in
global economic welfare of Dollars 274bn by 2002 - underestimate the likely
benefits of the trade deal.
First, the studies ignore the stimulus to trade in services, which already
amounts to 21 per cent of world trade.
Second, the estimates assume that the status quo would have been maintained
if the Uruguay round had failed.
Last, they ignore the greater international transfer of technology and
business practices. Thus the benefits to the world economy from the
completion of the round could prove to be significantly higher.
There is also some debate about where and to whom the benefits will accrue.
An OECD study looked at the different areas affected by the trade deal and
came up with the following conclusions:
Agriculture: removing 30 per cent of the tariffs and subsidies for
agriculture could yield gains of Dollars 190bn, with the 24 OECD countries
accounting for Dollars 120bn of the net gains, and the developing and
formerly centrally planned countries benefiting by Dollars 70bn.
In the final deal, it was agreed that trade distorting subsidies and import
barriers affecting agriculture would be cut over a period of six years, with
support for domestic farming reduced by 20 per cent. All import barriers are
to be converted to tariffs, and cut by 36 per cent, while Japan's and South
Korea's closed rice markets will gradually open. Tariffs on tropical
products were cut by more than 40 per cent.
Industrial goods: a 30 per cent liberalisation of manufactured products
would produce Dollars 23bn more income, with the OECD countries gaining
about 64 per cent of the extra benefit derived from the liberalisation.
According to the deal, tariffs on industrial goods will be cut by more than
one-third. More than 40 per cent of imports will enter duty free.
Services: the OECD did not examine the liberalisation of services, but it
said: 'The liberalisation of services would undoubtedly add to the income
and growth dividend, yielding additional benefits.'
Naturally the Gatt deal will bring losers as well as winners in its wake.
Producers formerly sheltered from competition by trade barriers and input
subsidies would lose from elimination of these. Food importers in particular
will suffer as a result of the higher prices projected for a number of
cereals, resulting from the agreement. Overall, however, the aggregate level
of losses is small compared with the gains.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Yeltsin opts to appease hardlinersas Fyodorov quits:
Departing finance chief says economic coup has occurred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin appeared yesterday to opt for an
inflationary economic policy to appease a parliament dominated by communist
and ultra-nationalists by accepting the departure of his reformist finance
minister.
Mr Boris Fyodorov resigned with a warning that an 'economic coup had taken
place' headed by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, which would
plunge the country into disaster.
Mr Fyodorov said he was quitting after a half-hour meeting with President
Yeltsin, who reportedly told him 'you cannot leave at a time like this and
throw everything away', but made no effort to meet any of his conditions for
staying.
The new acting finance minister will be Mr Sergei Dubinin, a deputy finance
minister, who is unlikely to fight for his reformist views with the same
energy as Mr Fyodorov. The changes come before an International Monetary
Fund mission is due in Moscow to examine economic reform prospects.
The latest stage in the battle over Russian economic policy could further
undermine the west's readiness to step up financial support for Russian
reform.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are
expected next month to discuss the economic crisis and political upheaval.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has invited his colleagues from
the US, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada to a meeting near of
Frankfurt.
The German minister has proposed that the meeting should be held on February
26 and that Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, should
attend. The ministers want, after the G7 talks, to meet Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the middle of the road reformer who last week was made economics
minister.
Mr Fyodorov said an inevitable rise in inflation, a fall in living standards
and a continuing drop in output would demonstrate there was no alternative
to the policies he had embraced. He warned that 'a dead-end reached at the
people's expense' could trigger a social explosion. 'Having in the cabinet
people who have caused the country colossal political and economic harm and
are opposed to reform is unacceptable.'
Mr Fyodorov told the Financial Times that his main reason for leaving was
President Yeltsin's refusal to fire Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank
chairman, whom he accused of undermining his attempts to institute fiscal
discipline and a tight monetary policy. He said: 'This was a must. If I
tightened (spending) in the government, they would go to Gerashchenko (for
money).'
Mr Yeltsin refused to offer Mr Fyodorov a promotion to first deputy prime
minister, meaning he would be under Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, the
pro-Communist deputy prime minister for agriculture whose departure Mr
Fyodorov had also demanded.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader whose Liberal Democratic
party scored a remarkable election victory last month, is to be prosecuted
for 'warmongering', the public prosecutor's office in Moscow said.

cent as favourable remarks concerning a potential compromise on the
government's political reform measures encouraged buying from futures and
foreign investors in late trading, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average added 489.85 at 19,138.21, after fluctuating between
18,759 and 19,155. The Topix index of all first section issues ended 30.94
higher at 1,550.32.
According to domestic brokers, a vague comment from Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a
leader in the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which was interpreted
as supporting the nation's political reform measures, sparked the late
afternoon buying.
Mr Gotoda was reported to have said that he has already decided how to vote
when the measures reach the lower house. Furthermore, about 70 other members
of the LDP have allegedly agreed to vote in favour of the bills, which the
upper house of parliament rejected last week.
Futures-led buy orders entered the market aggressively late in the session,
coupled with foreign purchases, which pushed the Nikkei average to its
intraday high. Foreign investors remained bullish on Japanese equities, but
most domestic players watched cautiously from the sidelines in spite of
available evidence which now suggests otherwise.
Mr Norio Okutsu, manager of futures trading at Nikko Securities, said the
day's gains marked a change in market sentiment, and he expects the buying
to last for the rest of this week.
But, judging from the weak state of the domestic economy, below-average
economic reports and the Bank of Japan's seeming unwillingness to cut the
official discount rate, it was still too early for unbridled optimism.
Volume was estimated at 360m shares, compared with Tuesday's final 281m.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 968 to 114, with 93 issues unchanged. But
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 0.01 off at 1,281.11.
On the trading floor, computer equipment makers moved higher in tandem with
the Nikkei average. NEC gained Y21 at Y980, and Fujitsu rose Y15 to Y920.
Steady buying lifted consumer electronic issues. Sony advanced Y100 to
Y5,870, Pioneer Electronic moved Y80 higher to Y2,920 and Victor climbed Y30
to Y934.
Domestic brokers benefited from the day's gains, Nomura Securities rising
Y50 to Y2,090, Nikko Securities Y40 to Y1,230 and Daiwa Securities Y40 to
Y1,490.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 431.10 ahead at 20,832.32 in volume of
55.7m shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets moved in sharply divergent directions. Australia and
Bombay were closed.
HONG KONG fell 2.2 per cent, pressured by profit-taking and fears over
Sino-British ties, although late demand lifted prices from their lows. The
Hang Seng index was finally down 251.37 at 11,239.57 after touching
11,150.71.
Profit-taking pushed prices lower from the start amid concern over the
future of Sino-British relations after China's warnings on Tuesday that it
will not honour debts or contracts for Hong Kong's new airport after it
takes over in the colony in 1997.
Hutchison Whampoa slipped HKDollars 1.50 to HK40.25 as it denied market
rumours that it planned to spin off part of Hongkong International
Terminals, in which it recently increased its stake.
MANILA dropped 3.4 per cent as the market continued to lack buyers due to
worries over looming oil price and wage rises, and talks between the
government and the International Monetary Fund. The composite index fell
103.83 to 2,985.61.
SEOUL moved ahead for the fourth consecutive day as blue chip shares were
favoured over low-priced counters. The composite index closed 2.28 higher at
894.34.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed a weak early trend to end higher across the board as
the market staged a strong rebound after forced selling had dragged prices
lower.
The composite index gained 17.51, or 1.7 per cent, at 1,029.31 after
touching a low of 967.92 in the morning as forced selling on clients unable
to meet margin calls sent share prices tumbling.
SINGAPORE recouped much of sharp early losses, helped by the rebound in the
Malaysian market. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.58 easier at
2,255.47 after plunging more than 2 per cent in morning trade.
TAIWAN finished modestly firmer in turnover that continued to shrink as
trading interest was diminished by the high level of outstanding margin
loans and seasonally high money market interest rates. The weighted index
put on 9.99 at 5,845.50.
BANGKOK staged a moderate rally near the end of a lacklustre session. The
SET index finished 11.54 higher at 1,459.14 in light turnover of Bt11.9bn.
NEW ZEALAND closed firmer in reasonably active trade in spite of the holiday
in Australia. The NZSE-40 capital index was up 3.42 at 2,284.11.
KARACHI finished higher as blue chip stocks posted fresh gains on
institutional support. The KSE 100-share index closed 5.31 ahead at
2,284.88.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Major launches bid to reassert his political authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will tomorrow attempt to relaunch the government's troubled
'back to basics' initiative in a speech which was being interpreted last
night as the start of a concerted push to rebuild his political authority.
The prime minister will use a visit to the north of England to set out his
'prospectus for 1994' amid mounting pressure for him to regain a grip on the
government after a month of turmoil.
Downing Street said last night that Mr Major would use the speech to explain
his policy priorities for the rest of the year.
Meanwhile, the war of words at Westminster over tax and spending priorities
rumbled on, with senior Conservatives disputing a claim by Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, that Labour had made no public spending commitments
whatsoever.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dismissed government allegations about
Labour's spending plans as 'bogus rubbish.' However, he warned the shadow
cabinet not to give the Conservatives ammunition by making irresponsible
promises.
Amid continue sniping last night among Tory MPs and ministers, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, faced heavy criticism from some rightwing Tory MPs
for his apparent failure to react quickly enough to Labour's attack on the
government's planned tax increases.
His deputy at the Treasury, Mr Michael Portillo, was being attacked from the
left of the party for seeking to raise his own profile ahead of any
challenge to Mr Major's leadership.
Amid a general mood of feverish disenchantment on the Tory backbenches,
rightwing MPs were also speculating about the possible candidacies of Mr
Michael Heseltine and Mr Douglas Hurd if Mr Major is threatened.
Yesterday's exchanges on Labour's spending pledges came after Mr Brown had
said in a morning radio interview that the party had 'no commitment to spend
money on anything.'
Mr Portillo promptly accused Mr Brown of 'stepping on the garden rake.' The
shadow chancellor's 'rash campaign against his colleagues' showed he
realised that that 'if you promise to spend more you will have to tax more',
he said.
The theme was taken up by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, who said that by making tax the 'main political issue', Labour had
scored 'a significant own goal'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo bounces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Internationally traded pharmaceuticals group Glaxo bounced in an uncertain
market as US sellers took a back seat, prompting technical buying in London.
The shares closed 13 1/2 stronger at 668p, with turnover heavier than its
average at 7.7m.
Dealers said US investors had been very heavy buyers of puts - a bearish
derivatives trade which allows the investor to sell stock later at a fixed
price and date. Put buying is often carried out as a hedge against possible
bad news, and in this case it was President Clinton's State of the Union
address on Tuesday night which had caused the nervousness.
In the event, most analysts were reassured or at least not flustered by the
president's comments on health care reform. The sellers stayed away and UK
dealers who had maintained short positions for some time bought back stock
to square their books.
However, one international trader said: 'Dollars 20 was a floor on the way
down and will be a resistance on the way up.' The UK closing price equated
to a US price of Dollars 19 3/4 .
Reports of a deal between Cadbury Schweppes and Cott Corporation, of Canada,
in which the UK group will bottle 'own label' drinks in continental Europe
undermined the shares.
Some in the market saw a conflict of interest between the two groups,
arguing that Cadbury could undermine its branded products by producing
cheaper generic versions for Cott. The battle between the two product types
has been a prominent feature in the food industry, particularly over the
past year.
However, Cadbury supporters argued that the move solved the company's spare
capacity problem. Cadbury shares retreated 5 to 526p.
Food retailers were again under pressure as William Low unveiled depressed
margins and cautioned over future trading. The shares dropped 17 to 174p.
Argyll slipped 7 to 274p, Tesco 2 to 230p and Kwik Save 8 to 621p. J.
Sainsbury rallied to close 4 ahead at 447p.
A profits warning from Hogg Group, the insurance broker, saw the company's
shares plunge 22 to a year's low of 130p. There was exceptionally heavy
trading in other broking stocks, however, with much of it transacted at
prices below ruling market levels, according to the Seaq ticker. Sedgwick
settled 3 off at 196p and Willis Corroon 6 lower at 229p on turnovers of
3.6m and 3.2m.
The bid story in the composite insurance sector refused to lie down, with
the market still excited by the prospect that UAP, Europe's second biggest
insurance group, might move against one of the quoted UK companies.
Independent Insurance rose to 314p before closing 3 ahead at 311p. And there
were also persistent stories that UAP may have targeted Royal Insurance's
telephone insurance division, The Insurance Service, the UK market's second
biggest direct insurance group after Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line
subsidiary. Dealers noted further underlying support for Royal Insurance, a
net 2 off at 327p.
Sun Life's good new business figures drove Transatlantic shares up 16 to
436p.
Banks took a back seat and reacted to widespread profit-taking. Smith New
Court was seen as a big seller of TSB, which retreated 4 to 280p on 3.2m
traded. Abbey National options were again heavily dealt, the underlying
shares closing 4 up at 506p.
Cray Electronics advanced 6 to 192p after an SG Warburg recommendation.
Warburg said the company's 1994 and 1995 price/earnings relatives offered
prospects for at least 35 to 40 per cent outperformance in the next 18 to 24
months.
The sale of the Brann Direct Marketing subsidiary to a management buy-out
for Pounds 8.15m, plus a buy note from BZW, drove ACT shares up 3 to 179p.
GEC was one of the market's most actively traded stocks, moving up a further
3 1/2 to 340p on turnover of 10m, still boosted by Hoare Govett's buy note.
Credit Lyonnais Laing and BZW were also recommending the stock.
Pearson rose 9 to 664p on recommendations from Lehman Brothers and Henderson
Crosthwaite. Lehman raised its 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds
270m and targeted a share price of 800p within 12 months.
Public relations group Shandwick improved 8, or 22 per cent, to 43 1/2 p as
SG Warburg recommended the stock up to 55p following figures on Tuesday.
Mirror Group Newspapers receded 4 1/2 to 195 1/2 p, with the market deciding
it was going to lose the battle for control of The Independent, the UK
newspaper. Mr Tony O' Reilly's Irish Independent is tipped by some to emerge
the winner, and United Newspapers, which shares a printing arrangement with
the Irish group, gained 7 at 687p on hopes of extra printing contracts.
Engineering group Bullough forged ahead 14 to 186p after improved figures.
BBA Group fell 9 to 207p after James Capel indicated that it preferred other
stocks in the engineering sector. The broker still has the stock on its hold
list. Volume rose to 5.3m.
British Steel brushed aside a profits downgrading from SG Warburg and closed
a penny firmer at 132 1/2 p. Turnover remained high, reaching 32m shares.

FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed retail fortunes
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of the mixed pattern of Christmas trading among the big
retail stores emerged yesterday as slightly disappointing results from WH
Smith contrasted with strong figures from Next.
Although Smith reported an increase in sales, profits came in towards the
bottom of market expectations and some brokers edged down full-year
forecasts. However, most took heart from the lower losses at Do It All, the
home improvement chain, and positive remarks from the Smith management on
trading.
WH Smith 'A' shares, marked sharply down initially on a hefty tax charge,
closed at 530 1/2 p, off 6 1/2 on the day. Turnover was a brisk 2.4m.
Next shares were also sold, but dealers attributed this to profit-taking
following the stock's sparkling new year run. Most of this was caused by
intense speculation of its sales increase over the Christmas period,
confirmed by yesterday's trading statement. Retail sales jumped 18 per cent
and Next Directory 9 per cent in the six months to the end of January.
Analysts' upgrades lifted profits forecasts some 5 per cent to around Pounds
70m. The shares eased 2 to 241p.

FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading

<TEXT>
A mildly disappointing UK gilts auction and weakness in the bund futures
gave traders a further opportunity for profit-taking in Footsie futures,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Early weakness after the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index
opened at 3,444 gave way to a modest advance as independent traders turned
sporadic buyers.
However, the outcome of the mid-morning UK bond auction covered just 1.21
times proved disappointing and sellers of March emerged, driving the
contract lower. The consequent weakness in UK gilts and in the German bunds
proved further reasons for selling and the contract fell to a 7-point
discount to cash early in the afternoon.
The day's low was 3,430, but bargain hunting as Wall Street improved in
early trading helped March recover some of the earlier loss. It finished at
3,439, down 9 from its previous close and at a 4-point discount to its fair
value premium to cash of about 7 points. Volume improved to 13,836 lots.
The expiry of the January stock options brought strong activity to the
traded options sector. Turnover rose to 50,704 contracts, though trading in
the FT-SE 100 option was little changed and volume closed at 13,682 lots.
Some 3,153 contracts were dealt in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
British Steel, the subject of January expiry, was the most actively traded
stock option with a day's total of 6,768 lots. It was followed by British
Gas at 2,624 and Abbey National, in which Kleinwort Benson was said to have
carried out a big trade in the June calls.

FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground following
gilt-edged auction - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness in the government bond market undermined UK equities yesterday,
leaving share prices to drift to lower levels after another directionless
session. Selling pressure appeared fairly modest, although the latest
reports from the retail sector gave little evidence of the bounce in
consumer spending for which the stock market is still searching.
The market opened lower in the face of weakness in Hong Kong and New York
overnight, but was then spurred briefly ahead by determined buying of the
Footsie future by at least two big US houses.
The Footsie gained a net 6.3 in the first hour of official trading but this
proved to be the best of the day. Traders were quick to see the bond futures
weaken ahead of the auction of Pounds 2.75bn of government securities, a
slightly unusual development, according to several leading traders.
Negative signals from the bond market quickly appeared following the
announcement of the auction result. Equities held up fairly well, however,
until early in the afternoon when share prices began to come under some
selling pressure from overseas.
At worst the market was 11 points down on the Footsie scale, before a calm
opening on Wall Street and a steadier trend in other European bourses helped
London to rally at the close. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at
3,436.1 for a net loss of 7.9 points.
The picture was much the same among the second line issues, where the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index continued its fall to register a loss for the day of 11.4 at
4,079.7. Seaq volume of 829.3m shares compared with 985m in the previous
session, with non-Footsie business consti-tuting 61 per cent of the total. A
slower trend this week in the market's second line stocks has contrasted
with the outperformance of the Mid 250 Index previously.
Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 2bn on Tuesday, indicating
that beneath a relatively calm surface the big institutional investors are
actively reshuffling portfolios, taking profits in a market now around 1.7
per cent off the trading peak reached less than a week ago. Technical
analysts suggest that some stocks may be overbought.
Uncertainty in UK government bonds is discouraging for the stock market,
where the currently very high valuations on share prices owe much to the
prolonged slide in bond yields. UK gilts gave investors returns of more than
20 per cent last year and some equity analysts fear that the sector may have
'seen its best for this cycle', as one trader expressed it.
The London market was helped by firmness among the international stocks as
sterling eased back from its recent strength; concern over the currency's
effects on export sales has surfaced over the past fortnight. Oil shares
looked steadier but the best features came among the global media stocks,
where Reuters continued to make headway.
There was little support for the retail sector, however, after the latest
round of sales reports did nothing to lift the clouds of uncertainty. There
were losses for the store sector leaders as fund managers appeared to be
lightening exposure to the conventional store leaders.
The rest of this week is expected to see London remaining somewhat on the
sidelines, with share prices vulnerable to bouts of profit-taking as global
markets respond to economic data from Japan and the US.

FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Earnings data help Dow pick
up after slide
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
After recording its biggest loss of the year in the previous session, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday in response to solid
corporate earnings and firmer bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow was 12.66 ahead at 3,908.00, while the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 improved 2.28 to 473.20. The American SE composite was 1.15
better at 481.74 and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.41 at 788.80. NYSE volume
was heavy, at 304.6m shares.
The negative tone which surfaced on Tuesday carried over to yesterday's
opening. No fresh economic readings were available to sway sentiment, and
early activity in the US Treasury market was light and convictionless.
Later, bond prices struggled into positive territory, and by late afternoon
the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 higher at 98 5/32 , with
the yield easing to 6.308 per cent.
But it was corporate earnings that captured the most attention. Among the
cyclical issues that were hit by profit-taking the previous day, Bethlehem
Steel rebounded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 1/4 on news of a strong fourth
quarter. Caterpillar, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 99 1/4 , Sears, Dollars 1
7/8 ahead at Dollars 53 7/8 , and Procter &amp; Gamble, Dollars 1 firmer at
Dollars 58 5/8 , also contributed to the Dow's advance.
Among the index's other component stocks, Philip Morris confirmed
expectations of lower operating income because of cigarette pricing cuts.
But improvements by other facets of its business lifted the shares Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 .
Owens-Corning Fiberglass advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 after
Merrill Lynch reaffirmed its favourable rating on the stock in anticipation
of solid results in the final 1993 quarter.
American Express slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 on profit-taking
after Tuesday's gain, but most banking issues were up sharply. Citicorp
jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 35 1/4 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 and Bankers Trust
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 80 1/2 .
Scott Paper's plans to reduce its worldwide workforce by 25 per cent pushed
the shares up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 in heavy trading.
Technology stocks were particularly active, but investors were unimpressed
by Compaq, which beat forecasts with record fourth-quarter earnings and
sales. Its share price fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 80 7/8 . Advanced Micro
Devices put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 20 5/8 after Compaq revealed plans to
begin buying AMD microchips.
International Business Machines, down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 56 3/8 ,
continued to slide amid uncertainty over its 1994 prospects.
Lotus Development rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 55 5/8 after a doubling of
net income in the final three months of 1993. But the positive sentiment
failed to lift other Nasdaq technology issues. Intel shed Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 63 5/8 . Canada
Toronto stocks snapped a four-day losing streak, ending slightly higher
after active trading. The TSE 300 index rose 4.0 to 4,460.3 and advances
outscored falls by 409 to 368 after volume of 71.2m shares.
Gold, transportation and real estate stocks led the way, all posting index
gains of more than 1 per cent. Industrial products fell 1.19 per cent.
PWA surged 30 cents to CDollars 1.50 on news that Air Canada, up CDollars
1/2 at CDollars 6, will discontinue all litigation that would prevent PWA
from completing a proposed partnership with AMR.

FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw leads the world in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland and Hungary are to be added to the IFC's emerging stock market
indices in April after turning in strong growth last year.
The Warsaw stock exchange, established in April 1991, was 'far and away the
best performing market in the world in 1993', said the IFC, a
Washington-based affiliate of the World Bank.
The WIG index climbed from 1,040.70 at the start of 1993 to 12,349, while
the IFC's price index showed a dollar gain of 717 per cent.
Turkey ranked second in the IFC's investable indices - stocks available to
foreign buyers - advancing 211 per cent, while the Philippines, Indonesia,
Thailand and Malaysia produced dollar rises of more than 100 per cent.
Zimbabwe's investable index of five stocks was introduced on June 30, but
still managed to show a 102 per cent climb.
Hungary's investable index produced a more modest 67 per cent gain, but the
IFC said that all the emerging markets it considers investable for foreign
buyers produced better dollar returns last year than the S &amp; P 500.
Mr Daniel Adams, IFC's vice-president for capital markets, commented that
many of the top performing markets were in countries which had undertaken
significant macro-economic and political reforms to help growth, including
the privatisation of state-owned businesses and the liberalisation of trade,
foreign investment and financial services.
'International investor confidence will continue to grow only with further
improvements in regulatory regimes, transparent market practices, adoption
of international audit and accounting standards, and efficient clearing and
settlement arrangements,' he said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong Roche advance takes
Zurich to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from a downturn among the emerging markets, bourses were generally
firmer, writes Our Markets Staff, improving on good economic news in Germany
and seemingly impervious to a general strike threat in Spain.
ZURICH posted a second consecutive record close, as the market again took
its lead from the strong performance of Roche. The SMI index rose 24.8 to
3,091.3.
Roche certificates rose SFr145 or 2.1 per cent to SFr6,945 on short covering
by foreign and domestic investors. The share has risen by a cumulative 3.8
per cent over the last two days, amid renewed speculation that the company
is planning a share split.
In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers fell SFr5 to SFr940 after reports that a
German regional environment minister had called on the group to bear the
cost of cleaning up northern German beaches after packets of one of its
pesticides were washed ashore.
FRANKFURT was cheered by further good news on inflation from the states of
Bavaria and Hesse and retrieved most of Tuesday's post-bourse losses, the
Dax index closing just 7.61 lower on the session at 2,119.17.
The afternoon saw the Ibis-indicated Dax stage an eventual recovery to
2,128.66 after a period of weakness but Mr Thomas Nolten, of B Metzler in
Frankfurt, saw no message for investors in this. 'For several days,' he
said, 'equities have simply followed movements on the bund market.'
Influenced additionally by the movement of Dax futures, the market was
currently a traders' preserve, said Mr Nolten, with investors on the
sidelines awaiting German M3 figures. Inflated by special factors, M3 could
rise by 7 1/2 to 8 per cent for December.
Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM9.1bn. Lufthansa, which dropped DM9.50 last
Friday on profit-taking, put it back on again to close at DM189 yesterday
with dealers powerless to explain the airline's gains. Mr Nolten saw buyers
around for the retailer, Asko, but no stories to explain why the stock was
up DM40 to DM1,265 yesterday, and by DM155, or 14 per cent over the past
three days.
PARIS closed the day slightly firmer with even Bouygues, the construction
group, adding FFr4 to FFr735 in spite of reporting disappointing results.
The CAC-40 index rose 4.01 to 2,282.35.
Bouygues turned in its estimated results for 1993 after the close on
Tuesday, showing a steeper decline then had been expected, owing to losses
in its property division. Elsewhere in the sector Lafarge Coppee, up FFr5.30
to FFr474.00, said that it would not release its results until mid-March,
but would make a comment on trading activity at a meeting today.
Moulinex, which is not included in the CAC-40, performed well after
announcing that it hoped to break even in the nine months to the end of
December. The shares gained FFr9 to FFr128.
MILAN picked up after a weak start, prompted by renewed political worries,
as US investors returned as buyers later in the day. The Comit index rose
2.36 to 627.57.
Turnover remained high, in spite of a two hour failure of the electronic
trading system, after Tuesday's all time record L895bn, which compared with
average daily turnover of a mere L50bn during the summer of 1992.
Demand centred on the banks after BCI reported on Tuesday that parent
company profits rose 1.7 per cent in 1993, in spite of big increases in tax
payments and bad loan provisions. BCI rose L171 or 3.6 per cent to L4,890
and Credito Italiano added L107 or 4.9 per cent to L2,306.
Among smaller stocks attracting renewed attention, Alitalia was L48.60 or 6
per cent higher at L846.30 after the weekend management changes and
indications that a more dynamic future is planned.
MADRID balanced an ongoing rally in bank stocks against the threat posed by
today's general strike, coming out strongly on the credit side with the
general index 5.46 higher at a new high of 348.40.
Turnover was virtually unchanged, a high Pta50.8bn. In banks, BBV rose by
another Pta225 to Pta3,325 and Popular by Pta480 to Pta16,780.
AMSTERDAM softened slightly, the AEX index down 0.67 to 425.62, given
weakness in the blue chips, such as Royal Dutch, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 210.80.
The AEX index eased 0.67 to 425.62.
ING went in the opposite direction, rising Fl 1.20 to Fl 87.30, on news that
it might be close to the sale of its UK insurance unit, Victory.
ISTANBUL dropped another 7 per cent, the composite index falling 1,598.57 to
21,128.64 as interbank overnight rates remained at 190 per cent, and the
central bank twice sold dollars to try to reverse the fall of the lire.
Incorporating rapid currency depreciation, the index has lost 35 per cent in
dollar terms over the past 13 days.
ATHENS was unmoved by new interest rate cuts, tumbling 2.6 per cent
profit-taking. The general index closed 29.48 lower at 1,114.01.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Profit-takers chip at Pounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technical factors caused sterling to lose ground yesterday during London
trading, but analysts said it remained underpinned by sound economic
fundamentals, writes Philip Gawith.
Against the background of another quiet day in the markets, the pound
weakened against the D-Mark on profit-taking following the currency's recent
failure to break through the DM2.62 level. It also ended lower against the
dollar.
The atmosphere in the markets was likened to a 'phoney war', with currencies
trading in fairly narrow ranges awaiting fresh information to give them
renewed impetus. The relative weakness of the D-Mark continued to trigger
some activity, particularly in European currencies, with the Portuguese
authorities yesterday following the example of the Spanish and Belgian
central banks in announcing a rate cut.
The yen remained fairly stable yesterday following the apparent breakdown of
trade talks between the US and Japan. The Japanese currency finished in
London at Y110.420 to the dollar, up from Tuesday's close of Y111.155. It
ended New York trading at Y110.09.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said: 'The yen is
remaining well underpinned despite the political and economic uncertainty.
The market perceives the Japanese political situation as indicating the US
authorities wanting to keep the yen firm.' Economic and political
uncertainty normally undermine a currency, but in this case a firmer yen is
seen as assisting the US in achieving its aim of narrowing the trade deficit
with Japan.
Earlier the dollar had weakened during Japanese trading following reports
that Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the US think-tank, the Institute for
International Economics (IIE), would revise his target range for the dollar
to Y90 to Y110 from Y100 to Y110. Dealers said Mr Bergsten was believed to
have considerable influence in US government circles.
Others questioned the logic that had taken the US currency lower, saying a
dollar around Y90 to Y100 would not be good either for Japan or the world
economy. It was noted also that the US Federal Reserve intervened last
August to support the dollar when it weakened towards Y100.
Mr Lyons said that while he still regarded the yen as a strong currency in
the longer term, there remained a short term risk if the Japanese
government's current political difficulties lead to an early election, which
would make the yen vulnerable.
Sterling fell against the dollar, closing in London at Dollars 1.4926, down
from Dollars 1.494 on Monday. It also declined nearly a pfennig to DM2.6089,
from Monday's DM2.6187.
Observers said the pound appeared to have run out of steam, having
appreciated steadily against both currencies in recent weeks. That it has
not retreated further was due to underlying bullish sentiment, based on a
raft of recent figures indicating solid economic growth with little
inflationary threat.
Analysts said it was unlikely that yesterday's decline by the pound
reflected concern about the government's political weakness. Mr Steve
Barrow, economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'The political factors have
been here for quiet a while, and if they were going to have any bearing they
would probably have done so a few weeks ago.'
The newly independent Bank of France will be in the spotlight today as its
monetary council meets again. The bank will be setting monetary targets for
1994, but more attention will focus on whether it is prepared to ease
monetary policy independently of a Bundesbank lead. Although underlying
economic conditions are thought to support a rate cut, it is not expected.
Most observers anticipate that the bank will not want to compromise its
credibility with an early monetary easing. Mr Barrow said: 'The bank is
still finding its feet as far as monetary policy is concerned. It would run
the risk of losing its credibility before it was even gained if it is seen
so soon doing something different from its predecessor.' The French franc
closed slightly easier against the D-Mark at FFr3.393, after Monday's
FFr3.390.
The D-Mark was generally higher in European trading. Hopes of lower interest
rates declined in spite of encouraging inflation figures, because of the
prospect of poor German M3 money supply data for December and the recent
weakness of the currency.
Bundesbank deputy president Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said German money
supply growth will miss the Bundesbank's 6.5 per cent target ceiling in
December, a judgment endorsed by Mr Otmar Issing, another Bundesbank board
member. The D-Mark closed at DM1.7480 to the dollar, up from DM1.7528 on
Tuesday. In New York it finished at DM1.7450.
The Bank of Portugal cut its regular intervention rates by  1/4 percentage
point to 9.50 per cent yesterday. The rate cut initially prompted a strong
move ahead in the escudo, but later in European trading it returned back to
levels seen late on Tuesday of around Es100.36-41 to the D-Mark.
The Bank of England yesterday provided late assistance of about Pounds 420m
in its daily money market operations. It had earlier provided the market
with Pounds 219m of assistance at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent.
The early forecast of a shortage of Pounds 950m was later revised to about
Pounds 800m.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean group faces big futures
losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, yesterday launched an investigation
into 'serious irregularities' in its futures trading on the London Metal
Exchange that could result in losses of about USDollars 100m.
The deputy head of sales, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, was sacked and three other
senior executives, including Mr Owen Guerrini, head of sales, resigned.
Nervous tremors went through the London and New York metals markets after
the announcement, by Mr Alejandro Noemi, president of Codelco, the world's
biggest copper producer which had estimated 1993 profits of Dollars 115m.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said:
'People will not want to establish substantial positions in any direction
until Codelco's situation is made clearer.' If there was any expectation
that a major player like Codelco was to liquidate contracts to buy copper,
'others would sell very quickly, it would have a snowball effect and a big
impact on the copper market.'
But Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services
group, said Codelco was a big, state-owned organisation well able to meet
its obligations. 'I would be amazed if Codelco liquidated its positions, so
I don't imagine this having much of an impact on the copper market.'
Codelco's Mr Noemi said accountants Price Waterhouse would conduct an
independent investigation into the potential losses. 'We have projected a
Dollars 100m loss, but it could be more and it could be less. A final figure
will be known in about two weeks,' he said.
The scandal could have profound effects on the future of Codelco, which
accounts for about 20 per cent of Chile's export earnings.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British oil brigade leads
charge into Crimea - Jill Barshay reports on a joint-venture project for
deep-water drilling in the Black Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British-Ukrainian Crimean Petroleum Company will drill the first deep
off-shore oil well in the Black Sea this spring, following the completion
last month of a preliminary geological study last month that confirmed the
location of a likely oil deposit in the sea's north-western shelf.
If the well, 3,300m below the sea floor and 90km off the Crimean coastline,
strikes oil the joint venturers expect an annual oil yield of 2m tonnes and
additional investment of Dollars 1.5bn into the sea-shelf project.
'This will be the first deep oil well in the history of the Black Sea. No
one has ever tried this before,' says Mr Nikolai Ilnitsky, deputy general
director of Chornomorneftgaz (which translates as Black-Sea-Oil-Gas), the
state enterprise representing the Ukrainian side.
'We have a very, very exciting prospect,' says Mr Richard Humphreys of JP
Kenny Exploration, the British partner of Crimean Oil Company. 'The Black
Sea is one of the few areas in the world that is unexplored. . . 'We have a
licence for one of the most promising areas. We are looking forward to
drilling the first well'.
Despite the high risks, the virtually unexploited Black Sea shelf has
attracted British energy companies, such as JP Kenny and British Gas, with
their advanced North Sea oil drilling technology.
British Gas signed a co-operation agreement last month with Chornomorneftgaz
to conduct geological research in the Black Sea's eastern Kerch shelf.
Ukraine is eager for British know-how because Soviet technology not equal to
drilling farther down than 70m, keeping off-shore exploration near the
coastline. But the Black Sea's oil potential is much farther off-shore where
the water depth is 80m and oil deposits are thousands of metres below the
sea floor.
American, Dutch and Norwegian companies also have experience with deep sea
drilling, but the British have come first to the Crimea, where they fought
against the Russians 140 years ago.
Mr Humphreys said: 'British companies are very well placed. Ukraine needs
western sea technology which can go down thousands of metres. We've done
this in the North Sea'.
Ukraine, in turn, is eager for western investment to develop domestic oil
sources in order to reduce their 90 per cent oil and gas dependence on
neighbouring Russia and alleviate their current energy crisis.
In Crimea, where the joint venture is based, energy shortages have shut down
35 per cent of all enterprises and forced another 55 per cent to operate at
half capacity. Aircraft at the capital's airport are grounded for lack of
fuel and most scheduled flights have been cancelled.
Anxious to keep oil at home, the Ukrainian government has reserved the first
option to buy JP Kenny's 49 per cent share of Crimea Petroleum Company's
production at world market prices. If Ukraine is unable to pay, JP Kenny may
export the oil abroad, according to the joint-venture agreement, signed in
April of last year.
Despite the Ukrainian and British sides' optimistic assessments, deep off
shore drilling in Crimea is as fraught with risk as it is in other areas.
Huge drilling expenditures (Dollars 7m-Dollars 8m for each drilling attempt)
are often for naught, as even the most thorough seismic analysis cannot
reduce the two-to-one odds against striking oil in the seas.
In addition, the unsettled Ukrainian-Russian territorial dispute over Crimea
could threaten current contracts, which have been negotiated with Ukrainian
authorities.
Crimea was transferred from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction only 40 years
ago. Many Crimean Russians, who make up 70 per cent of the population, would
like to reunite with their ethnic kin.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pepper production forecast to
plunge this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World pepper production is set to plunge this year with an estimated
103,000m tonnes of exports available compared with 164,000m tonnes last year
according to a report by Man Producten, an Amsterdam trader.
The shortfall in output led to a steep rise in prices last year and although
the market has since undergone a correction, it remains strong. Lack of
investment in old and less productive pepper plantations and farmers' lack
of interest in growing pepper following a period of low prices in the late
1980s has seen a substantial decline in the availability of pepper
worldwide.
World pepper demand cannot be met by new crop supplies, but must be
partially satisfied by selling stocks, the report states. There was a large
drawdown of stocks last year and stocks are expected to fall further this
year. Man Producten expects this year's demand to be close to consumption of
between 145,000m tonnes and 155,000m tonnes.
Traders expect a long-term increase in pepper prices, which are at present
about Dollars 2,950 a tonne for white in Rotterdam and 73 cents a pound for
black in New York. The white pepper price soared to touch Dollars 4,100 a
tonne in September from Dollars 1,100 a year before. Black pepper also
increased from historic lows with the New York price doubling to 81 cents a
pound in September.

<TEXT>
European Farm Commissioner Rene Steichen yesterday presented farm price
proposals for 1994-95 (July/June) aimed at giving farmers and traders
continuity and stability, reports Reuter from Brussels.
The proposals would to a large extent implement cuts in the cereals, dairy
and beef sectors decided under the reform of the common agricultural policy
in May 1992.
Plans to reform the wine, fruit and vegetables and sugar sectors are due to
be presented later this year.
'It would not be in anyone's interest to delay the annual price decisions by
proposing piecemeal changes,' Mr Steichen said.
European Union farm ministers will start to examine the Commission's
proposals at their next meeting on February 21-22.
Mr Steichen told a news conference he had very little budgetary room for
manoeuvre. Farm spending was likely to total Ecu36.678bn (Pounds 29bn) in
1994, overshooting the budget limit by some Ecu200m, he said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Output cut hopes lift aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium prices climbed strongly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday in
the expectation that producers will soon start cutting world-wide output.
However, some analysts were recommending caution about the outcome of last
week's negotiations, at which some of the world's big aluminium producers
attempted to work out a formula for global annual output cuts of 1.5m to 2m
tonnes.
Reports from Moscow suggested the government was working on a decree calling
for the Russian smelters to cut output by 500,000 tonnes a year. However,
various news agency reports also said the smelter managements were not keen
on the idea and were much more concerned about an argument with their
electricity suppliers about rapidly rising energy costs.
Yesterday the LME the price of aluminium for delivery in three months closed
at Dollars 1,235.75 a tonne, up Dollars 31.25, and in after hours trading
advanced to Dollars 1,240. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, suggested that 'the market might be running ahead
of itself. Any improvement in prices will stall until we actually see action
rather than hear about intentions. If the market is disappointed, the price
will drop sharply again'.
Mr Ted Arnold at the Merrill Lynch financial services group said the
agreement between the big aluminium producing countries had taken too long
to reach and contained too many caveats. It was unlikely that governments
could find a way to enforce the arrangements, so any agreement was likely to
unravel.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greece to offer onshore and
offshore concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Public Petroleum Corporation (DEP) plans to offer concessions for
onshore and offshore oil exploration in western Greece later this year.
Blocks in Epirus and the Ionian Sea would be made available to international
bidders after parliament passed a new law on oil exploration and
exploitation, 'probably in late spring', according to Mrs Teresa
Fokianou-Malaveta, the corporation's chairman.
DEP's research department said seismic studies in Epirus produced
encouraging results, while test drilling in the Ionian Sea had established
the existence of oil-bearing levels, she added.
Under production-sharing arrangements included in the new legislation DEP
would have the right to participate with a minority stake in consortia
exploiting oil deposits in Greece.
Meanwhile, a new test drilling is being made by North Aegean Petroleum
Corporation at the Prinos offshore field near Thassos island in the
north-eastern Aegean.
The drilling is the first by NAPC, a Canadian-led consortium, since Greece
and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1987 over conflicting claims to
offshore oil rights in the Aegean. The dispute has prevented NAPC from
exploring for oil east of Thassos.
Production at the Prinos field, situated west of Thassos in Greek coastal
waters, has declined from 26,000 barrels a day in the early 1980s to about
8,000 b/d last year.
However, the introduction of gas re-injection techniques, using natural gas
from the nearby South Kavalla offshore field, has lifted production to
around 12,000 b/d. If successful, the Dollars 5.3m drilling project,
reaching 2,000 metres below sea level, could yield up to 6,000 b/d, Mrs
Fokianou-Malaveta said.
The Greek government last year signed a new six-year production agreement
with NAPC, giving the consortium a more favourable tax arrangement than
previously. The consortium had considered shutting down its operations
because of the political obstacles to exploiting known oil and gas deposits
east of Thassos. It has invested Dollars 700m in Greece since it won the
Prinos concession 20 years ago.
Denison Mines of Canada controls 58 per cent of the consortium. DEP holds 15
per cent, with subsidiaries of three other international oil companies,
Wintershall Greece, Hellenic Overseas Holdings and White Shields Greece,
holding smaller stakes.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts recover their poise after
post-auction dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds dipped immediately after the release of disappointing
results to the Bank of England's Pounds 2.75bn auction of stock due 2010
yesterday. However, they recovered their poise relatively quickly in the
belief that the market's upward trend was still intact.
Analysts said that prices were supported by the positive outlook for
inflation in the UK and the fact that the Bank was well ahead in its funding
programme.
In addition, traders said they were confident that most of yesterday's
supply of gilts had gone straight into the hands of domestic institutions
and were unlikely to come back into the market.
The cover on the auction was 1.21 times, which compared with market
expectations of around 1 1/2 times, while the tail was two basis points,
above hopes of one basis point or less.
The March long gilt future on Liffe fell as low as 118 23/32 but by the end
of the day it was trading around 119 1/16 , down  13/32 points on the day.
By contrast, long-dated gilts fell around  5/8 points.
More positive news on inflation and renewed hopes of an early cut in
interest rates helped German government bonds to break their losing streak
yesterday.
The March bund future on Liffe rebounded from an intraday low of 99.74 to
trade around 100.21 late in the afternoon, up 0.40 on the day.
Some analysts were encouraged that the March future had bounced back above
par and they were confident that it would remain above par for the
foreseeable future.
However, they noted that most of the activity was in the futures market
whereas the cash market was reasonably quiet.
A disappointing reception to the Japanese ministry of finance's monthly
auction of 10-year government bonds kept the downward pressure on Japanese
government bonds yesterday.
Although the size of the auction, at Y1,000bn, came in below the market's
expectations of between Y1,200bn and Y1,300bn, the coupon was set at 3.7 per
cent as opposed to hopes of a coupon of 3.8 per cent.
As a result, the bid-to-cover ratio was just 1.44 (which traders said was
the worst in recent history), the average yield was 3.904 per cent and the
lowest successful bid was at 3.958 per cent.
The March future dropped as low as 113.44 in Tokyo trading before closing at
113.60, down more than a point on the day.
The future later bounced back to around 114.20 in London but dealers warned
that the outlook for the market remained vulnerable due to persistent
worries about supply and the likely re-allocation of assets from bonds to
equities.
US bond prices moved higher yesterday in spite of lacklustre bidding in the
Treasury's auction of Dollars 12bn in new five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at
98 3/16 , after slipping as much as  1/4 early in the session. The yield
eased to 6.306 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note inched  1/32
ahead to 99 3/4 , to yield 4.115 per cent.
The session got off to a slow start, with a winter storm over much of the
east coast. Traders allowed prices to drift lower but as activity picked up,
there were modest gains across the maturity range.
After a disappointing follow-through on Tuesday's sale of new two-year
notes, the market had approached the afternoon's five-year auction with
caution. In the event, dealer-led demand was just fair. The notes were
awarded at a yield of 5.10 per cent, on the weak side of expectations.
Afterwards, when-issued five-year bonds dipped, but soon firmed in
speculative buying. Near the session's end, the yield was at 5.052 per cent,
against 5.099 per cent at the opening, with the price  1/16 ahead at 100
9/32.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Building society launches FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market absorbed two sterling floating-rate note issues and
several US dollar convertible bonds while dealers prepared for further large
bond issues in coming days.
The UK's National &amp; Provincial Building Society issued Pounds 150m of
five-year floating-rate notes paying a coupon of three-month Libor plus 10
basis points.
Most syndicate officials complained that the deal was too tightly priced,
and even lead manager Goldman Sachs conceded that it was aggressive and
would take a while to place.
'Considering the borrower's rating, the pricing was completely unjustified,'
said a trader.
He pointed out that a recent five-year FRN for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society yielded 19 basis points over Libor at its re-offer price,
in spite of its higher credit rating.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is rated Aa3 by Moody's compared to National &amp;
Provincial's A1 rating. A five-year floater from A1-rated Bradford &amp;
Bingley, issued some three weeks ago, currently trades at 21 basis points
above Libor, another dealer pointed out.
The day's other sterling floater, a Pounds 100m issue for the Household
Mortgage Corporation via Lehman Brothers, met a slightly warmer reception.
'It was tight, but fair,' said one syndicate official. The notes, which
mature in March 2021 but are callable from 1997, ended around 99.95 bid,
slightly above their 99.925 re-offer price.
With nearly Pounds 2bn of FRNs maturing this year and another Pounds 2bn -
Pounds 3bn of floaters with 5 per cent coupon floors likely to be called if
short-term interest rates fall below that level, traders are expecting heavy
FRN issuance in comings months. Until more supply emerges, the redemptions
are expected to generate strong demand for FRNs, especially from building
societies, which are keen buyers of this paper.
Elsewhere, the Brazilian power company Electrobras launched Dollars 150m of
eight-year bonds via Nomura International. The bonds will be priced on
Friday at a yield spread of 350 basis points over US Treasuries.
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation issued the first Hong Kong dollar
range-floaters: HKDollars 200m of two-year notes via Morgan Stanley. The
notes pay the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor) plus 1.25
per cent, on the days that the Hibor fixing falls within a specified range.
The market also saw three new convertible bonds: Dollars 200m of 10-year
bonds for Malaysia's United Engineers, Dollars 175m of six-year bonds for
the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India and Dollars 125m
of 10-year bonds for the Thai borrower Tanayong.
'This is classic convertible climate: with yields so low worldwide, they
offer a decent coupon and the chance to gain on the equity side while stock
markets are still so buoyant,' said one dealer.
The Province of Ontario is set to launch its long-awaited USDollars 1.5bn
global floating-rate notes today. They are expected to have a maturity of
around 5 1/2 years and traders are calling for a yield spread of between six
and 10 basis points above Libor. The deal will be arranged by Lehman
Brothers and Merrill Lynch.
Meanwhile, China is expected to issue its Dollars 1bn 10-year global bond in
the middle of next week, with Merrill Lynch as lead manager. The bonds are
expected to yield between 80 and 85 basis points above the relevant US
Treasury bond.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: More than 1bn futures
contracts traded in 1993
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Global trading of futures and options on exchanges exceeded 1bn contracts in
1993, a 20 per cent increase on 1992 volume, according to full-year figures
released yesterday by the Futures Industry Association, the US trade body
for the futures industry.
However, the 13 per cent rate of growth recorded by US exchanges was
substantially lower than the 34 per cent gain recorded by exchanges outside
the US.
Of the top 10 exchanges in the world in 1993, only four were US-based, while
four - Liffe in London, the Matif in Paris, Germany's DTB and the London
Metal Exchange - were European. However, the fastest growing exchanges were
BM&amp;F in Brazil, where volume rose 49 per cent to 52m contracts, and Tiffe in
Japan, where volume grew 55 per cent to 24m contracts, which were placed
seventh and 10th respectively.
At the top of the table, the Chicago Board of Trade increased its lead on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with 179m contracts and 147m contracts
respectively. In third place, Liffe's volume rose 35 per cent to just under
100m.
FIA volume figures exclude options on individual stocks.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Dunedin trusts issue
commercial paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two UK investment trusts managed by Dunedin Fund Managers have issued
commercial paper for the first time.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust has signed a Pounds 150m programme, while
Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust has signed a Pounds 75m programme,
both arranged by NatWest Capital Markets.
Both will use the proceeds to lower borrowing costs by about 50 basis
points, according to Mr David McCraw, a director of Dunedin Fund Managers.
The proceeds will refinance syndicated loans which have been fully drawn and
invested in the UK gilts market.
'We believe that these programmes with their first class credit ratings are
a highly efficient means of gearing,' Mr McCraw said. The programmes are
rated A1+ by Standard &amp; Poors and P1 by Moody's.
Sumitomo Bank and First Chicago have set up a programme for repackaging
trade receivables of European companies and selling them to US investors, in
the form of asset-backed commercial paper.
So far, Dollars 300m of US commercial paper has been issued through a
conduit administered by First Chicago, but the potential size of the
programme is Dollars 3bn.
Similar programmes already exist. For example, NatWest has a vehicle for
securitising corporate loans, called Thames Funding, which also issues
commercial paper in the US market. However, Sumitomo is believed to be the
first Japanese bank to securitise European assets through the US commercial
paper market. Sumitomo and First Chicago already run a similar programme in
the US market backed by US receivables.
Most of the receivables are originated from investment-grade European
companies or subsidiaries, many of whom are clients of Sumitomo.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Flotation planned for Armco
Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Armco and Kawasaki Steel, the US and Japanese steel companies, are planning
to float their US joint venture, Armco Steel, as part of a Dollars 590m
recapitalisation of the heavily indebted company.
The transaction will effectively wipe out the two companies' existing equity
interest in the joint venture, which produces flat-rolled steel for the
auto, appliance and construction industries.
The financing is among the largest of a series of recapitalisations by steel
companies in recent months, a period in which companies have taken advantage
of an upturn in their shares to return to the public markets. It also marks
a decision by Armco and Kawasaki not to commit further capital to their
joint venture, which has racked up losses of more than Dollars 800m since
the beginning of 1990. The company returned to profit in the third quarter
of last year.
The two joint venture partners plan to raise Dollars 315m of new equity for
Armco Steel to pay off much of its existing debt and reduce its pension fund
deficit.
According to a filing in the US, the flotation will involve 15.75m shares at
around Dollars 20 each, equivalent to more than 75 per cent of the company's
equity after the recapitalisation is complete.
In addition, Kawasaki will exchange Dollars 100m of subordinated debt owed
it by Armco Steel for 5m shares in the newly capitalised company, giving it
a 24 per cent stake. The current equity in the company will be all but
extinguished in the transaction, reducing Armco's existing 50 per cent
interest to less than 1 per cent.
Armco Steel also plans to raise Dollars 275m of new long-term debt, leaving
it with Dollars 412m of long-term debt after the recapitalisation has been
completed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bethlehem Steel jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 yesterday
as the US's second biggest steelmaker reported a continuing improvement in
its operating position and a further restructuring charge.
Projecting another year of strong steel demand, Mr Curtis Barnette,
chairman, said the economic recovery and only a small rise in imports
'should result in 1994 domestic industry shipments which match or exceed
1993's estimated 87m tons.
'We expect that Bethlehem will be profitable for the year 1994,' he added.
The rise in its shares reversed a bout of profit-taking the day before,
confirming Bethlehem as one of the best performing large company stocks this
year. Bethlehem has risen from below Dollars 17 in early December as
investors have sensed a revival in the fortunes of steel companies.
Yesterday, the company reported a Dollars 350m charge (Dollars 290m after
tax) to cover a revised modernisation plan for its structural products
business and to write down a coke plant at its Sparrows Point works. The
plan will result in the loss of 2,000 jobs, compared with 1,500 expected
under an earlier plan.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Canadian airlines end two-year
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air Canada has called off its two-year fight with rival Canadian
International Airlines, saying 'it is time for both of us to move forward
and focus on rebuilding our industry'.
In a statement, Air Canada said it is ending all litigation 'that would
preclude' PWA, Canadian's parent company, from concluding a CDollars 246m
(USDollars 187m) deal with AMR, parent of American Airlines.
AMR had insisted Canadian withdraw from the Gemini ticket reservation system
and join its own Sabre system as a condition of injecting CDollars 246m
equity.
But Air Canada, a co-founder of Gemini with PWA, maintained Canadian
Airlines was contracted as a Gemini shareholder until 1997.
Air Canada would not add to the statement. But the industry said it means
the court battle over Canadian's membership in the Gemini reservation system
is over.
At the same time Air Canada issued its statement, the federal government
said it will soon announce arrangements for Air Canada to get access to
Japan and Hong Kong - two destinations already served by Canadian.
Air Canada had failed to persuade the public that it should become the sole
Canadian international carrier and Canadian Airlines should 'concentrate on
the domestic market', said Mr Stephen Garmaise, analyst with First Marathon
Securities in Toronto.
'We'll continue to have two international carriers and Canadian may be ready
to pay CDollars 10m to CDollars 20m to exit from Gemini.'
PWA recently won renewal of CDollars 100m in government loan guarantees. A
deal with Air Canada and the equity infusion would allow it to move ahead
with a financial restructuring, with massive dilution facing existing
stockholders.

<TEXT>
Scott Paper, the Phila-delphia-based manufacturer of personal care paper
products and printing papers, is to cut its worldwide workforce by 25 per
cent, or 8,300 employees.
The company took a Dollars 381m charge on fourth-quarter earnings to cover
the job cuts. More than half of the lay-offs, or about 4,500 jobs, will
occur in its international operations and affiliates.
The company intends to shut down some of its older tissue manufacturing
plants in the US and Europe and to restructure its coated paper business.
Both businesses have been pressured by worldwide overcapacity and
competitive pricing. Scott said its affiliate in Mexico would restructure.
Mr Philip Lippincott, Scott's chairman, said the workforce reductions should
bring the company's employment rate into line with its lowest-cost
competitors.
'These actions are part of our efforts to take control of our destiny in the
slow-growth, highly-competitive and value-focused environment of the 1990s,'
he said.
Before the restructuring charge, Scott reported fourth-quarter earnings fell
to Dollars 34.4m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 44.8m or 61 cents per
share in the same quarter last year. Including the charge, Scott had a loss
of Dollars 379.3m or Dollars 5.01 per share for the quarter.
Scott's fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 1.20bn, down from Dollars 1.28bn a
year earlier.
For the year, before special charges, Scott had income of Dollars 177.6m or
Dollars 1.58 per share, down from Dollars 167.2m or Dollars 2.26 last year.
With charges, Scott had a loss of Dollars 277m or Dollars 3.75 for the year.
Scott's 1993 sales were Dollars 4.7bn, down from Dollars 5bn. The company's
debt increased by Dollars 201m during 1993.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lower copper prices hit sales at
Asarco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asarco, the US integrated copper company whose Arizona operations have been
dogged by flooding problems, reported a fourth-quarter operating loss before
tax benefits and special gains of Dollars 59.3m or Dollars 1.42 per share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 98.6m or Dollars 2.36 per share a year
earlier.
During the quarter, Asarco began recognising income from its 80 per cent
ownership of Corporacion Minera Nor Peru, a Peruvian mining concern.
That recognition, and special accounting treatment, gave Asarco a one-time
gain of Dollars 104.5m. Including the gain, Asarco reported a profit of
Dollars 73.7m or Dollars 1.78 per share for the quarter.
Although the company managed to trim operating losses, it said that its
fourth-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 435.5m, from Dollars 471.9m in the
fourth quarter of 1992.
The decline in fourth-quarter sales was linked to lower copper and lead
prices. Asarco said that its average realised price for copper dropped to 78
cents per pound in the quarter, from Dollars 1 a pound a year earlier, and
the average price for lead to 21 cents a pound from 24 cents.
For the full year, Asarco's operating losses hit Dollars 134.6m or Dollars
3.23 per share before taxes and other benefits, on sales of Dollars 1.73bn.
That compares with losses of Dollars 69.1m or Dollars 1.66 per share on
sales of Dollars 1.9bn for the 1992 fiscal year.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday revealed improved
fourth-quarter operating earnings in spite of a sharp downturn in revenues.
Net income on continuing operations was Dollars 64m, or Dollars 2.02 a
share, on sales of Dollars 779m. In the corresponding period of 1992,
comparable net earnings were Dollars 60m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, after
stripping out a Dollars 95m tax credit and an after-tax gain of Dollars 14m
on the sale of securities.
Earnings in the 1992 period were struck on sales of Dollars 911m. This was
about 13 per cent greater than the comparable 1993 figure.
Results for both periods exclude contributions by the company's space
systems division, which General Dynamics agreed last month to sell to Martin
Marietta for Dollars 208.5m in cash.
Mr James Mellor, president and chief executive, said the company's long-term
outlook had improved. 'Our low debt and year-end cash balance of Dollars
585m provide us with liquidity and financial capacity to build the value of
General Dynamics going forward,' he said.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 270m on
sales of Dollars 3.2bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 305m and
marginally higher sales a year earlier.
Total net earnings in 1993 were Dollars 885m, including a Dollars 645m gain
on the sale of the aircraft business. In 1992, net earnings totalled Dollars
815m, including a gain of Dollars 374 on the sale of a variety of smaller
operations.

Fourth-quarter profits at Newmont Mining Corporation were lifted by higher
gold prices, rising production at its largest subsidiary, Newmont Gold, and
income from the start of gold mining operations in Peru, writes Laurie
Morse.
Income rose to Dollars 16.9m in the quarter, or 19 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 4m, or 3 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 160.8m, up from Dollars 140.9m a year
ago. The company said the average gold price received during the quarter was
Dollars 388 per ounce, up from Dollars 362 per ounce in the fourth quarter
of 1992.
For the year, net income was Dollars 133.1m, or Dollars 1.71 a share, up
from Dollars 79m, or Dollars 1.13, the previous year. The 1993 results
include a tax benefit of Dollars 38.5m. Sales for the year were Dollars
634.3m, against Dollars 613.2m in 1992.
Newmont owns 38 per cent of the Minera Yanacocha gold mine in Peru, which
began gold production last August. During the fourth quarter, Newmont
received Dollars 4.2m in income from the Peruvian mine.
Newmont Gold Company, which is 90.1 per cent owned by Newmont Mining,
reported a 41 per cent rise in fourth-quarter income, to Dollars 23.9m, or
23 cents, on sales of Dollars 153.8m. This compares with income of Dollars
16.9m, or 16 cents, per share on sales of Dollars 128.4m.
During the quarter, the company sold 410,200 ounces of gold, compared to
with 378,700 a year ago.

The retail arm of Time Warner Entertainment, the US media group, plans to

The move is unusual for US retailers, most of which are reluctant to extend

Warner Bros Worldwide Retail said the stores were among 50 it planned to
open in 1994 to add to the 60 operating in the US.
The stores sell gifts and clothing featuring characters from Warner Bros
films, such as Batman and Bugs Bunny.
The 28,000 sq ft London store will be the biggest in the chain after the

Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, recorded

of securities offset by a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose to a record Dollars 278.3m from Dollars 246m in
the same period a year earlier.
For the full year, revenues grew to Dollars 981.2m from Dollars 900.1m in
1992. Before one-time items in both years, net income in 1993 rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 75.4m, or Dollars 1.69, from Dollars 57.2m, or Dollars 1.33,
in 1992.
Net income for 1993, including a charge of Dollars 19.9m related to the
acquisition of Approach Software, was Dollars 55.5m, or Dollars 1.24. For
1992, net income, including a pre-tax gain of Dollars 49.7m from the sale of
securities and a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge, was Dollars
80.4m, or Dollars 1.87.
Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive, said sales of Notes and
cc:Mail, two communications software products, had been strong.
Lotus also expanded its share of the market for applications designed to run
with Microsoft's widely used Windows software, he said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mitel continues strong recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong recovery at Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits
and telephone equipment that was formerly controlled by British Telecom,
continued in the third quarter, writes Robert Gibbens.
Profit for the three months ended December 24 was CDollars 7.9m (USDollars
6m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 1.4m, or one cent, a year earlier
on revenues of CDollars 129m, up 15 per cent. Nine-month profit was CDollars
15.9m, or 13 cents, against a loss of CDollars 9.3m, or 15 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 351m, ahead from CDollars 305m.
Strength in the December quarter came largely from higher PBX sales in the
US and rising demand for specialised circuits.

Vancouver exchange

<TEXT>
A commission of inquiry has urged sweeping regulatory reforms to improve the
image of the scandal-plagued Vancouver stock exchange (VSE).
But several key participants, including the VSE itself, have expressed
doubts whether the proposals, which include new supervisory bodies, will
achieve their desired goals.
Mr James Matkin, a prominent businessman who led the inquiry, said the VSE's
successes are overshadowed by 'shams, swindles and market manipulations'.
The report's main proposal is to transfer supervision of the VSE from the
British Columbia Securities Commission, a government agency, to an
independent Securities and Exchange Board, modelled on similar bodies in the
US and UK.
Mr Matkin said the commission has been 'too passive in its regulatory
activity, and preoccupied with the prosecution and adjudication of
securities abuse'.
The report also recommends that responsibility for disciplining errant
securities dealers be shifted from the VSE to Canada's Investment Dealers'
Association, a securities industry group. Brokerage firms would be required
to pass a 'fitness test'. A registration system and other controls would be
extended to stock promoters.
The VSE said the proposed new structure would result in 'a cumbersome,
fractured and expensive system that shows no promise of addressing the
market problems'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Restructuring takes its toll on
Borden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group which this month put
several of its businesses up for sale, yesterday announced the expected
heavy losses for its fourth quarter and the full year after taking heavy
charges for restructuring.
Net losses for the fourth quarter came to Dollars 635.9m, or Dollars 4.50 a
share, largely because the company took a charge of Dollars 632m against
earnings to cover losses stemming from business divestments, asset
write-downs, the cost of reorganisation, and accounting changes. Last year
it made net profits of Dollars 28.4m, or 20 cents.
For the full year, Borden reported net losses of Dollars 593.6m, or Dollars
4.21, compared with net losses of Dollars 439.6m, or Dollars 3.07.
At the beginning of January, Borden announced that it was putting its
loss-making salty snacks business and its seafood, jam and jelly businesses
on the market in the latest of a series of restructurings aimed at reviving
profits.
Mr Ervin Shames, president and chief executive, said yesterday he believed
the latest plan would improve Borden's performance and build shareholder
value.
'The key is revitalising our best businesses through a combination of focus,
investment in marketing, the largest cost reduction in Borden history, and a
management team operating in a re-energised culture,' Mr Shames said.
He predicted that quarterly earnings would strengthen this year after a
marginally profitable first quarter, producing year-end earnings per share
at the upper end of the 75 cents to Dollars 1 range predicted by analysts.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rivals target Mexican monopoly -
Telmex is to face competition for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's monopoly telephone carrier, is about to face
competition for the first time. Notoriously inefficient and hugely
profitable, the company is proving an irresistible target for rivals.
On Tuesday, MCI, the US long-distance carrier, and Grupo Financiero
Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial group, announced they
were forming a new company with the aim of offering long-distance services
in 1996. The company will be capitalised at Dollars 1bn, and build a
state-of-the-art fibre-optic cable linking three cities.
MCI was confident the joint venture would be awarded a long-distance licence
by the government. The new operators could provide services from August
1996, when Telmex's monopoly on long-distance service runs out.
The MCI-Banacci announcement comes as Iusacell, the cellular phone company
in which Bell Atlantic recently took a 42 per cent stake for Dollars 1.04bn,
is preparing to provide a basic wireless local telephone service. Iusacell
hopes to have 1.5m subscribers by 1996, compared with Telmex's 7.3m.
'Depending on regulation, the future for Telmex could be very difficult,'
says Mr Bill Deatherage, an analyst with S. G. Warburg. 'Obviously, new
entrants will focus on the more lucrative markets.'
Telmex's main weakness is that its costs are high, and it is required to
install new telephone lines at a loss, making it vulnerable to competitors
that have no such obligations. Telmex charges a telephone installation fee
of about Dollars 580 for homes and Dollars 1,000 for business, against an
average cost of installation of Dollars 2,500.
It recoups the installation costs from inflated charges for long-distance
and international calls. According to France Telecom, Telmex's partner, the
company makes profits on subscribers who make more than Dollars 300 worth of
telephone calls a year, the average operating cost per telephone line.
MCI is likely to focus on long-distance business traffic, the most
profitable segment of the long-distance market. In all, long-distance and
international revenues are expected to have accounted for Dollars 4.2bn of
Telmex revenues last year, or more than half the total.
Mr Austin Beutner, general partner of The Blackstone Group, which advises
Iusacell, says installation costs on the Iusacell local service are
'dramatically lower' than Telmex's. Assuming the same installation fees as
Telmex, Iusacell can cover installation costs with far fewer than the
planned 1.5m subscribers, he says.
Mr Beutner adds that operating costs for the digital wireless service will
be much less than the Telmex average of Dollars 300 per subscriber. Usage
(excluding long distance) will be higher for Iusacell than Telmex's since
'in building any network you are going to penetrate high demographics and
high-use areas first.'
If so, Telmex's profit margins of nearly 40 per cent could start to fall.
Local revenues are expected to have been Dollars 3.15bn last year, and were
Iusacell to meet its target for subscribers, it would capture at least a
fifth of that.
Telmex is betting on a friendly regulatory environment in both long-distance
and local markets. Mr John Atterbury, local head of Southwestern Bell - one
of Telmex's foreign partners - believes Iusacell should bear some of the
cost of Telmex's obligation to install lines at a loss by paying, for
example, high interconnection fees.
Telmex is also seeking to limit competition in the long distance segment.
The company recently proposed a plan for long-distance interconnection
which, if accepted, would 'leave very little on the table for new
long-distance carriers,' Mr Deatherage says.
Under the plan, Telmex will establish just 10 interconnection points between
local and long-distance networks, ensuring that a good part of many
long-distance calls will be carried by Telmex's local network.
Telmex will require all links between a user and long-distance network to be
provided by Telmex 'to maintain equality among competitors'. Telmex will
also force subscribers to choose a carrier each time they call, rather than
pre-select a long-distance carrier as in the US.
The government has still to approve the Telmex plan and will be under
pressure to encourage competition. MCI and Banacci are confident Mexico
would move to the sort of competitive market found in the US. Iusacell
already has the regulatory go-ahead to provide a basic service, it says.
If there is open competition, Telmex would seem to be ill-prepared,
providing a service well below that demanded by subscribers. Last year, the
government's consumer protection agency received 114,000 complaints against
Telmex, 44 per cent of all complaints received.
While Telmex is investing heavily to improve efficiency, new technology
alone may not solve the problem of high costs. Telmex's foreign partners say
the telephone union is a significant obstacle to greater productivity.
Telmex, complains Mr Christian Chauvin of France Telecom, 'is like two
companies, the management company and the union company. Negotiations can
take months'.

The strong recovery at Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits
and telephone equipment that was formerly controlled by British Telecom,
continued in the third quarter.
Profit for the three months ended December 24 was CDollars 7.9m (USDollars
6m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 1.4m, or 1 cent, a year earlier on
revenues of CDollars 129m, up 15 per cent.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 15.9m, or 13 cents, against a loss of
CDollars 9.3m, or 15 cents, on revenues of CDollars 351m, ahead from
CDollars 305m.
Strength in the December quarter came from higher PBX sales in the US and
rising demand for specialised circuits. Domestic business was also good, the
company said.
Imperial Oil, Canada's biggest integrated oil company, benefited from higher
downstream margins and higher petrochemical sales in the fourth quarter.
However, the improvements were partly offset by lower crude oil prices and
lower resource profits.
Fourth-quarter net income was CDollars 54m, or 28 cents, up 6 per cent from
CDollars 51m, or 27 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 2.1bn,
down 7 per cent. For the year, profit was CDollars 279m, or CDollars 1.44,
up 43 per cent from CDollars 195m or CDollars 1.01. Revenues were CDollars
8.9bn, down 3 per cent.
Imperial, 70 per cent held by Exxon of the US, has cash resources of more
than CDollars 1bn and may be planning an acquisition, analysts say.

25%

Scott Paper, the Philadelphia-based manufacturer of personal care paper
products and printing papers, is to cut its worldwide workforce by 25 per
cent, or 8,300 employees.
The company took a Dollars 381m charge on fourth-quarter earnings to cover
the job cuts. More than half of the lay-offs, or about 4,500 jobs, will
occur in its international operations and affiliates.
The company intends to shut down some of its older tissue manufacturing
plants in the US and Europe and to restructure its coated paper business.
Both businesses have been pressured by worldwide overcapacity and
competitive pricing. Scott said its affiliate in Mexico would restructure.
Mr Philip Lippincott, Scott's chairman, said the workforce reductions should
bring the company's employment rate into line with its lowest-cost
competitors.
'These actions are part of our efforts to take control of our destiny in the
slow-growth, highly-competitive and value-focused environment of the 1990s,'
he said.
Before the restructuring charge, Scott reported fourth-quarter earnings fell
to Dollars 34.4m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 44.8m or 61 cents per
share in the same quarter last year. Including the charge, Scott had a loss
of Dollars 379.3m or Dollars 5.01 per share for the quarter.
Scott's fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 1.20bn, down from Dollars 1.28bn
in the same 1992 quarter.
For the year, before special charges, Scott had income of Dollars 177.6m or
Dollars 1.58 per share, down from Dollars 167.2m or Dollars 2.26 last year.
With charges, Scott had a loss of Dollars 277m or Dollars 3.75 for the year.
Scott's 1993 sales were Dollars 4.7bn, down from Dollars 5bn the previous
year. The company's debt increased by Dollars 201m during 1993.
Scott's European operations were hit by lower sales and unfavourable foreign
exchange conversions. Outside the US, the company's operating income
declined 26 per cent, and sales were down 20 per cent. Within the US,
Scott's operating income slid 14 per cent, while sales were flat.
Scott's operating income from its printing paper business dropped to Dollars
79.6m in 1993, from Dollars 90.8m in 1992, while its personal care and
cleaning paper lines saw income slide to Dollars 306.6m, from Dollars 374.7m
the previous year.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting lifts DuPont
earnings in fourth quarter

Underlying earnings at DuPont in the final quarter of 1993 reflected the
steady improvement in the US chemicals company's operating position during
last year, rising to Dollars 329m from Dollars 97m the year before.
After-tax operating earnings rose by a quarter for the year as a whole, to
Dollars 1.7bn.
The gains were made largely as a result of cost-cutting, said Mr Edgar
Woolard, chairman, adding that the company would continue to concentrate on
productivity improvements to enable its businesses to grow at a faster rate
than the world economy.
Mr Woolard pointed in particular to improvements in the group's petroleum
business in the latest period, where cost-cutting on the upstream side and
higher margins on refining and marketing pushed operating income up to
Dollars 163m from Dollars 94m the year before.
The chemicals and other businesses also benefited from lower costs, he
added, though this was partly offset by weak economic conditions in Europe.
The chemicals business recorded operating income of Dollars 76m, up from
Dollars 51m a year before; fibres reported Dollars 104m, against Dollars
52m; polymers Dollars 85m, up from Dollars 26m; and diversified businesses
Dollars 4m, from a loss of Dollars 47m.
After previously-announced restructuring costs and other non-recurring
items, fourth quarter net income was Dollars 226m or 33 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 230m or 35 cents the year before.
One-off items included an after-tax charge of Dollars 144m to reflect
product liability claims, mainly related to the Benlate fungicide, offset by
a gain from the sale of Remington Arms and the company's Canadian
polyethylene business.
For the year as a whole, net income was Dollars 555m (Dollars 1.7bn before
all one-off items), against a loss of Dollars 3.9bn (a profit of Dollars
1.3bn before items) in 1992.
Cost-cutting also helped push earnings at chemicals group Union Carbide
ahead in the final quarter, lifting net income to Dollars 41m, or 26 cents a
share, from Dollars 17m, or 12 cents, the year before, when the results had
benefited from a net Dollars 7m gain from one-off items.
For the year, net income was Dollars 58m (Dollars 165m before accounting
changes), against a loss of Dollars 187m (a profit of Dollars 119m before
accounting changes and a contribution from discontinued operations) in 1992.

Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, recorded
higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting strong sales of its
programs for electronic mail applications.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 29.6m, or 64 cents per share, a 103
per cent increase over last year's fourth-quarter net income of Dollars
14.6m, or 35 cents. Last year the company recorded a pre-tax gain of Dollars
15m from the sale of securities offset by a Dollars 15m pre-tax
restructuring charge.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose to a record Dollars 278.3m from Dollars 246m in
the same period a year earlier.
For the full year, Lotus revenues grew to Dollars 981.2m from Dollars 900.1m
in 1992. Before one-time items in both years, net income in 1993 rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 75.4m, or Dollars 1.69, from Dollars 57.2m, or Dollars 1.33,
in 1992.
Net income for 1993, including a charge of Dollars 19.9m related to the
acquisition of Approach Software, was Dollars 55.5m, or Dollars 1.24. For
1992, net income, including a pre-tax gain of Dollars 49.7m from the sale of
securities and a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge, was Dollars
80.4m, or Dollars 1.87.
Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive, said sales of Notes and
cc:Mail, two communications software products, had been strong.
Lotus also expanded its share of the market for applications designed to run
with Microsoft's widely used Windows software, he said.
Lotus' share price gained on news of its fourth-quarter results. The stock
was trading at Dollars 54 1/4 at mid-day in New York yesterday, up from
Tuesday's close of Dollars 52 7/8 .

sharply higher refining and marketing earnings for the last three months of
1993, helping to offset the effects of the precipitous fall in world oil
prices.
Together with significant cost-cutting over the past year, the rise in
profits from downstream activities enabled both Exxon and Mobil to report
higher operating income for the period compared with a year before, while
Chevron profits eased slightly.
At Exxon, upstream exploration and production earnings fell to Dollars 743m,
from Dollars 1bn the year before (before one-off items). This was balanced
by higher downstream profits, which rose to Dollars 625m from Dollars 399m
(before special items). Recurring profits from chemicals rose to Dollars
143m from Dollars 71m on lower costs and a shift towards higher-margin
products.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share,
from Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 1.12, the year before. Full-year earnings at
Exxon were also bolstered by Dollars 450m of cost savings, taking net income
to Dollars 5.3bn on sales of Dollars 111bn compared with Dollars 4.8bn for
1992 on sales of Dollars 117bn.
Mobil said its exploration and production earnings fell by Dollars 137m
during the last quarter, to Dollars 337m, while marketing and refining
profits rose by Dollars 150m to Dollars 355m (excluding all special items).
Unlike other groups, Mobil failed to see an upturn in its chemicals
business, which is heavily dependent on polyethylene prices, and reported
operating income of Dollars 1m down from Dollars 4m.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 349m (Dollars 602m before charges),
compared with Dollars 582m a year earlier. For the year, net income was
Dollars 2.1bn (Dollars 2.3bn before special items and accounting changes)
compared with Dollars 862m (Dollars 1.5bn) for 1992.
At Chevron, net income for the final quarter totalled Dollars 294m (Dollars
515m before special items), compared with Dollars 1.1bn (Dollars 542m before
items) the year before. Exploration and production earnings fell from
Dollars 342m to Dollars 283m, while refining and marketing income climbed
from Dollars 192m to Dollars 236m.
Full-year net income reached Dollars 1.3bn (Dollars 2.1bn before one-off
factors), compared with Dollars 1.6bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in 1992.

Martin Marietta yesterday reported a surge in fourth-quarter net income to
Dollars 118.7m, excluding a Dollars 17.4m charge for accounting changes,
from Dollars 75.7m.
The US defence contractor saw sales rise to Dollars 3.19bn from Dollars
1.45bn. Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.08 from 81 cents before
accounting changes and 90 cents after the changes.
In April last year Martin Marietta bought General Electric's aerospace
division for Dollars 3.05bn. It expanded again at the end of the year by
buying agreeing to buy General Dynamics' space launch business for Dollars
208.5m.
For the full-year, net income was up to Dollars 450.3m from Dollars 345.4m
before accounting changes, but slumped to Dollars 20.9m after the changes.
Turnover was up to Dollars 9.44bn from Dollars 5.95bn.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 4.25 from Dollars 3.60 before accounting
changes, but turned into losses of 26 cents a share after the changes.

restructuring takes its toll

<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group which this month put
several of its businesses up for sale, yesterday announced the expected
heavy losses for its fourth quarter and the full year after taking heavy
charges for restructuring.
Net losses for the fourth quarter came to Dollars 635.9m, or Dollars 4.50 a
share, largely because the company took a charge of Dollars 632m against
earnings to cover losses stemming from business divestments, asset
write-downs, the cost of reorganisation, and accounting changes. Last year
it made net profits of Dollars 28.4m, or 20 cents.
For the full year, Borden reported net losses of Dollars 593.6m, or Dollars
4.21, compared with net losses of Dollars 439.6m, or Dollars 3.07.
At the beginning of January, Borden said it was putting its loss-making
salty snacks business and its seafood, jam and jelly businesses on the
market in the latest of a series of restructurings aimed at reviving
profits.
Mr Ervin Shames, president and chief executive, said yesterday he believed
the latest plan would improve Borden's performance.
'The key is revitalising our best businesses through a combination of focus,
investment in marketing, the largest cost reduction in Borden history, and a
management team operating in a re-energised culture,' Mr Shames said.
He predicted that quarterly earnings would strengthen this year after a
marginally profitable first quarter, producing year-end earnings per share
at the upper end of the 75 cents to Dollars 1 range predicted by analysts.

NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, is investing in General Magic, a
California company which develops software for 'digital agents'.
Digital agents will provide users of computerised devices with assistance in
finding information, performing routine tasks, alerting them to news or
events that need their attention, sending or receiving messages.
NTT joins Apple Computer, the US personal computer company, AT&amp;T, the
telecommunications company, Motorola, the US electronics manufacturer,
Matsushita and Sony of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands, as General
Magic investors and technology licensees. The companies are each separately
developing products and services based on communications software developed
by General Magic.
NTT is expected to develop 'intelligent agent-based communications services
based on General Magic technology,' said Mr Mark Porat, General Magic chief
executive.
For General Magic, NTT's investment increases the possibility that the US
company's technology will become an industry standard and kick-start the
market for hand-held 'personal communicators'.
General Magic is also in talks with leading European telecommunications
companies, said Mr Porat. International Business Machines has also expressed
interest in General Magic's technology, he added. General Magic's goal is to
establish its technology as a standard for a new generation of
communications devices and services.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Moulinex secures draft rescue
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moulinex, the troubled French household electricals group, yesterday saw its
shares rise sharply on the Paris stock market after announcing that it had
agreed draft proposals for a financial rescue package.
The company's shares soared to close FFr9 better at FFr128. Moulinex was
also buoyed by the announcement that it came close to break even in the nine
months to December 31.
Moulinex, badly affected by economic recession and debts incurred by its
1991 acquisition of Krups, the German kitchen appliances manufacturer, fell
into the red during its last financial year and has reported an interim net
loss of FFr161m (Dollars 27.3m) for the six months to September 30.
It has put together a provisional rescue package after months of
negotiations. The plan involves a FFr650m capital increase for Finap, the
holding company that controls 40.2 per cent of Moulinex. The capital will
come from a number of investors including Glen Dimplex, the Irish group
behind the Morphy Richards electrical brand, and Finamex, a partnership
formed to invest the money left by Mr Jean Mantelet, the Moulinex founder.
The restructuring of Finap would be followed by a FFr600m capital increase
for Moulinex to reduce that company's debt. However, Mr Gilbert Torelli,
managing director in charge of the rescue, cautioned that the plan was still
at a provisional stage and could take several months to finalise.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Strength of ambition fuels steel
group - Shougang wants to be China's first multi-national
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shougang Corporation wants to be more than one of the biggest steel
companies in a country which has a desperate need for steel to fuel an
economic boom.
'Our aim is to become a multi-national, world class enterprise by the year
2000,' says Mr Zhou Beifang, chairman of the group's Hong Kong holding
company.
The company, which has 24 subsidiaries and affiliates in 15 countries
including the US, also plans a huge increase in domestic capacity to put it
among the top three steel companies in the world.
Shougang, which is entirely state-owned, has no plans to sell shares to
employees or to seek listings for the parent company on stock exchanges
either in China or elsewhere, according to Mr Luo Bingsheng, its president.
Nevertheless, Mr Luo and Mr Zhou have embarked on a round-the-world tour to
present the group to the investment community.
Its international ambitions are led by Shougang Concord International
Enterprises, one of four subsidiaries listed in Hong Kong, which last year
made a Dollars 183m convertible bond issue.
The group plans to use its presence in Hong Kong as the base for further
expansion into the rest of Asia as well as Europe and North America. Mr Zhou
says steel markets in south-east Asia are very promising and that Shougang
would like a presence there - subsidiaries may seek stock market listings in
Malaysia and Singapore.
The group also plans to build steel plants outside China on a contract
basis.
Shougang is unusual among Chinese state-owned companies, though not only
because it makes a profit. It was one of the earliest to acquire a measure
of management autonomy under the economic reforms which Mr Deng Xiaoping,
China's leader, introduced in 1978.
Its independence has since increased to the extent that it is allowed to
engage autonomously in investment, finance and foreign trade - it has even
been able to set up a bank. Shougang is responsible directly to the State
Council, China's equivalent of the cabinet, and not to the ministry of
metallurgical industry, which oversees other steel producers.
The company has extraordinarily good connections. It makes liberal use of
photographs of Mr Deng Xiaoping visiting its main iron and steel works just
outside Beijing in May 1992. Mr Deng Zhifang, the leader's son, is on the
board of Shougang Concord Grand, another Hong Kong-listed subsidiary.
In Hong Kong, the group has struck up an alliance with Mr Li Ka-shing, the
tycoon whose main company, Cheung Kong, owns 12 per cent of Shougang Concord
International.
Some of the group's holdings in mainland joint ventures have already been
assumed by Shougang Concord International, which has been in rapid
transformation since it was acquired as Tung Wing Steel in October 1992. Mr
Zhou says Shougang also plans to inject a 51 per cent interest in a new
rolled steel venture and 'will continue to inject assets in accordance with
market conditions'.
Most of the group's international activities thus far have in fact been
directed at boosting Shougang's position within China. In 1992 it paid
Dollars 120m for an iron ore mine in Peru, which it is using to feed its
steel plants at home.
Although the company's executives talk of Hong Kong as a window on the
world, where 'China's industrial capital joins the world's financial
capital', a large part of its role in the group is to finance mainland
activities. Hong Kong companies which invest in the mainland count as
foreign and obtain beneficial tax treatment.
Shougang's primary goal is to become China's largest steel producer -
currently it is the third largest crude steel maker and second largest
manufacturer of steel products. It aims to produce 10m tonnes of crude steel
this year - up from 5.7m in 1992, and to expand capacity to 20m tonnes by
2000. This increase would come through a new joint venture in Shandong
province with Cheung Kong.
The group's ambitions - and those of investors eager to get a piece of
China's boom - face a number of uncertainties. Like all Chinese state-owned
companies, Shougang will one day have to face up to the financial burden
created by 280,000 employees, for whom it has to provide from cradle to
grave.
More immediately, it will need to establish equilibrium in its fast-changing
listed subsidiaries: a research report by Salomon Brothers says of its
profit estimates for Shougang Concord International: 'Given the fluid nature
of the company, these numbers must be viewed as merely rough indications of
trend and magnitude.' Salomon sees rapid growth in earnings, though it sees
as risks changes in Chinese steel import tariffs, currency fluctuations and
slippage in implementation of the expansion plans.
Shougang also depends on the success of economic policy, which has produced
a series of booms and busts since reforms began. If government austerity
measures taken last year fail to curb inflation and speculation, Beijing
could be forced to bring about a 'hard landing'. Mr Luo says the measures
brought down steel prices last year but that they have been rising again so
far in 1994.

Korean telephone network

<TEXT>
Sunkyong, South Korea's fifth-largest business group, has acquired a 23 per
cent stake in Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT), the country's cellular telephone
network, in a Won437bn (Dollars 540m) bid.
Shares in KMT were auctioned this week as part of a privatisation programme
by Korea Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications operator. Korea
Telecom will retain a 20 per cent stake in KMT.
Sunkyong was the only investor whose bid was accepted from 292 applications
for 44 per cent of KMT. The rest of the bids were too low and a new auction
will soon be held for the remaining KMT shares. Sunkyong paid an average of
Won340,00 for each share, which were trading this week on the Seoul bourse
at Won327,000.
The KMT share price has grown from Won50,000 since late 1991, reflecting the
large demand for cellular telephone services. The number of subscribers
reached 470,000 at the end of last year.
KMT, which was established in 1984, reported net profits of Won71.9bn on
sales of Won420bn last year.
Other main KMT shareholders are the Bank of Seoul, Korea Fund, and the Korea
Stock Stabilisation Fund.
A second cellular telephone network will be formed by a consortium of
companies next month to compete against KMT.
Sunkyong in 1992 was awarded the licence to operate the second mobile
telephone network, but was then forced to relinquish the contract because of
charges of nepotism involving the families of the Sunkyong chairman and
then-Korean president Roh Tae.

NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, said yesterday it was investing
in General Magic, the US company which is developing technology for
multi-media products.
NTT's decision to join a string of international investors in General Magic
increases the possibility that the US company's technology will become the
de facto industry standard for portable multi-media communications. This
area is expected to become one of the most promising growth industries.
Multi-media is the combination of text, sound and pictures with computing
and telecommunications functions.
Apple Computer, the US computer company, AT&amp;T and Motorola, US
telecommunications companies, Matsushita of Japan and Philips of the
Netherlands, invest in General Magic. The companies have formed the General
Magic Alliance and are developing products and services based on General
Magic's communications software.
NTT's involvement in the General Magic Alliance promises to kick-start the
market for hand-held multi-media devices as the larger number of products on
the market is likely to stimulate demand for them.
NTT, which is joining a foreign software alliance for the first time, would
develop multi-media services based on technology licensed from General
Magic, it said.
The Japanese telecommunications group hopes its tie-up with General Magic
will enable it to use its technologies in standardising global
communications services.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rights issue to go ahead at
Sonae group
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter legal battle that for more than a year blocked a rights issue by
Sonae Investimentos, the holding company for Portugal's largest
privately-held industrial and distribution conglomerate, has been settled by
an out-of-court agreement between minority and majority shareholders.
A minority group composed of heirs of the founder of the Sonae group secured
a court injunction ordering the suspension of the Es15bn (Dollars 86m)
rights issue only minutes before the subscription period was due to end on
December 31, 1992.
Since then majority shareholders led by Mr Belmiro de Azevedo, president of
the Sonae group, have been fighting for permission to proceed with the
issue, which would raise the share capital of Sonae Investimentos from
Es25bn to Es40bn.
Stock markets analysts say the capital increase is badly needed to reduce a
heavy accumulated debt and help meet the cost of major investments.
The minority shareholders argued that the issue was unnecessary. But their
underlying reason for opposing it was reportedly that they lacked sufficient
funds to participate fully in the capital increase and feared a dilution of
their holding.
Details of the agreement between the two groups of shareholders have not
been revealed. But immediately following the accord, the minority group sold
4 per cent of its holding to institutional investors in the majority group
for Es3bn.
The minority group will be able to use the cash raised to reconstitute their
position through the capital increase. Shares in the rights issue will sell
at the December 1992 price of Es1,000 each and will be available only to
shareholders at that time. Shares in Sonae Investimentos were trading at
Es3,350 yesterday. The date for the rights issue now depends on a decision
by the Lisbon Stock Exchange Commission.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Credit National profits fall but
dividend is held
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit National, the corporate banking group, has warned that it suffered a
sharp fall in net profits during 1993 after a 'particularly difficult year'.
The group, now headed by Mr Jean Yves Haberer, controversial former chairman
of Credit Lyonnais, said in a statement that it planned to maintain its
dividend for 1993 despite the reduction in net profits from the FFr585.9m
(Dollars 98.6m) achieved in 1992.
However, a later statement that Credit National would pay a dividend of
FFr20.00 for 1993 caused confusion on the Paris stock market. The group's
dividend in 1992 had been worth FFr20.00 but it had since split its shares
thereby doubling the number in issue.
Credit National's shares were temporarily suspended until it clarified the
situation by issuing another statement confirming that, because of the share
split, the FFr20.00 payment for 1993 was equal to that of 1992.
The group, like other French banks, was badly affected last year by the
sluggish state of demand for corporate credit as companies cut back on
investment due to recessionary pressures and concern about the high rate of
real interest rates in France.
It was also affected by the sharp increase in the number of company
failures, particularly among the small and medium-sized businesses that have
borne the brunt of the French recession.
The amount of credit extended by the group fell by 20 per cent to FFr14.4bn
during 1993 against FFr18bn in 1992.
However, Credit National, which recently finalised a cross-shareholding
agreement with IKB Deutsche Bank of Germany, fared relatively well in its
investment activities. It also benefited from an improved performance from
Dupont-Denant, its stock broking subsidiary.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris drops 72% to
Dollars 339m in fourth term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Last year's cut in the price of Marlboro cigarettes and a heavy
restructuring charge combined to produce a 72 per cent slump in net profits
to Dollars 339m for Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, in
the fourth quarter.
However, the company claimed its cigarette pricing strategy was working
because Marlboro had regained market share, showing that consumers were
prepared to make decisions based on brand preference rather than price
alone.
Group operating profits fell by 28 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn in the fourth
quarter because the downturn caused by lower domestic cigarette prices
outweighed a 13 per cent increase in operating profits from the rest of the
group's businesses.
The company took a Dollars 457m charge against net earnings for the
restructuring it announced in November, involving the loss of 14,000 jobs
and the closure or scaling down of 40 plants. Earnings per share fell to 38
cents from Dollars 1.34.
Results for the full year were broadly in line with those predicted by the
company in November.
Sales were 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 60.9bn, but after the restructuring
charge and a Dollars 477m provision for accounting changes, net earnings
fell to Dollars 3.09bn from Dollars 4.94bn the previous year. Earnings per
share fell by 35 per cent to Dollars 3.52 from Dollars 5.45.
Claiming success for the 40 cents reduction in the price of Marlboro and its
other premium cigarette brands last April, Philip Morris said research
showed that Marlboro had increased its share of the US market from a low of
21.5 per cent before the cuts to 26.6 per cent in November.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman and chief executive, said Philip Morris had
emerged from 1993 a stronger and more competitive company.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bayer lifts profits and sales
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German chemicals group, has up-graded its 1993 profits and sales
forecasts, consolidating expectations that it will pay an unchanged DM11
dividend for the year.
According to Mr Manfred Schneider, group chairman, a better-than-expected
fourth quarter and a lift from the strengthening dollar would bolster sales
to around DM41bn (Dollars 24.1bn), compared with DM41.2bn in 1992, and his
late-November forecast of DM40bn. Bayer calculates its results using
year-end exchange rates.
Pre-tax profits would perhaps be a bit better than the DM2.2bn expected
earlier, he said.
Mr Schneider repeated his forecast that the four-year decline in earnings
had ended. Bayer had reached the bottom of the trough, he said, although he
predicted unchanged earnings for the current financial year.
The VCI chemicals industry association, of which Bayer is a leading member,
last week said the worst was past, but there were no signs of a lasting
recovery.
Mr Schneider said Bayer intended to deal with the problems of low-capacity
utilisation by negotiating more co-operation deals with other manufacturers
in dyes, organic chemicals and plastics.
The group was running some plant at 50 per cent to 60 per cent of capacity,
he said.
He expected to conclude co-operation negotiations by the end of March aimed
at giving the company a foothold in the fast-growing US market for generic
drugs, but it would continue to focus most of its attention on its
established role as a supplier of branded pharmaceuticals.
Some 45 per cent of this year's DM3.3bn research and development budget
would be devoted to pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter and diagnostic
products. These divisions absorbed about 43 per cent of last year's DM3.2bn
budget.

Compaq Computer registered record fourth-quarter and year-end results amid
'unprecedented demand' for its personal computer products. The US company
aims to overtake IBM and Apple Computer to become the world's largest PC
manufacturer by the end of next year.
Net income jumped to Dollars 151m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, well above the
highest Wall Street predictions. In the fourth quarter of 1992, net income
was Dollars 89m, or Dollars 1.10.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.2bn, a 55 per cent increase over the
Dollars 1.4bn reported for the same period in 1992.
For the year, the PC manufacturer reported revenues of Dollars 7.2bn, an
advance of 75 per cent over Dollars 4.1bn in 1992 while net income more than
doubled to Dollars 462m, or Dollars 5.35, against earnings of Dollars 213m
or Dollars 2.52 for 1992.
Sales in North America grew by 100 per cent in 1993 to Dollars 3.7bn. In
developing markets including Japan, Latin America and the Pacific rim ,
sales were up 111 per cent at Dollars 800m. European sales grew 61 per cent
in local currencies, but the strengthening dollar reduced growth to 44 per
cent at Dollars 2.7bn. Worldwide, unit shipments reached 3.1m, an increase
of 98 per cent over 1992.
Last week, Compaq revealed plans to expand its manufacturing facility in
Scotland. It is increasing its production in Singapore and opening a
facility in China.
During 1993, the company expanded its distribution adding more than 6,500
third-party re-sellers to total about 16,000 worldwide.
Compaq has made progress toward becoming the world's leading supplier of
PCs, Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive said. It held
about a 10 per cent market share. If trends continued, it could overtake
Apple Computer and IBM to become the number one PC manufacturer in 1995, he
predicted.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: German group's Castle in the air
 -The relationship with the US oil trader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large portions of Metallgesellschaft's financial distress are being blamed
on failed oil and gas hedging strategies of MG Corp, its US subsidiary.
However, MG's tangled dealings with Castle Energy Corp reflect more than
just a derivatives strategy gone wrong.
MG Corp's refinery contracts with the company, described by one oil expert
as irrationally beneficial to Castle, remain in force.
Five years ago, Castle Energy Corp was a Dollars 5m company whose sole
business was managing oil and gas partnerships. By 1989, tax law changes
forced Mr Joseph Castle II, the chairman, to look for other business. At the
same time, MG Corp was embarking on an ambitious expansion into oil and gas
trading and merchandising.
In the poker game that is global oil trading, owning a refinery or two
increases a trading company's options. The two found common ground.
In late 1989, Castle bought a mothballed refinery in Lawrenceville,
Illinois.
It was a marginal property in a troubled industry and the refinery required
eight months of refurbishing and large investments before it could operate.
Soon MG Corp was its sole customer.
In October, 1991, MG Corp initiated the first of a series of extraordinary
refining agreements with Castle. It paid Castle a fixed refining fee and
promised Castle any profits it made marketing the refined products.
Castle in return agreed to indemnify any losses that MG made trading the
products. Had Castle been an MG Corp subsidiary this arrangement may have
been understandable.
As a separate company, the agreement was unique in the refining industry.
Castle logged Dollars 31.6m in operating losses during the four months of
the agreement, all linked to paybacks to cover MG Corp trading losses.
Under a separate arrangement, if Castle needed operating funds or capital
for expansion, MG Corp lent the necessary cash, and received Castle stock in
exchange for the loans.
By November, 1993, Castle had a Dollars 363m revolving credit line from MG
Corp, and MG Corp had 3.5m shares of Castle stock, or 49.3 per cent of
ownership.
The tangled financial dealings between the two companies shed some light on
why, even now, MG Corp's bankers are having difficulty sorting out its
liabilities.
The story drew the attention of US securities regulators, because deals made
between Castle and MG Corp during 1992 and 1993 had the effect of pumping up
Castle's profits in advance of Castle's Dollars 42m public stock offering in
November 1993.
The share sale came as MG Corp's liquidity problems were reaching a crisis.
News of MG Corp's problems reached the creditors of its German parent one
week after Castle's share offering. Nearly all of the Dollars 39.5m Castle
gained from the offering was paid to MG to reduce dept, according to company
filings. Senior MG people were pulling the strings at Castle.
Mr Siegfried Hodapp, formerly MG Corp's president and formerly a senior
vice-president of the German parent, was made a Castle director within weeks
of Castle's venture into the refining business in 1989.
As MG's investment mounted, Mr Hodapp had replaced Mr Castle as company
chairman. Two other MG executives joined the Castle board. Mr Arthur Benson
was chairman of MG Natural Gas Corp, and Mr Joseph Rinaldi was head of MG's
US finance arm. The Castle's agreement to cover MG Corp's oil products
trading losses was brief.
After four months, MG revised the agreement so the refining company could
log profits. MG agreed to to pay Castle a fixed rate of Dollars 5 per barrel
above the near month market price for the benchmark west Texas intermediate
crude oil, unconditionally, to the year 2,000.
In the refining business, contracts to pay a fixed price over crude oil
prices are standard, but the margins are generally in cents, not dollars.
That Dollars 5 refining margin put Castle in clover.
Its revenues jumped 54 per cent, or Dollars 187.2m, in fiscal 1992. After
losing Dollars 36.6m in the first four months of 1992, Castle earned Dollars
1.9m for the year.
MG Corp would not comment on why it granted Castle such terms. However, it
could have been part of a larger strategy, because it was expanded to
include two other properties the following year. Using MG Corp loans Castle
bought a Texas natural gas pipeline and other gas interests from Arco for
Dollars 103.7m, and just a month before its stock offering, purchased a
second, smaller oil refinery in California. Castle got a better margin from
MG for the output of the California refinery - a set price of Dollars 10.20
per barrel over nearby Alaska North slope crude price, guaranteed for
several years.
The MG Corp contracts allowed Castle to burnish the otherwise stark business
realities laid out to investors in Castle's share offering November 24. In
the prospectus Castle clearly stated that it had, as of September 30, 1993,
a negative net worth of Dollars 9.4m and a total debt of Dollars 335.5m.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft debate
heightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence has emerged that the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board was
uneasy about the activities of the group's US subsidiaries months before
problems at its New York trading arm drove the group to the brink of
collapse.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, is
understood to have appointed KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, chief auditors to the
Metallgesellschaft group, to carry out a review of financial systems and
accounting policies at MG Corp, the diversified commodities trading arm, and
other US subsidiaries normally audited by another accounting firm.
The appointment was made in the first week of last October and was in
addition to the normal audit of Metallgesellschaft's US operations conducted
by Arthur Andersen for the year to September 30.
The disclosure will add fuel to the debate in Germany about how to apportion
blame for the debacle afflicting Germany's 14th largest company. Although Mr
Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive was sacked after the
scale of losses triggered by MG Corp became apparent, it is not clear that
the supervisory board can be exempt from all responsibility.
The audit review suggests that the supervisory board was aware of possible
weaknesses in internal controls at the US subsidiaries - but not so worried
that it treated the issue with great urgency. Neither Mr Schmitz nor KPMG
was prepared to comment yesterday but it is understood that the accounting
firm did not deliver the results of its enquiry until December, as the scale
of MG Corp's losses had started to become clear.
This was well after the supervisory board had renewed Mr Schimmelbusch's
contract as chief executive for a further five years. This took place on
November 19. Had Mr Schmitz's worries about MG Corp been more pressing, he
could have opposed Mr Schimmelbusch's reappointment.
Mr Rainer Lepper, chairman of the works' council at Metallgesellschaft and a
member of the group's supervisory board, said yesterday that Mr
Schimmelbusch was reappointed on that day after making a convincing
presentation about the group's future without mention of difficulties in the
US. The supervisory board asked Mr Schimmelbusch whether there were any
other problems. Mr Schimmelbusch said there were none, Mr Lepper added.

FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: BCI improves 1.8% to L268bn
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the commercial bank controlled by IRI, the
Italian state holding company, has announced parent company net profits up
1.8 per cent to L268bn (Dollars 163m) in 1993.
The results, coming shortly before the bank is privatised, reflected a heavy
increase in tax provisions, to L713bn, up from L290bn, and a large increase
in sums set aside for possible loan losses.
The loans provision has been increased to L554bn from L373bn reflecting the
effect of recession in the domestic market.
The proportion of doubtful loans in BCI's portfolio rose to 3.3 per cent
from 2.9 per cent - but this was almost the average percentage for the
Italian banking system.
Net interest income for the year remained stable, marginally increasing to
L2,822bn from L2,816bn. Total assets amounted to L115,813bn at year end,
against L111,577bn. Non-interest income rose 78 per cent to L1,738bn,
benefiting from favourable market conditions.
The directors are proposing unchanged dividends of L200 per ordinary share
and L230 for savings shares still outstanding after the conclusion on
February 11 of the offer to convert savings into ordinary shares paying L250
to BCI.
Net profit for the group, to be announced in February, is expected to
reflect an improved performance by BCI subsidiaries and allowing a better
overall result than 1992.

Control Techniques, the Powys-based electronic drives and controls company,

Brno-based joint venture with Vues, its Czech distributor.
CT wants to take full advantage of the surge in industrial growth caused by
economic reform in both the Czech and Slovak republics. This, it said, has
opened up new opportunities in industries such as metal, paper, glass and
power generation.
CT's drive centres, a key element in its recent expansion, provide
engineering system building and problem solving expertise close to its
largest customer base, the users of small and medium-sized drive systems.

acceptable money and it will take some time to change that.'
The shares fell 4p to 40p.

Shares in Densitron Inter-national fell 5p to 35p after the electronic

The company said that sales were strong in Europe and in Asia, but declined
in the US. There was a strong recovery in the microwave division which was

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: DY Davies losses cut to Pounds 116,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower exceptional charges and interest costs helped DY Davies, the
USM-quoted architect, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 484,000 to Pounds
116,000 for the six months to October 31.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said that there had been a return of confidence
in the property investment market but this had yet to be transferred to the
property development or construction markets.
He added that fee levels remained low as a result of competitive bidding and
low demand.
Turnover was 36 per cent lower at Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.93m). Exceptional
costs were down from Pounds 387,000 to Pounds 49,000 and interest payable
was Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 157,000).
Mr Davies said that exceptional items should continue to fall as vacant
office space was let.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: In search of some sweetener - Why a US
union will attend Tate &amp; Lyle's AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle faces a public challenge from the US labour movement at the
sugar and sweeteners group's annual meeting in London's Barbican centre
today.
Seven US labour leaders, armed with proxies, plan to attend the AGM to
publicise what they call 'unfair and reckless' labour practices at AE
Staley, the multinational's subsidiary in Decatur, Illinois.
Staley, accusing its employees of sabotage, locked out all 760 workers at
its corn processing plant at 3am on June 27. The workers have been picketing
the plant ever since.
Temporary sub-contract workers have been hired to help management continue
production but union officials claim Tate has lost orders.
'The company's flat earnings report for last year is related to its failed
management policies in the US,' said Mr Dave Watts, local president of the
United Paperworkers union, yesterday. In the year to end-September the
company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 269.6m, against Pounds 237.4m.
Citing global competitive pressures for needing sweeping change, Staley
wants new employment contracts that the union claims will undermine their
members' living standards.
It argues that the imposed package includes a 20 per cent cut in workers'
average annual pay of about Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) through the
introduction of compulsory 12 hour shifts without any bonuses; an end to
seniority rights in work deployment; and abolition of the plant's grievance
and arbitration procedures.
Earlier this week the union delegation met Mr Neil Shaw, Tate's executive
chairman, and they hope this may help resolve the conflict.
'We will not go away', says Mr Watts, 'If the company is rational it should
talk to us and reach an honourable, negotiated settlement. Our members are
suffering real pain but so is Staley.' Tate said yesterday it would not
comment until today's annual meeting.
Tate has said in the past that it was not an anti-union company and the
Decatur lock-out was a matter for the local management to resolve. But the
company has recently suffered from bad labour relations elsewhere in the US.
Last year it endured a five-month strike at its Domino sugar refinery in New
York that the union claims cost the company Pounds 4m.
'We are confident Tate management could boost profits substantially at
Staley if it would step in to settle the dispute. Failure to resolve the
lock-out means lost earnings for shareholders,' said Mr Mark Brooks, UPIU's
special projects director, yesterday.
The Decatur plant has been unionised for half a century. 'The old management
was hard-nosed but at least we had agreements with them,' said Mr Watts. The
union leaders argue management-labour relations have deteriorated since Tate
acquired the company in May 1988.
When the last collective agreement expired in September 1992 the company
proposed its sweeping cost-cutting package which was rejected overwhelmingly
by the workforce in a ballot.
The union stepped up pressure by boycotting local banks which had Staley
executives on their boards. They were compelled to resign from them.
The company went ahead and imposed the changes it wanted. In retaliation,
the employees started a work to rule.
The conflict escalated rapidly. Three union activists were dismissed and the
workforce held a safety meeting that shut down production.
On June 26 Staley production workers joined hands in solidarity with workers
from the nearby Caterpillar assembly plant who are also in dispute. Early
the next morning Staley locked them out.
Talks through the US Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service have proved
fruitless and the company has made it clear it intends to reduce its labour
force by 284.
Since last autumn the union has widened its counter-offensive against the
company at local and international level, seeking to create what it calls
coalitions of interest. 'We want the UK unions to pressurise the company',
Mr Brooks said. 'What is happening in Decatur is going to affect them. They
are next on the hit list.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wildrose reveals details of Norton reverse
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intrigue over the future of Norton Motors (1993) escalated yesterday when
the motorcycle manufacturer's Canadian owners released details of its
proposed reverse takeover in North America.
Wildrose Ventures, based in Vancouver, said an unnamed 'listed public
vehicle' would acquire a 51 per cent stake in Norton together with options
on a further 39 per cent for an undisclosed sum.
Under the transaction, the shell company - listed on the US bulletin board
in pink sheet securities - will be renamed Norton BSA.
Wildrose shareholders will receive Norton shares on a 1-for-1 basis, but the
new shares will be treated as an additional dividend and will not dilute or
replace their existing holdings.
Overall, the Canadian company will receive 9.25m of the 10m shares issued in
the listed vehicle.
The transaction has been arranged by Mr Nelson Skalbania, the Canadian
deal-maker who describes himself as a Wildrose consultant.
Mr Skalbania's daughter, Rozanda, admitted that the main investors behind
Wildrose were two Vancouver families: the Aquilinis - a property group with
a 10 per cent stake in Norton - and the Skalbanias themselves.
Ms Skalbania, who is running Norton's UK plant in the Midlands, said:
'Wildrose's sole purpose was to do the Norton deal. The families involved in
funding it were the Aquilinis and the Skalbanias.'
Wildrose has been seeking a shell for Norton since June last year when it
was suspended by the Alberta Stock Exchange over irregularities in the
proposed takeover.
Mr Chris Agagnier, president of Wildrose, said a new listing was necessary
to finance Norton's expansion.
Those expansion plans involve some bizarre ideas including Blue Thunder  - a
flying car which would have 'vertical take-off and full hover capabilities;
as simple as a motorcycle to operate; and lands safely with full power
failure'.
Another scheme involves a joint venture with MiG, the Russian aircraft
manufacturer, to produce bicycles from recycled titanium.
There are even proposals to buy a Bulgarian ski company 'to produce a line
of Norton BSA skis'.
Ms Skalbania, who said the schemes also depended on joint venture funding,
hinted that Norton planned to produce a new motorcycle - the TT558 - in the
spring.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New rules considered for research listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes are being considered to the new listing rules for scientific
research companies less than two months after they came into force, the
Stock Exchange said yesterday.
A working party set up by the Exchange is due to meet for the first time
today amid concerns that the rules, which came into force on December 1,
place too many restrictions on research groups.
Many of Britain's newly floated bio-technology companies are understood to
regard the rules, first published in the revised Yellow Book last September,
as over-burdensome.
Although the rules enable scientific companies to raise money without a
significant trading record, a minimum time is set after flotation before
fresh capital can be raised.
Restrictions on share disposals by staff and venture capital groups have
also prompted complaints.
Acknowledging 'problems associated with the lock-in of promoters, directors
and senior employees', the Exchange said the working party would decide
whether the rules were unfair.
Led by Mr Brian Richards, chairman of British Bio-technology, the working
party is expected to review the requirement for independent reports on a
company's viability. It would also reconsider the criteria companies must
meet before they are allowed to seek a listing.
Its recommendations are not expected to be published before spring at the
earliest.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trifast pathfinder sees Pounds 2.55m for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trifast, the Sussex-based industrial fastener group which is coming to the
market next month, expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m for the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 1.98m, according to the pathfinder prospectus
issued yesterday.
The company, which manufactures and distributes fasteners under the TR
Fastenings trade name, is seeking a listing through a placing which will
value it at between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m.
Trifast said earlier this month that the placing was expected to raise about
Pounds 15m. About two thirds of that will go to the company's two founders,
Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts who are reducing their 90 per cent stake
to between 30 per cent and 50 per cent. This would leave between Pounds 3m
and Pounds 4m for the company.
Trifast said that the listing would give the company access to a wider
capital market. The proceeds would provide it with additional scope to
finance growth as well as repaying debt to strengthen the balance sheet and
help the company make appropriate acquisitions.
The announcement of the placing, which is being sponsored by James Capel, is
expected on February 9, with dealings beginning on February 16.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Float likely to put Pounds 75m value on
Goldsborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month's flotation of Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing homes, acute
hospitals and homecare services provider, is expected to value the company
at about Pounds 75m.
Goldsborough's pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday, showed a
pre-interest profit of Pounds 4.3m in the year to October 3, up from Pounds
2.5m. Turnover was Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 27.1m).
However, Goldsborough said on a pro forma basis, including acquisitions made
last year for a full 12 months, operating profits from continuing operations
would have been Pounds 6m on turnover of Pounds 35m.
Goldsborough has 26 care homes, with 1,238 beds, three hospitals, one of
which is a joint venture, and 30 homecare branches. Mr Graham Smith, chief
executive, said that differentiated the group from others as it could meet
the needs of a range of clients and take advantage of developments in the
healthcare sector.
Although the float is likely to raise about Pounds 60m in cash, with 65 per
cent of the shares being placed with institutions and the remainder offered
to the public, only Pounds 29m will go to the company, cutting debt to
Pounds 7.5m, while shareholders' funds will be Pounds 51.6m.
Kunick, the amusement machines company which holds a 50 per cent stake in
Goldsborough, is to sell all its shares. The proceeds will 'significantly
exceed' net book value of Pounds 18.3m. Kunick shares rose 1p to 16 1/2 p.
NatWest Ventures, which has a 40 per cent stake bought in 1992 for Pounds
10m, will sell part of its holding, keeping 10 per cent of the enlarged
capital, while Phoenix Fund Managers' 10 per cent stake will be diluted to
about 3 per cent. Management will hold about 2.5 per cent after flotation.
SG Warburg is sponsor to the issue and SG Warburg Securities is broker.
Pricing is on February 17, with the offer closing on February 24. Dealings
are expected to begin on March 4.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide takes over at Quality Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which owns and manages private
rented housing in many parts of Britain, has brought in the Nationwide
Building Society as its majority shareholder in a restructuring which it
said gave it a stable basis for growth.
The Nationwide has converted Pounds 50m of lending to Quality Street into
non-voting preference shares and now controls 75 per cent of the company,
with the rest held mainly by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, chairman, and its
management.
Quality Street will also take over the management of about 2,000 houses
repossessed by the society. They will be brought into the private rented
sector using business expansion scheme funds recently raised by Nationwide.
Quality Street will become Nationwide's main vehicle in rented housing.
Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed in
1988 and earmarked funds to finance its properties. In 1991 it sold its
equity stake to Mr Mugnaioni and another director but continued to lend to
it.
Quality Street manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns about 2,000
and sees itself as a 'blue-chip' private landlord. But its balance sheet for
the year to March 31 1993, published yesterday, showed a deficit of Pounds
45.7m mainly because of the fall in property values.
Although the company made an operating profit of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5m)
thanks to rental income, this became a pre-tax loss of Pounds 28m (Pounds
9.4m) after a property write-down of Pounds 18m and additional interest and
redemption premiums on loans from Nationwide.
As a result of the new deal, which has been under negotiation since last
summer, Quality Street's indebtedness to Nationwide falls from Pounds 171m
to Pounds 121m in the pro forma balance sheet, leaving a surplus of Pounds
4.2m after taking assets into account.
Nationwide's remaining loans to Quality Street will be restructured and
Nationwide representatives will join Quality Street's board.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bullough beats expectations with Pounds
9.18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday reported an
increased full year outcome reflecting sharply improved operating profits
partly offset by higher restructuring charges and net interest costs.
Pre-tax profits in the year to October 31 increased to Pounds 9.18m from a
restated Pounds 5.98m in the previous year when, under FRS 3, profits were
reduced by a Pounds 2.56m loss on the sale of discontinued operations.
The pre-tax line was struck after first-half restructuring costs of Pounds
4.67m (Pounds 3.32m).
The results were ahead of market expectations and the shares, which have
risen sharply since the start of December when they stood at 124p, gained a
further 14p to close at 186p.
Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 271.4m (Pounds 276.9m) but operating
profits jumped by 21 per cent to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 12.7m) with all the
group's divisions improving their contributions slightly.
Refrigeration and store fitting boosted turnover to Pounds 93.5m (Pounds
89.2m) but operating profits rose only slightly to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds
5.66m) reflecting increased competition and thin margins.
Heating division turnover was also higher at Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 31.6m) and
operating profits increased to Pounds 4.09m (Pounds 3.48m), partly helped by
the return to the black at the restructured Reznor business in Belgium.
The office products side managed a modest Pounds 628,000 profit following a
Pounds 736,000 loss the previous year on turnover which fell to Pounds 93m
(Pounds 104.4m).
Within the division, Atal's sales fell by 21 per cent and the French
business underwent a substantial restructuring as a result of which it is
expected to return to the black this year. In the UK, Project's sales were
also lower and pressure on margins resulted in a significant drop in
profits.
Net interest costs rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 994,000), mainly because of
currency movements and lower interest rates on the group's cash deposits.
However, net borrowings fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 3.8m reflecting the
group's strongly positive net cash flow.
Earnings per share fell to 3.07p (4.57p) following a substantially higher
tax charge because losses at Atal could not be relieved against profits
earned in the UK. The final dividend is maintained at 4.3p, making an
unchanged total for the year of 6.05p.
COMMENT
The outlook for Bullough looks a great deal brighter than it did 18 months
ago and market confidence has been further boosted by the appointment of Mr
Gordon Bond as chief executive. Having dealt with the French office products
business the immediate task will be to arrest Project's sliding profits in
the UK and to try to boost anaemic margins elsewhere. This year interest
costs will be lower, tax should return to more usual levels, and any further
restructuring costs should be less than 10 per cent of operating earnings.
Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 16.5m, producing earnings of about 8.8p
this year, but the recent run-up in the share price means they are trading
on a prospective p/e of 21.2 and have limited further potential.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sun Life new single premiums top Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Life yesterday said that its new single premium business exceeded Pounds
2bn for the first time.
Announcing its new business figures for 1993, the life insurance group said
the increase to Pounds 2.2bn represented a rise of almost 60 per cent on the
1992 figure of Pounds 1.4bn.
New regular premium business rose by 24 per cent from Pounds 86m to Pounds
107m over the year.
Mr John Reeve, managing director, welcomed the results but sought to play
down expectations for 1994.
'Our new business has more than doubled over the last three years, which is
well beyond the performance of the market as a whole: our immediate focus is
now on consolidation at the new levels achieved,' he said.
Total new premiums in 1993 rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn, but the
group said that a better indicator of performance was the 45 per cent
increase in new business measured on the basis of an index of new regular
premiums and one tenth of new single premiums.
The overall increases came despite falls in new business from both single
and regular premium final salary and money purchase schemes.
New premium income in 1993 at Friends Provident, the mutually-owned life and
pensions group, also reflected the trend in the market towards single
premium business.
The increase in its new single premium income to Pounds 518m (Pounds 392m)
more than offset the fall in new annual premium income to Pounds 93m (Pounds
115m).

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar auction for rump of rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation and Robert Fleming, the investment banking groups,
are likely to initiate a significant change in London stock market practices
later this week by holding an auction for the rump of Trafalgar House's
Pounds 355m rights issue.
Normally when a company makes a rights issue to raise new capital, any
shares not wanted by the company's existing shareholders are placed with
investment institutions at a price fixed by the company's stockbrokers.
However, SBC and Fleming are planning to import a technique used in the
Eurobond market by inviting investors to make bids in an open auction. The
banks believe that a higher price will be fetched for the shares than using
the traditional method.
A final decision about whether to go ahead with the auction will be taken
today. However, bankers said last night that it was likely to take place.
The change may not be universally popular among brokers and investment
institutions.
The stockbroker to an issue has traditionally placed the rump of an issue
with their best clients, cementing a relationship between the broker and
investors.
Placing the rump also avoids the risk that much of it will end up with
sub-underwriters and lead to a fall in the share price.
In an auction, if there were no bids, all the rump would go to the
sub-underwriters.
The stockbrokers to the Trafalgar issue are Cazenove, London's leading
corporate broker, and UBS Securities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions helped Danka Business Systems, the office equipment supplier,
which operates mainly in the US, virtually double pre-tax profits from
Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 22.1m for the nine months to December 31.
Sales were Pounds 233.6m (Pounds 127.5m).
Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said that 'the company will continue to
search for strategic acquisitions to serve as regional centres in new
geographic areas'.
So far this year, Danka has spent more than Pounds 45m on acquisitions.
Earnings in the third quarter were held back by higher tax and remained
steady at 2.9p.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hogg Group profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hogg Group, the insurance broker, tumbled 22p to 130p yesterday
after the company warned of a decline in profits for 1993.
The company estimated that pre-tax profits in the year will fall by more
than 50 per cent to Pounds 6m, against Pounds 13.4m in 1992, with an
unexpectedly poor performance by its US business mainly responsible.
Mr Anthony Howland-Jackson, chairman and chief executive, said the final
dividend would be cut to 2.5p, reducing the total for the year from 8.15p to
5.65p.
Hogg has withdrawn from managing Lloyd's agencies and its Downs &amp; Burke fine
arts and jewellery arm, and expects profits from continuing business to fall
from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.3m.
Hogg Robinson, the US broking and benefits division, saw its profits decline
by Pounds 2m. 'New business was not sufficient to offset the effect of rate
reductions in the renewable portfolio, reduced contingency commissions and
lost business. The group's medical third party administration division lost
money, reflecting the depressed state of the medical insurance market. The
group has formed a new alliance with Emperion, a provider of administrative
services in the area, in a bid to improve efficiency.
Hogg's insurance marketing services division in the UK is also expected to
see a fall in profits - by about Pounds 800,000, reflecting the impact of
internal reorganisation. Profits from reinsurance and group investment are
also expected to fall, by Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 1.7m respectively.
Losses at Downs &amp; Burke amounted to Pounds 1.3m. According to Mr
Howland-Jackson, the market in which the broker operated collapsed. Hogg's
Lloyd's agencies, which contributed Pounds 1.6m to profits in 1992, were
divested in 1992.

<TEXT>
Next, the high street fashion retailer, added to the evidence of strong
consumer spending over the Christmas season, reporting that second half
sales in the year to January 31 were expected to be 18 per cent ahead of the
previous year.
'At our half year results on September 25 we reported that we were 10 per
cent up at that point in the second half in both Next Retail and Next
Directory, compared with last year,' said Mr David Jones, chief executive.
'Retail is now up to 18 per cent for the whole six months and Directory has
come down a shade to 9 per cent. By implication we had a very good run up to
Christmas at Next Retail.'
Mr Jones said that the like-for-like increase was about 17 per cent for the
second half with new space accounting for about 1 percentage point of the
rise. Volumes rose about 15 per cent or 16 per cent for the second half.
The company said the estimates for the second half meant the sales rise for
the full year was expected to be 17 per cent in Next Retail and 9 per cent
in Next Directory.
Analysts raised their pre-tax profit forecasts for the full year from about
Pounds 66m to Pounds 70m.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Small companies lead growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small companies returned to the buy list with a vengeance last year,
significantly outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index for the first time
in four years, to record their highest gains since 1977.
They gave a total return of 44 per cent in 1993, almost 16 per cent higher
than that achieved on the All-Share last year, according to the Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies Index. The HGSCI, published yesterday, covers the bottom
tenth by value of the main UK equity market - companies with capitalisations
of less than Pounds 318m.
The index showed the race was won by the very smallest companies, the bottom
1,000 by value, which ended the year with total returns more than 60 per
cent higher.
Property companies led the field, rising 85 per cent after a 22 per cent
decline in 1992.
The attraction for smaller companies appears to have been fuelled by
interest in investment trusts. Versions of the index excluding investment
trusts underperformed by more than two percentage points.
Fewer companies went into receivership with just 17 companies becoming
valueless against 43 last time. Some 313 more than doubled their value
during the year.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rover sales above break-even - Honda said
to be in talks with BAe about raising 20% holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New vehicle sales by Rover Group, the British Aerospace subsidiary, rose by
5 per cent to 442,745 last year - well above break-even level.
The increase, disclosed yesterday, underpinned the forecast made in
September by Mr George Simpson, the outgoing chairman, that Rover would
return to profit in 1993 after two consecutive years of losses.
However, Rover denied reports that it had already confirmed it would be
disclosing a profit, before interest and tax, as part of BAe's results
announcement on February 23.
Disclosure of the improved performance came as insiders close to both Rover
in London and Honda in Tokyo indicated that the two companies were
discussing the possible raising by Honda of its 20 per cent equity stake in
Rover.
This, also, has been formally dismissed as speculation by both sides.
However, it is understood that discussions have been going on for some time
although they are weeks, and possibly months, away from a conclusion.
'There are obvious benefits to such an arrangement', one insider commented
in London last night. 'It would free up capital for BAe and in the case of
BAe floating off Rover a bigger Honda stake would help keep away predators.'
In Tokyo a Honda executive said: 'There are no details we can talk about yet
. . . but the issue of our stake in Rover is something we are talking about
with BAe.'
While total sales to dealers were up 5 per cent at 442,000 units, retail
sales by dealers rose 9 per cent to 448,000 cars.
'This performance has been achieved despite extremely difficult trading
conditions throughout the world,' said Mr John Towers, Rover's group
managing director.
Rover's last profit of Pounds 65m before tax and interest was in 1990.
Within the sales total, the contribution of the Land Rover four-wheel-drive
subsidiary leapt by 30 per cent to a record 73,527.
Total export sales rose 17 per cent to 180,256 vehicles. Sales in
continental Europe rose by 8 per cent, despite the new car market as a whole
falling by 15 per cent, making Rover the only sizeable manufacturer to
increase sales on the Continent last year. Its sales in France, Spain and
Portugal also reached record levels.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bain Clarkson venture in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bain Clarkson, the international insurance broker which is part of Inchcape,
yesterday announced a new joint venture in Vietnam, becoming the first
insurance broker to be licensed in the country.
The deal follows hard on the heels of the announcement earlier this month of
the liberalisation of the local market, hitherto dominated by Baoviet, the
state-owned insurance company.
Bain Clarkson, which already operates in 11 other countries in east Asia, is
setting up a 50:50 joint venture between its Inchcape Insurance Holdings
(Hong Kong) subsidiary and Baoviet. Each partner will invest Dollars 125,000
(Pounds 83,000) in the new company, Inchinbrok, which will operate initially
from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Inchinbrok will provide the first retail insurance broking service in
Vietnam, focusing on arranging commercial insurance and financial services
for multinationals investing in the country.
It will place business both with Baoviet and other insurance companies. It
is understood that four Japanese companies - Yasuda Fire and Marine, Dowa
Fire and Marine, Tokio Marine and Fire and Mitsui Marine and Fire - have
been given permission to open representative offices, with Yasuda opening
its office at the end of last month.
'As the first fully licensed insurance broker we will introduce competition
among insurers which will benefit client companies and expand the market as
more operations elect to insure,' said Mr Simon Arnold, chairman.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: OFT talks halt TV bid clock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the future of London Weekend Television may not now be
resolved until the beginning of March, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Yesterday should have seen Granada's final extension of its offer of six new
shares for five LWT shares but talks were continuing with the Office of Fair
Trading with the takeover clock stopped.
The OFT is exploring with all parties involved what the future shape of
advertising sales houses, owned or influenced by Granada or LWT, should be.
Granada owns a 50 per cent stake in The Time Exchange which sells airtime
for Granada, Scottish, Border and Ulster. LWT owns Laser which sells airtime
for LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
If the two were combined it would amount to a 40 per cent share of the
market.
It may be as late as February 10 before the issue is resolved between the
OFT and the Department of Trade and Industry and the takeover clock starts
ticking.
Once the clock is started again LWT will have two days to put out any new
information and then the final closing date would follow 21 days after that.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hobson Pounds 0.54m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hobson, which on Tuesday responded to 'the significant rise' in its share
price by announcing that it was 'in negotiations for the acquisition of a
very substantial business', yesterday revealed increased losses for the six
months to September 30.
The shares fell  1/2 p to 20 1/2 p, having risen from 17p on January 20.
The USM-quoted company which has withdrawn from its personal care business,
saw losses before and after tax increase from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 544,000
largely as a result of operating losses in the discontinued division rising
from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 506,000 on turnover down from Pounds 713,000 to
Pounds 434,000.
Hobson is now left with its household products and commodities trading
operations.
In its first year the former made Pounds 51,000 on turnover of Pounds
398,000 while profits for the latter fell to Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 52,000)
on turnover reduced to Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 2.37m).
Losses per share emerged at 0.64p (0.02p).

FT  27 JAN 94 / Bulls make it an office party: Vanessa Houlder explains a
remarkable recovery in the property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of deep recession, Britain's commercial property market is
staging a spectacular comeback.
Since the middle of last year, investors have embarked on one of the most
frenetic bouts of buying in decades. 'This is the strongest bull market for
property since 1972,' according to Mr Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker,
chartered surveyors.
Fierce competition for investment properties, frequently attracting as many
as 15 bidders, has driven down yields sharply. Yields - the ratio of income
to value - for the most sought-after investments, such as high street shops
and retail warehouse parks, are close to record lows. In central London,
agents report that office yields fell by 1.8 percentage points to 8.3 per
cent last year, the greatest annual decline on record.
Investors are starting to see strong returns from property, albeit at levels
that lag the equity market. UK property achieved a total return of 18.6 per
cent in 1993, compared with negative returns of -2.1 per cent in 1992,
according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors.
There are even stirrings of interest in the development market. 'Speculative
development is now viable again in central London, assuming very low land
costs,' says Mr Geoff Marsh, managing director of Applied Property Research.
But the remarkable turnaround in sentiment does not stem wholly from a
reappraisal of property's intrinsic merits. In many regions of the country,
rents are still falling, vacancy rates remain well above long-term trends
and letting boards litter town centres.
Admittedly, investors are looking ahead to a recovery in rental growth,
which many believe is likely to resume at the end of this year. But that
does not fully account for such a pronounced revival at this stage of the
property cycle.
Instead, the surge in demand is mainly attributed to the strength of the
government bond market, where long gilt yields fell from 8.8 per cent to 6.4
per cent in the course of last year.
As equity and bond yields plummeted, the relatively high yields available on
property became increasingly attractive. Last year the institutions
increased their allocations of money to the sector - a trend likely to
continue.
Many analysts think that property will outperform the stockmarket. The
stockbroker UBS has predicted returns from property of more than 20 per cent
this year and 12 per cent in 1995, compared with returns from equities of
about 3 per cent in 1994 and less than 5 per cent in 1995.
Moreover, institutions need to invest extra money in property to compensate
for the outperformance of the equity market last year. Even though property
put in one of its best performances in years, the average weighting of
property in an institutional portfolio fell by a percentage point from 7.5
per cent at the end of 1992, in the view of Mr Peter Evans of DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, chartered surveyors.
Although the investment institutions are currently the most active buyers of
property, there is also strong demand from property companies. The quoted
property sector is flush with cash to spend on new investments, after
raising Pounds 2.39bn through rights issues last year.
As confidence comes back to the property market, there has been a shift in
the type of property being sought.
During the the recession, investors played safe. Demand was concentrated on
buildings that had secure incomes paid by financially robust tenants on long
leases. But as concern about tenant bankruptcies diminishes, investors are
placing less emphasis on security and more on the potential for rental
growth. Location is also regaining much of its traditional importance.
The question now preoccupying investors is whether the rush to put money
into property has pushed values up too far, too fast. The intense
competition for property deals has led some investors to turn a blind eye to
slight imperfections in property acquisitions, which potentially could lead
to difficulties. 'There are going to be some nasty shocks,' predicts Mr
Matthew Oakeshott of Olim, a fund manager.
More generally, property investors are at risk both from a
slower-than-expected improvement in the economy or from a rise in interest
rates resulting from an upturn in inflation.
The nature of the risk varies for different types of property. Low yielding
property, where investors have expectations of strong rental growth, has the
most to lose from a slowdown in the economy.
High yielding properties, which have meagre rental growth prospects because
the incumbent tenants are trapped by a long lease into paying well above the
market rent, have the most to lose from a rise in inflation and an increase
in interest rates. That is because the investment performance of this type
of property resembles a bond, and so would be affected by anything that
altered bond yields, such as a rise in inflationary pressures.
Although investors fear anything that could trigger a rise in interest rates
and bond yields, they may also feel a certain nostalgia for the era of
unrestrained inflation. In the 1970s, high inflation came to the rescue of
many bad decisions by indiscriminately boosting property values.
No such help is on hand this time round. 'Low inflation should make
developers and investors focus more on fundamental supply and demand
issues,' says Mr Peter Evans of DTZ Debenham Thorpe. 'They will not have the
luxury of being bailed out of bad decisions.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / Hanson lifts Beazer profits veil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson yesterday removed one of the veils covering Beazer Homes, its UK
housebuilding subsidiary, which it aims to float by the end of March.
It revealed that the builder, which is the fourth-largest in the UK, made an
operating profit of Pounds 37.5m in the year to September 30 on sales of
Pounds 276m.
The information came as Hanson held its annual meeting in London. Lord
Hanson told shareholders: 'The industrial sun is beginning to rise both in
the UK and the US.' He said conditions in the UK building industry were much
improved. Hanson shares rose  1/2 p to 279p.
Before the annual meeting, the management of Beazer Homes, led by Mr Dennis
Webb, managing director, made a presentation to analysts who cover the
housebuilding sector. However, after the meeting some analysts said they had
been given little information and could not put a specific value on the
business until the prospectus was issued. The market value is expected to be
between Pounds 400m-Pounds 450m.
Beazer Homes was bought by Hanson as part of its Pounds 391m purchase of
Beazer in December 1991, when it also took on Beazer's debts of around
Pounds 1.25bn. Before the bid, Beazer had planned to float its UK and
European activities, which also included property and contracting, for up to
Pounds 500m.
Hanson is also floating a 70 per cent stake in its US housebuilding
operation, and the two deals will help reduce the group's gearing, which was
86 per cent at the September year-end.
Beazer Homes said that at the end of 1993 it had a land bank of 16,117
plots, equivalent to 3.4 years at its current rate of building. However, Mr
Webb said later that reservations were currently strong and it was
responding to this demand.
Mr Webb said the balance sheet was 'good' but refused to elaborate on the
level of debt Beazer Homes would have on flotation.
The Pounds 37.5m profit figure for 1992-93 compared with Pounds 37.6m in the
year to June 30 1992, before a Pounds 99.3m write down of assets following
Hanson's acquisition of Beazer, on turnover of Pounds 251.2m. In the year to
June 30 1991 operating profit was Pounds 47.8m on sales of Pounds 313m, with
sales of 5,006 houses.
Beazer sold 4,805 houses in the UK in the 1992-93 financial year, including
850 sold to housing associations. These sales depressed the average selling
price to Pounds 59,000 down from Pounds 63,000 in 1991 and Pounds 60,000 in
1992.
At the 1993 year-end Beazer had 249 second-hand homes in the UK, taken in
part exchange, worth about Pounds 11.5m. Since then Beazer has bought Walker
Group, a Scottish housebuilder, for Pounds 28.2m, adding 1,300 building
plots to its land bank.
Lazard Brothers is sponsoring the issue, and James Capel is broker.

FT  27 JAN 94 / UK gilts auction disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's first 1994 auction of government bonds received a
lukewarm reception yesterday. The auction of 6 1/4 per cent Treasury stock
due 2010 raised Pounds 2.75bn and the average accepted price was Pounds
98.20 for a yield of 6.38 per cent.
The cover, or the amount by which demand exceeds supply, was 1.21 times,
below market expectations of 1.5 times. This compares with cover of 2.19 for
the December auction, but remains above 1993-94's lowest level of 1.1.
Another sign of subdued investor interest was the 'tail', the difference
between the average accepted price and the lowest. It was two basis points
compared with expectations of one basis point or less.
Although long-dated gilt prices fell by as much as  5/8 point, analysts were
relaxed about the disappointing level of investor interest. 'The
below-average cover and the above-average tail in today's auction is no
barrier to performance in the weeks ahead,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, a gilts
analyst at SG Warburg.
He also noted that the sum raised yesterday brought gilt issuance for the
year to about Pounds 48bn, compared with an estimated funding requirement of
Pounds 49bn. This meant that the Bank of England was well ahead of schedule
with its programme and that it could be over-funded by as much as Pounds 5bn
going into the 1994-95.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said
that the good long-term outlook for inflation in the UK was likely to
support the market.
Other analysts were confident that the market would soon recover its poise
in the widespread belief that much of yesterday's paper had gone into the
long-term investment portfolios of domestic institutions.

FT  27 JAN 94 / WH Smith cautious on consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, yesterday announced an 11.2 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, but said it was still cautious
about consumer spending.
Profits for the six months to November 27 increased from Pounds 40.2m to
Pounds 44.7m - towards the lower end of market expectations - and the shares
closed down 6 1/2 p at 530 1/2 p.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, said sales in the five weeks to
December 31 increased 6.2 per cent on the year before, improving to 7 per
cent in the first three weeks of this month.
'We are cautious about consumer expenditure in 1994, but we will continue
down the same path of finding more efficient ways of doing things,' Sir
Malcolm said.
He said efficiency improvements had helped the company to offer lower prices
without sacrificing gross margin. He added that successful retailing in the
1990s meant not just offering the lowest prices, but good service, and he
was scathing about some rivals' claims that they had cut prices to drive
volumes.
'Some retailers are good at claiming they have the lowest prices, but when
you actually look at them it's not true at all.'
Group turnover increased 6.6 per cent to Pounds 1.14bn. UK retail sales,
including WH Smith, Our Price, Waterstones, and a 50 per cent share of the
Virgin chain, rose 7 per cent to Pounds 612.5m, with profits up 4.6 per cent
to Pounds 32.1m.
WH Smith said music sales had recovered, and a price promotion on videos had
lifted sales, but sales of computer game hardware were down.
Its share of losses at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots, fell
slightly to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 8.4m). Sir Malcolm said the group was
negotiating to sell a number of the chain's weaker stores and a provision
would be made at the year-end.
The distribution and office supplies business lifted sales 4.2 per cent to
Pounds 497.6m and profits 14.2 per cent to Pounds 18.5m. But while sales
were up 4 per cent in the US division to Dollars 155.6m (Pounds 103.7m),
profits slipped from Dollars 5.5m to Dollars 5.2m.
Earnings increased to 11.6p (10.8p). The company is reducing the disparity
between its final and interim dividends and lifted the interim from 4.3p to
5p.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Mercedes trucks heads for 1994 loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading
truck maker, warned yesterday that the commercial vehicle operation would
suffer a third successive annual loss in 1994.
The car division, which also suffered an operating loss in 1993, was
expected to return to profit, helped by a forecast 12 per cent increase in
sales to 570,000.
Turnover at Mercedes-Benz, which accounts for about two-thirds of its parent
Daimler-Benz's total sales, was forecast to rise by 5 per cent this year to
DM68bn (Pounds 26bn). Daimler-Benz suffered a loss of DM2bn in the first
nine months of 1993 under US accounting rules.
Mr Werner said that Mercedes-Benz had embarked on a 'radical rethinking' of
its production structure. It was planning to:
increase the share of car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in the
medium term from only 2 per cent, in such countries as the US, Mexico, South
Korea and India. It expected to sign shortly a deal with Tata, the Indian
vehicle maker, to assemble up to 15,000 E-Class cars a year from 1995.
cut the level of in-house manufacturing from 45 per cent to less than 40 per
cent by 1998 by making greater use of outside components suppliers.
enter more co-operative ventures with other vehicle makers and suppliers.
Mercedes-Benz was also seeking to improve productivity. Capital spending was
being reduced to DM18.7bn in the five years to 1998 from the DM21bn
previously planned for the five years to 1997.
'We shall be able to achieve more with our available funds than in the past.
High investment expenditure is not always a sign of efficient performance,'
said Mr Werner. Research and development spending was also being cut by
DM1bn to DM16bn between the two planning periods, although spending on
product development was being increased by DM1bn.
Capital productivity had fallen steadily in recent years leading to 'a
dramatic increase in depreciation', said Mr Werner. 'We have to deploy our
investment more efficiently.' The company had cut its costs by DM4bn in 1993
alone and planned to close the present cost gap with Japanese producers by
1998. Mercedes-Benz cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992,
some 11,000 last year and planned to cut a further 8,000 jobs this year to
give a total of 151,000 by the end of 1994. The German vehicle industry
overall cut 70,000 jobs last year, said Mr Werner.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Germany plans more open market for gas and electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government is drawing up legislation to open the country's highly
regulated market for electricity and gas.
A draft law allowing access to the energy supply grids will be presented to
the cabinet before Easter, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said
yesterday.
The move would allow domestic and foreign competitors to take on the main
energy utilities including RWE, Veba's Preussen-Elektra and Bayernwerk, as
well as Ruhrgas, the country's leading gas importer and distributor.
It is likely to be fiercely resisted by the big utilities, the local
authorities which are their leading shareholders, and trade unions and
opposition Social Democrats because of worries about job security and
quality of services.
Mr Rexrodt insisted the change had the backing of the ruling coalition in
Bonn, and he was determined to make it law before the next election. It is
part of the government's programme to create jobs and stimulate growth.
'I know this is stirring up a hornet's nest,' he said. 'But we have the
consumers supporting us, for whom electricity and gas in Germany have been
too expensive for far too long.'
The new law will bar agreements between the utilities which set demarcation
lines between their operations, with each supplying all energy demand in
their own areas. Instead, it will give transmission rights to other gas and
electricity suppliers.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary for economics, said the aim was to open
competition in the German market before the European Union allowed
cross-border energy supplies from 1998. Germany would allow cross-border
supplies once neighbouring countries did the same.
The German market was opened to foreign competitors for the first time last
year, when an Anglo-US consortium, including Britain's PowerGen, bought the
Mibrag brown coal field in east Germany.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French, German and Italian steel tube companies yesterday won approval to
merge, creating a bulwark against Scandinavian, Japanese and east European
competition, after the European Commission overturned an internal
recommendation that the deal should be blocked.
After weeks of lobbying by the companies and their trade unions, the 17
European commissioners were split eight against eight on the issue as Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, abstained. This made it impossible for
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, to obtain majority approval
for his proposal to outlaw the deal.
Vallourec, a French steel tubing company, Dalmine, a subsidiary of Ilva, the
Italian steel producer, and Mannesmann of Germany, want to form a joint
venture called DMV, and cut capacity in high-technology seamless stainless
steel tubes, which are used in the nuclear and chemical industries.
But the Commission's merger task force had said the deal should be blocked
as it could create an anti-competitive duopoly in the European Union market.
Together with Swedish engineering group, Sandvik, DMV will have nearly 69
per cent of the EU market. Most of the remainder is shared by Tubacex of
Spain, Schoeller Bleckmann of Austria and Sumitomo of Japan.
Mr Jean-Claude Cabre, chief operating officer at Vallourec, welcomed the
Commission's decision and said: 'Now we will have a level of competitiveness
which will permit us not only to compete with Sandvik, but with Sumitomo,
the eastern bloc and even Russia.'
It is Mr Van Miert's first Commission defeat since he took over as
competition commissioner in January 1993. The defeat is a setback for the
merger taskforce, which had hoped to set a precedent for the treatment of
duopolies with no structural links.
The three companies estimate that after production cuts DMV will have a
turnover of FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) a year and employ 1,000 people.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Berlusconi sets up group to fight March election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, abandoned his position as chairman
of Italy's third-largest private business empire yesterday in favour of an
uncertain career as head of a new political grouping, Forza Italia - 'Come
on, Italy' - to fight a general election in March.
It is the first time in recent years such a prominent business figure in any
European democracy has switched from business to politics. Mr Berlusconi
said he was entering politics 'because I don't want to live in an illiberal
country run by immature people linked to the political and economic failures
of the past'.
The announcement came in a video message sent to television stations
controlled by his Fininvest group and those of state-run television. State
television was last night resisting pressure from him to run either the full
eight-minute video or a four-minute version on the grounds that they were
unsolicited political propaganda.
Mr Berlusconi's likely entry into politics has been an on-off affair since
last December. He had held back until now because of fears that his entry
could split the centre-right vote even more.
There are believed to be some 4,000 Forza Italia clubs already in existence,
set up by Mr Berlusconi some months ago.
His principal enemy, the former communist party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), said Mr Berlusconi could not easily distance himself from his media
interests and there were clear conflicts. Indeed, Fininvest made clear that
Mr Berlusconi's ownership would remain unchanged. He was simply abandoning
any management role. Fininvest controls more than 80 per cent of Italy's
commercial television networks, as well as two newspapers and magazines.
His move also raises questions about the financial health of Fininvest,
whose profit figures analysts have recently begun to question. Its 1992
profit was L21bn (Pounds 8.2m) in the published accounts with debt at
L4,500bn, 43 per cent of turnover. Part of his empire, Silvio Berlusconi
Enterprises, has been due to be floated to raise money. Last autumn the
banks obliged him to bring in a more professional management structure.
Mr Berlusconi said yesterday: 'I want to form a wholly new group of voters.
It won't be the traditional faction-ridden grouping. On the contrary it will
have the opposite aim - of uniting people to give Italy the majority and
government the country needs.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tantalising glimpse of Beazer Homes offered by Hanson yesterday will lay
a few ghosts to rest. Beazer's land bank will last for more than three years
at the current rate of house sales, which should allay fears that the
business has been squeezed for cash under Hanson's stewardship. If land was
run down through recession, recent acquisitions have been sufficient to
replenish stocks. Important details such as Beazer's cost per plot will have
to wait for the publication of a full prospectus. But the Pounds 99m asset
write-down taken in 1992 shows that measures have been taken to protect
profit margins.
Since operating margins are already a respectable 13 per cent, though,
Beazer cannot boast the same recovery prospects as some of its peers. Unless
house price inflation returns in earnest, profits growth will have to rely
on rising unit sales. That argues for a lower share rating than house
builders now operating on wafer-thin margins. The final price will also
depend on Beazer's balance sheet. Since house builders generally absorb cash
going into the upturn - as profits are ploughed back into land - too much
debt could raise fears of a rights issue further down the line.
Assuming the prospectus contains no such nasty shocks, and a multiple of
perhaps 12 times this year's likely earnings, Hanson might still raise more
than Pounds 400m from the sale. The outperformance of other house builders
this month suggests investors are anything but tired of the sector. With
April's tax rises looming, there could be a danger in waiting too long.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years in the doldrums, small company shares finally delivered in
1993. Measured by the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, the minnows
delivered a total return of 44 per cent last year, outperforming the market
by the largest margin since 1978. The composition of the index is a partial
explanation; interest rate-sensitive stocks such property companies are
clustered in the lower reaches of the market, while unfashionable consumer
goods companies are scarce. But size itself appears to be just as important
as sector. The bottom tenth of the index measured by market capitalisation
delivered a total return of almost 100 per cent.
If recovery stays on track there could be more to come. Manufacturing and
capital goods companies stand to benefit most as the UK economy turns, and
are also heavily represented among smaller capitalised stocks. The recent
outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which is also weighted in the
direction of manufacturers, suggests that investors appreciate as much. As
with the very largest companies, though, much now depends on whether
companies can deliver the earnings and dividend growth implied by high
ratings.
There are also risks along the way. While the number of bankruptcies among
smaller companies fell sharply in 1993, the experience of the 1980s suggests
that trend might be expected to reverse this year as some companies
over-reach going into recovery.

FT  27 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: W H Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
W H Smith's rather glum results neatly underlined the tough trading
conditions in the high street. While the company held on to its gross margin
and reported an accelerating sales trend towards Christmas, raising turnover
is clearly still a tough job. That is unfortunate, since pressure on margins
is likely to mount in several of Smith's businesses. Thus far News
International has borne the full weight of its newspaper price reductions.
If the lower prices become permanent, there must be a strong temptation to
share the pain with distributors and retailers. Lower CD prices - ironically
something for which Smith's has been arguing - may be on the way. Unless the
market grows substantially as a result, Smith's revenues will decline. If
the Net Book Agreement eventually goes, it may well cut margins at the
popular end of the market.
All of that will test Smith's management skills, particularly since in the
past the company has had the good fortune to operate in markets, such as
books and newspapers, with above average inflation. Lower margin businesses
and tough competition mean slips will not be so easily forgiven. It will be
interesting to see whether the company can cut its cost base to adjust to
that world. As well as improvements behind the scenes, that may mean rolling
out good ideas like Virgin Megastores faster. And if that is not enough to
keep the new chief executive, Sir Malcolm Field, occupied, there is always
the only partly defused land mine which is Do It All.

The gilts market was inclined to shrug off the disappointing result of
yesterday's gilt auction. In the short run it may have reasons for doing so.
Overseas investors have little interest in stocks with a maturity as long as
15 years, so this auction depended more than usual on domestic investors.
The run-up in the market since the initial auction announcement and the
uncertain tone of international bond markets may have made them more
selective about the timing and price of their purchases. That does not add
up to a basic shift in direction, but it does add piquancy to the question
of the government's apparently more relaxed attitude to public sector pay.
Even on this score, gilt bulls can find reasons not to worry. With price
pressures so depressed there is little risk of pay review body awards
rekindling general inflation. The government may manage to finance the
awards with productivity improvements. If it does not, the impact on the
PSBR should be small, and nothing to worry about when it is well ahead with
funding.
The danger lies in the slightly longer term. A year ago the political
pressure on the government was to cut interest rates in the face of a weak
economy. Now it is focused more on the fiscal side as MPs have become aware
of the impact of lower rates on savers and the unpopularity of higher taxes.
The government is pretty well locked into its programme of tax increases but
there is always room for slippage on spending. Unless it is careful, fiscal
policy could turn out to be looser and interest rates higher than the City
now assumes. Neither gilts nor equities could view that prospect with
relish.

There is little more than a fortnight to go before the start of the Winter
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, but one band of merrymakers familiar from
the Albertville and Barcelona games will sadly not be there.
The men - and women - from Mars have failed to reach satisfactory terms with
the International Olympic Committee to continue Mars' sponsorship of the
Olympics. Mars stumped up about Dollars 25m to be a main sponsor of 1992's
Albertville and Barcelona games. The starting price for major sponsors -
such as Coca-Cola - which have stayed the course for Lillehammer 1994 and
Atlanta 1996 has risen to Dollars 40m.
The IOC says its split with Mars was 'amicable'. But - sotto voce - the IOC,
uneasily riding the two unrelated horses of commercialism and athleticism,
was not overjoyed with Mars' desire to repeat its Barcelona antics - hordes
of Mars employees swamping the Olympic village handing out sweeties to
everything that moves.
Perish the thought that Coke should try to do the same when the Olympics
hits its home town of Atlanta in 1996.

A Basle reader inquires whether the German central bank will henceforth be

His question is prompted only indirectly by the Bundesbank president's
perceived proximity to God.
The staunchly Catholic Hans Tietmeyer, a former altar boy who once thought
of becoming a priest, has been chosen as one of 40 members of a new
interdenom-inational Academy of Social Sciences - set up by the Pope. The
new seat of learning is an offshoot of the eminent but obscure Pontifical
Academy of Sciences and, like the latter, will meet in a 16th century summer

the benefit of the church's sociological teachings.

Britain's Department of Transport seems oblivious to all the talk in
Whitehall about looking after taxpayers' money and maintaining a tighter
grip on the government's finances.
When Labour MP John Spellar asked about the cost to the taxpayer of the
government's decision to extend Eurotunnel's concession by 10 years, he got
a dusty answer. Transport secretary John MacGregor said he could not
estimate it 'with any precision'.
Eurotunnel clearly thought the extension represented serious money in the
bank and is likely to quantify it in its forthcoming rights issue
prospectus. In the meantime, Warburg Securities, Eurotunnel's broker, has
publicly estimated that the extension has added around Pounds 300m to the
value of the project.
No reason why the taxpayer shouldn't be told.

21 years old yesterday, remains as snooty as ever, despite advancing age.
Only a couple of establishments are felt worthy of three stars, even though
the number of one stars has now topped 50 for the first time.
Sadly, the passing years have also precipitated a degree of memory lapse.
Journalists set out for the award ceremony at new one-star holder Leith's,
in Kensington Road, as per the invitation, only to find themselves lost.
Forgivable, seeing that the collators of the 5,700 entries had omitted the
all-important 'Park' nestling between the Kensington and the Road.

A couple of US academics want to mark the occasion, but they have been

Scotland which is planning its own 'Festival of Accounting'.
Not to be outdone, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales is now entering the lists with 'Figures in proportion', an exhibition
of its own original edition of Pacioli's ancient masterpiece. With all the

FT  27 JAN 94 / On the planet of the unholy allies: Robert Graham examines
the realignment of Italy's political parties as they prepare for a general
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacle of Italy preparing for its general election resembles
interlocking galaxies: politicians and parties are like planets orbiting
each other with nothing to halt them.
The poll on March 27 will mark a watershed in the country's political
development. A new electoral formula will introduce the principle of a
first-past-the-post system and voters will choose from a plethora of
recycled or new parties.
At this stage the outcome is unpredictable. Most political parties are short
of funds, poorly organised and without any clear idea of where their votes
are likely to come from - let alone the policies on which such votes might
be sought.
The latest addition to the field is Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. He
has chosen to ignore advice to refrain from direct politics and has decided
to offer himself as the white knight for people 'of goodwill' to rally round
and prevent Italy being run by a left-wing government.
While no one will hazard a bet on the likely winner, or winners, at least
one result of the election can be predicted. Italy will introduce a system
that encourages parties to alternate in power. This is a turning point in
political culture.
Until now Italy has been unique among western European democracies for its
political immobility. Christian Democrat-dominated coalitions have backed
each of Italy's 52 postwar governments. This lack of a genuine alternative
to the parties in government has been a crucial ingredient behind the spread
of corruption that has provoked the collapse of the old political system.
The poll is being held a mere 23 months after the last general election. But
the early dissolution of parliament was an inevitable consequence of the
discredit heaped on the traditional parties by two years of non-stop
scandals. With one in six deputies under investigation, parliament had
little moral claim to represent the people.
Local elections last June and November, using new electoral laws,
demonstrated that the composition of parliament was out of balance with
popular sentiment. The four parties that provided the notional majority for
the technocratic government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi had come to account
for well under 20 per cent of the popular vote.
Despite efforts by die-hards among the Christian Democrats and Socialists to
prolong the life of parliament, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had no
alternative but to announce a dissolution.
Since the announcement on January 16, events have moved fast, dictated by
the former Communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). It is way ahead,
both by virtue of its organisation and because Mr Achille Occhetto, its
leader, has grasped the need to forge alliances under the new system, where
75 per cent of the seats are to be covered by majority voting.
Some 18 parties will be contending for a share of power. None, on current
estimates, is capable of mustering more than 18-20 per cent of the vote, and
most will win considerably less. The victor will, therefore, inevitably have
to be a coalition of parties which will be formed in advance of the
elections - a break with tradition.
The PDS has arranged an effective 'progressive alliance' of candidates. It
is composed of the Sicily-based clean government movement, the Network, the
Greens, some radical Catholics, former Republicans grouped under the
reformist movement, Democratic Alliance, and on occasions the rump of the
Communist party, Reconstructed Communism.
The PDS has placed at the disposal of these groupings its considerable
nationwide organisation, the best in Italy and inherited from the Communist
party. In return, it has acquired the de facto right to act as the leader of
the alliance. On the latest projections, this group is capable of winning at
least 40 per cent of the vote.
Being thus organised while everyone else is either disorganised or
squabbling over the nature of alliances, the PDS has dictated an important
part of the battleground.
The campaign will be fought on whether Italy should have a government
dominated by a party that is the heir to the Communists. This is certainly
going to be Mr Berlusconi's chosen area of battle.
It will be up to the PDS to demonstrate that the party has evolved towards
an acceptable form of social democracy, embracing the broad lines of a
market economy, complete with privatisation and reduced state spending. The
fact that the PDS ended up as a key supporter of the Ciampi government's
1994 austerity budget in parliament has yet to be appreciated by the
electorate.
The success of the PDS will depend in good measure on how united or split
the other parties are. The greater the number of other parties and alliances
in the field, the better the PDS's chance of winning. The greatest number of
groupings is fighting for the centre ground, to occupy the hole left by the
40 per cent of the voters traditionally accounted for by the Christian
Democrats and their allies.
Mr Berlusconi's entry yesterday adds a 'Ross Perot' factor to the equation.
He risks splitting the centre vote, rather than acting as a coagulant as he
pretends. He is an inexperienced politician and has been publicly warned to
stay out of politics by every leading political figure.
His movement, Forza Italia (literally, the footballer's exhortation 'Come
on, Italy') is well organised, rich, controversially backed by his
television stations and slick on public relations; but it cannot hide Mr
Berlusconi's manifest vanity nor the thinness of his political ideas. He is
also likely to become the biggest single target for media hate and
investigation, particularly as his business rivals finance a big slice of
the newspaper industry and support opposing parties. A 'Stop Berlusconi'
campaign is thus likely to be a significant feature of the elections.
Forza Italia will be most threatening if Mr Berlusconi makes an alliance
with the neo-fascist MSI, which last week sought to gain greater
respectability by rebaptising itself the National Alliance. The MSI
performed strongly in the centre and south in last year's local elections,
and is one of the fastest-growing parties.
Mr Berlusconi probably would have never been able to enter politics had not
the Christian Democrats' authority been eroded. The party, founded in 1942,
has been obliged to adopt a new identity with almost indecent haste to
revive its fortunes. Last weekend it became the Popular Party (PP), drawing
inspiration from the similarly named party of the 1920s that was the
forebear of the modern Christian Democrats.
The PP is still led by the chisel-faced Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the former
Christian Democrat leader. It looks no different from its predecessor and
espouses the same woolly platform of 'Catholic values'. The only difference
is that the political dinosaurs like former Premier Giulio Andreotti have
been excluded. Some 10 per cent of the outgoing Christian Democrat deputies
have formed a breakaway party - the Centre Christian Democrats.
Mr Martinazzoli's natural ally is Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader and
breakaway Christian Democrat. Mr Segni is not an easy partner and for the
moment has opted for a deal with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto
Bossi. The latter could prove a useful marriage of convenience with the
league delivering a sizeable slice of the vote in the north, and Mr Segni
picking up the vote in the centre in the south.
At this stage all the potential alliances look at best opportunistic. With
the exception of the PDS alliance, none augurs well for forming a credible,
cohesive government.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Public sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough problems require tough but skilfully implemented solutions. The
government's freezing of the public sector wage bill for the next three
years is a suitably firm response to a gaping fiscal deficit and the
inefficiency which still infects many areas of the public sector. Yet the
government must avoid undermining the independent review bodies, which are
in the process of making recommendations on the next round of public sector
pay deals.
The three-year freeze on the public sector wage bill announced by the
chancellor last September never implied a freeze on wages. If costs can be
reduced and more efficient working practices devised then the savings made
can be used to fund higher wages.
It is not yet known what the pay review bodies will recommend. Their role is
to consider comparisons with the private sector, where pay is rising at an
annual rate of 3 per cent, and when headline inflation is running at 1.9 per
cent. It may be that some of the review bodies will see a case for increases
significantly ahead of this inflation rate, but there is also a reasonable
chance that they will call for rises which can be accommodated within a
static overall pay bill.
If this happens, it will further increase the chances of completing the pay
round without open conflict. Some public sector union leaders have talked of
a spring offensive on wages, but in reality their members show little sign
of wanting a fight. Union leaders would be wise to recognise this mood,
since the government cannot afford to see its restrictions on pay in the
public sector overturned at this stage in the deficit-reduction process. Any
challenge would be firmly resisted.
Ministers, however, should beware the hubris which might arise from an easy
victory this year. It is not in anyone's interest to see public sector wages
slip seriously out of line with those in the private sector as the labour
market tightens.
The widespread strikes and breakdowns in public service which led to the
creation of the independent review bodies a decade ago have not necessarily
been banished for ever. Before ministers risk undermining their advisers by
casually ignoring their work in good times, they should reflect upon the
long-term value of a mechanism that offers transparent analysis and an
alternative to confrontation.
It is difficult to make sensible productivity projections across the public
sector for the entire three-year period of the proposed pay freeze and
ministers will be wise to consider the matter with care before leaping to
convenient conclusions.
At the same time, ministers should recognise that their policies towards the
public sector involve an unreconciled contradiction: on the one hand they
favour decentralisation, contracting out and greater freedom for local
management; on the other, they are using a blunt and centralised instrument
on pay. It would be unwise to regard the three-year paybill freeze as beyond
further debate.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Leading Article: European defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's meeting of the British, French and German defence ministers was
apparently an unprecedented event. It would be quite normal for any two of
them to meet bilaterally, or for all three to meet with their colleagues in
the Western European Union. But a trilateral meeting is a novelty.
That it has been held barely a fortnight after the recent Nato summit is not
a coincidence. One important and perhaps insufficiently noticed effect of
that summit has been to give a significant boost to what is known, in
current politico-military jargon, as the 'European security and defence
identity' (ESDI). Previous attempts to develop this have been checked by the
conflicting priorities of Britain and France. France believes that ESDI
should be an aspect of the EU, distinct from and independent of Nato, while
the UK opposes anything which might appear to compete with, undermine or
otherwise weaken Nato.
At the summit President Bill Clinton not only reaffirmed the US's long-term
commitment to European security, but also made it crystal clear that this
commitment would be strengthened, not weakened, by the development of the
ESDI, to which the new 'combined joint taskforces' are intended to give
tangible form. More important, he did so in a way that apparently carried
conviction with European leaders, including notably President Francois
Mitterrand.
France, no longer under pressure to return formally to the integrated Nato
command which it left in 1966, and no longer suspecting the 'Anglo-Saxons'
of seeking to block the development of ESDI, has shed virtually all its
inhibitions about working with Nato on a day-to-day basis. The UK for its
part now feels much more relaxed and positive about ESDI. Current thinking
in Whitehall is that it should be possible, when the Maastricht treaty is
revised in 1996, to endow the EU with a common defence policy explicitly
linked to the Atlantic alliance. This would, among other things, make it
easier to rebut Russian objections to central and east European countries
joining Nato, since membership of the alliance would become a logical part
of their preparation for membership of the EU.
The faltering of the Russian reform process, and the chauvinistic noises
heard from Russia in the last few months, have obliged west European
governments to begin thinking seriously about defence; while the US attitude
to the former Yugoslavia has strengthened the feeling, in London as well as
Paris, that Europe should be better equipped to take military action on its
own when necessary. At present Europe is clearly incapable of doing anything
serious in the defence field without US leadership and direct involvement.
That will not be changed by occasional meetings of defence ministers, or for
that matter by an amendment to the Maastricht treaty. If they seriously
intend to develop a capacity to act, European governments will have to check
and perhaps even reverse the reduction of their defence budgets, which
everywhere except in France are virtually in free fall. They will need to
look much harder at ways of getting a 'bigger bang for the buck' (or for the
Ecu), by co-ordinating their procurement policies and extending the single
market to defence contracts. Above all they will need to develop a genuine
unity of purpose, which means a capacity to reach common decisions and a
willingness to act on them.
Of that there can be little hope until Germany overcomes the inhibitions it
currently feels about joining in military operations, even when firmly
convinced of their political necessity.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Parent power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who should run Britain's state schools, appoint the teachers and decide
their priorities? The answer, the government says, is the school governors,
the majority of whom are parents. The right to hire and fire teachers - the
head teacher, in particular - was taken away from local authorities to stop
them interfering in the day-to-day working of schools.
Now this apparently sensible reform has been cast into doubt by events at
Kingsmead School in Hackney, east London. Ms Jane Brown, the head, last week
achieved instant notoriety by refusing cheap tickets for her children to see
the ballet Romeo and Juliet. She described Shakespeare's plot as 'blatantly
heterosexual', calling down a torrent of media interest and abuse for her
political correctness. This abated somewhat after she apologised for her
decision. But it then emerged that Ms Brown shares a house with a woman who
chaired the school governors at the time of her appointment.
Hackney Borough Council, anxious to improve the poor image of its education
service, launched an immediate inquiry into her appointment. To the
council's horror, the governors have refused to suspend her during the
inquiry. In this, they apparently have the backing of the parents: even
those who condemn her refusal of the tickets say that she has been a good
head. Parents have shown a healthy scepticism for Hackney's desire for a
quick end to the affair. More to the point, they seem well able to separate
Ms Brown's private life from her professional performance.
This has led to predictable calls for Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, to intervene and remove Ms Brown as head. He can do this under
powers left over from the 1944 Education Act. Mr Patten would be wise to
ignore such calls, however, despite the prospect of popular acclaim for so
doing. If parent power is to mean anything, the governors' decision - made
with clear parental backing - must not be second-guessed from Whitehall.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Court revolutions: A possible way of increasing the
independence of the Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As MPs debate independence for the Bank of England tomorrow, attention is
turning to the role of the Bank's court, or governing body. Though the
government is unlikely in the near future to give the Bank autonomy over
interest rates, the question of how the court might develop over the longer
term is exercising policymakers.
Mainly comprising captains of industry, plus six senior Bank officials, the
18-strong body meets every Thursday in the Bank's 18th-century 'court room'
to discuss general economic trends, the business outlook for the City and
internal staff matters such as training. No formal decisions are taken, but
the meetings channel outside views to the Bank officials, led by governor Mr
Eddie George.
Some believe that a more formal role for the court may be a necessary step
if the government is ever to move towards giving the Bank control over
interest rates.
While the bill before MPs tomorrow - introduced by Tory backbencher Mr
Nicholas Budgen - has little chance of becoming law, the debate will be
another boost for those who argue that removing politicians from monetary
decisions would lead to more stable economic policies.
The bill does not mention the court; Mr Budgen wants to concentrate on the
main political and economic issues. But discussion about greater autonomy
for the Bank is intrinsically linked to the future of the court, which has
met virtually every week during the Bank's 300-year history.
Gatherings of the court are highly confidential, with minutes released in
full only a century later - a lengthy delay even by British standards of
official secrecy. Each court member receives Pounds 500 a year plus a weekly
lunch, invariably consisting of smoked salmon and roast lamb. Members
include Sir David Lees, chairman of engineering group GKN, Sir Christopher
Hogg, chairman of Reuters, Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, and
Sir 'Chips' Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank.
One person with firm views about what the court should do is Sir Peter
Middleton, a former Treasury permanent secretary who is chairman of the
Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment group. In October, he told MPs he was in
favour of the court taking on people with a greater commitment than the
current court to keeping prices down.
There are two broad ways the court could evolve. It could act as 'joint
arbiter', sharing decision-making with the governor, or as 'cheerleader',
leaving most judgments to him but helping the Bank sell its message and
shielding the governor from policy attacks by outsiders.
The cheerleading approach would be the less ambitious option, but the court
would still play a more public role than now. One court member says it is
already taking a more pragmatic line: 'We are getting ready to stand up and
be counted behind the governor, should our support be needed.'
But the 'joint arbiter' model appears to be gaining the support of more of
those who back Bank independence, partly because sharing out decision-making
would make policy judgments more transparent. Mr John Watts, chairman of the
Commons treasury and civil service committee, says: 'Swapping the judgment
of the chancellor of the exchequer for that of the governor, no matter how
good he is, is not an attractive option.'
One idea for ensuring accountability would be for court members in any new,
independent Bank to testify every few months to a parliamentary committee.
Others make the point that bringing more people into the arguments over
interest rates would mean more appropriate decisions being reached in the
complex business of setting monetary policy.
Such an approach would put the Bank on a similar footing to the US Federal
Reserve, the German Bundesbank and the newly independent Bank of France -
which all share decision-making between full-time officials and selected
outsiders.
Sir John Banham, a former director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry and chairman of the Local Government Commission, says the governing
body of an independent Bank should be analogous to the corporate boards of
directors, which have responsibility for overseeing long-term strategy.
As to who Britain might pick for a revitalised court, the newly independent
Bank of France might show the way. This month it selected the nine-strong
body that will set monetary policy. It comprises three full-time Bank
officials, two industrialists, a former government minister, a journalist, a
financier and an economist. Mr Warwick Lightfoot, a former Treasury adviser,
even suggests that, in the cause of attracting 'serious players', the court
could be opened to foreigners such as Mr Helmut Schlesinger and Mr Paul
Volcker, former heads of the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve respectively.
Such an approach might go some way to assuaging the fears of those sceptical
about moving towards Bank independence. It would offer a means of removing
political interference while ensuring the process of decision-making was
transparent, spread over a relatively large group of people and appropriate
to the needs of the UK economy.

DISCLOSURE
By Michael Crichton
Century. Pounds 14.99
Thomas Sanders is a great guy: smart, well-liked and going places in his
Seattle-based high-tech company. Meredith Johnson is a bitch: manipulative,
ruthless and sexy. One morning he turns up to work late - having given the
kids breakfast while his lawyer wife throws a tantrum - to find Meredith has
been appointed his boss.
Once they were lovers but, since they split up 10 years ago, they have
barely seen each other. On her first day in the job she plies him with wine,
and leaps on top of him. He fights her off, escaping with a scratched chest
and a torn shirt. The next morning both claim they were sexually harassed by
the other.
Were Disclosure an ordinary airport novel the verdict would be simple: the
characters are cardboard cut-outs and the plot ludicrous. The book is none
the worse for that. The story races along, taking in sex, power, the
clashing cultures of two merging companies, virtual reality systems, CD-Rom
disc drives and telephones the size of a credit card.
In other circumstances you would read it, enjoy it, forget it. Yet Michael
Crichton - who caused something of a stir with his novel Jurassic Park - is
intent on getting more publicity out of this one. If the velociraptor was
frightening, meet the woman in the power suit.
Crichton wants Disclosure to be taken very seriously indeed. He claims the
book was a quasi-scientific undertaking, based on a true story and
substantiated by numerous interviews with experts in the field of sexual
harassment. He has suggested that part of the reason for writing it was to
explain to his four-year-old daughter what a bad old world it is out there.
It should not take his four-year-old long to work out that daddy has picked
a hot topic. Sexual harassment and male backlash are the great corporate
preoccupations of the moment: combine them in a story in which the woman
harasses the man, and bingo, the film rights sell for Dollars 3.5m and
feminists are furious.
Unless she has a good sense of humour, his daughter may not like the way
women are presented. Talented 'pale males' are passed over for jobs in
favour of less capable women. The only trustworthy females are dull and
ugly. Wise men never sit next to a female colleague on an aircraft for fear
she will accuse him of being unable to keep his hands to himself.
Yet for all that, Disclosure raises some interesting points. By reversing
the sexes of the villain and the victim, the author makes us question our
standard reactions to sexual harassment. The sight of a woman grabbing and
lunging simply underlines how obnoxious the men are who really behave in
this way. This is not Crichton's intention.
Instead he is trying to show that sexual harassment is not a women's issue.
Repeatedly he asserts that it has nothing to do with sex and everything to
do with power. In the words of Louise Fernandez, Thomas's shrewd lawyer:
'Sexual harassment is about power, and so is the company's resistance to
dealing with it. Power protects power. And once a woman gets up in the power
structure, she'll be protected by the structure, the same as a man.'
Nobody denies that women harass men. In the US some 10 per cent of the
22,000 cases filed each year are from men. In Europe there is also a small
but growing number of men who claim to have been harassed by women. Crichton
is also right to point out that companies tend to stand behind their senior
executives. But his argument that harassment is only a function of power,
that senior women are just as likely to be perpetrators as their male
counterparts, is tenuous at best.
Still more dubious is the notion that women use the same tactics in the
office as their male counterparts. The evidence from the UK, at least,
suggests they are more likely to wear their victims down, with constant
unwanted remarks and invitations, than pin them to the sofa. It is in this
context that the implausibility of Meredith-the-she-devil matters: if sexual
abuse of power comes as naturally to women as to men, we need a more
recognisable stereotype. But a Meredith who persecuted Thomas with words
might not be bestseller material.
Regardless of the sex of the victim, Disclosure makes both too much and too
little of the effects of sexual harassment. Too much, because the outcome of
the corporate merger is made to depend on whether he pounced on her or vice
versa. Too little, because the embarrassment, guilt, lost reputation and
damage to family life that come with sexual harassment cases are skated
over. When New Man Thomas comes through victorious, he appears to have been
emotionally unscathed by the incident.
Crichton's view is that sexual harassment claims are reaching their peak
level. He argues that society will have to form rules to cope with the new
political correctness: allegations are flying and nobody knows what
behaviour is appropriate any more. He shows how damaging the mere accusation
of sexual harassment can be, and rails against the 'contemporary climate
where men were assumed to be guilty of anything they were accused of'.
The press release that accompanies the book finishes with an unusual message
in heavy type: 'Disclosure illuminates the situation today and demands that
it be addressed before it gets out of hand.' Actually, the book makes no
such demand, neither does it give much account of how the matter could be
remedied. Fernandez, the lawyer, throws in her solution at the end of the
book, but it is left dangling: 'When women have 50 per cent of the executive
positions. That's when it will end.'
Some readers, enraged at the depiction of 'female chauvinist sows', and
irritated by the advertisements warning that women are even more deadly than
dinosaurs, might doubt whether the author agrees total equality is the
answer.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shake-up is best chance for Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your flabby editorial advice to Prime Minister Hosokawa ('Tokyo: time
to compromise', January 24) - that he should patch up a compromise with the
Liberal Democrats over electoral reform - ill becomes you. It would lead
only to another decade of hugger-mugger corruption.
The point about the reform bill was not that single-member constituencies
are somehow better or more democratic. It is just that - as intelligent
Italians perceived - the best way of shaking a nation out of corrupt
practices is to make a lot of the basic ones irrelevant by a new system of
elections. And his defeat in the Upper House gives Hosokawa the chance of a
lifetime to do that shake-up in an even more thorough-going way.
Surely better advice would be that he should take a leaf out of the book of
Mario Segni and his referendum alliance at the last Italian general election
 -but in a more thorough-going fashion. Hosokawa's personal popularity is
high. If a referendum were possible the reform bill would win a strong
popular majority.
So why does he not take his courage in both hands, dissolve the Lower House,
and put himself at the head of a cross-party ad hoc reform alliance with the
passage of the reform bill as its sole objective? He should clearly declare
his refusal to make advance deals either on cabinet seats or any other
aspect of policy; and promise further elections as soon as the electoral
system is changed. It is a package which might just come off. Even trying it
would 'break the mould'.
It would not be so bad, either, for the economy that you are primarily
worried about. The excitement and optimism engendered could well restore
business confidence. There might even be less paralysis of government; the
bureaucracy could get on with business as usual, with fewer irrational
interruptions.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance falls as executive pay
rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your story, 'Executive pay rises three times faster than inflation'
(January 24), makes many important points but it fails to identify the most
significant feature. Based on a sample from the latest accounts - to the
year ending October 31 1993 - of 653 plc companies in the FT-SE
'non-financials', the remuneration of the highest-paid directors rose by
10.48 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
Breaking this down into the size ranges you used shows that the highest-paid
directors in the 169 companies with sales exceeding Pounds 600m received
increased remuneration of 12.38 per cent. Those directors in the 250
companies with sales between Pounds 100m and Pounds 600m received 9.35 per
cent and the 234 with sales less than Pounds 100m had increases of 7.76 per
cent.
Total board remuneration rose by a more modest 3.48 per cent, according to
the published accounts, while the number of directors rose by 3.67 per cent,
suggesting others did not do quite so well.
A study such as the one the FT reported depends on the co-operation of
participating companies. This raises the possibility of a study having to
omit some companies which did not wish to take part and so avoiding the
disclosure of their increases. The above figures are based on a total sample
of the FT-SE 'non-financials', plus a few more, and therefore provides a
robust appraisal.
What is even more concerning is that while these average increases were
being paid to the highest paid directors, the overall corporate performance
was actually falling. The return on total assets fell from 18.78 per cent to
15.52 per cent (-17.4 per cent), return on capital employed fell from 7.78
per cent to 6.44 per cent (-17.2 per cent), margins declined from 8.04 per
cent to 6.64 per cent (-17.4 per cent) and added value/pay went from 1.71 to
1.69 (-1.2 per cent). Earnings fell 3.50 per cent but retained profit fell
by 47 per cent to only 22.55 per cent of the figure four years earlier.
Noticeably, dividends are up 23.7 per cent over the same four years.
Not only are executives receiving increases larger than inflation, as your
feature stated, but the most senior executives are doing virtually twice as
well as the average you showed. Surely this suggests that the supposedly
independent compensation committees need more rigorous attention to detail
when setting standards and reviewing performance. Otherwise, how can such
overall increases be awarded at the same time as performance is falling?

FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inflation factor in tax argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICO COLCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One crucial point has gone unmentioned as government and opposition
argue about which of them taxes Britain more heavily. It is that inflation
is a hidden tax, which governments are hard-pressed to do without.
Today's Conservative government is trying to sustain a rate of inflation at
least 10 per cent lower than that managed by the Labour government of the
late 1970s. That amount of inflation would eat away the state's net current
debt of roughly Pounds 250bn by Pounds 25bn a year, as part of the insidious
process by which inflation taxes the saver and hands the proceeds to the
debtor.
There is not a huge amount to choose between the indebtedness of the state
today and in the 1970s, but there is a huge difference in its real carrying
cost for the government. Set against a total tax take of some Pounds 220bn a
year, that handicap of Pounds 25bn a year is a big one, particularly now
that income from the sale of state assets has dwindled.
One wonderful thing about low inflation is that it forces governments to be
more honest about what they offer and how they finance it, for any given
degree of involvement in the economy. But it may also force them to put up
with profligate governments of the past claiming that they somehow offered
people more while taxing them less.
They didn't; they just did it more stealthily.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax distortions on drinks harming UK
pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Cross-Channel Shopping' (January 25) has some curious
arguments. You seem to be saying that lower beer prices in supermarkets hurt
pubs, but not lower beer prices from duty-paid imports] The facts are
obvious. At least one in every seven pints drunk at home is a duty-paid
import. This must hurt everyone who produces and sells beer in the UK,
including pubs, clubs, off-licences and supermarkets - some 100,000
businesses employing around 500,000. On-licensed premises represent around
74 per cent of UK licensed outlets and are suffering accordingly.
The loss of revenue to the chancellor is at least Pounds 160m from beer duty
and VAT. But it extends beyond that, damaging sources of all kinds of tax
revenue from the businesses and individuals affected.
On pricing, your readers would not have guessed that wholesale beer prices,
net of tax and discounts, have decreased relative to the retail prices index
over the past three years. Externally imposed service costs on pubs have
increased well above RPI. Beer prices in pubs, net of tax, are almost the
lowest in the whole of the European Union; only Portugal is lower. Something
has to give and the need is for fair competition in the single market,
without distortion by the UK tax system.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Jobs - keep out the politically correct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's special draft
report on unemployment, outlined in the Financial Times on January 24, is an
example of excellent detailed analysis spoilt by the attempt to impose a
politically correct conclusion and summary.
Does it really help to increase the influence of the OECD to conclude 'the
requisite policy agenda will be wide-
ranging, and politically difficult, requiring much determination and a
commitment to social equity'? The call for 'undogmatic and concrete
solutions' is no doubt aimed at those whom French speakers call
'ultra-liberals', but is anyone at all impressed? Is 'an insufficient
ability to adapt to change' adequate as a summary of what has gone wrong?
These examples of OECD-speak from Paris - like similar examples of Eurospeak
from Brussels - serve only to smother some of the fascinating information
that the organisation's analysts have unearthed. For instance I did not know
until I saw this document of the survey evidence that, for every part-time
worker wishing to work full-time, there are three full-time workers who
would prefer to work part-time if they were able to.
I have, however, the fortunate advantage over the OECD that I am not trying
to increase my non-existent influence at summit conferences, let alone to
please 24 member governments. So let me try my own summary of the main
aspects of the European unemployment problem.
First, all markets require some reserves as shock absorbers. In product
markets these consist of stocks. In the labour market, as they at present
function, these are people out of work.
Second, the size of this reserve is swollen by two phenomena: inadequate
overall demand; and pay and other labour costs which price workers out of
jobs. The latter has been the more fundamental. But both forms of failure
interact with and reinforce each other.
Third, they are both aggravated by a shortage of capacity - it is this last
which provides the effective ceiling to UK employment at present. Such
capacity bottlenecks do not occur by accident in advanced economies. They
are nearly always a response to excess labour costs in the past. As a
result, investment has had too much of a capital deepen-ing character,
designed to cut costs and save manpower, and not enough of a cap-ital
widening kind, designed to increase capacity. (All of this is explained much
more clearly in The World Economy in Perspective, by Herbert Giersch,
published by Edward Elgar in 1991, than it is by the OECD.) In addition, the
legacy of past inflationary decades makes financial markets more suspicious
of official attempts to sustain demand.
It follows from the first proposition that work-sharing gimmicks, such as
early retirement, compulsory cuts in hours and so on, have at best a neutral
impact on jobs. The same amount of unemployment will re-emerge around a
smaller amount of output and employment. This is a self-inflicted wound that
European countries with ageing populations should hesitate to impose on
themselves. In practice, the effects are likely to be perverse, because
labour costs can increase if pay is not cut in proportion to the reduction
in hours, if shortages of highly skilled workers emerge or if the amount of
effect-ive industrial capacity is reduced.
Why should these phenomena have become so much worse in recent dec-ades?
There has probably been a fall in the market-clearing price
of many kinds of labour and certainly a fall in the relative demand for the
unskilled, the less adaptable and the unlucky. How far these trends are due
to technical change inside western economies and how far to competition from
newly industrialised countries is unsettled; but the implications are quite
similar.
The pressures are starkly illustrated by the accompanying chart. Low-paid
workers have been under pressure everywhere. (The bar representing Germany
should be treated with caution because
only five pre-unification years are covered.) But whereas in the US these
pressures have taken the form of falling real pay, in Europe they have
ex-pressed themselves in high unemployment.
If, however, Europe is to move towards American-type market-clearing pay,
and towards unemployment which is not only lower but more short-term in
composition, it is important that the casualties of lower pay should have
their incomes topped up by the rest of us who benefit from a more
efficiently working economy. Social security systems have to be designed
carefully to minimise work disincentives, but they also have to be adequate.
Some evidence that they have not been adequate is provided by the 1994 issue
of the official UK Social Trends published today. The special article in
Trends on the least well-off 20 per cent of the population avoids the issue
by taking a snapshot of affairs in 1990-91. But buried in the chapter on
income and wealth there is an important table which gives the game away -
indeed the facts have already emerged in parliamentary answers after last
summer's recess.
The table shows clearly that, looking at net income after housing costs  -
which is the normal method in such comparisons - the real income of the
bottom fifth fell between 1979, when Lady Thatcher came to office, and
1990-91 not merely in relation to the rest of the population but in absolute
terms. The typical drop was 3 per cent, compared with a rise of 28 per cent
(after tax and benefit) for the middle fifth and a rise of 50 per cent for
the top fifth. The estimates may, as ministers have claimed, have been
distorted by the under-reporting of the incomes of the increasing number of
self-employed people and other statistical problems. But these complications
do not explain away the whole change.
The root explanation is that the Conservative policy of tying benefits
purely to prices and not at all to incomes is bound to be vulnerable. For
any failure to claim benefit, or any change in specific circumstances not
covered by the system, will be sure to tip some families into being absolute
net losers.
However, the Trends analysis is a warning against spurious remedies for
poverty. A table reproduced on page 9 of today's FT shows that 56 per cent
of heads of household in the bottom fifth of the income distribution are
retired or without a job. Only 4 per cent are unskilled workers and 9 per
cent semi-skilled ones who might benefit - if they remain in work - from
Labour's proposed minimum wage. Another chart shows that 69 per cent of the
incomes of the bottom fifth consist of benefit and only 20 per cent of
earnings from employment.
Analysed in another way, more than 70 per cent of the bottom fifth of
households with children consist of one-parent families or couples with
children where neither parent has full-time earnings. These estimates do not
suggest that the British social security system is overflowing with
generosity to such people.
But simply to call for more generous benefit all round is unconvincing when
social security already totals Pounds 80bn a year and is by far the largest
component in the UK budget. Greater generosity needs to be combined with
greater selectivity. The left wing emphasises the first, the right wing
emphasises the second. The need is not to split the difference, but for
larger amounts of both. There is also a need for adjustments in the
conditions attaching to benefit to make it easier for people of low earnings
capacity to participate in labour markets without losing entitlement
altogether.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Arts: A pared-down Handful of Dust - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It started in Brazil. Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966), travelling to South America
in 1932 after a disastrous marriage, met a religious mystic bent on reading
Dickens. The resulting short story and the novel A Handful of Dust (1934)
have been a warning to South American explorers and Dickensians ever since.
Now the Cambridge Theatre Company has staged Waugh's book at the Palace
Theatre, Watford: it makes super theatre.
A Handful of Dust, straight from TS Eliot, tells of the creaky marriage
between Tony and Brenda Last, who in the 1930s are much less middle class
than they now sound. Brenda falls in love with a younger man, John Beaver,
at the same moment that the Last's eldest son dies in a hunting accident.
Grief and alimony drive Tony to search for Indian gold in South America; but
his expedition, lead by Dr Messenger, comes to a sticky end and Tony finds
himself a prisoner reading Dickens to the illiterate local potentate.
The director Mike Alfreds opts for the anti-Brideshead approach. The ten
actors do without scenery and props for this pared-down touring production.
The scenes are short, like movie cuts, and each one finishes with a freeze
frame. The lighting is bright white and the backdrop and costumes pearl
grey.
Alfreds' adaptation is excellent. He parcels out the narrative so that
Waugh's voice in the book shares itself among the actors, who introduce
themselves or the scene and then speak the lines. The ensemble scenes -
restaurants, parties and hunts - work well, and the actors retire to chairs
facing the stage. Alfreds' other company, Shared Experience, used the same
technique to tackle Anna Karenina, so it works on longer books as well.
Waugh's best lines survive, and make dramatic sense; as her affair gathers
pace, Brenda comments to the audience: 'Their interest in each other had so
far outdistanced their knowledge that there was a great deal to say.' The
cameos also live on: the shocking American Blonde, the doddering clergyman
Mr Tendril and in the background the humble and uncomplaining victims of
primogeniture.
The principals keep the action bowling along, although the long first half
and short second is a problem inherited straight from the novel. Lady Brenda
(Annabelle Apsion) is less worldly than in Waugh and Lord Tony (Tim Dutton)
more sympathetic; both actors are sharp and subtle. Elsewhere there are fine
performances from Jason Watkins (the Lasts' boy and Dr Messenger), Laurence
Kennedy (family friend and general club bore) and Sophie Heydel (Brenda's
socialite sister, Marjorie).
In all, the characters are less extreme than in Waugh's book, but more
easily caricatured. Perhaps he felt turning 30 altered his attitude: 'for
the first time I am trying to deal with normal people instead of eccentrics;
comic English character parts are too easy when one gets to be thirty.' Noel
Coward begs to differ.
The Palace Theatre, Watford (0923 225671) until February 12.

THE AGE OF INNOCENCE (U)
Martin Scorsese
MRS DOUBTFIRE (12)
Christopher Columbus
DECADENCE (18)
Steven Berkoff
In Martin Scorsese's The Age Of Innocence the director's fondness for
full-steam-ahead visuals - see Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas -
collides with novelist Edith Wharton's icy prose: that 1920s irony looking
back on 1870s social etiquette. The result is something like the alarm-bells
sounding on the Titanic. The viewer's imagination pushes the melodramatic
possibilities forward. But the SS Scorsese is stuck on the ice and - more
remarkably - it seems to be enjoying its state of suddenly ordained stasis.
While the audience tries to will the characters into Scorsese-ish excess,
the casting (mainly British) and the film's ornately deliberate style (James
Ivory meets Luchino Visconti) tell us to stop or slow down.
It takes half an hour, by my watch, to adjust the aesthetic metabolism. By
then such magic as the movie boasts - a lot, allowing for some tricks that
fail - is working. And we realise that the tension between energy and
stillness is the essence of both the film and Wharton's tale. Here is Mr
Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), affianced to the demure and lovely May Welland
(Winona Ryder), but dazzled by the aureate ringlets and wide-lipped Cheshire
Cat allure of Ellen Olenska, the Countess with a Past (Michelle Pfeiffer).
This woman has come over from Europe, vaguely bent on divorcing the Polish
husband we never see, and spins an amorous web all around our hero. Will his
family stand for it? Will society impose pariahdom? Or will decency and
dynastic imperative turn Day-Lewis back to dull virtue?
Edith Wharton's world was one where snobbery and puritanism dined at the
same table. While the writer's gelidly ironic prose is served to us by
Joanne Woodward's novel-quoting voice-over (each cadence shaped to
perfection), her equally icy supporting characters, played by a rich cast of
Brits including Alec McCowen, Richard E. Grant and Michael Gough, are seated
round the meal-board or hearth, recounting scandal and tittle-tattle.
Scorsese collaborates with co-scenarist Jay Cocks in bleeding the dialogue
of spontaneous drama; then he injects that drama straight back  - but subtly
 -into the images. No savagery in people's words or gestures. But look at
the painted screen just behind Pfeiffer depicting a pelican biting her own
breast, or the picture at the top of a staircase of an Indian scalping. No
incendiary bursts of feeling in the scenes of revelation or confrontation.
But look at the firebomb impact Scorsese builds into close-ups of cigars
being lit] This is emotional 'displacement' transmuted into cinematic
symbolism.
And transposed feeling is apt. For the romance at the story's heart is one
that never happens. Newland's trysts with Ellen stumble on through the weeks
and months, the screen alternately cracking with the slow-thawing emotion of
their encounters and then re-freezing under the influence of social protocol
or prohibition.
It is in the 'love' scenes, though, such as they are, that the film goes
askew. Day-Lewis's wry, delicately suffocated hauteur is perfect for Newland
 -this man raises repression to an art form - but Pfeiffer's Ellen is a
disappointment. She comes across as a rent-a-minx who has been to elocution
lessons. The breathy precision of her consonants reminds us of Monroe in
pretentious mode; the actressy coquetry of her fan play and head-turns is
too studied. The artifice numbs the movie's heart. There is no chemistry -
let alone any credible urge to biology - in this ill-mated pair.
So the story about a love that dares not speak its name comes most alive
when the lovers are off the screen: when Scorsese's camera roams or soars
across banquet-tables or opera houses, seeking the poignancy of personal
intimacy in the majestic ceremonies of its absence; or when Day-Lewis's
haunted, handsomely hollow-cheeked face, alone on screen, re-lives over and
over the dream that he never had.
If Scorsese's film is a tragedy of what-you-never-had-you-always-miss, Mrs
Doubtfire is a comedy of once-you've-had-it-you'd-better-hold-on-to-it. At
last, in this film, the solution to the much-discussed single mothers
problem. Dress estranged Father (Robin Williams) in female garb; pad out his
chest so that it resembles two footballs trapped under a duvet; give him a
high-pitched Scottish burr - somewhere between Jean Brodie and Lord Reith -
and then smuggle him into his (ex)wife's house to nanny the children.
There he will pass undiscovered until the fateful day when Sonny wanders
into the bathroom and - but enough] Surprises are not so plentiful in this
comedy, at least until it reaches its magnificent restaurant climax
(quick-changing compounding cross-dressing), that we should squander them
here. Much of the early stuff consists of Robin Williams doing his
super-schmaltz act: stumbling wet-eyed in the wake of Sally Field (departing
wife) and looking like Mr Pagliaccio without his script or make-up.
But once we are into vesti la giubba - on with the nanny drag - the magic
and merriment steal in. Christopher (Home Alone) Columbus directed; Randi
Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon co-screenwrote, from a novel by Anne Fine. But
when funny Williams takes over from fey Williams he needs neither director
nor writer(s). He is Hurricane Shtick: omnipotent whether turning his
employer's cooking quarters into a literal Hell's kitchen, or fending off a
lascivious bus driver, or improvising polite insults to Miss Field's new
boyfriend (Pierce Brosnan). 'Your accent's a little muddled' ventures the
bronzed smoothie with the decollete shirt. 'Really?' replies Miss Doubtfire,
'so's your tan.'
Hurricane Shtick has another great asset. Once he starts blowing, even the
threat of renewed sentimentality is turned to matchwood. In one scene our
hero, reduced between nanny hours to a fetch-and-carry job in a TV studio,
wanders onto an empty soundstage and starts to improvise with a pair of
dinosaur puppets. At this point I screamed inwardly. I thought the ghost of
Jerry Lewis had arrived. But whimsy turns to wit, and then becomes for the
cue for the film's cracking comic climax in the eatery.
This sequence will make you laugh till you cry. Either that or you have seen
too many tired pantomimic drag acts - Hinges and Brackets and Danny La Rues
 -and had your taste corrupted. For the wonderful thing about Williams's
Doubtfire is that he (she? it?) could be real. Even when the stockings are
inadvertently slipping to the ankles, or the false teeth are falling into
the aperitif, or the wig is turning round to face Mecca, the lady's sweet,
purring, buxom feminity continues. In a bad comedy Mrs Doubtfire would be
the nanny of our nightmares. Here she is the nanny of our dreams.
Mrs Doubtfire would have her work cut out cleaning up after Steven Berkoff's
Decadence. In one scene the actor-director throws up all over the camera
lens: that is, over us the audience. We/the camera are situated inside a
lavatory bowl (sic), though for the few seconds before Mr Berkoff lets fly
this seems the nicest, safest, comfiest place in the whole film.
For the rest of the excruciating 108 minutes we are stuck in no-man's-land.
God save us from filmed plays in which the writer-star-director has no idea
how to come at his material in a new medium. Plonked down like disregarded
tots in a series of crowded or uncrowded rooms - luxury apartment, dingy
pad, swank restaurant - we watch Berkoff and Joan Collins spout the blank
verse as they quick-change between their two equally resistible pairs of
characters.
Now they are the high-rolling toffs who play kinky sex games and gorge on
champagne and caviare. Now they are the low-lifers who vary gormless
leg-over sessions (message: the lower classes do not know how to enjoy sex)
with chat about murder and petty crime. It may all have been a hoot on stage
but here on screen it plays like a Ben Jonson comedy modernised by a madman
with logorrhea.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Arts: Old attitudes challenged by young playwrights -
Malcolm Rutherford is impressed with 'The Body Politic' at the Cockpit
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A little-noticed change has come over the British theatre: new plays are no
longer noticeably left-wing. While one hesitates to say that there has been
a shift to the right, young playwrights are becoming much more detached.
They are also looking for new subjects.
Mike Cullen's The Cut, a play about British miners which was reviewed in
Monday's FT, is a case in point. The author did not take sides: he simply
wrote a very good piece about how the coal industry looks from the inside
and underground.
There are half a dozen examples at the Cockpit where the Soho Theatre
Company is presenting 15-20 minute extracts from potential full-length plays
by young writers under the umbrella title The Body Politic.
The body is more relevant than the politics. Medical science, and the
ethical questions raised by its advances, are one of the big subjects of the
future. Why not explore some of the implications on stage? This is exactly
what the Soho Company attempts. Some of The Body Politic is funny; some of
it is sad.
Quite the most brilliant piece in the compendium is about DNA and cloning.
Indeed, On the Strand by Paul Goetzee is one of the wittiest revue sketches
I have seen in a London theatre since the young Dr Jonathan Miller was
performing in Beyond the Fringe. Here is a genetic engineer so in need of a
friend like himself that he places an ad. in the lonely hearts column of
Scientific American. He finds a clone: they have their magic moments in song
and dance, squash, scrabble and chess, but look-alikes and are-alikes do not
always get on for ever.
It would take a genius to extend On the Strand into a viable full-length
play; as a sketch it is the tops. Darren Tunstall as the premier genetic
engineer has a marvellous way of communicating directly with the audience.
The saddest, though no less estimable, exhibit is Grin and Bear It by Sara
Clifford. The national health service has plainly done its best in adverse
economic circumstances. An old couple have one pair of spectacles and one
set of dentures between them. They swap every hour so that one of them can
read the Daily Express while the other eats.
'Which do you prefer, the teeth or the glasses?' Neither is quite sure, but
it is not a bitter dispute. They even dance together quite happily. Still,
there is menace outside: a knocking on the door - the gasman perhaps? The
knocking subsides. The triumph of the piece, performed by Hilary Sesta and
John Crocker, is that it is played absolutely straight without overt
political or social harassment.
The other outstanding contribution is Skin by Neil Biswas, who left
university only a year or so ago and must be a writer to watch. Skin is
about a Bengali family in the English Midlands considering a return to
Calcutta on retirement: the daughter (Nina Wadia) has become Europeanised.
It is both moving and comic and the only part part of the programme that can
be easily envisaged as a full-length play. I look forward to seeing it.
Meanwhile, the formula of a collection of short pieces is very effective.
Most of them stand in their own right at their present length. The influence
of television is strong: they would go down equally well on the small
screen. The advantage of the theatre is that they can be done together. The
Body Politic should be seen as a new kind of stage review, and copied. Alex
Perrin directs in a place that has become one of the liveliest theatres in
London.

Starting at 9.00 the BBC offers an hour and a half of modern (some would say
'alternative') comedy. The All New Alexei Sayle Show proves that, although
following in a recognisable tradition, Sayle is still his own man and may
one day be recognised as one of the most important talents of his generation
(BBC2). At 9.30 we finally see the opening episode of the second series of
Jennifer Saunders' Absolutely Fabulous with Saunders herself as the
impossible PR woman and Joanna Lumley as the gorgeous boozy Patsy. That is
followed at 10.00 by Ben Elton's comedy series The Man From Auntie.
Earlier, in First Sight, BBC2 considers white collar crime in Britain which,
we are told, 'is estimated' to cost Pounds 9bn a year (7.30). This week's
passenger in Great Railway Journeys is Natalia Makarova who travels from St
Petersburg to Tashkent (9.30 BBC2).
Channel 4 shows its second Peter Greenaway film of the week: Prospero's
Books, a modified version of The Tempest, starring John Gielgud as Prospero
(10.00).

FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Supremo becomes executive director at British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeff Edington, whose appointment in 1992 as British Steel's technology
supremo was welcomed by industry observers, has been appointed an executive
director at the UK steelmaker.
Edington joined British Steel as managing director, technology, after 10
years at Alcan Aluminium in Montreal, and has a mission to redress the
balance between use of steel and that of faster-growing aluminium.
David Grieves, an executive director and vice-chairman at British Steel,
will retire from the board in July after 37 years in the UK steel industry.
Grieves is chairman of Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel
producer formed in 1992.

FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Inchcape to gain as much as it will lose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the international marketing and services group, is losing one
well-connected non-executive director and picking up another. Jurgen Hintz,
51, chief executive of CarnaudMetalbox, the Anglo-French packaging group, is
replacing Jean-Paul Parayre, 56, a supervisory board member of Peugeot, who
is retiring from the Inchcape board in May in order to devote more time to
his increasing business commitments in France.
Inchcape has always prided itself on its international connections; Hintz
seems to fit the bill nicely. A US citizen born in Germany, he has worked
and lived in the UK, Germany, and France as well as the US where he was an
executive vice president of Procter &amp; Gamble.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although a book is a manufactured item with many sub-components, not one of
them is re-usable. Most manufacturing control software is written for more
traditional operations and a major consideration for HarperCollins was to
select a package that fitted its needs. Even having selected the package
with the most flexibility, David Thomson, HarperCollins' systems manager,
says it has pushed Mac-Pac to its limits.
The most interesting aspect of the new system has been the attention given
to people. Owen
Mitchell, business development director, spent considerable effort in
getting his staff to see the computer system as a means to more efficient
operation rather than as an end in itself.
Classical change- management theory talks of a three stage process:
'unfreezing' attitudes; the change itself; and 're-freezing' new behaviour
patterns. Mitchell ensured that the unfreezing period minimised the feelings
of unease that precede change. The change itself was carefully managed
and quickly carried out. The re-freezing has been so complete that Agnes
O'Brien, inventory planner, claimed that most people now could not even
remember how to key in to the old system.
One cost is the use of internal resources. Mitchell estimates that the
Pounds 2m spent on the system has been matched by Pounds 1m of staff time.
The returns seem to imply that it has been worthwhile. Inventory has dropped
from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 3.4m and lead times have halved. On-time delivery
for paperbacks has increased
from 50 per cent to 97 per cent. A quotation now takes about two days when
it used to take two weeks.
Andersen Consulting seems to have been a helpful partner in the process. It
has insisted that HarperCollins write its own procedures. This has a twofold
effect: first, it makes HarperCollins 'own' the result; and second, it
reduces dependency on external consultancy.
The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton
Keynes

FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Storehouse selects Steele and Sorrell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After getting through three finance directors since 1990, Storehouse will be
hoping that its latest recruit to the position, Dick Steele, 38, right,
currently FD of Lloyds Chemists, may stay the course.
In addition to filling the FD's position which has been vacant since the
unexpected departure of Graham Rider last October, Steele's appointment from
April will give Storehouse a full board of four executives and four
non-executives for the first time for more than a year.
Bringing the management back to full strength has been one of the priorities
of chief executive Keith Edelman since he was appointed to the group last
summer.
Steele was appointed after an executive search and had no previous links
with Storehouse, but the group says it is sure that it now has the right
man.
'Clearly he has the qualities we are looking for,' says Storehouse. 'He has
first-class accounting skills and very strong retailing experience.'
Steele has a degree in economics and accountancy from Liverpool University
and qualified as an accountant with KPMG Peat Marwick. He joined fashion
retailer Next in 1984 and held a number of senior financial positions before
moving to Midsummer Leisure as group finance director in 1987. He became FD
of Lloyds Chemists in 1990.
Martin Sorrell, 48, chief executive of the marketing services group WPP, is
also joining the company, as a non-executive director, the first such post
he has notched up. Yesterday he said he did not wish to comment on his
reasons for making the move into previously uncharted waters.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Technology: Biography of a book - The printing industry
presents unusual challenges to computerised manufacturing systems. Claire
Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software / Software at
Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pick up a copy of Jung Chang's bestselling novel Wild Swans and the last
thing you are likely to consider is the effort that went into printing it.
But books, like motor accessories and widgets, have to be manufactured, and
they present unusual challenges to computerised manufacturing systems.
Left-over pages from one book cannot be used elsewhere: each book comprises
components that are useless in any other product. Prints are likely to be
repeated, possibly in short runs, for which machines must be geared up.
HarperCollins Manufacturing produces books from raw material to finished
product, using various grades of paper. Owen Mitchell, HarperCollins's
business development director, considers book-printing a manufacturing
process much like any other, equally subject to current thinking on
just-in-time methods and low inventories.
On the shelf in Mitchell's office stand fat, glossy-covered hardbacks
including Wild Swans and the memoirs of Lady Thatcher and Sir David Frost,
reminders of the end-product of his 400,000 sq ft factory. 'Our customers
are the publishers, not the public. We make reprints or new titles to order
for HarperCollins, our main customer, but also for Headline and Simon &amp;
Schuster (outside the US market), among others,' Mitchell says.
A full remainder basket is bad news for author and publisher alike, and
producing to demand ('make to order') introduces a delicate balancing act
between resources. Getting it wrong means keeping the customer waiting,
perhaps losing sales as interest in a book fades, while machines and staff
work overtime, only to lie idle the next day.
To avoid this, HarperCollins now runs a computer integrated manufacturing
(Cim) system called Mac-Pac, which includes a complex 'expert system' that
helps make decisions about scheduling.
'This division operates as a high-volume, make-to-order environment. One of
the business reasons for moving in the Cim direction was the pressure for
just-in-time manufacturing, small batches, and short lead times,' says
Mitchell.
In the early 1980s, most packaged software solutions were for make-to-stock
and assemble-to-order processes - which are inappropriate for books. Other
solutions came from low-volume 'make-to-order' suppliers. 'Getting behind
this distinction was important, because every book is make-to-order, but we
deal with more than 100 different titles every week.'
On average, the factory copes with 1,250 component orders a week (about 10
per book). Components in a book include the bundles of printed pages
(signatures - see Buzzwords), illustrations, covers, dustjacket, and perhaps
also a ribbon-marker for diaries and bibles.
The paper for the paperbacks is stored four hours away. 'We work as a
manufacturing business, so in manufacturing terms, a routine diary is just
as important as Sir David Frost's autobiography,' comments Mitchell.
'Our experience in the past has been with batch computer systems, updated
overnight and accessed for inquiries. What we have now is a system in which
participants dictate the programme. Their actions make a difference. There
are very few people who don't have a terminal - 450 users out of 480
employees,' he adds.
The new system has developed gradually. Outside consultants have
contributed, but it largely evolved from a painful process of
self-examination that started in 1989.
'We challenged and changed the way we do business as part of the preparation
for automation. The first question was whether we were ready for change, and
the answer was no. We faced the fact that customers were not well served by
the buffer times which were exposed. Inventories were no longer assets, but
earned a black mark,' recalls Mitchell.
'One of the first things to go was the shop-floor bonus which encouraged
over-production of components unique to one order.
'We used Computer Integrated Business - our version of Cim - as a catalyst
for change. From day one, I was concerned to get the message across that
there would be more people problems than technology constraints,' Mitchell
says.
'IBM's industrial design team gave us a vision and experience beyond our
own, and helped us develop a strategy that has held good to this day -
develop people, simplify processes, then automate.'
Initial inquiries involved 25 vendors, and a 70-page proposal synopsis was
sent out to a shortlist of eight.
Andersen Consulting's Mac-Pac software was fully integrated in its design,
and came closest to fitting the HarperCollins 'no modifications' policy.
Another attraction was the Expert Configurator, an 'intelligent' module that
works like many expert systems, to define the rules which govern a process.
A trip to the US to see Expert Configurator in action (there were no UK
users at the time) confirmed the choice.
Mac-Pac follows the business flow from start to finish. It can treat every
order and every title as an individual product. Each book is planned and
tracked through every process. Every component - printing plate, signature,
cover - is tied to its book and traceable through Mac-Pac.
'Setting the rules is an interactive 'conversational' process to create the
code. The two years it took to evolve was a combination of analysis,
simplification, and representation of what we do. No one individual has the
command of detail of the entire process. We did not pick the brains of the
existing mainframe system, we did it from scratch,' adds David Thomson,
manufacturing systems manager.
The process of preparation and training was also an eye-opener. 'We had
shop-floor personnel training the managing director - people found talents
they never knew they had,' says Mitchell.
In November 1992, HarperCollins announced 211 redundancies in manufacturing
which took effect just six weeks before implementation. The first Mac-Pac
product off the presses was a high-profile title, Jeffrey Archer's Honour
Among Thieves in May 1993. 'All this put a strain on the organisation. We
found that even 1,000 days of training was not nearly enough,' says
Mitchell.
The Andersen consultants insisted that HarperCollins should develop its own
rules and procedures, which was time consuming but worthwhile.
Users are enthusiastic. One claims to have learned as much in training as he
had in 20 years in the business. According to Irene Thomson, customer
services manager for paperbacks, previous manual systems were difficult to
control. 'Now we are more reactive, and customer satisfaction has improved.'
Fred Buchanan, the paperback planner, had previously worked with a small PC.
'We did not know if we could fulfil to order or not, now we can say yes and
mean it.'
Steve Melvin is a lead operator on one of the print machines, which has
produced 25,000 copies of Wild Swans every week for the last three months.
'The lead time for a paperback used to be four or five weeks. Now it is 10
days or less,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kent Training and Enterprise Council has appointed a new chief executive,
Malcolm Allan, who will spearhead the Tec's enlarging role in the economic
development of Kent.
Allan, aged 44, has been chief executive of Sussex Tec for the past three
years. He succeeds John Forsdyke, who relinquishes his post at Easter.
More than 160 applications were made for the post. The job is an expanded
one, as it is planned that the new chief executive will be at the helm of a
new organisation made up of the Tec and Kent County Council's economic
development unit.
Agreement in principle has been reached on the merger of the county's unit
with the Tec, although detailed negotiations are still proceeding.
The intention is to rationalise and develop services to business in Kent,
Britain's front door into the Economic Union, under the Tec's leadership.
The merger could provide a model for other Tecs, all of which are seeking to
bring greater coherence to the delivery of economic development within their
localities.

<TEXT>
Bruce Bantz has been appointed head of global asset securitisation at
NatWest Capital Markets, a new post set up to reflect a stronger focus on
its securitisation business.
Bantz, previously vice president, treasury funding, at Citibank's credit
card securitisation arm, will be based in London and will report to Garry
Southern, managing director of NatWest Capital Markets.
Europe's nascent market in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities is
dwarfed by the US market, and has so far failed to take off.
Southern says he expects no explosive growth but predicts the market will
move up a gear or so over the next few years.
NatWest has been involved in several sterling mortgage-backed deals, and has
set up a vehicle called Thames Funding, which acts as a conduit for
corporate asset-backed commercial paper.
While sterling will remain a priority, NatWest plans to expand into other
European markets.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: Pitfalls in the way of a better
understanding - Andrew Jack considers a book that questions whether
financial reports can ever tell the whole story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On September 14 1990, Carr, Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the City investment analysts,
circulated a report recommending that clients buy shares in Polly Peck
International at the current price of 260p. The author predicted a
substantial improvement in pre-tax profits for 1990 and 1991.
Just six days later, Polly Peck, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Asil
Nadir, saw its shares plummet to 108p before they were suspended on the
Stock Exchange. The rest is turbulent history: raids by the Serious Fraud
Office, the appointment of administrators to the company under UK insolvency
law, evidence of enormous misappropriations of funds, and Mr Nadir illegally
jumping bail to flee to northern Cyprus.
Yet while much attention has been given to the machinations of the company,
its executives and investigators since that date, rather less has been paid
to the question of the financial information present in the company's
accounts and whether the warning signs were clear well in advance.
Trevor Pijper, an accountant in the technical department of Ernst &amp; Young in
London, attempts to set that right as part of his book on creative
accounting*. At its core is the question of whether readers of financial
reports will ever be satisfied by the information they could possibly
contain.
In the preface, Pijper says he wrote the book in part as a critical response
to another on creative accounting which was published in 1992: Accounting
for Growth, by Terry Smith, the City analyst. He believes Smith's approach
of grading companies by allocating them 'blobs' for each accounting 'trick'
they used was too simplistic.
He takes readers through the elements of company accounts, suggesting that
there is no single correct way to present information in all circumstances:
how to allocate credits or goodwill, at what point there is dominant
influence or control, the limitations of the components of both the
numerator and the denominator in any gearing calculation. Accounts are crude
attempts to deal with complex problems, he argues.
Pijper cites approvingly an article in 1991 by David Gwilliam and Tim
Russell of Cambridge University. They examined the role of Polly Peck's
analysts, and concluded that they seemed more willing to pay attention to
information provided by the company than the 'danger signs' shown in the
accounts.
He calculates a series of five-year trend ratios on the company which he
says auditors sometimes use to highlight points for discussion with
management. In Polly Peck's case, it suggests concerns such as possible
future financing strains and declining profit margins.
He also recasts the source and application of funds statement into the newer
cash flow format with the aid of footnotes in the 1989 accounts, to show how
far Polly Peck was dependent on new finance from its bankers and
shareholders to run its existing operations. The message is clear. A skilled
reader of accounts could have seen the troubles afoot.
The danger of this approach, of course, is the benefit of hindsight. Many
similar warning signs could be drawn from other companies that have not
collapsed and may not do so. It also neglects the considerable question
marks over the reliability of the figures published, making their
examination far less relevant.
It is nevertheless an important theme to which Pijper returns often in his
book. He cites the case of Trafalgar House, the construction, property,
shipping and hotels group, which triggered the first real confrontation for
the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the enforcement arm of the new
machinery established alongside the Accounting Standards Board as result of
the 1989 Companies Act.
After some initial brinkmanship, the company amended its 1991 treatment of a
revaluation and reclassification of properties between current and fixed
assets under pressure from the Review Panel.
Yet Pijper highlights the fact that all the necessary information was
disclosed in the accounts, though analysts apparently ignored it. He
interprets the episode as a demonstration of the power of the panel, but
more importantly as a reminder of its limitations. All it did was to clarify
presentation, and not, for example, to comment on the appropriateness of the
valuations adopted.
A welcome aspect of the book is that it attempts to consider the new
financial reporting machinery, although this presents a moving target given
the current pace of change. In the case of the review panel, he argues that
it can only deal with external, disclosed factors and not confirm the
correct use of accounting policies.
More generally, he sees the development of new accounting standards as part
of an increasingly regulatory response to concerns over the quality of
financial information in the last 20 years. But - citing the activities of
the urgent issues task force and the intention of standards-setters to
revise even their new regulations every two years - he suggests that there
will always be loopholes and never a watertight rulebook.
While he says there can be no doubt about the enthusiasm of the Accounting
Standards Board, he questions how far its activities are meeting its
objective to 'provide shareholders and creditors with an adequate basis for
understanding a company's accounts and its financial position'.
Pijper is not always able to follow through and connect the different
threads of his arguments. For example, he builds up a good explanation of
the motivations for creative accounting. Manipulating profits can help
companies make acquisitions, gain access to finance and swell directors'
remuneration, he says. He is less able to say whether manipulation takes
place as a result, or how widespread it might be.
After raising a number of important questions, he sometimes lapses into
detailed recitations of new standards and regulations and vague
speculations, rather than providing answers.
Without much exploration, he makes one of his most original and radical
points in a single sentence at the end: that there should be economic
penalties for preparers who fail to provide to informed users the
information needed for sensible decisions.
The most depressing aspect of the text is that it essentially ends up as a
defence of the accountancy profession. The conclusion seems to be that
trained accountants are the best and perhaps the only people equipped to
prepare and interpret financial statements.
As a result, he takes the establishment line in suggesting that education to
combat ignorance of the limitations of accounts needs most emphasis. In a
spirit of defeatism, he also argues that users of accounts other than
controlling shareholders have little choice but to place their faith in the
stewards chosen to manage the finances of the companies in which they have
invested. In that vein, he fails to address the extent to which some greater
standardisation or modification in disclosure requirements might help
improve accounts for a range of different user groups.
Nor does he touch on the potential vulnerability as a result of commercial
pressures on auditors in approving accounts of which they disapprove, let
alone of their potential active complicity in devising treatments which may
not be designed with transparency and disclosure most in mind. Those who
most escape his criticism are the accountants themselves.
But the book is a welcome contribution in the debate on the changing face of
accounting in Britain.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A flight path to
good pricing - How Airtours uses data on its competitors to maximise
profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The staff of the late bookings section of Airtours, the UK's second biggest
holiday company, are looking pleased. They have just managed to raise the
price of Caribbean holidays by Pounds 50.
Poring over banks of screens at Airtours' headquarters in rural Helmshore,
Lancashire, the 10-strong Airtours team bears more than a passing
resemblance to a group of City of London dealers. Their average age is 22
and they arrive at work at 7am.
What they are doing, however, is not trading currencies or selling bonds. On
the basis of up-to-the-minute information about their competitors in the
UK's Pounds 4.9bn air holiday market, they are seeking to adjust their own
prices to maximise profitability.
Travel agents, whether multiple chains or independent shops, look up
destinations on screen. The prices they see are set and communicated to them
by the tour operators, which arrange flights and accommodation. Thomson, the
biggest travel group, and Owners Abroad, the number three, change their
holiday prices every night. Airtours changes its prices several times a day.
Along with the rest of the holiday industry, Airtours makes much of its
cost-cutting campaigns. But like all companies, it strives to charge
whatever the market can bear, pushing prices up when demand is strongest.
Late bookings indeed play a central role in determining a holiday company's
profitability. The companies begin selling summer holidays in the August of
the summer before, when they publish the first edition of their brochures.
In January, they publish a second edition, with either higher or lower
prices, depending on how sales are going and what competing companies are
doing.
It is in the last eight weeks before departure that price competition
becomes most intense. David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, says a third of
holidays are sold during this period. There is also a winter late-booking
period, when holidaymakers make last-minute purchases of skiing holidays and
trips to the Caribbean.
Apart from trying to get the highest price possible, the late booking team
tries to ensure that all the company's airline seats are filled.
Tour operators pay for most of their accommodation in holiday resorts only
if they use it, although they do guarantee to fill a certain proportion of
beds. If bookings are disappointing, they do not end up owing hoteliers
large sums of money.
Airline seats are another matter. Airtours flies some of its customers on
its own aircraft. The rest go in seats chartered from other companies. The
seats have to be paid for whether they are filled or not. Flights that
depart with empty seats represent a loss to the tour operator.
The Airtours late bookings team's first task of the morning is to look at
the prices competitors have set overnight. They do this by using the
computer information available to travel agents. Airtours owns the Going
Places travel agents' chain which sells holidays organised by other
operators as well. This gives Airtours access to other operators' prices.
Crossland says Airtours is working on a system which will enable it to use
Going Places' sales to assess how well competing operators' holidays are
selling, as well as the prices being achieved.
Andrew Crossland, the 27-year-old head of the late bookings team and the
chairman's son, says Airtours will not necessarily do the same if a
competitor drops prices on holidays to a particular destination.
The competitor's price reduction could be temporary: the company might be
attempting to fill a particular aircraft or ensure it can sell its
guaranteed beds. On other occasions, the price drop might signal an attempt
to take market share from rivals like Airtours. 'The trick is to know when
to follow the market,' Andrew Crossland says.
The team says it gets to know the psychology of rival price setters, as well
as of customers. When the British weather is miserable, for example, prices
of sunshine resort holidays tend to be firmer.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan strikes a
chord with Asian teenagers - South-east Asia is lacking homegrown talent,
but Japan is ready to entertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years Japan's entertainment industry has been trying to reach out to a
western audience, sending its starlets on a mission to perform in Las Vegas
and Hollywood. But such efforts have been big flops.
Now, however, the industry has discovered Asia. Along with the country's
manufacturers, Japanese record companies, television networks and artist
management groups are turning to the rapidly growing Asian market.
Masahisa Aizawa, vice-president of Sun Music, a Japanese production agency,
says the entertainment industry in Asia has not caught up with the rapid
economic growth and the deluge of electronic hardware. 'Asia's entertainment
industry is behind Japan by about 15 years,' he says.
Sun Music was surprised at the popularity of Noriko Sakai, one of its
Japanese pop idols, among Taiwanese teenagers. Sakai recently became top
pin-up star in Taiwan, prompting the agency to work with a Taiwanese
television network to produce a drama starring the idol.
Until recently, Japan has been excessively cautious about exporting
entertainment software to Asia. Many of the older people in south-east Asian
countries still remember being forced to learn Japanese by the Japanese army
in the second world war, and South Korea still bans Japanese songs and
literature from its stores.
Younger Asians, however, crave news out of Tokyo. 'Tokyo is for Asia what
New York was for Japan 20 years ago,' says Eisuke Saito, managing director
of Amuse, another production agency, which organised concerts by Japanese
artists in Beijing last year.
Such is the demand that video tapes of Japanese television programmes are
sold in Taiwan video shops, Japanese soap operas are aired in Singapore and
Japanese songs sung on karaoke machines.
Harry Kaneko of Pony Canyon, a Japanese record company, believes that the
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) record market in Asia will grow threefold in the
next seven years. In contrast, marked growth in Japan's Dollars 4bn record
market is unlikely.
Japanese entertainment-related companies are keen to cash in on such demand,
and stress that there is little room for western corporations. 'Japan is
closer than the US or Europe, and besides, similar physique of the Japanese
people brings us closer to Asia than Caucasians,' says Aizawa. He also
claims the rhythm and melody lines of songs in south-east Asia are basically
the same.
Aside from bringing Japanese talent to Asia, the Japanese are eager to
capture the Chinese-speaking market including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia and Thailand, by offering Chinese artists. Saito reckons the global
Chinese-speaking population totals some 1.6bn.
Many in the industry point out that Hong Kong and Taiwan are important
strategic areas for subsidiaries to distribute software throughout
south-east Asia. Pony Canyon is building a network in Asia to search for
potential Asian pop and rock stars.
Japanese production agencies are searching for talent in China to sell to
the Chinese communities. Production agency HoriPro, teamed with a Hong Kong
agency, recently organised a nationwide amateur talent search contest in
China. Events organised by local television stations were held in 19
regional cities. The semifinals and finals were held in Beijing, and
broadcast live to other parts of Asia through Hong Kong's satellite Star TV.
Kazutaka Hori, vice-president of HoriPro, explains that the project was also
backed by the Chinese authorities, since 'China never really had its own
stars and artists. They all came from Hong Kong and Taiwan'.
Amuse has also arranged a contest, with the finals to be held this month.
'We want to train and bring up people with talent for the Asian market,'
says Saito.
Exporting Japanese software and know-how in the entertainment business has
struck a chord with the Japanese hardware makers. Matsushita Electric
Industrial is using Sakai of Sun Music to sell its electronic products in
China and south-east Asia, while other consumer electronics companies are
lining up to become sponsors of the China talent search contests.
A concern in the Japanese entertainment market is the absence of copyright
protection in the region. Although China is trying to improve its
enforcement of copyright law, more than 800 companies produce pirate
cassette tapes. Others, such as some Taiwanese companies, have been blamed
for distorting the legitimate market.
Japanese companies, however, see the advantage of establishing themselves in
the region before this problem is solved. 'Once proper laws on copyright are
laid out, there will be profits that did not exist before,' says Hori.

There was a time when Charles Forsyth King ruled Wall Street. Or, as he once
put it: 'Ruled Wall Street? I am Wall Street.' He built his financial empire
from nothing, only to see it crumble with the collapse of the market.
After his death, friends and associates attempted in interviews to explain
where he had gone wrong. Said one: 'King's mistake was in preferring paper
money to paper itself - he should have invested in timber.' There were those
who considered he should have gone for other basics such as bricks or coal.
Some thought the clue that explained King's failure lay in his single dying
word . . . Hanson. It was the one thing he wished he had had.
This fictitious drama, clearly inspired by the 1941 Orson Welles movie
Citizen Kane, unfolds at break-neck speed in an 80-second commercial - the
first corporate television advertising from the Hanson conglomerate since
1988. The ad, supported by press advertising, has already run in the US and
is now being shown in the UK.
For those who may be confused about what Hanson is trying to achieve with
the ad, Steve Cooper, account director in London with Hanson's agency Lowe
Group, explains: 'We were looking for stature and impact. The use of any
outside cultural reference tends to raise the stature and impact of a film.
There's already a frame of reference people have which establishes a
rapport.'
The contrast between the financial speculator - King in the advertisement -
and Hanson's interests in bricks, coal and timber, is intended to underline
the conglomerate's solidity and its enduring interest in the companies it
acquires, says Cooper.
Hanson's corporate spokesman puts it more succinctly: 'This is an
advertisement that is likely to attract attention, rather than be passed
over by people who see an awful lot of advertising. And it's entertaining,
too.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / Electricity consumers to call for price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity consumer representatives are to ask regional electricity
companies to cut their prices to coincide with the introduction of value
added tax on domestic fuel in April.
The chairmen of the 12 regional consumers' committees have decided to press
distribution companies to share more of their rising profits with consumers.
'With lower coal prices, lower interest rates and boasts of large reductions
in employee numbers and operating costs, the benefits of privatisation for
the ordinary, non-investing customers have been totally inadequate,' they
said.
Although many electricity companies have given rebates to their customers,
these have not matched the growth in profits.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, yesterday called for an
immediate cut in electricity prices, claiming that they had risen well ahead
of inflation since privatisation of the industry in 1989.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Brick production down in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brick production last year was 12 per cent below its level in 1992, but
actual deliveries were 8 per cent higher.
During the fourth quarter of last year, brick production and deliveries in
Great Britain totalled 680m and 666m respectively. At the end of December
stocks were 1.03bn, about 17 weeks' deliveries at current levels.
Seasonally adjusted and after allowing for working day variations, output in
the fourth quarter of last year was approximately the same as in the third
quarter, but 1 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year
earlier. Deliveries were 4 per cent lower than in the third quarter but 13
per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1992.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Home repossessions fall 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders last year fell 10,000 to
58,540 - a fall of 14.6 per cent - the Council of Mortgage Lenders said
yesterday.
This represents the second year that the annual total of repossessions has
dropped from its height of 75,540 in 1991, but is still a stark contrast
with the position 10 years ago when fewer than 9,000 homes were repossessed.
The number of repossessions in the second half of last year totalled 26,760.
The statistics released yesterday showed that the number of mortgages in
arrears has also started to decline. There were 164,620 mortgages in arrears
of six to 12 months in the second half of last year - a fall from 191,560 in
the first half of the year and from more than 200,000 in the last six months
of 1992.
The number of mortgages in longer-term arrears also fell, although not so
sharply, to 151,810 in the second half from 158,000 in the preceding six
months. Even so, that total is a record for a year-end.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the council, attributed the improvement
in the figures to lower interest rates, direct payment of income support for
mortgage interest, and more effective arrears management. He said lower
levels of unemployment and the economic recovery were also beginning to make
an impact.
Compared with the early 1980s, the numbers for mortgage arrears and
repossessions are strikingly high, even though they have begun to fall. In
1983, for example, fewer than 30,000 mortgages were in arrears of six to 12
months and only about 7,500 were in arrears for longer.
Mr Frank Bartlett, head of lending at Woolwich building society,
acknowledged that there was still a significant problem to solve.
Mr Peter Williams, the council's head of research and external affairs, said
home ownership had changed so much during the 1980s that the market was
unlikely to return to its former state.
The council has recently revised its statement of practice on the way in
which its members handle arrears and repossessions. The organisation
represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, and now
covers about 98 per cent of the UK mortgage market.
Last year 105,283 mortgage possession orders were made by the courts, the
Lord Chancellor's Department said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Coal sector faces 'weak' bargaining power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal's chairman warned yesterday that some of its private-sector
successors would have 'weak, possibly very weak' negotiating power with the
electricity generators who will be their main customers.
Mr Neil Clarke warned of fresh pit closures this year as the corporation
published figures showing that 25,500 workers have taken redundancy in the
past 15 months. There are 14,800 employed in the collieries.
He told the Commons trade and industry committee that British Coal had
exceeded its forecasts of a year ago on improved efficiency. The cash
operating cost per gigajoule of coal was expected to be Pounds 1.40 in
1993-94 and 11 collieries were operating at Pounds 1.30 or less.
It emerged that none of the additional 700,000 tonnes of sales to generators
in recent months has qualified for financial aid. Mr Clarke said that
government subsidies to help British Coal win extra sales were 'quite
restrictive' and were not used in recent deals to supply more coal to
generators.
He said subsidies did not apply if additional sales were won for a colliery
in profit, for pits with stocks of coal, and for pits where costs were lower
than at opencast sites.
Additional sales would not be enough to avoid closures among the remaining
22 pits. Mr Clarke refused to be drawn on how many would close but market
analysts believe five to eight are likely to go.
Mr Clarke told the committee that the generators' financial resources, plus
the oversupply of coal and the availability of other energy resources, would
put the privatised companies at a clear disadvantage.
'I think the imbalance of power between the two big companies - and whatever
the structure of the industry - will remain.'
Mr Clarke pointed out that the big Selby coalfield in the Yorkshire region,
which will made up more than half of the northern company, depended entirely
on selling its coal to the Aire Valley power station.
'Against that imbalance of market power, I have to say, its (the company's)
negotiating position will be weak, possibly very weak. The generators will
make sure they have other sources of coal available.'
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told the committee that he did not want the
nuclear review to drag into next year, and he hoped to announce the terms of
reference as soon as possible.
Mr Eggar told the committee he had 'scratched his head' after National Power
recently revealed figures showing that power from new gas-fired generators
was 30 per cent more expensive than that from coal-fired stations they were
replacing.
National Power said it is building gas stations in part because of
environmental considerations. 'The price difference is the cost of producing
cleaner electricity to meet new environmental standards,' it said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Auditors fight BCCI decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accountancy profession plans to argue in the House of Lords that any
delay to the launch of a disciplinary inquiry into the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International could jeopardise the future of
self-regulation.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's highest such
body, is to petition against a Court of Appeal ruling last month which found
in favour of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
Price Waterhouse has been fighting attempts by the scheme to start
investigating its role as auditor to BCCI, which was closed by banking
regulators in July 1991. The firm argues that such an investigation would be
disruptive and prejudicial to civil actions pending against it.
It also says that its auditing procedures have been examined by accountancy
regulators and no problems have been identified with its ability to continue
acting as an auditor.
The scheme, which represents the chartered and certified accountancy bodies
covering England, Wales and Scotland, is awaiting a decision from the Lords
on whether it may make its appeal.
It says that to wait until the outcome of litigation against Price
Waterhouse will delay any examination to the next century, by which time it
will be rendered impossible. Witnesses will be dead, retired or relying on
their memory long after the events, it says.
Mr Brian Harris, secretary to the scheme, said yesterday: 'The court should
have balanced the private rights of PW's partners with the public interest
in examination of the audit.
'By deferring it is effectively saying there will not be an investigation
into the biggest banking scandal in history.'
Lawyers for the scheme preparing the BCCI case for the Lords say that the
Appeal Court judges were inconsistent in their reasons.
In particular, they believe the judges neglected the need for the scheme to
pursue its investigation if it is to meet its requirements as a regulator
under the 1989 Companies Act.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Poorest rely on benefit cash: Self-employed face hardship -
Disposable income rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The least well-off 20 per cent of the population in 1990-91 derived 69 per
cent of their income from benefits, with only 20 per cent coming from
employment. Earnings from employment provided 75 per cent of the income of
the remaining four-fifths of the population, with benefits providing 11 per
cent.
These are among the findings of a study of Britain's lowest-income
households, presented in a special article in Social Trends by Mr Nick
Adkin, a statistician at the Department of Social Security.
More than a quarter of the poorest group at the time of the study was
retired. When they are added to others who were not working - either because
they were unemployed, non-working single parents or people with long-term
illnesses - people without work made up almost 70 per cent of the poorest
group. Only about a quarter of the group had worked a full year, compared
with 70 per cent of the rest of the population.
After housing costs, the real income of the poorest 20 per cent fell about 3
per cent between 1979 and 1990-91. Real incomes of all other groups
increased, with the wealthiest fifth of the population achieving a 49 per
cent rise.
The largest single group in the poorest 20 per cent is couples with
children, although they are represented in broad proportion to their numbers
in the population as a whole. This is not so with single parents - they make
up 15 per cent of the poorest group, but only 4 per cent of the rest of the
population. Mr Adkin links this firmly to their economic circumstances, with
only about 4 per cent of the poorest single parents in full-time work.
Two-thirds of the 3m children in the poorest group lived in families that
did not contain a full-time worker, compared with 11 per cent of children in
the rest of the population.
One striking finding is that the full-time self-employed make up 10 per cent
of the poorest group - similar to their proportion in the rest of the
population. The problem of accurately measuring income of the self-employed,
according to Mr Adkin, has 'vexed researchers for some time', and it is
unclear to what extent this may reflect some self-employed people
under-declaring their income or other factors.
Real disposable household income per head rose between 1991 and 1992,
reversing a fall the previous year, and is now at its highest level - nearly
80 per cent above 1971, says Social Trends.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Fresh threat faces EMA merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned merger between the Engineers and Managers Association and the
British Association of Colliery Management is heading for collapse after a
High Court decision yesterday to allow a full judicial review of the case.
Leading officials in the union are trying to de-rail the merger - in spite
of an overwhelming vote in favour by its 5,000 members - arguing that the
union had not been properly informed of how far it would lose its identity.
Mr Justice Laws decided that the decision of the Trade Union Certification
Officer to go ahead with the merger, in spite of the change of heart by
Bacom activists, should be subject to judicial review. The case is likely to
be heard within the next two months. The union is also likely to hold a
fresh ballot.
In the meantime the merger remains in limbo and Mr John Meads, Bacom general
secretary, who supports the merger, remains suspended by the anti-merger
group.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Delays in new milk market to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The delay in opening up the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to
competition will be investigated next week by the Commons agriculture select
committee, Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The committee said yesterday that it would hold a special session to examine
why market liberalisation had been put back from April to November.
Government objections to the Milk Marketing Board's plans to turn itself
into a voluntary farmers' co-operative have delayed introduction of
competition.
Evidence will be taken from the milk board, agriculture ministry officials,
the Dairy Trade Federation and the National Farmers' Union.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Unions urge Clinton to intervene at Caterpillar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two British unions are to ask US President Bill Clinton to urge the
Caterpillar Corporation to restore union rights to the white-collar
workforce at its Leicester production plant.
The US multinational, the world's biggest construction equipment
manufacturer, has offered staff Pounds 500 each and improved benefits in
return for giving up collective bargaining and moving to individual
employment contracts.
Derecognition of the MSF general technical union and Apex, the white-collar
section of the GMB general union, is due to take place on April 26. Last
week the majority of the workers voted in a company-organised ballot to
accept Caterpillar's terms.
Union leaders believe the company intends to make a similar offer to its 600
manual workers, represented by the AEEU electrical and engineering union. If
they accept, all Caterpillar's UK operations will be non-union.
The unions argue that the company has breached article 42 of the
International Labour Organisation code on multinationals, which says unions
should 'enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference in their
functioning or administration'. They also accuse Caterpillar of contravening
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development code of conduct
for multinationals.
The Geneva-based International Metalworkers Federation is also calling on
the Clinton administration to put pressure on Caterpillar.
Mr Clinton joined a United Auto Workers' union picket line outside the
company's Peoria plant in Illinois in 1992.
Mr Owen Bieber, the UAW's president, wrote to Mr Donald Fites, Caterpillar
chairman, last week saying that the company's action in the UK was 'glaring
and damning proof that all over the world your real objective is to bust
unions pure and simple'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Delays in new milk market to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The delay in opening up the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to
competition will be investigated next week by the Commons agriculture select
committee, Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The committee said it would hold a special session to examine why market
liberalisation had been put back from April to November. Government
objections to the Milk Marketing Board's plans to turn itself into a
voluntary farmers' co-operative have delayed introduction of competition.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Budget measures face challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budget proposals on capital gains tax and insurance are expected to come
under fire as MPs begin to scrutinise the detail of the 244-clause finance
bill next week.
Conservative MPs are among those trying to force changes to the plans of Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to scrap the indexation of capital losses
and to impose a 3 per cent insurance premium tax from October 1995.
A move to prevent the Inland Revenue from taxing directors' and officers'
liability insurance (D&amp;O) as a benefit in kind is also expected.
MPs argue that the present position acts as a deterrent to those considering
becoming company directors since, in the case of non-executives, the premium
can sometimes exceed what they would be paid.
Following this week's second reading MPs are expected to start evaluating
the fine print of the bill on Monday. The proposed insurance premium tax is
among the subjects listed for debate.
Conservative backbench critics are unlikely to join Labour in arguing that
the new tax - forecast to raise Pounds 750m in a full year and to affect 85
per cent of households - should be abandoned altogether. But they are
expected to argue that the list of exemptions should be extended to include
Pool Re, the specialist terrorist damage reinsurer set up after commercial
insurers withdrew from the market, and others.
Under current plans long-term insurance products such as endowments would be
exempt, as would some types of commercial insurance, such as export credit
and shipping insurance.
MPs will also seek clarification on details such as whether the tax point
for the new levy would be the date when a payment notice was sent out or
when payment was received, and whether the tax would be chargeable on
commission.
Strong Tory opposition is expected to Mr Clarke's proposal to abolish the
indexation of capital losses while retaining the indexation of capital gains
 -a change forecast to raise an additional Pounds 300m by 1996-97 and
portrayed in November as a tax-avoidance measure.
MPs are expected to argue that by removing indexation for transactions on or
after Budget day Mr Clarke will in some cases impose real capital gains tax
rates of more than 40 per cent on ordinary investors.
The purchase of D&amp;O insurance has expanded greatly in recent years, in
response to the growing number of potential liabilities faced by company
directors.

People in Britain travel an average of almost 200 kilometres (125 miles) a

Rail, bus and coach fares increased by more than 130 per cent between 1981
and 1993, compared with 80 per cent for motoring costs. Road travel became
safer as well as relatively cheaper - there were just over 4,000 road deaths
in 1992, less than half the record 9,000 in 1941.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Political Notebook: Heads in the Euro sand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is reappearing on Britain's political horizon. Groans of weary
resignation are already audible in ministerial offices across Whitehall.
The proximate cause is the approach of the elections in June to the European
parliament. After all, the outcome could decide Mr John Major's future. He
can hope to ride out a bad result, but if Conservative losses are as
disastrous as some are already predicting all bets will be off.
There is a more fundamental concern among those ministers and officials who
can still find the odd moment to think about policy as well as internal Tory
party politics.
As Germany and France start to put together the pieces after last year's
turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism, the government's post-Maastricht
triumphalism is fading.
Maybe the rest of Europe has not after all abandoned its federalist
ambitions in favour of Britain's inter-governmental agenda. With the franc
now back at its former ERM rate against the D-Mark, perhaps the idea of
European monetary union is not quite so fanciful after all.
The way that the Paris government has handled the franc since the near-break
up of the ERM last summer has confounded those who argued that sterling's
earlier ejection had been a symptom of its inevitable disintegration.
France never accepted the franc's devaluation was permanent. Unlike the
Treasury it did not replenish its foreign currency reserves at the devalued
rate. Now the franc has recovered it is doing so - without the billions of
dollars in losses suffered by the UK. There is talk of the ERM returning to
its narrow bands as soon as economic recovery is entrenched.
The fear in Whitehall is that the recovery will bring with it a rekindling
of the integrationist ambitions of the European partners in the approach to
the inter-governmental conference due in 1996.
The repeated assertion of Mr Douglas Hurd that Maastricht's
inter-governmental 'pillars' for foreign, defence and home affairs policies
had set the European Union on a new course no longer carry quite the same
conviction. Nor does Mr Major's description of European Monetary Union as
having 'the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'.
None of this has yet been discussed in detail by senior ministers. The
wounds inflicted on the Tory party by Maastricht are still raw. As one
(pro-European) member of the cabinet put it: 'The hope is that if we don't
talk about it, it might just go away.'
The same nervousness envelops the preparation of the Conservative manifesto
for the European elections.
Mr Hurd is one of the cabinet's grown-ups. But in an untypical admission of
weakness he has decreed that even membership of the committee charged with
drafting the manifesto must remain secret. The Tory right might otherwise
think it was under-represented.
The only thing that ministers are prepared to say publicly about the
manifesto is that it will cast the Conservatives as alone among the three
largest parties in opposing something called a federal Europe. It hardly
adds up to the promised agenda to lead Europe into the 21st century.
It would be unfair, however, to suggest that the Tories are alone in burying
their heads in the sand. There are few signs that opposition parties have
thought through the implications of the 1996 conference.
The Liberal Democrats are busy toning down the un-diluted commitment to
European union on which they fought the general election. The judgment is
that singing the praises of Brussels is not the best way to win seats in the
European parliament from the Conservatives.
Mr John Smith, if his shadow cabinet colleagues are to be believed, plans to
treat the European elections as a referendum on Mr Major's tax record -
though there will, one supposes, be the odd reference to the social chapter
and to the need for concerted cuts in European interest rates.
Europe has so far been a convenient staging post for the Labour party on its
long journey to electoral respectability. But at some point Labour will have
to develop a more detailed approach than one of simply approving all things
European.
If the Tories are wrong to suggest that the social chapter would turn
Britain into an industrial wasteland, Labour is misguided in asserting that
a few works councils would transform economic prospects.
But Labour is in opposition. It is the government which must map out
Britain's strategy in the approach to 1996. The problem is that the
Conservative party will not let it.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Population expected to reach peak of 62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's population will continue rising to a peak of 62.2m in the year
2027, after which deaths are expected to exceed births.
Scotland's population, however, is likely to reach a peak by the turn of the
century, with losses from migration then exceeding any natural increase.
The UK has an ageing population. In 1961 less than 12 per cent of the
population was over the age of 65. This rose to 16 per cent in 1991, and
will rise above 22 per cent by 2031. By contrast, the proportion of children
under 16 fell from 25 per cent in 1961 to 20 per cent in 1991, and is
projected to decline further to 18 per cent in 2031.
In 1951 there were 21 people of pensionable age for every 100 of working
age. The figure is now about 30 per 100, and will rise to 46 per 100 in
2031. Comparing the number of pensioners and children in the population with
those of working age available to support them creates the dependency ratio.
This was 57 in 1951, it rose to 63 in 1991 and is expected to reach 79 by
2031.
The 1991 population census has provided a range of new information about
ethnic minorities. The biggest individual ethnic group is Indian - forming
1.5 per cent of the national population, or 28 per cent of all ethnic
minorities. The three combined black categories of black Caribbean, black
African and other black people constitute 1.6 per cent of the nation, or 30
per cent of the ethnic-minority population.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Family loses out in social changes: More people live alone -
Sharp increase in divorce rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An apparently unequal struggle between the conventional family and social
and demographic change is shown today in Social Trends, the Central
Statistical Office's annual compendium of British life.
Political controversies over the future of the welfare state and the causes
of crime have brought the role of traditional family values into sharp
focus. But Social Trends shows that, while the debate continues, so does the
decline of the traditional family.
Couples with dependent children formed the majority of households as
recently as the early 1970s. By 1992 they constituted less than 40 per cent,
and it is now increasingly likely that such couples will not be married.
One significant reason for the change is a growing proportion of people
living alone. Single people now account for more than a quarter of all
households - there has been a threefold increase in the proportion of people
living alone during the past 30 years.
The biggest recent growth has been among men of working age, but the ageing
of the population is another factor that will fuel a continuing increase in
single-person households. By the year 2031 there will be more than 16m
people of pensionable age in Britain's population - more than double the
1961 number.
Recent years have seen an even more striking rise in the proportion of
lone-parent families - these have quadrupled since the early 1960s. The
government's General Household Survey, also published this week, shows that
21 per cent of families were headed by lone parents in 1992. The main
increase in single-parent households occurred during the 1970s and 1980s,
and there has been little further change in the proportion since 1990, the
government's household survey adds.
Allied to this change is Social Trends' now-familiar soaring graph showing
the remarkable rise in births outside marriage. Unmarried mothers now
account for almost one-in-three births - an increase from the one-in-20
level that, apart from the two world wars, had persisted throughout the
century until the 1960s. In Scotland and the north-east of England, 90 per
cent of mothers under 20 were unmarried in 1992.
The proportion of births outside marriage more than doubled during the 1980s
alone. But the children do not all grow up in single-parent families - in
1992, 75 per cent of babies born outside marriage were registered by both
parents.
Divorce, as well as births outside marriage, is contributing to the growth
in single-parent households. Marriages have declined by nearly 16 per cent
during the past 20 years, while divorces have more than doubled.
Some politicians hope that a renewed appreciation of the importance of
community involvement will fill the gaps created by fragmenting family
relationships. However, evidence in Social Trends suggests that this may be
wishful thinking.
Surveys show that only 4 per cent of the population has taken an active part
in a political campaign. The proportion of churchgoers is, at 15 per cent,
lower than in many other European countries.
Almost 75 per cent of the population has done no recent voluntary work. Some
of the active minority who do volunteer put in more than 10 hours a month -
but this compares with nearly 27 hours a week spent by the average citizen
watching television.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Mills defends CPS on abandoned cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of all cases dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service are
discontinued because there is not sufficient evidence for there to be a
realistic prospect of conviction, Mrs Barbara Mills, director of public
prosecutions, said yesterday.
Announcing the results of a survey of the 10,782 cases discontinued in
November, undertaken after concern about the number of cases dropped, Mrs
Mills said the findings would help correct the misconception that the CPS
was responsible for stopping an increasing number of prosecutions.
Appearing before the Commons home affairs committee, Mrs Mills told MPs some
of the results of the survey might appear surprising.
In 25 per cent of cases the CPS had no option but to discontinue. Where a
witness was missing or refused to give evidence, where the offence had been
taken into consideration by another court, or where defendants charged with
failure to produce motoring documents produced them at court, there was no
choice, she said.
The perception that the CPS was dropping serious cases was also untrue, she
said. More than 40 per cent of the discontinued cases were motoring
offences. In 31 per cent of cases it had been decided that it was not in the
public interest to prosecute. The main public interest reasons for
discontinuing were: defendant convicted/sentenced on other matters (9 per
cent); nominal penalty likely (6 per cent); staleness of case (4 per cent);
and change in complainant's attitude (3 per cent).
Of the 43 per cent of cases discontinued because there was insufficient
evidence, 11 per cent were dropped because of insufficient identification
evidence, in 13 per cent of cases there was an essential legal element
missing and in 19 per cent there was insufficient other evidence.
Mrs Mills denied there was a serious breakdown in relations between the
police and the CPS over how to bring a successful prosecution.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Shear makers kept in the fold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's smallest union has been bailed out by the Trades Union Congress
after threatening to leave because it could not afford the Pounds 18.20
affiliation fee.
The 13-member Sheffield Wool Shear Workers' Union, founded 104 years ago,
decided it no longer wanted to pay the annual fee of Pounds 1.40 a member.
Mr Ray Cutler, the general secretary, who runs the union from his home in
Sheffield, said: 'We never went to any of the TUC meetings and we haven't
got a lot of funds. We decided among ourselves that it wasn't worth it any
more.'
The union, which was once represented in about 12 companies when the
Sheffield steel industry was a global power, now only has members in one
company, Burgon and Ball, which makes hand shears.
The 240-strong west Midlands-based Engineering and Fastener Trade Union was
also threatening to resign because of similar financial problems.
The TUC decided yesterday that it would come to their rescue. Mr Jimmy
Knapp, the TUC president and leader of the RMT transport union, which has
105,000 members, persuaded the general council to set up a fund to pay the
fees of the two unions.
'They are part of our history and it would be sending the wrong signal if we
let them go for the sake of a few pounds,' he said.
Mr Cutler, who said his union had never had a dispute 'in memory' did not
appear to be too worried either way. 'It's the first I've heard of it,' he
said last night.
The TUC has not indicated the size of its fund but it will be hoping that
its intervention will not attract envious glances from other similarly
endowed affiliates.
Listed just above the shearers in the TUC handbook is the slightly more
muscular Scottish Union of Power-Loom Overlookers, membership 55.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Scott told of move to rein in Customs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Department of Trade official tried to delay Customs and Excise
investigations into illegal arms exports because he was concerned about
safeguarding British trade with Iraq, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard
yesterday.
Mr Michael Petter, the former head of the Middle East, Near East, and North
Africa exports branch at the DTI, said the view that Iraq should not be
allowed 'to go down the tubes' was shared more widely in Whitehall.
'It was the view of the DTI and the ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) which had invested heavily in Iraq. It was using one's
intelligence about the size of UK plc in the (Iraqi) market,' he said.
Mr Petter, now an assessor for Queen's Awards to Industry, said he had
wanted to delay the Customs investigations into the Iraqi supergun and the
exports of machine tools in June 1990 after the British ambassador to
Baghdad had warned of the potential damage to UK-Iraqi trade.
But he said that the proposed approach to Customs had been opposed first by
Foreign Office officials and then more widely in Whitehall.
Pressed by Lord Justice Scott to indicate whether his view about Customs may
have reflected orders from DTI ministers, Mr Petter assumed responsibility
for his actions.
'I don't think I appreciated as I ought to have done the constitutional
point about the independence of Customs,' Mr Petter said.
Whitehall documents made available to the inquiry show a growing awareness
from 1988, based on intelligence information, of Iraqi attempts to use trade
with the UK to build up its military capability.
Mr Petter recommended in August 1988, however, that officials should lift
their restrictions on the export of British machine tools after 'skimming
over very fast' intelligence reports and taking into account only the
interests of British trade.
Questioned repeatedly by Lord Justice Scott how he could justify his actions
as a civil servant, Mr Petter said: 'I felt that the whole of our trading
relationship was being driven by this problem of Iraqi procurement.'
The hearings were adjourned until tomorrow.
Due to a transcription error, yesterday's report on the Scott inquiry gave
June 19 1990 as the date of a meeting chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary. The date of the meeting was July 19 1990.

MPs have urged Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, to ensure that BT's
rate of return on capital employed remains 'within acceptable levels'.
In its first examination of a utility regulator, the Commons public accounts
committee says that Oftel should compare the UK's dominant
telecommunications operators with the leading US telephone companies as a
basis for assessing BT's performance.
It adds: 'As improved efficiency has a bearing on charges, we recommend that
such information is made available to customers in order that they may judge
the position for themselves.'
Oftel told the committee that BT's service had improved and that its
efficiency came close to the best of the US telephone companies. Oftel had
set an acceptable level of return on capital for BT of between 17.5 per cent
and 19 per cent. But in the years 1987-92, Oftel agreed that BT had made
Pounds 1.6bn more in profits than the benchmark dictated.
BT yesterday denied that its profits were unacceptable. Its pricing formula
 -the retail prices index minus 7.5 percentage points - was universally
recognised as tough, it said.
The committee also warns that the '999' emergency service should not suffer
from the increase in the number of operators licensed to offer telecoms
services.
BT said the committee's investigation had been completed last May. Its
conclusions were based largely on opinion rather than fact and many of the
recommendations had already been implemented.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Tory climbdown ends threat of Commons logjam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a procedural logjam in the Commons was lifted last night after
the government agreed to press on with debate of two important bills with a
majority of only one on the relevant committees.
As a result Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, is expected not to sit on
the committee that is handling a bill to reform local government in
Scotland.
Government business managers are thought to have reasoned that Mr Lang's
enforced absence at weekly cabinet meetings would have erased the
government's slender majority with unpredictable consequences.
Under the deal agreed last night after a prolonged row, the government will
also have a majority of only one on the bill to privatise the coal industry.
It will have a more comfortable cushion of two on committees handling both
the finance bill and the social security bill to tighten the rules for
invalidity benefit, whose composition was also discussed at last night's
meetings.
Yesterday's dispute has its roots in Labour's decision to withdraw
parliamentary co-operation from the government before Christmas after
ministers cut short debate on two bills.
Under Commons rules, the government's majority of 17 entitles it to a
majority of 1.8 on the standing committees, which debate bills line by line
after they have been approved in principle in the second-reading debate.
Normally, the two sides' business managers agree that some bills will have a
government majority of two and others one, giving an average majority of
about 1.8 over a parliamentary session.
But the campaign of non-cooperation has meant that no discussions have taken
place, leaving Labour free to trigger a crisis when the selection committee
met to choose MPs to serve on standing committees.
For the first time in memory the selection committee was forced to adjourn
without reaching a decision on the membership of a standing committee.
The outcome of yesterday's meeting will be regarded as a parliamentary
triumph by Labour, which appears determined to press on with its campaign of
confrontation until the government backs down.
Labour's refusal to allow leave of absence for its MPs has also forced the
abandonment of several cross-party overseas delegations. Casualties have
included a defence committee visit to Belize and a parliamentary delegation
to the Council of Europe/Western European Union plenary session in Paris.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Commons procedure row threatens to block bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was trying to break a procedural logjam in the Commons last
night after a row over committee rules threatened to block debate on four
important bills.
The row blew up after Labour refused to bow to demands for a Conservative
majority of two on a committee to debate a bill reforming local government
in Scotland.
However, it also prevented talks on the composition of committees on three
other bills - the finance bill, the bill to privatise the coal industry, and
the social security bill, which tightens the rules for invalidity benefit.
Labour said it would block further progress on the all bills unless the
government accepted a majority of one. 'It is their bill - if they want to
get it through they will have to back down,' said a senior Labour MP.
But Conservative business managers were refusing to give way, raising the
prospect that a full-scale Commons debate might be needed to sort out the
muddle.
'They are refusing to stand by the rules. If they insist on pushing it, we
will just vote them down,' said a Tory involved in the row.
The dispute has its roots in Labour's decision to withdraw parliamentary
co-operation from the government before Christmas after ministers cut short
debate on two bills.
Under Commons rules, the government's majority of 17 entitles it to a
majority of 1.8 on the standing committees, which debate bills line by line
after they have been approved in principle in the second reading debate.
Normally, the two sides' business managers agree that some bills will have a
government majority of two and others one, giving an average majority of
about 1.8 over a parliamentary session.
But the campaign of non-cooperation has meant that no discussions have taken
place, leaving Labour free to trigger a crisis when the selection committee
met to choose MPs for standing committees.
For the first time in memory, the selection committee was forced to adjourn
without deciding on the make-up of a standing committee.
The dispute is regarded as a parliamentary triumph by Labour, which appears
determined to continue its campaign of confrontation until the government
backs down.
Labour's refusal to allow leave of absence for its MPs has also forced the
abandonment of several cross-party overseas delegations. Casualties have
included a defence committee visit to Belize and a parliamentary delegation
to the Council of Europe/Western European Union plenary session in Paris.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Patten urged to intervene in Hackney school row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs yesterday urged Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to
intervene at a primary school in the London borough of Hackney after the
school's governors defied a request by the council to suspend the head
teacher.
The case has gained widespread attention after the decision by the head, Ms
Jane Brown, not to take pupils to see the ballet Romeo and Juliet because it
was 'blatantly heterosexual'.
The MPs' move, however, has exposed a loophole in measures introduced in the
education reforms of 1988 to ensure schools' accountability to parents.
Mr Gus John, Hackney director of education, recommended that Ms Brown should
be suspended as head of Kingsmead school. This was rejected on Tuesday night
by all but one of the governors. Several parents enthusiastically supported
the governors.
Mr Harry Greenway, Conservative MP for Ealing North and a former head
teacher, said: 'The time has come for Mr Patten to intervene, and it would
be right for him to do so . . . to order her suspension.'
The Department for Education said Mr Patten would not intervene unless
directly requested to do so. It refused to comment on the case.
Hackney yesterday said the matter raised 'serious constitutional issues',
and that Mr Patten could intervene at any time he wanted to.
Last night the council warned the governors that unless they co-operated
with an investigation into allegations against Ms Brown they could face
legal action.
Mr John McCafferty, council leader, said the governors would be invited to
set up a disciplinary panel with the local education authority to hear the
case which Ms Brown 'needs to answer'.
Educational experts said that the governors were acting within powers given
to them under the 'local management of schools' system introduced in 1988.
This shifted the responsibility for hiring, firing and discipline of heads
from education authorities to governing bodies.
Mr Walter Ulrich, of the National Association of Governors and Managers,
said that the authority still had the power to require governors to report
on any issue affecting the school.
Mr Ivor Widdison of the Confederation of Local Education Authorities said he
believed that the governors had acted within their powers, and that Mr
Patten could only step in using a clause in the Education Act of 1944, which
would allow him to intervene if the head had 'used her powers unreasonably'.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Palumbo raps 'irresponsible neglect' of arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Palumbo, outgoing chairman of the Arts Council, yesterday delivered a
stinging attack on the government's 'irresponsible neglect' of the arts.
He told the Lords that cuts in the next three years would reduce funds for
artists by 12 per cent, virtually reversing a 15 per cent increase since
1989. He said: 'This amounts to irresponsible neglect of a precious national
resource which generates a threefold return for every pound of taxpayers
money invested in it.
'The government's timing is impeccable, coinciding with a contemporary
decline in available funds for the arts from its mainstays of local
authorities, box office, sponsorship and charitable foundations.
'I am well aware of the vital necessity to constrain public expenditure, but
success feeds upon itself and it should be encouraged and built upon, not
penalised.'
Lord Palumbo's outspoken criticism of the government reflects anger in the
arts establishment about a Pounds 3.2m cut in the Arts Council budget,
announced in November.
In what amounted to a comprehensive indictment of the government's arts
policy, he accused ministers of wasting Pounds 6m since 1989 in a failed
attempt to achieve value for money.
He said: 'There has never been a moment in those five years when we have not
been reviewed, counter-reviewed, surveyed, appraised (and) tested against
market forces. That has cost a great deal in time and effort, and although
the calculation is imprecise, it has probably cost the taxpayer something in
the order of Pounds 6m in an attempt to establish value for money, and I
doubt very much that we have been able to do it.
'Of course mistakes are sometimes made, and when they are we regret them.
Equally on some occasions the blame we receive is unjust.'
Lord Palumbo said the decision to divert funds from the performing arts to
the refurbishment of London's Albert Memorial rather than use national
lottery profits was 'an act of the purest folly.'
Lord Palumbo will be replaced as Art Council chairman in March by Lord
Gowrie, a former Conservative arts minister.

FT  27 JAN 94 / CBI in call for cost clamp on pension reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for crucial elements
of proposals for reforms to pension law to be modified to reduce costs for
industry.
In particular the CBI expressed concerns about proposals for minimum
solvency standards for pension schemes, which formed part of proposals by
the Pensions Law Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode.
The Goode proposals would require employers to add reserves to schemes if
their assets fall below 90 per cent of what is needed to pay all pension
liabilities if the scheme were wound up immediately.
Wind-up at short notice could occur under certain circumstances,
particularly if an employer became insolvent. In recent years a number of
employers' schemes - most notably those of the late Robert Maxwell - have
been wound up with too few assets to meet pension liabilities.
The actuarial profession, which calculates the assets and liabilities of
pension schemes, is deeply divided over whether the proposed minimum
solvency standards would pose a great burden for employers or force a change
in investment patterns.
The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association
which includes many members of the CBI, has also called for an easing of the
proposed minimum solvency rules.
The CBI suggested that participation in an industry-funded compensation
scheme should be optional. Those schemes which could buy appropriate
private-sector insurance against a shortfall caused by fraud or
misappropriation should be allowed to do so, the CBI said.
An official conceded that while it was likely this would lead to a
compensation fund financed only by poorly run schemes, 'the good schemes
should not be made to subsidise the bad'.
The CBI also said that the reforms to pension law need not include a
requirement for member-appointed trustees to schemes.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Oil output hits five-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Sea oil production in December reached its highest level since the
disaster which destroyed the Piper Alpha platform in 1988, according to
figures published yesterday by Royal Bank of Scotland.
December production of 2.33m barrels a day was about 1 per cent up from the
figure for November.
Fourth quarter production registered a 14 per cent rise over the same period
in 1992 as new fields came on stream.
Oil production for 1993 as a whole reached a five-year high. Gas production
averaging 6,255m cu ft a day reached a three-year high. Buoyant gas prices
helped to boost the average daily revenue from North Sea oil and gas
production last year to Pounds 33.5m, a 13 per cent increase from the 1992
average of Pounds 29.7m.
Average daily oil revenues rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 22.4m in spite of
the fall in the price of the benchmark Brent blend from about Dollars 20 a
barrel at the start of last year to the present level of about Dollars 14 a
barrel.
Ms Jo Armstrong, a bank economist, noted that the oil price decline was
particularly steep towards the end of the year, with daily oil revenues in
December falling by just under 10 per cent to Pounds 21.4bn.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Lilley to cut jobless benefits for the young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to cut the amount of benefit given to unemployed people
aged between 18 and 24, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
announced yesterday.
In evidence to the Commons social security committee, Mr Lilley said that
the introduction of a jobseekers allowance next year would involve general
reductions in the level of benefit given to this age group.
Legislation for the new allowance will be presented to the next session of
parliament for implementation in 1995, and will help to cut about Pounds
300m from the social security budget in the first two years of its
implementation.
Under the current benefit system most people over the age of 18 who become
unemployed receive weekly benefit of Pounds 44.65 in the first 12 months out
of work. After that they switch to Income Support, receiving Pounds 34.80 if
aged between 18 and 24.
Under the new system they will receive a jobseekers allowance for the first
six months, the level of which has not been set. After that they will switch
to income support. Mr Lilley told MPs: 'There will be a lower benefit level
for those under 25, which reflects the lower earnings expectation of people
in that group.'
Mr Lilley said the under 25s had lower earnings expectations and made lower
National Insurance contributions than people over that age. Social security
officials also claim that part of the rationale is that many young people
below the age of 24 tend to stay at home.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security committee, said that
young people would get much less than they would have received under the
current system. 'We are slowly finding out which groups will be affected by
Mr Lilley's new policies,' he said
Mr Lilley reiterated the importance of his overall goal of reining in the
Pounds 80bn social security budget so it grows in line with the nation's
ability to pay for it. 'If you want to contain its long-term growth, you
must introduce long-term structural reforms to ensure it goes to those with
greatest need,' he said.
Mr Lilley denied suggestions that he was engaged in an argument with the
Department of Employment over who would administer the scheme.
Meanwhile, the government last night admitted that more than a million UK
citizens are classified as unemployed but are not claiming
unemployment-related benefits.
But, it added, there were nearly as many claimants who were not unemployed,
according to the international standard measure.
The answer came in a parliamentary written answer from Miss Ann Widdecombe,
employment minister.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Appeal by convicted solicitor rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A solicitor jailed for mortgage fraud lost his appeals against conviction
and sentence yesterday. Mr Michael Farrell, of Knutsford, Cheshire, served
10 months of a 30-month prison sentence imposed at Liverpool crown court in
July 1992 on two charges of conspiracy to obtain property by deception.
Mr Farrell, who practised at Eccles, near Manchester, had claimed he was
duped and had no knowledge of any conspiracy.
Lord Justice McCowan, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Mr Justice Scott
Baker and Mr Justice Blofeld, said the trial judge's directions to the jury
were perfectly satisfactory. He rejected as 'wholly unjustified' criticism
of the judge's handling of the case.
'We are satisfied there was no badgering or hectoring of Mr Farrell, no
disparagement of his account and no hostility shown towards him by the
judge,' he said.
The appeal judges also refused to cut the length of the sentence. 'These
were very serious offences for a solicitor to commit and he did not plead
guilty. Therefore we are unable to say the sentence was wrong,' Lord Justice
McCowan said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Classic FM reaches out to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Classic FM, the commercial classical music radio station, plans to transmit
on satellite to provide a service all over Europe. The decision is linked
with last week's announcement that Classic has been awarded one of two new
FM frequencies in the Netherlands.
Satellite is the easiest way to deliver the Classic signal to the Dutch
terrestrial radio transmitters but it will also mean that Classic will be
available to individuals across the continent.
Sir Peter Michael, Classic chairman, said yesterday: 'It certainly makes
broadcasting sense and it makes commercial sense.'
As well as using the latest satellite technology Classic - whose
shareholders include Time Warner, the world's largest media group,
Associated Newspapers and the GWR local radio group - plans to apply for
more broadcasting licences across Europe. Sir Peter expects the process of
de-regulation of broadcasting to continue and believes that classical music
is one of the most international of all media sectors.
The station, launched in 1992, is expected to apply for a radio licence
coming up in Finland and is interested in other Scandinavian markets.
Sir Peter emphasised that Classic was prepared to look at joint ventures
with continental European partners. As part of its campaign to win the Dutch
licence - beating 27 applicants for the two frequencies - Classic enlisted
the support of Dutch musicians. As a result leading Dutch orchestras such as
the Concert Gebouw are likely to feature on the station.
The audience for Classic, which has attracted a range of advertisers
including airlines, financial services and publishers, is estimated to be
more than 4.7m a week. Sir Peter said: 'It is now more effective than a
small ITV contractor as an advertising medium.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / Treasury blamed for roads setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Treasury constraints have delayed road-building contracts worth Pounds 1.6bn
and prevented the creation of nearly 50,000 jobs, the British Road
Federation said yesterday.
Between April 1991 and March 1994 work should have started on 128 schemes
worth nearly Pounds 3bn yet so far only 74 projects worth Pounds 1.4bn have
begun. Mr Richard Diment, federation director, said: 'This is bad news for
the construction industry, for towns waiting for a bypass and for business
stuck with a Pounds 15bn bill for congestion.'
The Department of Transport denied that a shortage of finance lay behind the
delays and said road schemes which were announced still depended on
obtaining planning consent. In the current year starts were planned on 41
schemes.
Design and build contracts, which are planned to account for a third of new
road construction schemes over the next three years, are to be extended to
principal road maintenance contracts, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said yesterday.
He is extending the arrangement to seven schemes with a combined estimated
value of Pounds 23m in England.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Rivers Authority yesterday won a High Court ruling that
companies can be found guilty of causing pollution through their operations,
even if the offence is the result of actions by employees who cannot be said
to be part of the 'controlling mind' of the organisation.
Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Morland allowed the authority's
appeal against a decision by magistrates at West Malling, Kent, in January
last year that Alfred McAlpine Homes East could not be held responsible for
polluting a stream and causing death to fish.
The construction company was prosecuted after wet cement was washed into the
Ditton stream at Goldwell Springs, East Malling, in May 1992.
The High Court ordered a rehearing before a fresh bench. McAlpine Homes was
refused leave to appeal to the Lords.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Call to reform capital gains tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should substantially reform capital gains tax, the Bow Group
says in a pamphlet published yesterday.
The tax is damaging to investment and enterprise, complicated and expensive
to administer and inefficient in raising funds, the Conservative pressure
group says.
The pamphlet was written by Mr Anthony Coombs, MP for Wyre Forest and
secretary of the Conservative parliamentary finance committee. He says the
decision in 1988 of Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, to equalise
capital gains tax and higher income tax rates left British capital taxes at
among the highest in the industrialised world.

<TEXT>
The Foreign Office spends nearly Pounds 10m a year on private education and
boarding school allowances for the children of its personnel, Mr Alastair
Goodlad, foreign office minister, said last night.
In a parliamentary written answer he said that in 1992-93 the department
spent Pounds 7.88m on 744 children attending boarding schools in the UK and
a further Pounds 2m on those educated locally at their parents' post.
The corresponding figures in 1988-89 were Pounds 7.17m and Pounds 1.54m.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Straw accused of undermining Labour spending promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, was accused in the Commons last
night of undermining a claim by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that the
Labour party had no new public expenditure commitments.
Sir George Young, housing minister, insisted that Mr Straw's demand that
local authorities be allowed to use Pounds 5.5bn of accumulated capital
receipts to build new houses and acquire empty properties would add to the
public sector borrowing requirement.
Mr Straw said that the Pounds 5.5bn secured by local authorities from the
sale of council houses could enable a start to be made on tackling the
'crisis'.
When reminded of Mr Brown's assurance that Labour had made no new spending
commitments, he recalled that the government had permitted councils to use
capital receipts from council house sales in the current financial year.
Sir George said the accumulated capital receipts had been used to reduce the
overall indebtedness of local authorities and the public sector borrowing
requirement.
He said capital receipts were not simply stored in bank vaults 'for a Labour
chancellor to spend'.
Mr Straw said ministers had been 'up to their necks' in discussions about
the housing policy of Westminster city council, alleged by the district
auditor to amount to 'gerrymandering'.
He said there was no reason why the government could not condemn the policy
pursued by a 'flagship' Conservative authority even if it was not prepared
to comment on allegations made against individuals.
Sir Paul Beresford, MP for Croydon Central and former leader of Wandsworth
council, defended the council's housing programmes and accused the previous
Labour council of gerrymandering.
The Tory council housing sales policy pioneered by Wandsworth led to
allegations of 'homes for votes' when operated by Westminster.
Sir Paul said that Wandsworth, as a leading Labour local authority before
1978, had operated schemes which boosted the number of council properties.
'They were working with the Labour-controlled Greater London Council in
blatant gerrymandering,' he said.
Sir George released figures in a Commons written reply showing that
Wandsworth council featured consistently at or near the top of the league
table for discounted property sales in the London boroughs.
The figures showed that it sold houses and flats totalling more in value
than any other authority in every year from 1983-84 to 1991-92.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Reynolds hopeful of IRA response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dublin government yesterday said it remained hopeful that the UK-Irish
initiative would bring peace to Northern Ireland but stressed that it was
not interested in erecting artificial deadlines for a response from the IRA
and Sinn Fein.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, told the Dail (parliament)
that there was a deep debate in the two organisations and that Ireland as a
whole would welcome a response from republicans 'at the earliest possible
time'.
His remarks came ahead of tomorrow's meeting in Dublin of the first session
of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference since the two governments
unveiled their joint peace initiative at the end of last year.
The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to
reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative and to make clear that
their demands for a cessation of violence remain a prerequisite to any
progress on a settlement.
Tomorrow will also see a Sinn Fein conference in Londonderry, called to give
members another opportunity to express views on the peace proposals. The
meeting will be addressed by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.
With British ministers increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for a
positive IRA response, Mr Reynolds continued to stress his optimism. He
said: 'I am not privy to the internal debate that is going on. But there is
clearly an intense debate.
'I have repeatedly made it clear since the declaration was signed that I did
not expect an early response. We are trying to find a resolution to a
centuries-old conflict.
'I am as hopeful as I was on the first day of the declaration. But time is
needed, and there can be no artificial deadlines. We are trying to change
direction, and take the gun out of Irish politics. I would still give it a
fair chance of success.'
He stressed that there had been no contact with Sinn Fein over the
'clarification' it had demanded before making a decision.
Ulster police last night put the province on a firebomb alert amid fears
that the IRA was about to strike against business and commercial property.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Production of oil hits a 5-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Sea oil production in December reached its highest level since the
disaster which destroyed the Piper Alpha platform in 1988, according to
figures published yesterday by Royal Bank of Scot-land.
December production of 2.33m barrels a day was about 1 per cent up from the
figure for November.
Fourth quarter production registered a 14 per cent rise over the same period
in 1992 as new fields came on stream.
Oil production for 1993 as a whole reached a five-year high. Gas production
averaging 6,255m cu ft a day reached a three-year high. Buoyant gas prices
helped to boost the average daily revenue from North Sea oil and gas
production last year to Pounds 33.5m, a 13 per cent increase from the 1992
average of Pounds 29.7m.
Average daily oil revenues rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 22.4m in spite of
the fall in the price of the benchmark Brent blend from about Dollars 20 a
barrel at the start of last year to the present level of about Dollars 14 a
barrel.
Ms Jo Armstrong, a bank economist, noted that the oil price decline was
particularly steep towards the end of the year, with daily oil revenues in
December falling by just under 10 per cent to Pounds 21.4bn.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Plea over river pollution upheld
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Rivers Authority yesterday won a High Court ruling that
companies can be found guilty of causing pollution through their operations,
even if the offence is the result of actions by employees who cannot be said
to be part of the 'controlling mind' of the organisation.
Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Morland allowed the NRA's appeal
against a decision by magistrates at West Malling, Kent, in January last
year that a construction company could not be held responsible for polluting
a stream and causing death to fish.
Alfred McAlpine Homes East was prosecuted after wet cement was washed into
the Ditton stream while homes were being built at Goldwell Springs, East
Malling, in May 1992.
The magistrates held the company had no case to answer because two
employees, who accepted responsibility for the pollution, were not 'of a
sufficiently senior standing'.
Ordering a rehearing of the case before a fresh bench, Lord Justice Brown
said: 'An employer is liable for pollution resulting from its own
operations, carried out under its essential control.'
McAlpine Homes was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

FT  27 JAN 94 / State of the Union: Tough-talker Clinton slays the
'naysayers' - The president demands results in his domestic crusade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If giving speeches were all there was to government, and if the US
constitution allowed it, Ronald Reagan would have been elected
president-for-life - and so, on Tuesday night's form, might Bill Clinton. In
fact there was quite a lot of the old Republican gunslinger in the first
official State of the Union address by the self-proclaimed 'new kind of
Democrat'.
The call-to-arms for a better America, with or without the assistance of
Congress, and the brandishing of his pen as he threatened to veto any
healthcare legislation that did not provide universal insurance coverage
were borrowed from the Reagan handbook. So too were the acknowledgement of
ordinary (and not so ordinary) people in the public galleries and the artful
seating at either side of Mrs Hillary Clinton of Jack Smith, head of General
Motors, and Lane Kirkland, the trade union leader.
Critics might also complain that the 64-minute speech was too long, yet
short on new proposals, especially on the revived promise to 'end welfare as
we know it'. Foreigners might lament that its external passage was both
perfunctory and predictable and Republicans that the president keeps
stealing their clothes.
But reservations must be placed in context. The State of the Union address
offers all presidents a stage and - for a Democrat, old or new, welcomed by
a Democratic Congress - an audience guaranteed to applaud often and loudly.
And it found Mr Clinton in vintage missionary form on his favourite subject,
domestic reform. The country, he concluded in ringing tones, 'is growing
stronger but it must be stronger still'.
It was tough for the opposition to muster an effective immediate response.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, speaking woodenly from his office
without the benefit of partisan cheering, could only proclaim that there was
no healthcare crisis, and complain about higher taxes.
Potentially far more revealing, though still to be approached with a degree
of cynicism, was the reaction of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
firebrand conservative. 'There is a potential, if this speech was sincere,
for a remarkable coalition that could pass a lot of stuff,' especially on
crime and welfare. He added approvingly that Mr Clinton was now talking his
kind of language.
This, indeed, was the political message of the address. Mr Clinton drew his
line in the sand, insisted that an improving economy was no excuse for
delaying more reform and gave the distinct impression that he did not care
from which side of the political aisle he derived support for his crusade.
But he warned, too, that the body politic was ultimately accountable to the
public - 'those who hold our feet to the fire'.
Americans, he said, would not heed the siren songs of the special vested
interests and the 'naysayers who fear we will not be equal to the challenges
of our time and who misread our history, our heritage and even today's
headlines'.
There were micro-political messages, too. The president's promise to bring
in soon substantive proposals to change the welfare system and explicitly to
link this with healthcare reform was a clear nod in the direction of Senator
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate finance
committee.
The senator, an intellectual, if temperamental, original in this Congress,
has become miffed with the administration. He has declared, like Senator
Dole, that there is no healthcare crisis and threatened to make trouble for
the health proposals if his welfare hobby horse was relegated in priority -
which is precisely what the White House intended at the start of this year.
At least he was satisfied with Mr Clinton's commitment on Tuesday night,
though as the president went on to expound with much greater passion on the
imperative of healthcare reform he can have been left in little doubt where
the Clinton heart lies.
But this, too, had a political need. The momentum for changes in healthcare,
accelerated by the rapturously received presidential address to Congress
last September, has slowed over the last two months. Other issues such as
Nafta, gun control and Mr Clinton's European trip have intruded while the
insurance and medical professions have begun to launch effective propaganda
campaigns. It had become incumbent on Mr Clinton to regain the initiative.
His ecumenical side was also in evidence in the coda to his address on crime
and on the responsibility of individuals to make communities safer.
Much of what he said appeals to conservatives - mandatory sentencing for
violent offenders, more police on the streets, the restoration of family
values - but some, specifically the calls for ever tighter gun control, does
not.
Violent crime is now a perennial political issue. Every president since
Lyndon Johnson has attacked it and Congress loves to debate it, though the
effect of the efforts of both may be questioned, not least because
conservatives and liberals have rarely agreed on the right prescriptions.
But at least the Senate last year passed, by 95 votes to four, an omnibus
crime bill that now awaits action by the House, while both chambers approved
waiting limits for purchasers of handguns. This measure was now the Brady
Law, Mr Clinton said with pride as he clapped Mr James Brady, the former
presidential press secretary, who from his wheelchair in the galleries
proudly waved his walking stick back in return.
There is always a risk of overloading Congress, especially in the run-up to
mid-term elections. It is possible now that fixation with crime will make
harder action on health and welfare reform, both immensely complicated and
controversial, as well as other items on the president's heavy agenda such
as worker retraining, campaign finance reform, more controls on lobbyists
and the creation of an information superhighway.
But, from his Tuesday night pulpit, Mr Clinton was brooking no delay. 'Our
deepest and most profound problems' could not be left to 'petty political
fighting'. If words were all - and he used them very well - he would be home
and dry. But not yesterday, as his doctors ordered him to rest a voice that
barely lasted the 64 minutes.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLINTON SPEAKS: WARNING AND COAXING CONGRESS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
VIOLENT CRIME
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society,
  limiting personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us.'
'Every day, the national peace is shattered by crime. . .The problem of
  violence is an American problem. It has no partisan or philosophical
  element. Therefore, I urge you to ..set aside partisan differences
  and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
HEALTH AND WELFARE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'I want to make this very clear. . .If you send me legislation that
  does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can
  never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the
  legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over
  again.'
'I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the
  same time we tackle healthcare. But let me point out, I think it is
  inevitable and imperative.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FEDERAL BUDGET
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'It will cut spending in more than 300 programmes, eliminate 100
  domestic programmes, and reform the way government buys its goods
  and services. This year we must make the hard choices again to live
  within the hard spending ceilings we have set.'
'The budget. . .draws the line against further defence cuts. It fully
  protects the readiness and quality of our forces.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREIGN POLICY
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Our support of reform (in Russia and the other former Soviet republics)
  must combine patience, for the enormity of the task, and vigilance,
  for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to urge
  Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms.'
'As we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must
  continue to insist on clear signs of improvements in that nation's
  human rights record.'

FT  27 JAN 94 / Budget is forecast to cut deficit to Dollars 180bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Next year's budget deficit will be less than Dollars 180bn (Pounds 120bn),
President Bill Clinton predicted in his State of the Union address, 40 per
cent lower than the Dollars 300bn many analysts were forecasting when he
assumed office last year.
The president said the budget for fiscal 1995, which begins in October,
would be 'one of the toughest budgets presented to Congress'. More than 300
programmes would be cut and 100 eliminated.
The full budget details will not be available until early next month. In
addition to tax rises and spending restraint enacted last year, the rapid
decline in the deficit appears to reflect a combination of factors. These
include an unexpectedly sharp deceleration in healthcare inflation, a strong
cyclical recovery which is boosting tax receipts, and lower than projected
long-term interest rates which are reducing debt service costs.
Medical care prices rose at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of last year. For 1993 as a whole, the increase was 5.4 per cent,
twice the overall rate of inflation but sharply down from 9.6 per cent as
recently as 1990. Last year's healthcare inflation was the lowest since
1973.
Partly as a result of slowing healthcare inflation, officials have reduced
projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the public programmes for the
elderly and poor, by about Dollars 45bn over the next five years.
The key factor reducing the deficit in the short term was the strong
cyclical economic recovery, according to Salomon Brothers. Growth was
boosting tax receipts, especially from the corporate sector, and cutting
increases in transfer payments, for example on food stamps and unemployment
insurance.
A deficit of Dollars 180bn or less in fiscal 1995 compares with last year's
White House projection of a Dollars 296bn deficit, if no action were taken,
or Dollars 200bn after enactment of last year's budget. But it would
represent an extension of a well-established trend. The deficit peaked at
Dollars 290bn in fiscal 1992 - less than the feared Dollars 350bn - and fell
to Dollars 255bn in fiscal 1993.
Private sector analysts are projecting a deficit of Dollars 220bn-Dollars
240bn in fiscal 1994, against official projections last year of Dollars
262bn. Next month's budget is expected to show the deficit falling to well
under 2 per cent of GDP in the next five years.
But any permanent improvement would depend mainly on the durability of the
slowdown in healthcare spending. That, in turn, will depend on the nature of
reforms enacted this year.

FT  27 JAN 94 / 'Big Bang' for Chile capital markets: Reforms in Latin
America's leading financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chile boasts the most sophisticated domestic financial market in Latin
America - a development that has helped the country achieve the highest
savings rate in the region. A new law passed by Congress this week, lifting
many of the remaining market restrictions, is expected to help keep it that
way.
'We believe this to be one of the most important financial reforms in many
years,' said Mr Julio Bustamante, chief regulator of Chile's fast-growing
pension funds. 'This is a project that took us more than two years to draw
up and one that spent more than a year in parliament undergoing a process of
refinement.'
The new law broadens investment choices, introduces new financial
instruments and seeks to apply international standards of regulation.
Impulse for reforms came from a desire to manage better the savings
administered by Chile's private pension funds (AFPs) and to tap their
resources for social needs such as infrastructure and housing.
AFPs, privatised in 1981, control Dollars 15bn in savings, more than 35 per
cent of Chile's gross domestic product - and expected to reach 80 per cent
by the turn of the century. Under legislation introduced in the early 1980s,
employees are required to save at least 10 per cent of their wages in one of
these funds.
AFPs have complained for years that over-cautious regulations have starved
them of investment opportunities and dented their ability to increase
profits. Pension funds and associated life insurance companies are
restricted to investing 30 per cent of their capital in blue chip stock. In
practice, they have concentrated on only a handful of shares in the
electricity and telecommunications sectors.
New regulations will allow AFPs gradually to extend their investments to
most of Santiago's nearly 300 listed companies, provided these satisfy
certain criteria. It is hoped that this will provide a financial fillip to
small and medium-sized companies, and coax some of Chile's conservative -
often large - family-run concerns to float on the stock market.
'I think the more companies that are eligible for AFP investment the more
interest there will be among medium-sized private companies to open up to
the market,' said Mr Juan Andres Camus, managing director of Celfin, a local
investment bank.
New instruments are also to be introduced, such as mortgage-backed
securities, convertible bonds, and revenue bonds. It is hoped that the
latter will encourage private capital to play a much larger role in
financing badly needed infrastructure such as ports and roads. Mr Bustamante
estimates that, of Dollars 500m worth of infrastructural projects planned
for the next two years, institutional investors could provide up to 40 per
cent.
Scope for AFP provision of venture capital and for coverage of risk through
options, futures and swaps will also be expanded.
Furthermore, AFPs and other institutional investors, such as mutual funds,
will be able to expand investments abroad, currently limited to 3 per cent
of their portfolio in AAA-rated bank debt and gilt-edged securities. This
ceiling will be raised over four years to 12 per cent, permitting AFPs to
invest more than Dollars 1.3bn abroad.
'When a country is on the road to development, it doesn't only export goods
 -but also services and capital,' said Mr Bustamante.
The range of foreign investment options will be widened to cover equity and
bonds in investment-grade companies. AFPs will also be permitted to cover
risk through currency and interest rate swaps, but will not be allowed to
use such instruments for speculation.
Along with greater flexibility comes a tougher regulatory framework aimed at
clamping down on abuses of new freedoms by Santiago's tight-knit business
community. Reforms devote much space to defining insider dealing - still a
novel concept in much of Latin America - and set minimum prison sentences
for specified offences.
There is also an attempt to erect walls between pension funds, brokerages
and listed companies on whose boards the same faces tend to crop up again
and again. Under the new legislation, for instance, brokerage houses whose
executives are board members of specific companies will be obliged to resign
their directorship or cease trading in shares of that company.
Although rules pertaining to conflict of interest were softened by Senate
amendments - after lobbying from interested parties - Mr Bustamante feels
that the final result is satisfactory. 'It will force a lot of changes,' he
said.
The legislation does not address foreign investment restrictions, such as a
one-year repatriation period and high levels of withholding tax on stock
market gains. But there are signs that the new administration, due to take
over in March, may be willing to do so.

For many senior members listening to President Bill Clinton's State of the
Union speech in Congress on Tuesday night, it was the last time they will
have front row seats for such an address.
Members are retiring or seeking other office in record numbers, driven out
by age, cynicism or fatigue. Many others face a hard fight to win
re-election.
Complaints that the Congress has become more partisan and less rewarding are
widespread among those who have chosen to leave.
'Partisan politics and negative campaigning have so poisoned the system that
reasoned, good faith debate on policy is now the exception when once it was
the norm,' said Congressman Austin Murphy of Pennsylvania. Congressman Al
McCandless of California said he simply wanted a leisurely breakfast and
more time with his grandchildren.
The 1992 election had already brought in a crowd of new faces: 110 members
of the House of Representatives and 14 senators.
But so far this session 19 House members with 348 years of legislative
experience between them - 14 of them Democrats - have announced their
retirement after the November 8 election. Six senators are also retiring.
Another seven House members are giving up their seats to run for governor in
their home states, while nine more are trying to move up to the Senate.
Democratic leaders expect to lose some seats in November, a normal
phenomenon for the president's party in the first two-yearly congressional
election after a presidential victory.
But the projected swing of about 25 seats - a figure both parties agree on -
would not be enough to change control of the House, where the Democrats now
hold 257 of the 435 seats.
In the Senate, too, the Republicans are expected to gain another two or
three seats in 34 elections that will be fought this year, but this would
again not break the Democratic majority, now 56 out of 100 senators.
The departures include some of the most influential members of the House:
from Mr Bob Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, to Mr William Ford of
Michigan, chairman of the education and labour committee.
They also number some of Congress's most colourful and principled members,
such as Mr Jake Pickle, a protege of former President Lyndon Johnson.
The exodus could affect the power structure of Congress, where committee
chairmanships are critically dependent on seniority. Three of the six
judiciary subcommittee chairmanships will come open, and another nine
subcommittee chairs will be left empty - besides Mr Ford's chairmanship of
the full education and labour committee.
Even more sweeping changes could be under way, as several senior members
could be persuaded to withdraw, or be defeated outright, by powerful
challenges in their party primaries.
The most important figure under attack is Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who holds
sway over tax matters as chairman of the ways and means committee. Still the
target of a Justice Department investigation, Mr Rostenkowski's popularity
in his Illinois district has rarely been lower.
Mr Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, whose 52 years in the House are already the
longest in history, has been urged by many of his colleagues, who have
already eased him out of the important appropriations committee
chairmanship, to go gracefully.
If he does not, he faces the most difficult race of his career against Mr
Tim Ford, Speaker of the Mississippi state legislature.
On the other side of the political divide, Mr Phil Crane of Illinois, rated
by Roll Call, the Capitol Hill village newspaper, as the most extreme right
winger in the House, faces a tough primary.
They all might take the advice of Congressman Douglas Applegate of Ohio, who
is calling it quits after 17 years in Congress. 'It is time for younger
people to take the reins of government and lead us into the next century. I
would further suggest that other older members of Congress consider this, as
well,' he said.

FT  27 JAN 94 / Smugglers force Canada to cut cigarette taxes
</HEADLINE>

Canada's federal and Quebec governments have bowed to the commercial and
political costs of rampant cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border
and look set to reverse a tradition of ever-higher taxation on tobacco
products.
Both Quebec and Ottawa have promised to cut and perhaps even abolish the
high federal and provincial taxes which are widely blamed for the surge in
cigarette smuggling.
The problem is most acute in Quebec, where the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers Council estimates that about two-thirds of all cigarette sales
are contraband.
A group of Quebec convenience store owners, whose business has been ravaged
by smuggling, earlier this week flouted the law by setting up an illegal
market north of Montreal, where they sold cigarettes at the smuggled price
of CDollars 20 (Pounds 10.20) a carton, compared with the fully-taxed retail
price of CDollars 40-CDollars 46.
Governments have become increasingly concerned at the social and political
ramifications of smuggling. Much of the trade, which is centred on the St
Lawrence River and Indian reserves which straddle the US-Canada border, has
fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Some Indian communities have begun to manufacture their own cigarettes, and
contraband products are starting to find their way on to retailers' shelves
in counterfeit packaging.
The ready availability of cheap, smuggled cigarettes is also believed to
have boosted consumption. Contraband packs carry less prominent health
warnings.
Ottawa and the provinces have so far failed to agree on a co-ordinated tax
cut. Ontario, which collects CDollars 800m a year from tobacco taxes and is
struggling to contain a yawning budget deficit, is reluctant to forfeit a
sizeable source of revenue.
But the smuggling issue has gained a political dimension in Quebec, where
separatists argue that the francophone province could easily put a stop to
the trade if it had greater autonomy from Ottawa.
Tobacco manufacturers estimate that taxes on cigarettes will have to be
chopped by about two-thirds to compete with contraband goods.
They are also banking on a rise in US cigarette taxes within the next year
to narrow the price gap between the two countries.
