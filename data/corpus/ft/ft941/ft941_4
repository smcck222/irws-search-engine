FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows CGT indexation allowances for assets sold in February.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month you
bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale; the balance
is your taxable gain or loss. Say you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in
September 1985 and sold them in February 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying
the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.481 gives a total of
Pounds 8,886. Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 4,066, which is within the 1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
selling shares bought before April 6 1982, use the March 1982 figure. The
RPI in February was 142.1. It has not been possible to use indexation to
create, or increase, a loss for shares sold after November 29 1993.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors in Tinsley Robor finally have succumbed to the temptation to take
some very handsome profits. Three of them have been dripping stock on to the
market consistently over the past three months and, overall, they have
disposed of 355,000 shares at prices ranging from 20p to 29.5p.
Board members of the small printing and packaging group were heavy buyers of
their own stock in September 1992 and six months later, at which time the
shares remained near their low point of around 6p. Results for the year to
end-March are due in June, but the market clearly is confident that the
company will return to the black.
SelecTV is known best for such television programmes as Lovejoy and Birds of
a Feather but has had a high-profile boardroom dispute which kept the shares
under a cloud. Looking at their relative performance over the past year,
though, that period clearly is behind the company. Non-executive director
Peter Laister has sold 130,000 shares at 33.5p, leaving him with just under
25,000. Brokers expect profits in the year to March 1994 to surpass Pounds
1m, producing earnings of about 0.5p.
The estate agency business finally is responding to improved conditions in
the housing market. Hambro Countrywide, one of the market leaders, has
enjoyed a strong share price over the past year. Gerald Fitzjohn sold 25,000
at 73p, which still leaves him as the second largest shareholder on the
board with more than 400,000.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Warrants with a future - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you have a piece of paper that has, perhaps, been overlooked but which
might now be worth a significant sum? Warrants are easy to forget and are
misunderstood by a number of people - yet, their value can sometimes be
surprising.
My personal pension scheme has had a shareholding in a small investment
company, London Finance &amp; Investment, for some time. Last October, the
company gave its shareholders one warrant for every five shares held.
Each gave its holder the right to subscribe in cash for one share in London
Finance at 25p apiece within a certain specified period in any of the years
1996 to 2005 inclusive.
As the warrants were free, I simply made a note of their acquisition and did
not bother to track their progress. I assumed they would not be worth much
until London Finance's share price rose considerably.
Earlier this year, though, I was browsing through the share price pages on
the screen of the Market Eye financial information service. I noticed that
while London Finance shares were quoted at 29-31p, the warrants were 17-19p.
I was surprised they were worth so much because it meant people were
prepared to pay 17-19p just for the right to buy London Finance shares at
some time in the future for 25p each.
As I saw it, there were were two obvious explanations. The first was that
the warrant-holders hoped public expectations of the company's prospects
would enable them eventually to sell the warrants at a profit as their price
rose. The second was that they expected the shares to rise to more than
42-44p (the 17-19p warrant price plus 25p a share purchase price) in order
to make it attractive financially to exercise their warrant rights and take
up the new shares.
Issuing warrants has become increasingly popular, especially by companies
using them almost like a future-dated rights issue. They have proved
especially popular with investment trust companies; many new trusts include
warrants with their share capital when they are launched.
There are now more than 100 quoted trusts which have warrants, although each
trust differs in the terms for them. And, with trust warrants, investors can
keep track of their progress fairly easily as many are listed on the FT's
share price pages immediately under the trust's share price (which was not
the case with London Finance).
Although warrants confer the right to buy shares at a fixed price within a
set time period, there is no obligation on the holder to do so. Indeed, I
suspect a number of people simply consign their warrants to the attic.
They should, however, look again at their terms because they may have a
valuable asset. This is because warrants usually can be traded in their own
right; thus, an investor can keep his existing shareholding in a company and
sell all or some of his warrants.
Trading in warrants also has attracted investors who are interested in the
possibilities of making spectacular gains from being able to take an
interest in a company's shares for a relatively modest outlay - much less
than actually buying them.
Suppose a person bought 1,000 shares when these cost Pounds 1. If they rose
to Pounds 2, his Pounds 1,000 investment would be worth Pounds 2,000. But if
the company's warrants cost only 10p, an investor could acquire 10,000 for
the same initial outlay.
Suppose, then, that the warrant exercise price to buy further shares in the
company was 130p. When the shares reached Pounds 2, the warrant-holder would
not have to pay for more shares - he could sell his warrant rights via a
broker on the stock market, perhaps to someone prepared to pay 65p a
warrant.
The buyer could then either keep the warrants in the hope that the
underlying shares would rise still further, or exercise the rights and
acquire shares for less than the market price - that is, for 195p instead of
Pounds 2 because he had paid 65p for the warrants plus 130p to exercise the
rights. (It is worth noting that the price spreads between buying and
selling warrants often is greater than those between the buying and selling
prices of shares).
Meanwhile, the person who sold the warrants to him would have seen his
Pounds 1,000 investment in 10,000 warrants turn into Pounds 6,500 cash.
On the other hand, if the person who bought 1,000 shares for Pounds 1 saw
them plummet suddenly to, say, 70p, he could still sell them and get Pounds
700 of his Pounds 1,000 back (less dealing costs). In such circumstances,
the warrant-holder might find little interest in them - especially if their
expiry date was imminent - and could lose his entire Pounds 1,000 warrant
investment.
So, if you have been given warrants free, do not ignore them: they could be
valuable, either to keep so that you can eventually exercise their rights
yourself; or to sell, either now or at some time before they expire.
And if you want a speculative investment, then warrants are certainly worth
considering.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (8): How to avoid being a fashion victim -
Avril Groom chooses four catwalk themes that are wearable and that will not
look out of place in the average wardrobe / This spring's winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are a late and disorganised shopper, relax. The next time a smug
assistant tells you that the best styles have already sold out, have pity
for the early birds who bought them. They will have perused the trend
reports and made their decisions on immediate reactions to the clutter of
ideas thrown up by the catwalk shows.
You, by contrast, can sit back and see which ideas work in real life. These
are not necessarily the ones which cause the initial fuss. Choose from the
ideas that really sell and you will stay the right side of the fine line
that divides the fashionably smart from the fashion victim.
Only some ideas cross the divide between catwalk and closet. Each season
only a few themes influence the market and it can take the more conservative
outlets a year to join the bandwagon.
Here are this spring's winners, the four looks that update the wardrobe
without taking it to extremes, and which are wearable enough for the
commercial version to be very close to the catwalk one.
Fashion has rarely been so pared-down, simple and uncompromisingly modern.
Corresponding to this lack of detail, cut has never been so important. At
whichever price level you look, shape and fabric are overriding priorities.
THE SOFT SUIT
If you own a jacket with shoulderpads get them removed. Designers showed the
soft jacket with the short A-line skirt but it works equally well with wide
trousers or a long bias-cut skirt. With a short skirt, a long jacket gives a
graceful, flared silhouette; a short jacket cuts the outline in half. Look
for silk, floppy viscose, double chiffon, mixes with linen that maximise
softness and minimise creasing.
THE SLIP DRESS
A cheap slip dress risks looking like the nightie that some of them are. So
choose one with a structured bodice and, if in the lightest fabric, double
layers. Designers showed these tiny dresses one over the other, or over a
plain white vest. Come summer, it stands alone as a fetching evening or
sundress. Avoid grunge or schoolgirl caricatures.
NEUTRAL LAYERS
The look which Giorgio Armani has been promoting for years finally takes
off. This casual style is a new take on deconstructionism, in soft but
coarse-woven beige, cream or white, mixing textures, stripes and checks. The
ethnic mood means anything goes on lengths - tunics, jackets and waistcoats
hang one below the other, over baggy trousers or long sarong skirts.
Jewellery - big and ethnic this summer - will look right with these styles.
METALLICS
Space Age silver, which made catwalk headlines, has been embraced by the
young and can work, in small doses, for anyone. It provides a touch of the
unexpected - a counterpoint to tweed or pinstripe or, a la Chanel, shrouded
under chiffon. In the more obvious context of evening wear, metallics work
best as simple shapes and soft fabrics - pale gold or dulled silver chiffon,
organza or satin.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Now it's a floating gilt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government bond which pays a floating rate of interest might sound like a
contradiction in terms, but the Bank of England is to sell Pounds 2.5bn of
variable-rate, five-year gilts on Wednesday.
UK government bonds (gilts) are regarded as the best fixed-interest
instrument, allowing nervous investors to fix their income. So, how should
they regard a gilt paying a variable rate, reviewed every three months, and
with a yield which is fiendishly difficult to calculate?
The Bank says the issue is being aimed more at the wholesale markets than
private investors and, if the minimum bid is anything to go by, this
certainly seems the case; it has been raised from the usual Pounds 1,000 to
Pounds 50,000. Investors can, however, wait until after the auction and buy
in much smaller denominations from a broker.
The stock will pay interest gross, which will appeal to non-taxpayers, and
will be sold at auction for a discount at a minimum of Pounds 99.50 for
every Pounds 100 of stock. The interest rate will be set at  1/8 per cent
below the London Interbank bid rate. For the first period, this works out at
an annualised interest rate of 4.98 per cent gross to be paid on June 9.
The most competitive building society rates are paying well above this on
Pounds 50,000 and above (see Highest Rates table, page X) but the rate is
competitive for less than Pounds 5,000, although dealing costs will reduce
the real return.
There are no plans to make the stock available through the National Savings
Stock Register.
James Higgins, of the independent adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'For
the private investor, the simple answer is that the bond offers nothing that
a straightforward deposit - other than absolute security - does not. There
is no chance of an appreciable capital movement and the yield is, frankly,
not competitive.'
Jeremy Alford, investment director at gilts fund manager Whittingdale, has a
similar view. He says one concern for private investors will be the
liquidity of the stock; the last time the Bank issued a floating-rate bond
in 1979, demand was poor. 'If you think interest rates will fall further, as
we do, you are better off buying a conventional gilt,' adds Alford.
Attractive gilts he cites include the 6 per cent Treasury stock of August
1999 with a yield of about 6.6 per cent, and the 7 per cent of 2001 yielding
7.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, another instrument that usually operates only on a fixed rate has
made a variable-rate issue - permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). These
are issued by building societies and normally pay a fixed rate on interest
indefinitely, since they are irredeemable.
Last week, Cheshire building society became the first in the UK to issue
Pibs with a floating rate, although First National, the Irish building
society, launched a similar venture earlier in the month. The yield on the
Cheshire Pibs is set at 2.4 percentage points above the six-month London
Interbank offer rate, now yielding about 7.6 per cent. Minimum denomination
is Pounds 1,000.
Simon Mozley, assistant director at Hoare Govett, broker to the issue, says
'We have seen huge capital growth in Pibs until February this year but
prices have fallen since. A floating-rate Pibs will not vary in price as
much as one with a fixed rate, and so it offers greater capital security.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: A woman of account - Cavendish
Financial Management, 9th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Julie Lord, the managing director of Cardiff-based Cavendish Financial
Management, is the only Associate of the Institute of Financial Planning in
Wales, but the distinction has not encouraged her to rest on her
professional laurels.
She is now working for some tax qualifications and says: 'I believe you have
to keep studying to keep your brain alive in this business. There are IFAs
(independent financial advisers) who are doing the same sort of
product-based business they were doing 20 years ago. Their approach is
positively Jurassic.'
Lord claims that Cavendish is one of the few companies in south Wales that
is pioneering the idea of fee-based advice, and she argues that its success
shows people will pay for quality advice and service if they can see they
are getting value for money. 'It is the Marks and Spencer principle,' she
says. 'We consider that we give an extremely good service that is not
necessarily unique but is unusual.'
Lord founded Cavendish with her husband Andrew in 1991 after six years'
experience with a commission-only IFA firm. 'I saw things were changing and
that the sophisticated clients wanted more than a commission organisation
could give them,' she says. 'I began to think that we could offer something
more professional.'
While there is now a small branch office in Blackpool, Lord says there is
unlikely to be any further expansion. 'We have made a policy decision that
we don't want to build up another financial services empire based on sand.'
She insists that all clients make a will (she retains a local solicitor to
help, if necessary) and the firm's terms of business stipulate that clients
must inform it if their circumstances change. 'We can't possibly give proper
advice if clients don't tell us what is going on,' she argues.
Most of Cavendish's clients live in south Wales, over the English border in
Bristol, or along the M4 corridor. Half are business owners and company
directors, and many approach the firm after attending one of its regular
investment seminars. 'We thought these seemed a very sensible way to attract
people who were serious about their financial future,' Lord explains. 'Our
clients all have one thing in common: they recognise the value of structured
financial planning to help them achieve their goals.'
The seminar audiences invariably include a number of single, divorced and
widowed women. Lord thinks women are 'notoriously bad at organising their
financial affairs,' adding: 'They prefer to rely on their partners or on
large institutions. I try to persuade them they must do their own planning,
because no one else will.'
In her experience, however, financial incompetence is by no means confined
to women. 'There is a surprising number of totally naive professional
people,' she says. 'Some accountants are in a terrible mess with their
finances and some of our medical clients are hopeless.'
'Then there are people who say they want to retire at 55 and they haven't
started making pension contributions. It is almost like not being on the
right planet.'
The four advisers at Cavendish aim to provide comprehensive financial and
investment planning for private clients but the services are not confined to
the asset-rich. Lord says: 'Providing clients have income, they can have
absolutely no money whatsoever. We have clients who are literally just
starting off, while our wealthiest client probably has something like Pounds
2.8m.'
Fees are time-based. 'We have a time sheet and it is all logged into the
computer,' says Lord. 'The client has a notional account and we debit this
with the time we spend on them.' Hourly rates range from Pounds 20 to Pounds
125, and annual retainer fees for financial planning and investment clients
are Pounds 100 to Pounds 500.
Clients choose how to deal with any commission that arises. It can be
rebated to them, added to their investment, or offset against fees.
Lord describes most of the investment clients as loss-averse rather than
risk-averse; thus, any portfolio recommendations tend to err on the side of
caution. But while many clients like a modest flutter, she stresses:
'I will invest their money in riskier things only if I have done it myself.
If we feel we have made a mistake, I would rather cut out than expose
clients to further loss.'
The firm is equally robust in its dealings with financial institutions that
fail to deliver a proper service. 'Since we started, we have sacked two
insurance companies because of their atrocious administration,' she says.
Cavendish does not undertake discretionary management. 'Clients have to
agree to absolutely everything we do,' Lord says. 'It is far better for
them; then, they can keep control of things.' Clients are seen at least once
a year and the firm likes to meet their accountants and other professional
advisers, too.
Lord expects the disclosure of commission and new solvency requirements will
do much to change the face of the IFA market. 'I can't think of anything
more bizarre than an IFA who can't stay in business because of solvency,'
she adds. 'It is quite alarming; the requirement is only Pounds 10,000.
'I do think the IFA sector is going to get smaller. Unfortunately, this will
give clients less choice. But at least those advisers who are left will be
the genuine article - qualified, client-orientated, professional financial
planners.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (7): Newcomers go for ease and simplicity -
Young designers favour the daring baby doll dress / The new generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fashion may have been confusing recently but there's no denying its
vitality. And without vitality, quality fashion simply is not fashion. It is
just a uniform. And while that can be interesting in its own way, ultimately
it makes us jaded, restless, edgy with the need for change.
The early 1990s found fashion concreted into uniform; grunge shattered it;
and out of the rubble something new will be built. Exactly what is still in
doubt.
There are, however. plenty of suggestions. That is what all the fuss was
about this month at the Paris collections: a wealth of competing ideas, a
dazzling display of exciting new directions. Some will prove to be
cul-de-sacs but some will be the first steps on fashion's new route.
Some of the freshest ideas are coming from the stalwarts of the old guard,
such as Issey Miyake, Karl Lagerfeld, Vivienne Westwood, Jean-Paul Gaultier,
Valentino, John Galliano, Rei Kawakubo and Ann Demeulemeester.
But there is also a new generation of designers which, probably because the
fashion establishment is in a period of joyous experiment, are managing to
have their ideas taken into account as well. From their ambitious,
idealistic ranks, three designers and one design partnership stand out.
They all have essentially different styles, different points of view and
different customers in their sights but they are remarkably united in
believing that ease and simplicity are the keynotes for clothes this spring.
(But watch out for something entirely different next autumn.)
Ease and simplicity can be done many ways: from Paul Frith's deliberately
understated sophistication, through Maria Grachvogel's high glamour and Lisa
Johnson's playfully coy camp to Clements Ribeiro's sporty gamine.
Asked to select one outfit to sum up this fashion moment, none of them
hesitated. 'The baby doll dress,' says Paul Frith, 'because it is very
short, very feminine, sexy, young and very daring. It is a bit floaty so
there's a sort of innocence about it; that's the best sort of sexy dress. It
provokes the imagination, gets the mind working. The strappy effect is
important; I love the natural shoulder line, the fragility and vulnerability
of the curves and hollows made by the bones.'
Like most of this new generation of designers, Frith looks upon the clean,
youthful simplicity which is the mood for spring as a kind of psychic
clearing of the decks for action. It deliberately rejects the overly
structured, body-hugging styles which held sway throughout the late-1980s
and into this decade.
There was a jaded knowingness to those clothes which looks quite distasteful
now. It is also a decisive move away from 'deconstruction' and the grunge
look which so disconcerted women over 25. It is likely, however, given the
undeniably juvenile quality of this spring's definitive looks, that they
will remain disconcerted. In some cases, they should be.
Of her pink baby doll dress, Lisa Johnson says: 'It's fun, not serious and
sophisticated. I think things got overly complicated in the last few years.
There's a sense of relief at the simplicity of wearing just one garment.
This collection is very light and breezy. Call it breezy classicism.'
And although she is certain that the mini version is breeziest of all, Lisa
also makes her simple dresses in long versions. These should hold few
terrors for those old enough to buy a drink. 'You can wear a T-shirt or a
shirt underneath,' she says. 'It ties round the bust but nowhere else so it
is guite flattering and very comfortable.'
Maria Grachvogel, a self-taught designer who invented the complicated but
cunning construction of her body-enhancing slip-dress 10 years ago when she
was 14, says of it: 'It's simple and glamorous. What else should clothes be?
It's a dress which grows with you; it moulds itself to your shape and it's
kind to women of all sizes.'
She is hardly alone in her delight in the unadorned minimalism of the slip
dress. From designers such as Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein down, the
whole fashion industry is in love with it.
At smart parties in Milan, New York and London the most stylish women in
their slivers of silk or satin are
making the rest look over-dressed and middle-aged. Some are wearing just one
fluttering Klein slip, others layer two in contrasting colours, others layer
theirs over a silk T-shirt or organza blouse. Whichever way it is worn, it
looks modern and effortless.
'It is,' says Suzanne Clements, partner with her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, in
Clements Ribeiro, 'a matter of attitude, not age. I think everyone desires
some freshness and some subtlety in clothes now.'
Sleek, uncluttered, spare; that is the mood for summer. 'Clean-looking,'
says Inacio. 'Innocent,' says Frith. 'Timeless,' says Grachvogel.
'Uncomplicated,' says Johnson. Almost, one could add, puritanical in its
insistence on the simplest of shapes and the absence of accessories.
But not humourless: the young and lean of leg can wear the baby doll dresses
with Minnie Mouse heels and socks (Lisa's have a row of baby-bonnet pink
bows down the back) and the short shorts with clumpy Alpine-meadow-mowing
Birkenstock sandals.
If fashion is taking a breather from the obvious and complicated, it is just
keeping its powder dry for an autumn of richness, sensuousness and
complication.
Who says so? Frith: 'Very dark, lush, layered, contrasting lengths.'
Grachvogel: 'Aphrodite at the witching hour, baroque glamour.' Clements and
Ribeiro: 'Narnia, shades of monochrome, sparkly fabrics, bright colours,
little bonnets and fluffy muffs.' And Johnson: 'Cutesy, cutesy, very pretty,
lots of detail, very long and very short, lambskin, velvet, fluffy things
and silver metallic, vents and tucks and furry crowns.'
Furry crowns? Fluffy muffs? For this summer of simplicity, may we be truly
gateful.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Inchcape inches ahead after setback
 -The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion for updating analysts on trading could have taken something of a
dent after Inchcape's experience in January. When the international trading
group - which announces 1993 results on Monday - met stockbroking analysts,
some thought it had said nothing new of any great significance. But others
came away from the meeting bearish and cut their forecasts. In the following
days, the shares slumped nearly 70p from a high of 606p. Only recently have
they begun to recover.
All will be revealed in Monday's numbers. There is a wide range of
forecasts, although most close Inchcape watchers range from Pounds 265m to
Pounds 275m (up from Pounds 250.1m in 1992), excluding a Pounds 16m profit
on the sale of a minority stake in Toyota GB to Toyota. Inchcape told
analysts at the briefing that the second half had been similar to the first,
when profits rose from Pounds 117.1m to Pounds 130.9m in spite of a Pounds
12m higher interest charge.
Caradon, the building products group which last year bought RTZ's Pillar
business for Pounds 800m, is expected to show a slight rise in pre-tax
profits for 1993 - from Pounds 125.7m, to around Pounds 128m to Pounds 130m
 -when it reports full year results on Wednesday. But there also will be an
exceptional profit of Pounds 100m on the sale last year of the group's 25
per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, the packaging group.
On Tuesday, it is the turn of Taylor Woodrow, and analysts expect pre-tax
profits to have been between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m compared with a
re-stated loss of Pounds 94.5m for 1992, which included Pounds 51.5m of
property provisions.
Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile producer, reports on Thursday and is
expected to have increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 221.5m in 1992 to
Pounds 270m last year on a strong performance in Germany.
City analysts are looking for Pearson's pre-tax profits to increase from
Pounds 151m last year to between Pounds 201m and Pounds 215m for 1993 when
the media group's results for the year to December are announced on Monday.
The results could take some of the pressure off the share price, which has
dropped from a high this year of 735p to 615p, with a particularly sharp
drop in the past week. The share price fall does not seem to have been
caused by any event and trading volumes have been low.
Blenheim Group, the exhibition organiser whose shares have almost halved
over the past year, is expected to report profits of between Pounds 42m and
Pounds 45m for 1993 on Tuesday. That compares with profits of Pounds 49.7m
for the 16 months to December 1992.
Next, the UK fashion chain which has recovered strongly since running into
difficulties at the end of the 1980s, is expected on Tuesday to provide
further evidence of its resurgence with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 70m
for the year to January 31, up from Pounds 38.9m last time.
Next reported a very strong Christmas performance in January, with high
street sales up a total of 18 per cent in the second half-year, and mail
order sales through Next Directory up 9 per cent. Analysts are keen to hear
if that improving performance has been sustained since the year-end.
The dividend is expected to double from 2.5p to 5p.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Society axes fixed-rate offer - But
plenty remain to tempt home-buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market upheavals mean that fixed-rate mortgage offers do not have a long
shelf life at the moment. The Yorkshire building society withdrew a planned
range of six this week before it had even been launched. But there are still
a number around.
New rates from the Woolwich are 7.99 per cent fixed for five years, or 6.99
for two years. Arrangement fees are Pounds 295 and Pounds 225 respectively,
and the penalty for early redemption during the fixed period is six months'
interest on the former and three months' on the latter.
Loans are available as repayment, endowment, pension, Pep and re-mortgages,
up to 95 per cent of valuation (except for re-mortgages). Insurance is not
compulsory.
The Nationwide has fixed-rate offers for periods of two to 10 years, with
rates varying from 6.39 per cent over two years (6.29 for first-time
buyers), 6.99 fixed for three years, and 8.89 over 10 years for buyers with
a 15 per cent deposit; otherwise, for loans up to the usual limit of 95 per
cent of valuation, it is 8.99 per cent.
Early redemption penalties are between three and 10 months' interest.
Arrangement fees range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 300 (Pounds 95 for
first-time buyers).
Barclays is offering fixes over two, four and 10 years for existing
home-owners, with versions over two and four years for first-time buyers.
Rates are 6.25, 7.45 and 8.65 per cent, or 5.95 and 6.95 per cent for
first-timers. Purchase of a Barclays' life assurance policy is compulsory
for first-timers.
Booking and arrangement fees are from Pounds 200 to Pounds 400; Pounds 100
will be refunded to existing home-owners if they take out a life policy or
pension. Redemption fees are three to seven months' interest.
Halifax has five fixed rates over two to six years. They go from 6.25 per
cent over two years to 8.49 over six. There are cash incentives of Pounds
300 to Pounds 500 on completion, and arrangement fees are between Pounds 150
and Pounds 250.
National &amp; Provincial is holding its one and two-year fixed rates until
early next week, but has raised rates for fixes over three, four and five
year. The new rates for loans of up to 95 per cent of value are: 7.25 per
cent until February 1997, 7.50 until February 1998, and 7.95 until February
1999. For loans of up to 75 per cent of value, the rates are 6.95, 7.25 and
7.75 per cent respectively.
The maximum re-mortgage is 90 per cent of value. Arrangement fees are Pounds
250 and a free valuation is included, but buildings and contents insurance
has to be arranged through N&amp;P. Early redemption penalties range from 90 to
120 days. N&amp;P's one-year fix is at 3.25 per cent, or 3.95 per cent depending
on what proportion of the property's value is borrowed; the two-year rates
are 5.64 or 5.84 per cent, with the same conditions as above. There are
special offers for first-time buyers, too.
Mortgage broker John Charcol continues to offer a three-year fix at 6.99 per
cent for anyone wishing to borrow between 75 and 90 per cent of the value of
their homes. Re-mortgaging costs a fixed fee of Pounds 250, and Charcol will
pay all the costs for this except for early redemption penalties on earlier
fixed-rate mortgages. But the firm warns that the offer will be withdrawn
soon.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (5): Paris Pointers - A look ahead to
autumn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shows are held the world over but Paris always seems to produce the best,
the worst and the most extreme.
Prettiest collection: Valentino - youthful, charming but womanly. One of the
few older-generation designers with the right, light touch for now.
Ugliest collection: Lagerfeld - swathes of harshly colour-mixed stretch
nylon body-dresses do nothing to enhance wearable, well-cut jackets and
coats.
Most overworked collection: anything being filmed for Robert Altman's
forthcoming frock-horror film, notably Lacroix, Rykiel and Dior.
Over-elaborate clothes essential to prise attention away from the antics of
the cast who look less like fashion people than film stars.
Wittiest collection: a toss-up between Westwood, with her fur bikini and
derriere-concealing tartan 'curtain', and Issey Miyake's serious pleats worn
with hats made out of pasta, lampshades, dustbins etc.
Most influential collection: John Galliano's 18 outfits mixed Japanese style
with 1950s couture that could be the new direction designers are waiting
for.
Must-have accessory: the mineral-water holder made from Chanel gilt-chain
and leather straps, a fine example of old-style Lagerfeld wit.
Silliest accessory: a Chanel handbag in foot-long pastel fake fur, an
example of new-style Lagerfeld desperation.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (6): Main themes for autumn - A look ahead
to autumn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GIRLS: Short and sweet but no longer waiflike, there are womanly curves
under the naive fluted shapes. Good girls, bad girls, teddy girls.
DRESSES: The logical extension of summer's slip dresses, the autumn version
has a high waist, a short skirt and is in soft velvet or knit.
SHEEPSKIN: The acceptable face of fur to all but the purists - and more
aesthetically pleasing than manic day-glo shagpile, this season's choice
fake.
DRESSING GOWNS: The long wrap-and-tie coat hove into view last winter. Now
it comes richly adorned in velvet, brocade or quilting.
KIMONOS: Aiming to reverse recession-hit Japanese sales and mindful of China
as the next great market, designers are in love with Far Eastern shapes,
often used ingeniously.
SPORTSWEAR: From puffy ski jackets and minuscule skating skirts to runners'
go-faster stripes, this sports gear is for those whose fashion sense is
better-honed than their bodies.
HANKY POINTS: For those unwilling to commit themselves totally to short
skirts but unsure of the modishness of long, the ultimate bet-hedger. A nod
to the new length from the long-preferring avant-garde.
SOFT KNITS: The fuzzy outlines of angora, mohair or looped wool and cropped,
shrunken shapes take knitting to the opposite pole from the rugged
camouflage which the word 'sweater' often suggests.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (4): Loyalty to the label that reflects you
 -The autumn season is likely to be diverse but underlying themes still
emerge / A look ahead to autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the fashionably correct the label as status has been replaced by the
label as statement. In typical 1990s mode, the designers you pick next
autumn will reveal less about your bank balance than your personality.
This season the new trends are fudged, so the creators of fashion have
produced collections that concentrate, often in extreme form, on their
individual beliefs as designers.
Your loyalty will be to the label that best reflects your own fashion
ideals. If you love Comme des Garcons' cerebral folding, you may well
despise Versace's raunchy brashness. If you enjoy Lacroix's flamboyant
fabric mixes, Armani's cool minimalism may do nothing for you.
Even in such a diverse season underlying themes emerge, however hidden by
the designers' handwriting.
The spring collections' juvenilia proved to be the shock troops in a general
movement towards a light femininity younger in spirit than in reality.
For autumn skirts are indeed short, hems flippy and waists high. But these
components can as easily make clothes for women as for girls.
Tailoring, meanwhile, takes a tomboy turn, with long, slender drape jackets
and skinny trousers worn coltishly with high heels.
Bulkier clothes return, but always with a light touch. This started as fuzzy
little mohair sweaters warming up spring chiffon layers; for autumn it
blossoms into anything from risible shaggy gorilla-suit fake fur to wearable
soft sheepskin.
It is then a short step in designer minds to padding in all its forms -
Winter Olympics ski jackets, quilted dressing gowns, kimonos and Tibetan
wrap coats.
Vivienne Westwood's bustles may have been overstating the obvious but it
seems, thankfully, as if next winter it will be cherchez la femme rather
than la petite fille.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Trusts offer the best way in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
For most investors, the only practical way of investing in emerging markets
will be through a unit or investment trust, write Scheherazade Daneshkhu and
Bethan Hutton.
Arguably, unit trusts have a potential disadvantage compared with investment
trusts. Since a unit trust is an open-ended fund, the manager may find
himself having to sell holdings quickly to meet redemptions if performance
falters and investors want to liquidate their holdings. But this could be
tricky in emerging markets which are relatively illiquid.
Investment trusts do not have this problem. Instead, the trust might fall to
a deep discount if the fund or the countries in which it invests become
unpopular.
Unit trusts for the global emerging markets are to be found in the crowded
international equity growth sector. The top performer over three and five
years to March 1 is an emerging markets fund: Prosperity Emerging Markets.
This has returned growth of 293 per cent over the five-year period. City of
London Emerging Markets is another in the top four funds for the same
periods (HSW: offer to bid, net income re-invested).
Investors preferring an investment trust have seven general emerging market
funds to choose from: Abtrust, Beta, Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Govett,
Kleinwort, and Templeton. A few months ago, most were looking very
expensive, with shares standing at substantial premiums to net asset value.
But the reversals in many emerging markets, and a change in sentiment in the
UK, have made them more affordable.
Willing risk-takers may be interested in the handful of single country
funds, and regional funds for the Pacific rim and Latin America. But for
anyone preferring a more cautious approach, many emerging markets investment
and unit trusts have savings schemes which allow you to put in a fixed
monthly amount.
Nigel Sidebottom, a private client fund manager who specialises in
investment trusts with stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, picks Foreign &amp;
Colonial Emerging Markets as his favoured buy at the moment. This week's
assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate hit F&amp;C's share price,
like other funds with large exposures to that country, but Sidebottom says
this could be viewed as a buying opportunity for anybody prepared to sit out
short-term volatility.
The F&amp;C fund does not have a long record under its present name and
management. Formerly the New Frontiers Development trust, it started life as
a US venture capital fund before mutating into an emerging markets fund
under the management of Ivory &amp; Sime. F&amp;C took over the management only last
September but Sidebottom says he has confidence in the team, which has wide
experience in the various markets.
Templeton, a longer-established and extremely popular trust in the sector,
is raising new capital with a conversion share issue at present. Investments
in the Templeton fund grew by more than 270 per cent over the three years to
March 1 (source: HSW).
While such spectacular returns cannot be guaranteed for the future, the
fund's main manager, Mark Mobius, has a good track record.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Risks - but rewards, too - Avoid
emerging markets and you will lose out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Aztec fund is using shots of a nappy factory in Mexico City to plug
the solid merits of Latin American investment. Indeed, Mexico is seen widely
as one of the safest and most stable of the emerging stock markets. But even
Wall Street was shaken by the assassination on Wednesday of the country's
presidential candidate. Safety is a relative concept.
This year has been proving tough already for investors in emerging markets.
Most have jerked into reverse, with some spine-chilling individual
movements. Turkey, for instance, is less than half its level at the
beginning of the year. But while emerging markets are different and
dangerous, they are likely to be a permanent feature on the investment
scene. Anyone who avoids them entirely will lose out in the long term.
What are emerging markets?
No definitive list exists although there is a hard core of countries which
most investors would agree warrants the label. Some people include all
countries with economies that are relatively undeveloped but starting to
sprint. Others allow only those with markets mature enough to absorb - and
welcome - foreign investment.
Most of the hard-core countries are in south-east Asia (the Pacific rim) and
Latin America. India has just joined the list because political and economic
change has opened it recently to direct and indirect investment. Hong Kong
and Singapore, both relatively mature, are honorary members because
international investors have been using them as a proxy for China.
What is the background?
Economic growth in the developed countries was slowing, even before they
were pole-axed by the recession, and economists reckon the rapid expansion
in the other parts of the world is more than a temporary phenomenon. The
collapse of communism in eastern Europe, and China's lumbering re-birth,
have altered dramatically the balance of the world economy. Both the
economies and the stock markets of the developing countries are expected to
have a much larger chunk of the world total by the end of this century.
Investment managers in the developed countries, notably the US, are trying
to ensure that the funds they run share in the explosive growth of some of
these nascent economies. Stock markets in most of the countries are
relatively immature, but western investors have been pouring in money as
fast as the markets could absorb it.
Our chart shows how the flow accelerated in 1993. Many of the markets rose
almost vertically, and companies which had seemed bargains to western
investors began to look much pricier. So, the investing institutions ranged
ever wider.
When many of the Pacific rim stock markets had doubled, the institutions
switched their attentions to Latin America, long regarded as an also-ran in
the economic stakes. Last year, it hardly mattered which market you bought
or what individual stocks. This year, after a sharp setback in most markets,
investors need to be more selective.
Anxiety that China is overheating, despite endeavours to damp it down,
overshadow the Pacific markets that depend on it. And countries linked to
the dollar may have to pull in their own belts as US rates rise. But
investors need also to weigh up factors as disparate as stock market
liquidity and political stability. Emerging markets are not all equal.
Buying the right stocks will be important.
Is this a good time to buy?
Probably not. Securities firm BZW suggested last year that its clients
should have a relatively high investment in emerging markets. BZW is now
'neutral'.
One worry is that the tide of US money could ebb as rapidly as it flowed if
US interest rates become more attractive - or even in sheer funk. If this
were to happen, the impact on some markets could be dramatic. Prices would
tumble as rapidly as they rose, and investors might in many cases find it
hard to get their money out.
But that does not mean that anyone with money already in should get out. The
higher risk/reward profile of emerging markets makes them an even
longer-term investment than elsewhere. How to invest
Your long-term strategy should depend on who you are. If you are an
affluent, footloose expatriate with no local loyalties, you might have as
much as 20 per cent of your equity portfolio in emerging markets. If you
live in the UK, around 3 to 8 per cent is probably the most you should
consider. Indeed, anyone nearing retirement and who cannot afford high risk
should shun them altogether.
Direct investment in shares in emerging markets is not for the amateur. It
is, however, possible to buy shares in companies which do business with
emerging countries and should benefit from their growth. Infrastructure,
telecoms and power generation are a priority. So, buying shares in companies
such as GEC or Cable &amp; Wireless is an indirect way of joining the boom
without taking on the risks associated with the local stock market.
If you are investing through unit or investment trusts, the vehicle you
choose will affect the overall riskiness of your portfolio. Generally
speaking, global funds, which can invest anywhere in the world, should be
less risky than regional funds, and much less risky than single country
funds.
But what if you want to increase your risk/reward profile? A more
closely-targeted fund is one way. Another is to choose an investment trust
which uses borrowed money or to buy investment trust warrants. In both
cases, the market price of the security exaggerates movements in the asset
value of the underlying shares.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (3): Designers agree on crumpled look - The
discovery of a simple and unstructured style for the 1990s / For men this
summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not since the ubiquitous power suit and black polo neck of the 1980s have
menswear designers agreed so unanimously. This summer, natural creams and
beiges are the colour, linen is the cloth, crumpled is the texture and loose
and unstructured is the silhouette.
They say it takes about four years into a decade before the styles for which
it will be remembered come to the fore. If this is so, designers - having
spent the last few seasons in a state of confusion as they struggled to
understand and reflect the mood of the era - have finally discovered the
1990s.
And it would seem that fashionable '90s man will go down in history as
someone who appears to have bought his clothes at a bazaar while trekking in
India and has just slept rough in them.
Showing spring/summer '94 collections on the catwalks of Paris and Milan
last year, designers sent out unkempt models in outfits which, not long ago,
would have looked like abortive work by a drunken sewing machinist.
Primitivism is the desired effect and any tricky details which reveal
garments have been manufactured in state-of-the-art factories are banned in
favour of unstructured, simple clothes which could have been hand-made on a
Bengali peasant's loom.
Shirts have lost their collars and hang loose to mid-thigh under jackets
which themselves look over-size, often with Nehru collars.
Trousers are as fluid and baggy as pyjama pants and are often held up with a
draw-string belt or an elasticated waist. Neck scarves replace ties and
Jesus sandals are worn without socks.
Only the omnipresent waistcoat holds in the layers and gives some remnant of
shape to the torso. Informality has been taken to an unprecedented extreme
as high-priced clothes look well-worn and soap-washed at birth.
Items seem to be thrown together unselfconsciously, prompting the term
'accidental fashion'.
The message is clear, whether it comes from Katharine Hamnett, John Rocha,
Nicole Farhi, Issey Miyake, Dries van Noten, Yohji Yamamoto, Dolce e
Gabbana, Byblos, Cerruti, or Giorgio Armani: status dressing is out.
Contemporary man is sufficiently socially at ease to turn to those who toil
in the paddy fields for sartorial inspiration instead of wearing his wealth
on his sleeve.
Relaxed clothes with rural and ethnic workwear connotations send out the
signal that modern man is ecologically sound and aware of the world as a
global village. He is a free spirit, unharnessed from the stiff formality of
boxy tailoring.
That is the theory, anyway. Whether many men adopt the look in reality, is
another story. It could be as short-lived as grunge was. Unless men work in
the more Bohemian side of the media or the applied arts, they usually still
need to wear a conventional suit, shirt and tie for the office.
It is also debatable whether many men are prepared to spend designer label
prices for clothes that can only be worn on summer holidays or at weekends.
Deliberately creased linen may eliminate the need for regular ironing but
this bonus is countered by cleaning chores as cream and beige will show
every stain. And such overtly summery clothes could look foolish in
torrential rain.
On the other hand, most of the individual items of clothing are, in fact,
thoroughly wearable when taken out of the context of the catwalk, where they
have been excessively styled to make a bold statement.
For instance, with a cricket sweater, baggy cream trousers would look more
Brideshead Revisited than Krishna convert - a commercial, though less
imaginative look. The clothes are also incredibly comfortable due to their
fluidity and relaxed appearance. And one size fits virtually everyone.
The mainstream clothing industry seems convinced the linen look will have
mass appeal as high street stores from Marks and Spencer to Reiss, the
menswear chain, have taken their cue from the international catwalks.
Even Hackett, the gentleman's outfitter, has nodded its Sloaney Panama hat
to linen with the introduction, for the first time, of unstructured, unlined
jackets; albeit more parish priest than Buddhist convert.
In fact, enormous worldwide retail demand for linen has caused severe supply
problems. Flax production has an inflexible lead time - a year from the
farmer's decision to sow the crop to spinning stage. A sudden boom can
diminish stocks which then take a year to replenish.
John Rocha, British Designer of the Year, says: 'We have had great
difficulty ordering all the linen we need due to the shortage. Prices have
also shot up and we have had to cover the costs ourselves rather than pass
it on to the consumer.'
However, the over-saturation of linen could lead consumers to tire of it
quickly, especially as so many designers seem reluctant to corrupt its
naturalness with coloured dyes or treatments to eradicate creases. Wary of
this danger, most designers are offering alternatives, alongside the main
cream, linen story.
Jasper Conran, Paul Smith and Comme des Garcons, for instance, are offering
the antithesis of the unstructured look with a return to figure-hugging
tailoring, reminiscent of the sharp-suited mods of the 60s. Rei Kawakubo of
Comme de Garcons takes tailoring to an extreme with high-buttoned,
narrow-lapel jackets - as stiff and flat as cardboard cut-outs - paired with
slim permanent-press, school uniform-style trousers, cropped at the ankle
for the 'cool to be square' look.
Paul Smith revives skinhead fashions by making accessories of slim-legged,
ankle-length trousers with tight T-shirts, braces and bovver boots or
brothel creepers. Jasper Conran makes references to Carnaby Street mods with
a collection of lightweight, dapper, three-button or four-button suits.
Jigsaw presents knitted collared T-shirts with 60s go-fast stripe patterns.
Just as the conservative-dressing mods of the 60s co-existed with
dishevelled hippies, so the 90s equivalents complement each other today.
The world will always be full of men who strike a balance between a desire
to be fashionable and a need to be moderate in their dress. This summer,
London department stores such as Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Liberty are,
therefore, offering the unstructured, the tailored, and the clothes that
fall between the two extremes. Liberty, for example, is offering tailored
suits under its own label in sober navy and grey, priced Pounds 295. They
happen to be in slightly creased linen. That is true compromise.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Fixed rates: hurry while stocks last - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Short-termism is one of the curses of the investing classes. So, it is
doubly satisfactory to find a financial decision which makes sense on both a
short and a longer term argument - and trebly satisfactory when it is one
open to millions of ordinary people. For all we are talking about is an
ordinary fixed-rate mortgage.
Let us start with the short-term arguments. Fixed-rate mortgages became
popular more than a year ago as home-owners came up for air after several
years of sky-high loan rates.
Estimates are that half to three-quarters of all new mortgage business is at
fixed rates. And while interest rates hit the floor at the beginning of
February, even after their recent rise you can still get a mortgage fixed
for five years at around 7.5 to 8 per cent.
But hurry while stocks last. Prices of gilt-edged securities have been
tumbling rapidly in the past few days. Fixed-interest mortgage rates are
linked to gilt yields. Thus, some of the present mortgage offers could be
withdrawn soon.
Indeed, it is happening already. The Woolwich has altered its rates for
five-year fixed-rate mortgages twice in the past 10 days: from 6.95 to 7.45
per cent, and on up to 7.99 yesterday. (See page IV for more details of
existing offers).
While rates remain as low as 8 per cent, you have the pleasant anomaly that
you are paying much the same as you would for a variable-rate mortgage.
Fixed money normally costs more.
That is an argument that will appeal even to the deeply myopic. Far more
important is the outlook for interest rates over the next few years.
UBS Phillips and Drew, for instance, is expecting base rates virtually to
double to 10 per cent by the end of next year, which suggests that even
variable-rate mortgages could be back over the 11 per cent mark. So much for
the brave new non-inflationary world of the 1990s.
Of course, not everybody agrees with that estimate. But it is hard to find
anyone who thinks that interest rates can go significantly lower even this
year, and most agree that any further dip will be very short-lived. So, that
leaves very little to go for on the downside and lots of risk on the upside.
For new borrowers, the arguments in favour of a fixed rate are pretty
conclusive. They appear to be balanced more finely when it comes to trading
in your existing mortgage for one with a fixed rate.
Re-financing normally costs around Pounds 1,000 by the time you have paid
the clutch of different charges that keep the financial services salesmen so
sleek. Thus, rates need to rise to make the switch worthwhile. The higher
they rise, the sooner you will cover the switching costs.
But there is another deterrent to consider. Most fixed-rate mortgage lenders
have substantial penalties for borrowers who want to pay off their loans
early. So, fixing your mortgage too far ahead could prove almost as
expensive as failing to fix it at all.
The long-term arguments are more debatable and will not appeal to those who
enjoy the thrill of outwitting the markets. They come down to the old truism
that to finance a long-term asset with variable-rate money leaves you
vulnerable to the whims of the market.
Assuming your income is relatively stable, why not fix this main chunk of
your outgoings too? After all, around 250,000 people whose homes have been
repossessed can testify that the whims of the market can prove extremely
painful.
At this time of the year, the most unlikely people start asking for
financial advice. Even journalists. FT readers, being less feckless,
undoubtedly have done all their year-end tax planning already.
Our detailed advice was published on March 12. But for those of you who have
spent the past few weeks on Mars, here is a brief recap of some of the main
points to check before April 5.
Pre-paying fuel bills before VAT comes in on April 1. This is levied at 8
per cent initially, rising to 17.5 per cent in a year's time.
If you can afford the outlay, it makes sense to pay now for some of the fuel
you expect to use. Electricity, gas and oil companies all have arrangements
helping you to do so. (See Briefcase on Page X and Weekend FT, March 19).
Capital gains tax planning. This is going to be relevant to an unusually
large number of people this year, thanks to the strong rise in stock markets
over the past 12 months. The basic aim is to ensure you make full use of
your Pounds 5,800 tax-free allowance, since it cannot be carried forward.
(See CGT, Page VIII).
Personal equity plans (Peps). You can shield up to Pounds 9,000 of
investments from both income and gains tax each tax year. Administration
costs sometimes cancel out the income tax savings in the early years of a
Pep, and they are less use to people paying only the basic rate of tax. But,
longer term, the protection from CGT is well worth having. And if you have
investments already, a Pep is well worth considering. (Our survey was
published on February 26).
Making additional voluntary contributions to pension schemes. You need to
get your contributions in by April 5 if you want tax relief against your
income for 1993-94. If, however, you expect a pay rise which would take you
into a higher tax bracket next year, it could make sense to hold fire.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Kingfisher's muted song - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail lore has it that Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of the Kingfisher
retail group, even has a yacht called No Comment. A shy, diffident man, he
is an unlikely-seeming retail guru.
That role was thrust upon him, however, after his skilful piloting through
the 1980s' boom of what was then called Woolworth Holdings. And people
listened when he began talking about the need for a new retailing approach
in the low-growth 1990s, involving lowering margins to drive sales volumes
and increase market share.
Mulcahy's most recent coup was the Pounds 1bn takeover last year of Darty,
France's largest electrical retailer and one of Europe's best.
Unfortunately, the reluctant guru's 'halo has slipped', as one retail
analyst put it. By the time Kingfisher announced its results this week, its
shares - long star performers of the stores sector - had dropped 22 per cent
since a disappointing trading statement in January raised fears that
Kingfisher's Everyday Low Pricing (EDLP) strategy was not working. And since
the results on Wednesday, its shares have dropped a further 20p, closing at
550p yesterday.
That must be irksome for a company which produced a 51 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to January 29 from Pounds 204.8m to Pounds
309.3m. But the profits increase was largely down to a Pounds 79.2m
contribution from Darty, a rise in the contribution from the group's
property arm from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 43m, and a smaller than expected
interest charge of Pounds 7.6m.
Profits from UK retailing actually fell, with three of Kingfisher's four
main chains reporting a decline. Only B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, showed a narrow
increase. That is disappointing given that B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworth all
enjoyed increases in like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores. The
point is that as margins have been trimmed as part of the everyday low
pricing strategy, sales have increased - but not enough to compensate for
the gross margin sacrifice.
Sir Geoff insists EDLP is a long-term process and the sales volumes will
come through eventually. But, with Kingfisher's EDLP campaign now a year
old, City analysts are asking how long that might take and whether the group
has got the strategy right.
There were other reasons for the UK retail businesses' poor performance.
Woolworth was hit by an unexpected collapse in the video games and consoles
market. Superdrug was in the process of shifting its focus to personal care
products, moving away from household and grocery ranges.
Moreover, some retail experts say the City is being characteristically
short-sighted in expecting profits to shoot ahead as a result of
Kingfisher's new strategy. They say it takes time for consumers to get the
low-price message on the kind of infrequent purchases in which some of its
chains, particularly Comet, specialise.
Analysts counter that in high-street chains, such as Woolworth and
Superdrug, the benefits of EDLP should have come through more quickly.
There are reasons to retain faith in Kingfisher. Darty has been hit by the
downturn in the French economy, with sales and operating profits down, but
it increased its share of a declining market. When the French recovery
begins, the company should reap the benefits.
There is also more progress to be made in exploiting the synergies between
Darty and Comet, and bringing the latter chain up to the standards of the
former.
Looking further ahead, some analysts are enthusiastic about the prospects
for B&amp;Q Warehouses (previously called The Depot), the 100,000 sq ft DIY
giants Kingfisher is developing.
The benefits of these developments, like those of EDLP, will take time to
come through. Although Kingfisher's shares now look cheap, anyone
contemplating buying them may need large reserves of patience.
But, concluded one analyst yesterday: 'Kingfisher still has an excellent
track record of both earnings and share price growth. Shareholders might be
foolish to sell them at this level.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Why tea and sympathy won't do - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King Edward VII said of the man who gave London four Corner Houses serving
50m teas a year: 'I like Joseph Lyons because he feeds people well.'
Allied-Lyons, the caterer's heir, but more interested in booze than tea,
said on Thursday it was changing its name to Allied Domecq once it completes
its Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro Domecq Group, the Spanish drinks business.
Dropping the evocative Lyons name merits only a footnote in history yet it
coincided with a significant shift in perceptions about London markets. Many
investors who thought a little tea and sympathy would nurse the markets
through their seven-week malaise now subscribe to a gloomier prognosis.
A sharper rise in inflation and a bigger current account deficit than
forecast in the UK, coupled with a further hike in interest rates in the US,
hammered UK equities, gilts and sterling this week. Any residual hope of an
imminent UK interest rate cut now hinges on political expediency; the
economic rationale has largely evaporated.
In fact, the next move in interest rates might well be up, a growing number
of analysts believe. This would end the swooping decline from 15 per cent in
October, 1990, to 5.25 per cent today which had driven the stock market
rally.
Apart from feeble fillips on Tuesday and yesterday, equities retreated
rapidly. The FT-SE 100 index closed down a net 89.1 points, or 2.8 per cent,
on the week at 3,129.0. Gilts, ridden by interest rate worries, were the
main culprit.
The price of the long gilts future contract lost a further four points to
105, taking its decline since the beginning of the year to about 12 per
cent. The 10-year benchmark gilt price fell three points to 92. Sterling
weakened as well, taking its decline against the D-Mark to some 5 per cent
since January 1.
The disturbing inflation figure was the 0.6 per cent rise in the retail
price index during February, against forecasts of 0.4 per cent. The
underlying annual rise, minus mortgages, was 2.8 per cent, against forecasts
of 2.6 per cent.
The trade figures were, however, more damaging because of the export and
import trends they imply. The current account deficit grew to Pounds 2.6bn
in the fourth quarter of last year from Pounds 1.8bn in the third. Looking
at non-EU trade, imports grew by more than 1 per cent a month in the three
months to February to a record level while exports showed no growth over the
period.
Among the more trenchant analysts, UBS claimed its research showed that the
deficit could be double the official figure. 'If our suspicions about the
true external position are correct, Britain's recovery is built on sand more
friable and shifting than we had ever imagined.'
The UK's recovery, although the best in Europe, is lagging about a year
behind the US's. Yet, UK markets have fared far worse than New York markets
since the Federal Reserve Board first raised US interest rates seven weeks
ago and gave them another nudge up on Tuesday.
The US economy is growing rapidly with no signs of pricing pressures. The
Fed has tightened, however, as a pre-emptive move against inflation. The US
markets have accepted this. As the chart shows, bonds are stabilising and
equities have recovered from their post-tightening low in early March.
With UK markets deeply unsettled by the Fed and other factors, bond yields
have continued to rise and stocks to fall. Two factors at least are likely
to prolong this agony. First, the increasing doubts over inflation and
growth in the UK. Second, the Fed will be tightening more. It says it is
moving from an easy to a neutral monetary stance. If US inflation is jogging
along at about 2.5 to 3 per cent, that implies short-term US interest rates
could rise to around 4 or 5 per cent from 3.5 per cent currently. Given
London equities' reaction so far to rising rates, it is hard to imagine them
staging a rally.
While the equity markets had enough broad-based concerns as it was this past
week, five leading stocks added some specific headaches. Shares in Glaxo
fell 8.7 per cent, Wellcome 8.8 per cent, Allied-Lyons 7.8 per cent, Bowater
8.6 per cent, and Kingfisher 6.6 per cent.
Glaxo was hit by news of a competitive threat to its money-spinning Zantac
ulcer drug. A Ciba-Geigy subsidiary has applied for US approval for a
variant which would evade Glaxo's patent protection as early as next year.
Wellcome's interim results showed a marked slowdown in growth of sales
volume and a 16 per cent drop in the sales value of Retrovir, its Aids drug.
It also dropped development of a new anti-herpes compound. A 79 per cent
increase in interim dividend to 8.6p failed to halt the slide.
Bowater reported a 44 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds
212m and a 13 per cent increase in annual dividend to 12.55p. But it talked
of difficulties in European packaging and printing markets, leaving
investors feeling its defensive virtues in a recession were a liability in a
recovery.
Kingfisher turned in a 51 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to
Pounds 309m but a lot of that growth came from Darty, its French
acquisition. Operating profits from its UK retailing operations such as
Comet, Woolworths, B&amp;Q and Superdrug fell 3 per cent. Its new policy of
Every Day Low Pricing has yet to show through in profits.
As for Allied-Lyons, the combination of a Pounds 651m rights issue, the
Pounds 739m purchase of Domecq and the forecast of only a Pounds 10m
increase to Pounds 630m in pre-exceptional pre-tax profits for the year
ending this month left investors cool.
But perhaps they will warm to Domecq's virtues. After all, it has the first
and third largest brandy brands in the world, a far more potent product than
Mr Lyons' tea.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall's GM Card holders, who can earn points towards a rebate on a new
Vauxhall car or van, can also take part in a new scheme to benefit company
car drivers.
Any user/chooser who drives a Vauxhall, or is planning to switch to one,
will be able to swap points earned with spending on the card for vouchers
useable in some high-street shops. Points worth up to Pounds 500 can be
built up each year, for a total of up to Pounds 2,500 over five years. There
is a redemption fee of Pounds 15 every time points are swapped for vouchers.
However, this option is only available for company car drivers, unlike the
rival Ford Barclaycard, which gives all card holders the choice between a
rebate on a car or consumer goods and leisure breaks from a catalogue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Money continued to pour into unit trusts as savers deserted the building
societies last month. Net sales of unit trusts rose to Pounds 722.4m last
month, Pounds 530m of which was private investors' money, according to the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Meanwhile, the Building
Societies Association reported a net outflow of Pounds 404m in February.
Among the most popular unit trust sectors were the five Pep-qualifying UK
equity sectors, which attracted Pounds 335m between them, illustrating the
rush to use up Pep allowances before the tax year ends. International growth
funds were also popular. The unit trust industry had Pounds 98.9bn under
management at the end of February.
The marketing drive is set to continue as more funds are still looking to
pull in new money - see table on page X.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: A week to satisfy the gloomiest Jonahs - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising interest rates, fresh revelations in the Whitewater affair, an
assassination in Mexico and the threat of war between the two Koreas: this
week's news was bad enough to satisfy the gloomiest pessimist. No wonder
shares on Wall Street took a tumble.
Yet, the surprise was not that the Dow Jones industrial average fell 75
points in four days of trading. It was that share prices did not fall
further. After all, this is a bull market that has looked vulnerable ever
since the Federal Reserve reversed five years of policy in early February by
raising short-term interest rates from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent.
Just before the Fed acted, the Dow was flirting with 4,000 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's appeared headed inexorably for 500. Since then, the two indices
have not looked like getting near those landmarks again. Every time the
market has taken a step forward, something has sent it two steps back.
More often than not, that something has been another rise in bond yields.
These have been rising because, in spite of statistics and analysis which
suggest the contrary, investors in Treasury bonds are convinced that the
recent rapid pace of economic growth will eventually feed through into a
rate of higher inflation later this year. While stock market investors are
more sanguine about the inflationary threat, they have been unable to ignore
the depth of bond market concern, or the potential impact on equities.
Consequently, share prices have been stuck in limbo over the last two
months. Almost everyone agrees that since the Fed raised rates, stocks were
unlikely to be be heading much higher in the near future.
At the same time, there has been a growing apprehension on Wall Street that
the market was becoming increasingly susceptible to a big sell-off, the sort
that might be triggered by a nasty and unforeseen external shock.
Surely this week provided an ample supply of those? Yet, there are good
reasons why the markets ultimately handled them so well.
Taking take them one by one, the rise in interest rates was hardly
unexpected, although once again the exact timing of the move caught the
markets by surprise. On Tuesday, the Fed's Open Market Committee was in
session. But, contrary to the expectation that the FOMC would sanction a
rate increase, the Fed intervened in the bank lending market just before
midday to keep short-term interest rates at their old target of 3.25 per
cent. Analysts immediately said the action signalled no change in policy.
Yet, minutes later, the Fed announced it was, indeed, raising short-term
rates, from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The market reaction was
instantaneous - bond and stocks prices surged. It seemed a puzzling
response, but a second monetary policy tightening from the Fed had already
been priced into stocks and bonds, so the rush of buying was mostly an
expression of investors' relief that the dirty deed was done.
If the markets took the Fed rate increase in their stride, they were less
assured in their reaction to the latest developments in the Whitewater
affair. On Thursday, President Clinton announced he would hold an evening
press conference to counter some of the more serious allegations. But nerves
were further shaken when a leading Republican in Congress claimed he had new
evidence on Whitewater damaging to the president.
Ultimately, however, neither the president's briefing, nor the congressman's
supposedly damaging revelations, appeared to advance the story much further
and, by Friday morning, the markets had moved on.
As for the two international shocks of the week - the assassination of Luis
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, leading candidate in the upcoming Mexican
presidential election, and growing tensions on the Korean peninsula - were
disturbing, but were not enough to undermine investor sentiment seriously.
Of the two, Korea has the greater potential to disrupt sentiment in the
future, particularly if extra US military forces have to be sent to the
region. The situation in Mexico, however, created more initial problems for
US markets. Yet, while the death of Murrieta, coming so soon after the
peasant uprising in Chiapas, reinforced the image that Mexico was mired in a
phase of political instability, it did nothing to alter the economic and
investment fundamentals of the country.
Once the initial shock of the assassination passes, US markets should be
able to concentrate on more pressing concerns at home: inflation, rising
interest rates, and an economy that may be growing too fast for its own
good.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (2): From the catwalk to the sidewalk - The
designers' outrageous images have been interpreted by the high street
stores. Avril Groom gives a guide on what is fit to be worn / In the shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you steeled yourself for diaphanous mini-petticoats, St Trinian-style
gymslips, white shrouds or hipster trousers drooping to almost indecent
levels? Such images dominated the media after the spring catwalk shows last
October and they were quite enough to make even the clothes-conscious
renounce fashion for the foreseeable future. But fear not. The clothes which
have arrived in the shops are surprisingly wearable.
Two factors govern the shake-out between catwalk and clothes-rail. One is
that, on the principle of using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut, designers
put outrageous versions of their ideas on the catwalk in order to make
fashion as a whole evolve by a whisker. Back at their showrooms, where the
real business with buyers is done, the clothes look much more normal.
The other is that the percentage of women who wear designer clothes is small
and the real importance lies in the way the mass market accepts and
interprets such ideas.
With instant communications, fashion is now a global village and everyone,
from couturier to chainstore, is thinking on the same lines. The shows give
the high street both confirmation of its choices and added inspiration.
The fashion-forward end of the high street is often accused of ripping off
the creators. Yet few top designers mind - Karl Lagerfeld, for instance,
believes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
The young and experimental, unworried by the finer points of wearability,
certainly imitate - they dress to shock in style straight off the catwalk,
and good luck to them. Hold-up stockings and ankle-socks are already
established in the nation's nightclubs.
The more mature and circumspect find it easier to wear the wider fashion
industry's interpretations: companies translate ideas to their own identity
and rarely admit a direct debt to a designer. But, in modified form, the
origins are plain to see. Not everything takes off - the customer still has
the final say.
So here are the catwalk inspirations for spring. Watch the rails in your
high street to separate the front runners from the potential turkeys, with
help from our brief notes on who backs what.
The tiny dress
Schoolgirl-style from Dolce e Gabbana, Anna Sui and even Valentino. But as
Marks and Spencer points out, a summer basic. By itself, a sun-dress; or
layer it over a T-shirt; or, as Kookai suggests, over a long version. With
popsox and DMs, for teenagers. With lace-topped hold-ups by Aristoc, in the
bedroom.
The A-line mini
In 15-inch hipster form, thanks to Chanel, Versace and Donna Karan. Top Shop
has gone as far as a 13-inch bum-freezer but even Marks and Spencer is
trying 16 inches. Next has a more grown-up version 'with a smart jacket,
which is how the over-25s will wear it', as do Monix and Warehouse. Softer
pleated styles at French Connection, Warehouse and Agnes B.
Homespun naturals
Armani's and Calvin Klein's rough textured linens are everywhere. You will
be bored with beige before summer starts.
The unstructured trouser suit, collarless shirts, and layered oatmeal knits
are topically 'green' and good for the size 12-plus majority.
Pyjamas
Drawstring pants from Ralph Lauren, Issey Miyake and others are the best
option for non-mini wearers.
These could be worn with bare midriffs - most shops do crop-tops for the
firm of tum - but are easier with a loose shirt and man's vest or a long,
unstructured jacket.
White
From Miyake's airy silks to Montana's crisp, fluttery-pointed shirts,
everyone has white. Whistles has an all-white silk collection of easy
pieces.
Next includes easy tailoring in white and more feminine styles mixed with
denim, a la Gaultier. And it is mixed practically with black at Marks and
Spencer.
Metallics
Part of the deconstructionists' credo of using unexpected fabrics during the
day, has been made mainstream by Donna Karan and John Rocha.
Silver leather from Whistles and Oasis is softer in other fabrics - textured
metallic knits from Episode and Oasis, lurex and marl at Jigsaw, soft gold
suits at Monix, shiny silk at French Connection.
Neo-punk
This encompasses safety pins at Versace, bondage at Chanel, vests and
leather at Helmut Lang and Yohji Yamamoto, and is mixed with the ethnic look
and jewellery at Gaultier, the season's most uplifting collection. This is
more talked about than copied but is strong at the youth end. Jigsaw have
clean-lined hipster jeans and crinkled georgette tops. Some see it as
important for next winter. You have been warned.
Layers
Originated by Ann Demeulemeester, Martin Margiela and Rifat Ozbek, the
secret is mixing textures, styles and lengths. Top Shop call it 'attitude'
dressing, with unexpectedly individual mixes such as sports tops and floral
skirts. Principles and Episode do sophisticated colour-mixes of simple,
fluid pieces.
Grecian nights
From Chloe, Gigli and Comme des Garcons, comes the newest in evening wear,
draped, wrapped, high-waisted and bound with ribbon ties, sometimes
one-shouldered, and with banded, ringleted hair to match. Monix, Next and
Top Shop have halter-necked and draped styles, very short or very long,
mainly in white or black.
Ethnics
Gigli, Lacroix, Betty Jackson and Gaultier mix print, stripe and plain,
often with tunics, long jackets or bandeaus over narrow pants or long
sarongs. Wearable versions in linen and cheesecloth from French Connection,
spicy silks at Principles, Indian prints at Top Shop, spicy linens and
stripes at Jigsaw, crinkle and linen at M&amp;S.

FT  26 MAR 94 / The Long View: Doomsters' delight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the stock market tumbles a long way on a marginally disappointing
economic statistic, as it did on Wednesday afternoon following the inflation
figures, there must be a serious underlying malaise.
Last August, a fictitious guest contributor to this column called Dr Mort
Duhm set out a scenario in which the global bull market, based upon
unlimited and cheap (3 per cent) credit from the US Federal Reserve, would
unravel. 'Within the next few months, I anticipate a meltdown in which the
Fed will turn down the tap, hot money will panic out of bonds, and stock
prices will become value-based and not liquidity-driven,' he said.
Since the end of January, this sequence of events has indeed been unfolding.
This week, the Fed added the second quarter-point to short-term dollar rates
and there is no logical stopping place until we get to the 4 1/2 -5 per cent
range, at least. Long-dated bond yields have surged everywhere and, in the
US, Japan and the UK, are more than a percentage point above last year's
lows. We have seen repeated waves of so-called stop-loss selling as bonds
have been dumped at ever-lower prices. We may soon have to call this a bond
market crash.
The vulnerability of the equity markets has varied, however. We can deduce
that the speculative hedge funds took aggressive positions in emerging
markets and in certain European markets (especially the UK, 12 per cent off
its peak) but not in the US or Japan.
There are real Dr Duhms that I know about in the US, Germany and Hong Kong.
His closest equivalent in London is Stephen Wheeler, of broker Greig
Middleton. He says financial markets have seemed to have huge liquidity but
actually will be shown to be hugely illiquid.
New figures for the UK investment institutions shed some light on how the
global surge in liquidity affected the domestic markets in 1993. At the
beginning of the year, there were worries about how investors would be able
to cope with the demands being made upon them, especially by the government
 -which, in the event, sold Pounds 52bn of gilts, net of redemptions, in
1993 compared with Pounds 28bn the year before.
Yet, the huge volume of paper was actually absorbed very easily in 1993.
First, there was a surge of money into unit trusts, investment trusts and
the roughly equivalent lump sum products of life assurance companies. This
happened largely because the fall in short-term interest rates made savings
deposits less attractive. In the fourth quarter, the inflows into these
institutions, at Pounds 11.6bn, were 86 per cent higher than in the same
period of 1992.
Second, overseas investors were active on an unprecedented scale in the gilt
market, buying Pounds 14bn worth in 1993 compared with just Pounds 2.3bn in
1992. Domestic institutions actually slightly reduced their gilt purchases
and, instead, went on a spending spree in equities, buying Pounds 17bn of
shares in the UK and Pounds 10bn overseas.
You do not have to be a Dr Duhm to ask what will happen now if the
distressed foreigners stop buying - or, worse, turn sellers (they sold
Pounds 4bn of gilts in 1990, for instance) and create a black hole of, say,
Pounds 20bn in the flow of funds equations. Fortunately, the British
government might not need to sell more than about Pounds 35bn of gilts this
year. And the Bank of England is preparing already for the change of
conditions by switching its attention to the banks, which next week will be
offered Pounds 2.5bn of floating rate gilts.
But patching over the new-issue gap will not be a complete answer. This
year, the long-term sterling interest rate will be set primarily by domestic
investors, not by foreign hedge funds. There will also be consequences for
the short-term rates. Britain's balance of payments' deficit of Pounds
10.7bn was, in effect, financed in 1993 by foreign bond-buyers, but it is
likely that short-term hot money will need to be attracted instead this
year, perhaps by higher money market interest rates.
The international background could turn difficult. Warburg Securities has
calculated that American banks and individuals have invested Dollars 650bn
in dollar bonds since 1990. They look fully committed now. There have also
been substantial investments in European bonds. Although UK government
borrowing is beginning to fall, this is not true for European countries
generally.
Wheeler argues that the 1993 bond market boom was a bank-financed bubble,
much on the lines of the late 1980s property boom. Commercial property
yields in the UK fell to about 5.5 per cent in 1989, but soared to 8 per
cent by 1992 as the market crashed. More recently, yields have declined
again as the overhang of unsold and bankrupt property has been mopped up
gradually by long-term investors.
In the bond market, events could be expected to move much faster because
paper can be shuffled much more quickly than office blocks. In both cases,
the transition would be from a situation in which the market was dominated
by buyers seeking short-term capital gains, to one in which long-term
income-seekers set the level. They would find the money by selling other
assets, such as equities.
What might long-term UK interest rates rise to? Pension funds are the
largest group of UK institutions. Out of their roughly Pounds 450bn of
assets, only about Pounds 13bn at present are fixed-interest gilts. Pension
schemes need a rate of return of 4 or 5 per cent over prices to meet their
long-term objectives. At present, the inflation rate implied by the gap
between index-linked and fixed-interest yields is more than 4 per cent. So,
fund managers might be looking for 8 1/2 to 9 per cent yields. But other
buyers, such as insurance companies, may settle for a bit less, depending on
the inflation outlook. Already, long gilt yields are close to 8 per cent.
They are likely to overshoot, then bounce back.
In these conditions, the market can become hazardous. Dr Duhm could be
quietly enjoying himself, though.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Yes, it's true. I was a Cybervirgin: Christina Lamb lost her
computer virginity to an addictive system that may well be the electronic
sensation of the 1990s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On washing days, when I was young, a favourite game was to burrow inside the
sheets blowing on the line, close my eyes and spirit myself to some faraway
land of exotic foreign playmates.
Nowadays neither imagination nor wind-billowing sheets are necessary.
Instead, late at night when real-world friends are sleeping, I make a coffee
and sit at my desktop computer in Boston, US, to begin travels in the
virtual world which may take me anywhere from an aid organisation in Bombay
to a research station atop a volcano in Hawaii.
Across the globe, millions are engaged in heated on-line discussion of
everything from politics to Elvis sightings, swopping travel or business
tips, or even conducting love affairs with people they have never met. We
are users of Internet, the worldwide web of computer networks and electronic
message (E-mail) systems. Its proliferation looks set to be as important to
the 1990s as the spread of personal computers was to the 1980s and has
enormous social and political implications.
Since access opened to the public two years ago, an estimated 20m people
from 60 countries have subscribed to this peculiar world with its own
language, culture and rules of behaviour or 'netiquette'. According to
figures released in December, at the Internet World '93 conference, 150,000
or more log on each month. In the US no business card is complete without an
E-mail address.
In general users are not computer nerds or social misfits who prefer
communicating with a screen rather than a person. They are ordinary people
seeking electronic soul mates to meet on-line without barriers of racism,
sexism or age, without facing crime on the streets, and with whom they can
form a community to compensate for the fragmentation of family and society.
In The Virtual Community, Howard Rheingold writes of the phenomenon:
'Perhaps cyberspace is one of the informal public places where people can
rebuild aspects of the community lost when the small shop became an
out-of-town mall.'
While taking part in the world's largest ongoing conversation may make
people feel good and enable them to learn about other cultures and garner
information, the implications are far larger. A system that gives direct
access to an educated population equivalent to more than twice that of
Portugal and multiplying, clearly has tremendous political and commercial
potential.
Internet advocates believe its spread will boost grassroots participation in
public policy. Rheingold describes it as an electronic Agora, the
marketplace in Athenian democracy where citizens met to debate. President
Bill Clinton, the first head of state to go on-line, says increasing
electronic access between the public and the administration will revitalise
citizen-based democracy.
All White House press releases and proposals are fed into the system and the
administration aims to provide computers in libraries, town halls and
shopping malls from which people can vent their views. Vice-president Al
Gore has even held an Internet press conference.
Sitting at the keyboard and messaging the US President gives a sense of
empowerment which some find overwhelming. At the Computer Museum in Boston,
where an exhibit allows visitors to send E-mail to Bill, I watched one
voluble character rendered wordless at the keyboard, typing only 'Dear Mr
President, How are You? Geoffrey'. Of course, Clinton is not sitting at his
screen personally replying to the 1,000 E-mail messages he receives each day
but White House officials insist that everyone gets a reply 'after
appropriate consideration'.
Democrats are not the only ones to spot Internet's potential. The Republican
Party executive went on-line last month with an electronic newsletter and
instant rebuttals and counterproposals to Clinton speeches. Marty Connors,
director of the Exchange Foundation, a Republican think tank, has elaborated
a plan called Govern-Net to improve governance by enabling mayors in
different cities to swap ideas and giving people direct access to party
bosses.
He envisages Internet becoming an essential part of election strategy. 'I
see it as perhaps the political tool of the future - at least as important
as mailshots and 'phone campaigning. The idea of reaching households
directly with my message unfiltered is very attractive.' A council officer
in Sunnyvale California was elected after campaigning almost entirely on
Internet.
Others are less convinced of the benefits. Samuel Huntington, director of
the Olin Institute, at Harvard University, warns: 'We are in danger of
creating a two-class society - those who are part of the information
technology revolution and those who are not. Can you train a whole society
to be computer literate?'
For those with access to a computer and modem getting on to Internet is
fairly cheap - less than Dollars 20 (Pounds 13) a month for an hour a day in
Europe and North America. But it is about as user-friendly as the roads in
Birmingham's Spaghetti Junction and first steps in cyberspace can be
daunting. In his book The Whole Internet, Ed Kroll compares it to 'grabbing
a handful of Jello - the firmer your grasp the more oozes down your arm'.
Internet has three main uses. The first is E-mail - electronic messages that
are far cheaper than long-distance telephone calls and faster than the post
(or snail-mail as Net users call it). Second, it functions as a public
bulletin board on which one can read and post messages in 2,500 discussion
groups on everything from out-of-body experiences to the best way to clean
an aquarium. There are groups of subjects under eight main headings such as
'alt' for alternative, 'biz' for business, 'comp' for computer-related
matters and 'rec' for recreational activities. It is like being able to
wander into a series of pubs in which conversations are underway - except
this one never closes. Finally, Internet can be used to retrieve information
from distant locations. That day's Supreme Court rulings, the Encyclopaedia
Britannica and the complete works of Shakespeare are all on-line; satellite
weather maps or entire books can be downloaded in minutes.
The only way to start is to dig in. A cybervirgin, I had been impressed by a
cocktail encounter with a graduate student of economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He told me that he had posted questions from a
tough take-home exam on the Net and soon had economists the world over
working on the solutions, earning him top marks. So when my mother told me
she would like a CD for Christmas of Bach's Concerto for 2 Violins, I hit
the 'm' button late one night to mail a message into 'rec. music.
classical', asking for suggestions of the best recording. When I signed on
the next morning I had 40 suggestions - unfortunately all different.
Inspired by this success, I trailed through and found I could get all the
latest news from Latin America - where I lived until recently - follow
scandals in the beleaguered Conservative government back home in the UK or
read about the hottest jazz clubs in New York. For a while I was a passive
wanderer, enjoying other people's exchanges such as those in 'alt. fan.
british accent' where British users tried to explain to a man from Illinois
how his ancestors from Bedford would have pronounced words such as 'mirror'.
Another favourite is 'alt. good. morning' which tries to brighten the day.
Wednesday's mailings included a poem, a warning from a Finnish user not to
walk on the ice to catch fish, some lyrics from rock band The Cure and a
riddle about the number of people with more than two arms.
Growing more cyberhappy, I began posting, particularly after discovering the
intriguing 'alt. history. what if' group which discusses issues such as what
would have happened if the south had won the Civil War in the US. To
compensate for the absence of body language various conventions have
developed. Laughter is represented by :-) while :-( means the author got out
of bed the wrong side. Writing in capitals is the Net equivalent of
shouting.
Soon I was experiencing my first electronic pick-up line from an 'aspiring
actor in California wishing to discuss Arthurian legends'. It began: 'I am
6ft with curly golden hair and drive a red Corvette.' The Internet is full
of people hoping to discover E-mail love.
David Weinstein, a 32-year-old software designer from Boston, was using the
Net to keep up with developments in his business when he came across 'alt.
personals' - the electronic equivalent of pasting loveletters on a public
notice board.
He says: 'I was lonely and having difficulty meeting Jewish girls so I
placed some ads. It seemed very public so I made them anonymous. That didn't
work so I sent some stories about dating.'
His stories attracted the attention of Michele Schneiderman, a 29-year-old
teacher from Columbus, Ohio and, four months later, they were sharing a
cabin on a Caribbean cruise.
Not all E-mail love stories have happy endings. A notorious Frenchman posed
as a woman on-screen, carrying on a series of Net-romances before being
exposed.
For many their desktop screen has become a shoulder to cry on. Forums have
evolved for Aids and cancer sufferers, for those undergoing divorce and
victims of rape or abuse. One user told me: 'Internet saved my marriage by
being able to talk to others in the same situation'.
Another said: 'Internet is a drug. You can pour your heart out to people
you'll never meet . . . it's like a practice zone for real-life.'
The Net has tremendous practical uses. Teachers in remote areas can compare
lesson plans and academics can swap research findings. Diane Williams, of
the Technology In Education project at Harvard Graduate School, says:
'Through Internet I have been able to discuss ideas with colleagues in
Milan, Tasmania and London and get existing models which I can then adapt.'
She believes Internet will soon offer virtual classrooms for rural or
homebound students. Businessmen find it invaluable for comparing conditions
in China, exploring investment partners, swapping tips on office management
and even marketing products.
Describing Internet as the 'world's largest adhocracy', Oliver Strimpel,
executive director of the Computer Museum, says: 'We are seeing a
fundamental change in the nature and control of information.' Ironically,
for something so anarchic, its origins lie in military thinking. It was
developed as a communications network for the Pentagon able to withstand
nuclear attack. It has no central command and messages are chopped into
small packets of data, routed by the network then reassembled at their
destination.
If any part of the system is wiped out the message simply takes another
route. During the attempted putsch against Gorbachev in 1991 its Russian
counterpart Glasnet kept feeding information to the west and proved
impossible for the coup's perpetrators to block.
While this lack of any central hierarchy - there is no 'Internet Inc' - is
in some sense its glory, it also means there is no one to take
responsibility for abuses or the proliferation of pornography. This month a
Boston man was charged with abducting a young boy he is alleged to have
lured through Internet.
There is another concern. Cables which bring information into the home can
also take it out. Marc Rotenberg, of Washington-based Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, says: 'While Internet is a great opportunity we
are worried about the potential loss of privacy and the Orwellian spectre
that government could monitor all communication.' His organisation is
fighting US government proposals which would enable federal agencies to
wiretap the information infrastructure without needing court orders.
As the precursor of the interactive world of the much-heralded Information
Superhighway, it is not clear what the final shape of Internet will be. As
federal funding is phased out it will probably be privatised. But, with the
price of hardware tumbling and governments expected to force cable companies
to provide cheap access, the most lucrative profits are likely to accrue to
those feeding in material. A plethora of on-line services are springing up
involving publishers such as Rupert Murdoch, stores such as Sears Roebuck,
which see great potential for advertising their products, and
telecommunication giants and computer companies such as IBM and Apple. Many
newspapers are going on-line too - the San Jose Mercury, USA Today and the
Washington Post.
One warning before you go electronic globetrotting - it is highly addictive.
An advisable first reading is an E M Forster story The Machine Stops, which
paints a chilling picture of a world without human interaction, all
communications taking place through screens . . .
ACCESS TO INTERNET
Access to Internet through on-line services is becoming increasingly
competitive in north America and Europe. Prices vary depending on the amount
of usage and services offered. Some charge per hour on-line - others give
unlimited time. For an individual wanting basic services for about 20 hours
per month, expect to pay about Pounds 15 per month. Software is provided
free but signing on does require a modem which costs about Pounds 100.
Compuserve, one of the largest services, offers a one-month free trial.

FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (1): Armani is crowned king of the
designers - Have the catwalk shows gone crazy? Or are they leading the way
with their headline-grabbing collections. Weekend FT asked the professionals
how they rated the fashion world's leading lights. Avril Groom assesses the
results of our special survey / Fashion for all seasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Has the fashion industry lost touch with the real world? Bare nipples,
extraordinary designs and improbable frocks at the recent fashion shows for
the autumn collections suggest that it has.
Are the catwalk extravaganzas merely a chance to grab the headlines or is
something more interesting at work? The FT attempted to throw light on these
questions by asking a wide group of fashion professionals which of the top
designers are most creative, the most relevant to the real world of commerce
and which had the most staying power.
Our survey showed that those well rated for creative talent tended also to
score well for having commercial value, but there were revealing
differences, as there were between the scores given by fashion editors
compared with those by younger observers.
And despite charges that designers are guilty of excess, ugliness, and
decadent bids for publicity, our respondents gave the best designers
consistently high scores. This may reflect the fact that the Paris shows
were remarkably lively and well attended.
We surveyed the people closest to the catwalk circus, from top international
fashion editors to photographers. They were asked to rank each designer on a
scale of 0-5 in each of the three categories. The results are shown in the
table at the bottom of the page. We then averaged the scores in the
individual categories to create a fourth, overall, category.
The results were contrasted with the views of a group at the younger end of
fashion - students at the Central St Martins College of Art and Design.
The results show that the 1990s have brought a change in attitudes to
fashion but not necessarily a diminution of interest in it. The dictatorship
of the hemline was toppled long ago but in the late 1980s it was
consumer-led status seeking that determined which designer, or style, was
'in' or 'out'.
In the 1990s, individualism rules and the top-rated designers are those
whose originality is far more significant than season-to-season changes.
Cutting may be complex but the clothes are understated, allowing as much
freedom of expression as possible.
The recession has done much for the individualisation of fashion. Vivienne
Westwood for one is convinced that, with less to spend, women want clothes
that are 'very beautiful and individual enough to enhance the personality
without a date or a label'.
This is not to say that fashion no longer exists: it does and it can change
quickly.
Among fashion journalists, for example, current taste in the forward rows at
catwalk shows is for droopy, romantic layers and tailoring, mainly in black.
In the poll, the writers gave designers such as Ann Demeulemeester, Martin
Margiela and John Galliano high placings, reflecting this. Yet the more
influential among them are already wearing the new soft, short skirt. By
next season there could be rows of exposed knees.
Two names share the top positions in the FT survey's four categories:
Giorgio Armani is voted top overall, for commercial success, and for
long-term influence on the way in which 'ordinary women' dress; Vivienne
Westwood comes top for creativity.
Unlikely as it seems, these designers are two sides of the same
individualist coin. Armani's designs are never extreme and his success (140
shops, a dozen ranges at different price-levels, Pounds 450m global
turnover, a jet-set lifestyle and a Milanese palazzo) is based on
wearability and desirability. But his understated tailoring and cool colours
are designed to let the persona take over.
'Fashion is not about satisfying the aesthetic whims of a designer,' he
says, 'but about interpreting the desires of the person who is going to wear
it. Only this gives fashion a social role and credibility.' And he has never
forgotten how to flatter.
At the cutting edge, Westwood's purpose is to be extremely individual, to
jolt fashion into new directions. The rest follow where she leads, though,
like a giant liner, the industry takes a long time to turn. And she has
suffered the fate of many British inventors, as others popularise and profit
from her ideas. She still cycles around London but her Pounds 3m-plus
turnover is increasing by 40 per cent a year.
Westwood is quite clear on her position as a creator. This is to fly in the
face of the 'so-called experts who think they know what the public want.
'In fashion this has created uniformity and disillusionment, so now there is
a craving for originality.'
She claims never to have underestimated the public. 'With no backer and just
a small shop I had great freedom and I found that however unusual a design
was, someone would buy it as long as it was beautiful. To be creative you
first need technique, to cut in the best, simplest way that makes the cloth
give expression to the body.'
Other highly-regarded designers would share this concern for cut before
commerce. Second overall is Jean-Paul Gaultier, the former enfant terrible
best-known for Madonna's conical corsets but also a producer of lyrically
ethnic collections. A master of individualism who pioneered showing clothes
on non-professional models, his high commercial placing reflects his astute
marketing of this approach in the current climate.
Next come the Japanese trio of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des
Garcons who were already rugged individualists in the era of power dressing,
when they were labelled 'avant-garde' and seen as somewhat impenetrable. Now
Yamamoto, the most uncompromising of the three for the female figure but
also the most understated, points the way ahead for the new generation,
voted top by students and all under-30s.
Pushing up from below are the rising stars, all minimalist and/or
individualist - Belgian deconstructionists Martin Margiela and Ann
Demeulemeester, Italian fabric innovator Romeo Gigli, the German Jil Sander
whose immaculate suits give her a high commercial rating, and British
near-couturier John Galliano.
All this squeezes establishment designers into mediocre positions, despite
high commercial ratings. The biggest indictment of older designers'
inability to adjust is Karl Lagerfeld's 11th position for creativity, though
fashion editors acknowledge the debt to his ideas by placing him second
overall.
Other ways of analysing the data show the divisions even more clearly. The
young eschew designers of conventionally glamorous clothes, preferring the
makers of plain, deconstructed shapes which rely on the wearer for their
allure.
This may give a clue to the reasons behind the fashion show debate. Most of
those commenting are mature. A majority is male.
For them, fashion really is the shock of the new. It appears strange because
the premises on which it based, such as the cerebral approach of the
Japanese, or the Belgians' interest in recycling and vintage clothes, are
very different from the priorities of the established design-ers.
The professionals and fashion students look beyond this. They know that no
one will wear Westwood's bare breasts and bustles but that by next autumn
her womanly silhouette of puffed shoulders and wider hips will have
superseded waifdom as the real world's fashion icon.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Rescue prompts hopes of thaw with Malaysia: PM gives
Mahathir 'warm thanks' after missing soldiers found safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful Malaysian search for five British soldiers missing in Borneo
prompted renewed hopes yesterday of a thaw in Britain's frosty relations
with Kuala Lumpur.
After weeks of sharp exchanges over Malaysia's Pergau dam project, the
search provided a rare opportunity for non-controversial contact between the
two governments.
Mr John Major used the opportunity to write to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister, expressing 'warm personal thanks'.
Mr Major's aides refused to release the text of the letter, which was said
to be a personal communication between the two prime ministers.
However, officials said it was intended to leave Dr Mahathir in no doubt
that Britain was highly impressed by the 'tremendous' performance of the
Malaysian armed forces.
The five missing soldiers were located on isolated Mount Kinabalu in the
Malaysian province of Sabah after a two-week search. Malaysia used
helicopters, troops, park rangers and local residents in the search for the
men, who had been on a climbing expedition.
Senior officials said Mr Major's letter of thanks did not refer directly to
the dispute over British press reports about the controversial Pergau dam
project.
Malaysia decided four weeks ago to withhold future government contracts from
UK companies because of press reports of alleged bribes offered to Malaysian
politicians.
The Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating the project,
has also heard allegations of a link between Pounds 234m in loans to
Malaysia and a Pounds 1bn arms contract.
Dr Mahathir insisted in a letter to the Financial Times last week that there
would be no change of policy. 'The die is cast,' he wrote.
However, the impression that Downing Street remains hopeful of a diplomatic
thaw was increased by the disclosure that Britain has not pursued
suggestions that the European Union is prepared to retaliate against
Malaysia.
The EU, which has sole competence in trade matters under the Treaty of Rome,
is understood to be willing to consider reciprocal action if Malaysia
refuses to back down.
Downing Street said the dispute had not been discussed with the EU.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Capel to break with past and make markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Capel, the UK stockbroker, is to make its first foray into equities
marketmaking, specialising in the shares of its own smaller corporate
clients which complain that their stock cannot be easily traded.
The move is a sharp reversal of policy for Capel, which said at the time of
the Big Bang deregulation in the City in 1986 that it would not both make
markets and also act as a broker for investors because of the potential
conflict of interest that this would involve.
Its latest decision follows the withdrawal by many UK stockbrokers from
marketmaking during the recession after they incurred heavy losses.
Marketmakers are professionals who offer to buy and sell companies' shares,
even in volatile market conditions.
Mr Bob Benton, Capel's managing director, said the firm, a division of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, was responding to the needs of
its clients who had seen liquidity in their shares dry up.
'There have been instances where we have had to ask a favour from another
marketmaker on behalf of one of our corporate clients,' Mr Benton said.
Following the liquidity problems, the London Stock Exchange announced plans
last year to close its Unlisted Securities Market where many small company
shares are traded. James Capel will only make markets in the shares of
companies that are not included in the FT-SE 100 index of largest companies.
Moreover, all but about 10 of its 69 corporate clients are too small to be
included among the 350 biggest companies traded on the London Stock
Exchange, which account for 90 per cent of the total value of all listed
companies.
Mr Benton said that, for now, James Capel had decided not to extend its
marketmaking capacity beyond its own smaller clients. However, the advent of
Crest in early 1996, the proposed system for paperless share settlement
could prompt the firm to reconsider its stance.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Boost for building societies from fuel payment windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Windfall funds received by some regional electricity companies from
customers seeking to avoid value added tax are to be deposited in building
societies.
The utilities hope the move will deflect criticism that mortgage rates could
be driven up as householders draw heavily from their societies to pay power
bills in advance. Bills paid before next Thursday will not be liable to VAT.
Seeboard, based in Hove, which has received Pounds 51m in the last few days,
said yesterday it was aware of a heavy outflow from the societies as
householders sought to beat the VAT deadline.
Southern Electric, which has taken in Pounds 48m from customers, will also
redeposit a portion of these funds, as will Midlands Electricity, according
to Mr Peter Chapman, its finance director.
The Building Societies Association has reported heavy withdrawals from
members this month. It attributed this largely to householders trying to
avoid VAT. From April 1 home fuel bills will be subject to 8 per cent VAT.
Next year, the rate will be 17.5 per cent.
By last night, householders had paid in more than Pounds 400m, depriving the
Treasury of about Pounds 40m in tax revenues. But the money is still flowing
in, and most electricity companies said they would accept last-minute
payments, provided they were made at their shops and offices.
However, it emerged yesterday that British Gas passed over an opportunity to
save its 18.5m domestic customers part of the new tax.
Earlier this year Customs and Excise allowed British Gas to assume, when
next billing its customers, that they used 2.5 units of gas each day before
April 1 for every one after that date, reflecting the fact that the earlier
part of the billing period was colder. But British Gas will count all days
the same.
The Gas Consumers Council estimated this would cost customers Pounds 23m in
extra tax in the two-year transition to full VAT, and accused the company of
'meanly taking the easy way out'.
British Gas confirmed that Customs had allowed the more generous weighting,
but said it had come too late to be included in its preparations for the
changeover to VAT.
The GCC advised householders to read their meters on March 31 to ensure that
VAT would not be charged on gas used before then.

FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Including purchases made this week, Eastern Electricity has now bought back
around 3 per cent of its own shares. That shows a certain confidence in the
future, despite the recent nerves of the market. It also shrugs off the
uncertainty surrounding the review of regional electricity companies
currently being conducted by Offer, the industry regulator.
Eastern's confidence looks well placed. The Recs' shares have fallen in
response to weakness in the gilt market, yet valuing Recs as quasi-fixed
interest stocks is a mistake. Real dividend growth will be at least 15 per
cent over the next two years. And as Offer's review seems to be running
along pragmatic lines, a deal may emerge which inflicts sufficient financial
pain on the Recs to appease the critics, yet is insufficient to tempt any of
the companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That would
still leave real dividend growth of 7 to 8 per cent until the end of the
decade.
There is also plenty of hidden value waiting to be unearthed. Demerger of
the National Grid is only a matter of time. Many of the Recs are now
completely ungeared, yet the review may well leave the companies generating
cash. Predators, particularly those with an advance corporation tax problem,
may well be tempted to buy a Rec once the review is over. Much of the
purchase price could be funded by injecting debt into the Rec or issuing
long term bonds, secured on the Recs cash flows or assets. Some Recs will
substantially reform their own capital structures to avoid such a fate. But
either way, shareholders can only benefit. A canny bidder would act now,
before prices rise.

FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slow Chinese burn being applied by the Federal Reserve to the American
economy is causing plenty of pain in the US Treasury bond market. Yields are
now touching 7 per cent, almost 1.5 percentage points above their autumn
lows. Some blame the gradualist quarter point interest rate rises inflicted
by the Fed for drawing out the agony. Yet what has caused the retreat is
perceptions of future short term interest rates. Forward markets imply that
US rates will have doubled to around 6 per cent by the end of next year.
If that happened, bond yields could not remain as low as 7 per cent. But
then, it could be that it is expectations which have got out of kilter. The
Fed may have good reasons for operating on the economy with a scalpel rather
than a mallet. The surge in growth in the second half of last year came
partly because consumers ran down savings. Unless those savings are replaced
by rapidly rising incomes, that growth will be a one-off effect. The surge
in housing construction and business investment may also end if growth
starts to slow.
Since the objective is to restrain growth to a sustainable rate, the Fed
will also have an eye to the political risks of dumping the economy into
recession in the run up to the next presidential election. Slow rises in
interest rates may thus continue. They may even be enough. The bond market
will remain sensitive to the inflation threat, but if growth moderates,
those interest rate expectations look overdone.

FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keeping track of the challenges to Zantac, Glaxo's big-selling ulcer drug,
is turning into a full-time job. Judging by the 10 per cent fall of the
shares this week, the market is taking the latest threat - from Geneva
Pharmaceuticals of the US - seriously. Geneva's claim to be able to
manufacture the active ingredient of Zantac without falling foul of Glaxo's
patents has some credibility. Whether it can also convince the US regulators
to approve its new product without years of clinical trials is impossible to
judge.
Since Zantac's US sales amounted to Dollars 2bn last year, though, there
must be a slim chance of a serious setback for Glaxo. The more imminent
danger is posed by the expiry in May of the US patent covering Tagamet,
SmithKline Beecham's rival ulcer treatment. generic versions of Tagamet will
tempt the new breed of cost-conscious US healthcare providers either to
switch from Zantac altogether or to demand a lower price. There must be a
fair chance that Glaxo's rate of growth is about to slow.
Until the outlook is clearer, it is hard to see the shares forging ahead.
Glaxo has already underperformed the UK market by 50 per cent since its peak
early in 1992. But that is par for the course among drugs companies. Merck
has underperformed Wall Street by almost exactly the same percentage over
that time. The wider squeeze on margins is the underlying cause of this
malaise. How much Glaxo's customers are prepared to pay for Zantac will be
an acid test.

FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Return to value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the FT-SE 100 index now 11 per cent below the peak reached in early
February, equities no longer look overvalued judged on their own merits. A
market multiple of around 14 times this year's forecast earnings, and a
prospective yield comfortably above 4 per cent, might start to tempt fund
managers with an eye to value. Many UK institutions certainly remained aloof
as equities scaled dizzy heights through the winter. Thus pension funds sold
equities to the tune of Pounds 1.7bn in the fourth quarter of last year,
reinvesting the proceeds in short-term bonds and cash.
Since there is little joy in holding cash at current interest rates, some of
that might now seep back into shares. The market's steady slide in February
did nothing to halt the flight of private investors from the dwindling
returns on cash. Unit trust sales of Pounds 722m were notably higher than
the previous month. If that pattern continues, and the flow of new funds
into institutional coffers this year does not disappoint, UK equities should
be able to count on a solid base of support.
Yet the punishment meted out this week to companies which disappointed on
earnings - the 8 per cent fall in Wellcome's shares on Thursday was a case
in point - suggests institutions are still reluctant to commit themselves.
The nervous state of world bond markets might be to blame. While the
fundamentals point to some upside for equities, it is hard to see how the
market can flourish until equilibrium is restored in bonds.

FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides for second
consecutive day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices went into steep decline for a second straight session
yesterday after the yield on the benchmark US Treasury bond climbed above 7
per cent for the first time in 10 months, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 46.36 lower at 3,774.73, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.77 at 460.58. NYSE
volume, at 249m shares, was moderate. Declining issues outnumbered advances,
1,188 to 845.
However, the secondary markets held up better than the NYSE, in contrast to
the previous session, when all leading indices showed big losses. The
American SE composite slipped 1.23 to 468.43, and the Nasdaq composite shed
3.23 to 783.45.
After Thursday's heated session, which brought a 48-point plunge in the
bellwether blue-chip index, yesterday's session began on a subdued note.
Investors had only one shred of economic news to guide sentiment - a 9.9 per
cent decline in February sales of existing homes - but the distorting effect
of last month's bad weather mitigated any negative implications suggested by
the data. EP) More important for stocks, the report failed to stir the US
Treasury market, which drifted lower amid continued uncertainty generated by
the assassination on Wednesday of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Mexican
presidential candidate.
But in the afternoon the sell-off in bonds intensified. Near 3.30pm the
yield bid on the benchmark 30-year government issue finally breached the 7
per cent level, an important psychological barrier.
Traders could not identify a single reason for the fresh slide, but instead
pinned the blame on a variety of factors, including inflationary fears and
political concerns, which have been driving prices down and yields up in
recent weeks.
The impact on blue-chip stocks, however, was never in doubt. Share prices
lurched downward after trading modestly lower for most of the session. Among
the Dow components, Alcoa dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 1/4 , Bethlehem
Steel lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 , International Paper shed
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 and General Electric Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 102 1/8 .
Automobile issues were down sharply. General Motors backtracked Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 , Ford Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 and Chrysler
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 . UAL, the parent of United Airlines, jumped
Dollars 7 3/4 to Dollars 131 1/2 after completing an agreement to sell a
majority stake in the company to its employees.
But International Business Machines was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
54 after a turnround strategy drew mixed reviews from investors.
Canada
Stocks were down sharply in active trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell
41.36 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 4,528.29, a loss on the week of about 39
points.
The tumble was blamed on the major banks' first rise in prime rates since
last August.
Mexico
Equities fell, as expected, with the resumption of trading following the
assassination on Wednesday of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading
presidential candidate, but finished with a surprising recovery. The IPC
index ended down 22.79 points, or only 0.90 per cent, at 2,520.78.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed up 6 per cent in moderate trade, boosted by strong buying
of major state blue chips tied to speculation on whether or not Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, minister of the economy, would run for president. The
Bovespa index was 825 higher at 14,591.

FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Hard-hit bank sector leads Zurich lower
 -US rate rises have hit confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The correction is over in the Swiss stock market - at least for now. That is
the consensus among analysts who watched the market lose 10 per cent of its
value last month before rebounding slightly early in March.
But there is not much confidence in an early or strong rally, which is
hardly surprising considering the scale of the recent damage to some the
leading shares.
The three big banks have been particularly hard hit. Following the old maxim
that wise investors buy on speculation and sell on the news, shares of all
three responded to the publication in the past few weeks of spectacular 1993
profit rises by heading decisively downwards.
Union Bank of Switzerland bearers were stuck at SFr1,204 yesterday, some 20
per cent below their 1994 high. CS Holding bearers at SFr647, have shed 15
per cent since their January peak.
This week, the main indices have been making only tentative moves in both
directions. Yesterday, the SMI index of 18 leading shares ended at 2,831.8,
little changed from the 2,843.5 point at the previous week's close. The
all-share SPI at 1,823.1 was likewise not far from last week's 1,831.5
close.
Analysts take some comfort from the observation that both the correction and
the current nervous mood derive largely from the recent US interest rate
hikes, whereas the interest rate trend in Europe remains downward. Inflation
in Switzerland, for example, is widely expected to sink under 1 per cent
later this year.
For some, the correction brings a welcome change from the frenzied mood of
two months ago. 'We are back to the long term trend,' says Mr Beat Philipp,
head of equity research at Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich, although he and
others do not rule out the possibility of further tests of the resilience of
the market in the next couple of months.
Then they see the market advancing well in the second half, especially if US
interest rate rises do not encourage US investors to repatriate funds.
The problem for the Swiss market at the moment is that it is primarily
composed of financial and defensive stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and food
issues. During the past two years, when interest rates and economic
performance were declining in most industrialised countries, this
composition served very well.
But with both the interest rate and economic cycles at or near their turning
points, investors' attention has turned decisively to cyclical shares, and
there the Swiss market is rather thinly represented.
Most international portfolio managers have already reduced their Swiss
weighting and others have helped bid up the few truly liquid Swiss cyclical
shares to impressive levels.
Bearer shares of Brown Boveri, the Swiss share representing the ABB Asea
Brown Boveri power engineering group, are up 10 per cent since the beginning
of the year and trading at around 20 times estimated 1994 earnings.
Bearers of Sulzer, the engineering and medical equipment group, are up 20
per cent this year and trading at about 16 times estimated 1994 earnings.
Alusuisse-Lonza, the aluminium and packaging group,is a current favourite
with many analysts. Its shares are up fractionally this year after a good
run late last year, and are trading at perhaps 22 times current year
earnings.
Still, these are the shares that many Swiss analysts have on their
recommendation lists. 'Every correction is a splendid opportunity to buy,'
says Mr Bernhard Tschanz of Credit Suisse in Zurich. He believes that
overall corporate earnings will be up a sparkling 19 per cent this year
after 24 per cent last year, with another 16.5 per cent gain expected next
year.
So far, 1993 profit reports have tended to bolster the cyclical recovery
story. This week, Holderbank, the cement group, reported 1993 net income up
12.3 per cent to SFr438m, well ahead of its 4.9 per cent forecast in
November.
Even the report on Tuesday from Georg Fischer, the troubled foundries and
engineering group, of a SFr34m loss on restructuring costs could not
undermine the sentiment. Investors bid up Fischer bearers SFr60 to SFr1,260
following the chief executive's forecast of returning to profit this year.
Interest in secondary stocks is also rising, with issues such as vehicle
maker Bucher, computer mouse maker Logitech and travel agents Kuoni being
mentioned frequently.
But if the market is to resume its growth pattern again - and most analysts
believe it will advance 10 per cent to 15 per cent this year - the focus
will have to shift back to the banks and possibly the pharmaceuticals.
Analysts agree that the big bank shares have been oversold on directors'
warnings of flat profits this year. Mr Philipp acknowledges that profits
from securities and currency trading are most unlikely to match last year's
extraordinary levels. But he argues that the banks' overall earning power
has been transformed in recent years through tighter management.
Still, many investors are inclined to focus their attention elsewhere. 'It
is not that we think the Swiss market will do badly this year. But we think
other European markets, that have more cyclical potential, will do a lot
better,' says an analyst at brokers James Capel in London.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Declines in US stock and bond markets triggered by the assassination of
Mexican presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio affected investor
confidence, and the Nikkei index fell 1 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average declined 201.42 to 19,836.48 after a high of
19,973.40 and a low of 19,771.68. The market has fallen some 3 per cent on
the week.
Share prices also gave way to profit-taking as continued concern over the
North Korean situation also depressed sentiment. Dealers were absent on the
last trading day for March settlement.
Volume was 340m shares against 359m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 4.56 to 1,610.35 and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.16 to 259.18.
Declines led advances by 682 to 349, with 149 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.41 to 1,320.19.
Profit-taking by companies depressed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y6,000
to Y920,000 and East Japan Railway down Y7,000 to Y507,000.
Car shares were lower with Nissan Motor falling Y19 to Y859 and Toyota Motor
declining Y30 to Y1,990.
Isetan, the retailer, fell Y20 to Y1,740 on reports that it will report
extraordinary losses linked to investments on the currency markets.
Banking stocks were higher on foreign buying of Topix index futures.
Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y50 to Y3,250 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank added
Y40 to Y1,940.
Mining shares were higher on higher gold and silver prices. Sumitomo Metal
Mining rose Y6 to Y920 and Dowa Mining gained Y10 to Y570.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 201.42 to 19,836.48 in volume of 108.7m
shares.
Roundup
A volatile week for the region ended mostly lower on the day.
HONG KONG fell 0.9 per cent ahead of an interest rate rise which came after
hours. The Hang Seng index ended 86.54 lower at 9,234.21, 1.1 per cent
higher on the week.
HSBC, the banking heavyweight which has been under selling pressure, fell
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 89.50, HKDollars 3 down on the week. Jardine
Matheson, which has said it will delist its shares from the local market,
topped the active list and fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 47.50.
KUALA LUMPUR's tighter settlement rule, effective from Monday, and Wall
Street's sharp fall overnight left the KLSE index 13.42, or 1.4 per cent
lower at 970.10, 3.7 per cent lower on the week.
SINGAPORE was weighed down by bearishness in global equity markets, the
Straits Times industrial index falling 26.23, or 1.2 per cent to 2,083.42, a
fall of 1 per cent on the week.
MANILA rose on a late rally in blue-chips on the first day of the merger of
the Manila and Makati exchanges. The unified Philippine stock exchange index
finished up 29.7 at 2,631.07, a 1 per cent fall on the week.
San Miguel B shares climbed 9 pesos to 205 pesos. Turnover slipped to
727.74m pesos from 754.7m.
AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by weakness in the futures market, although
strength in the resource sector helped to offset losses elsewhere.
The All Ordinaries index shed 18.2 to 2,151.6, a week's loss of 0.5 per
cent.
Turnover, boosted by options expiries, was ADollars 1.16bn.
The resource sector was lifted by BHP, which saw a session high of ADollars
17.60, before closing steady at ADollars 17.34 after announcing a rise in
third quarter net profit of 25.8 per cent.
The shares added 3 cents to ADollars 1.26.
NEW ZEALAND finished a depressing week still on the downgrade, the NZSE 40
index closing 24.7 lower at 2,150.1, down 1.1 per cent on the day and 6.2
per cent on since the previous Friday. Volume was a relatively light
NZDollars 42.7m.
Market leader Telecom continued to bear the brunt of the pressure, falling
seven cents to NZDollars 5.24 after falling 19 cents on Thursday.
COLOMBO fell sharply following the ruling party's unexpected defeat at a key
regional election. The All share index shed 20.38 to 1,239.01.
The win by the opposition People's Alliance at reversed earlier indications
that the government would win.

FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German banks offer hope on
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses pulled back some of their losses in the afternoon, seeing a measure
of recovery in bond markets, and in the dollar, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT incorporated Thursday's post-bourse losses and dropped further by
the end of the session when the Dax index was 2,130.06, down nearly 14
points from the previous afternoon's close and off 1.2 per cent on the week.
However, bund futures rose late, there was a slight gain in the dollar, and
the Ibis-indicated Dax recovered to end just 0.36 down at 2,144.00.
The Federation of German Banks said yesterday that German interest rates
could continue to fall in spite of increases in US rates. In Milan, Deutsche
Bank said that the Bundesbank is likely to cut official lending rates half a
percentage point in April, with a further half a point cut before the end of
the year.
Turnover fell DM3bn to DM7.6bn. Volkswagen fell DM3.50 to DM499.30 but it
continued its upward career in relative terms, just overtaking BMW - down
DM14.50 to DM818 - in the performance stakes with a gain of 13.5 per cent
since January 1.
PARIS dipped sharply in the last moments of trading as the matif continued
to exert its influence over equities.
In a volatile start to the new account the CAC-40 index moved from a day's
high of 2,171 to a low of 2,113, before settling down 15.94 at 2,136.62. The
market has lost 3.8 per cent over the week.
Turnover was moderate at FFr4.4bn. Disappointing results from Credit
Lyonnais after the close on Thursday upset sentiment, and particularly
Thomson-CSF, which holds a 20 per cent stake and slipped FFr13.30 or 7 per
cent to FFr175.20. Credit Lyonnais said that it was omitting the dividend.
Societe Generale was expected to benefit on Monday from better than expected
results announced after the close on Friday. It closed FFr3 lower at FFr637,
before a 10 per cent rise in 1993 profit and an increased dividend.
AMSTERDAM closed the session and the week on a negative note. The AEX index
slipped 1.26 or 406.83, bringing the week's decline to 2.8 per cent.
There were some heavy falls among the major blue chips, although DSM
resisted the trend with a rise on the day of Fl 4.50 to Fl 129, as investors
were seen switching out of Akzo Nobel, down Fl 4.60 at Fl 214.60. DSM is
seen as benefitting from the possible turnround in the European chemical
sector.
MILAN saw an unexpected round of buying on the last trading day before the
general election on Sunday and Monday; the Comit index added 2.48 to 669.73,
0.7 per cent lower on the week.
Domestic retail investors emerged as buyers, adding to short-covering
activity by institutional investors expecting a flat market on Monday.
NatWest Securities expected that the outcome of the poll would be
inconclusive, and followed by a tense period of negotiation to form a new
coalition government: 'Volumes will be lower and market conditions more
volatile after the poll. Longer term, however, we expect that a
'technocratic' government will be formed which will be able to continue the
economic policies of the last administration.'
Industrials were at the centre of attention with Fiat rising L129 or 2.6 per
cent to L5,124; Montedison was L58 or 4.7 per cent higher at L1,298 in heavy
volume of 55m shares.
Olivetti added L28 to L2,584 with the decision on the awarding of Italy's
second mobile telephone licence expected imminently. Pirelli rose L120 or
4.9 per cent to L2,543, largely on short covering and optimism over the 1993
results.
MADRID featured the requotation of Hidroelectrica de Cataluna, down Pta59 to
Pta611 as the market absorbed details of the sale of the company's
non-nuclear assets in a restructuring of the industry. Turnover was high at
Pta45.4bn as the general index closed 1.19 lower at 329.39, down 2.3 per
cent on the week.
STOCKHOLM continued to weaken in thin trading. The Affarsvarlden index
dropped 28.2 to 1,438.6, for a 2 per cent fall on the week.
Turnover eased to SKr1.90bn from SKr1.96bn. The banking sector was one of
the day's steepest fallers, while Ericsson B lost SKr16 to SKr347.
ISTANBUL rose 4.3 per cent ahead of Sunday's local elections. The composite
index added 555.40 to 13,536.12, with many investors discounting the rise in
overnight rates to some 900 per cent, as the central bank attempted to check
an anticipated rush on the US dollar.

FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stakis deal mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suggestions that Stakis is close to clinching a deal to buy a clutch of four
star hotels worth in the region of Pounds 80m were being heard in the market
yesterday. The Scottish hotel group is said to have been visiting its big
institutional investors in recent weeks in readiness for an announcement.
With the hotel industry presently awash with unwanted chains, leisure
specialists had little trouble naming possible contenders. Favourite is the
Copthorne chain owned by Aer Lingus, which is known to have interested both
Stakis and Forte in the past, although the price being asked by the Irish
group is believed to have been discouraging. Queens Moat Houses, the
troubled hotel group, was another name being mentioned. It may be tempted
into selling some hotels to reduce its debts.
Any deal of such a size would involve Stakis in a cash raising exercise.
Yesterday Stakis shares were steady at 85p. Forte survived a James Capel
downgrade to close a half-penny up at 257 1/2 p.
Shares in Wellcome recovered from the three-year low achieved on Thursday
following disappointing figures and rose 22 to 572p with supportive brokers
reiterating their positive stances.
UBS repeated its buy recommendation arguing that the shares, at a 34 per
cent discount to the market but with growing earnings and a rising yield
premium, were very oversold. Wellcome also benefited from positive newspaper
comment. However, some securities houses are becoming increasingly cautious.
Smith New Court backed away from its 'mild buy' and Goldman Sachs cut profit
forecasts for Wellcome's figures over the next four years. Goldman moved to
Pounds 710m from Pounds 725m for this year, Pounds 750m from Pounds 790m for
next year and to Pounds 800m and Pounds 855m for 1996 and 1997.
Oil stocks hung fire as the first day of the Opec meeting provided no
indications on the direction of a a decision on quotas. Many analysts expect
the quota of 24.5m barrels a day to be maintained which might well send oil
prices lower. Shell Transport fell 6 to 656p but BP slipped down 1 to 373p.
Exploration and telecoms group Pittencrieff lifted 11 to 411p after the
company announced further details of the proposed demerger of its PCI
telecoms arm, which it hopes to list on the London market.
Banks and insurances led the way forward as a rush of US interest in the
oversold sectors forced marketmakers who had cut back their trading books on
the last day of the trading account to struggle for stock. The short
covering sent Lloyds up 22 to 568p, Barclays up 12 to 537p, Royal Insurance
12 to 271p Sun Alliance up 17 at 343p.
One advance in an otherwise weak electricity sector came as Eastern again
went into the market, buying 550,000 shares at between 627 and 630p. The
stock added 3 to 633p.
Beazer Homes made a fair market debut, but talk prior to trading that it
would be marked down proved right as the shares came under immediate
pressure. After opening at 165p, they fell 10, before recovering to close a
net 3 off at 162p. Turnover was a massive 53m.
It was a less auspicious start for MAID, the computer services group, which
came to the market at 110p and slipped down to close at 102p. Turnover was
708,000.
Drinks giant Allied Lyons basked in positive comment following the Pounds
739m takeover of Domecq, the Spanish spirits group, and the shares gained 7
to 568p. Merrydown, the cider group, announced the loss of its finance
director. The shares slid 16 to 133p.
Geest retreated 17 to 245p after unveiling poor results on Thursday, pulling
down Fyffes 6 to 94p.
There was heavy volume in Kingfisher as buyers returned following recent
underperformance prompted mainly by strategic concerns prior to and after
its results this week. The shares rose 5 to 550p, with turnover touching 8m.
There was further support for Great Univeral Stores, buoyed by continued
talk of an imminent share buy-back, and the shares finished 10 up at 584p
with turnover at 4.2m.
Rolls-Royce was one of the few engineering stocks to hold up well in the
depressed morning trading, bouncing back from heavy selling in the past
couple of weeks. It closed 4 up at 184 1/2 p.
Other engineering stocks doing well included BICC up 4 to 438p and Delta up
6 to 542p amid bid speculation.
BTR was hit by profit-taking late in the session, closing down 4 1/2 at 377p
after dropping to 374p during the day.
Garton Engineering fell back 2 to 122p despite good results.
Vehicle distributors also had a dull day with T Cowie closing down 10 at
304p and Evans Halshaw dropping 9 to 534.
Among transport stocks, P&amp;O continued its good run after Thursday's figures,
rising another 14 to 709p, after pushing ahead 27 at one stage yesterday.
National Express was also in demand early on after posting a 36 per cent
profit rise, but ticked back to close unchanged at 270p.
IOMS Packet rose 22 to 310p ahead of Monday's results.
Among leading companies reporting full-year figures on Monday, Pearson
bounced 15 to 635p and Inchcape slipped 5 to 552p.
Shipping company James Fisher fell 30 to 55p after revealing a Pounds 5.6m
annual loss.

FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Windfall prospects boost Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anticipation of a big boost to revenues at British Gas saw heavy turnover
and a rally in the shares, which closed 6 up at 304p yesterday. Investors
were buying ahead of the expected windfall to the company from customers
paying early and beating the imposition of value added tax on gas bills.
Turnover rose to 18m, making it the most heavily traded Footsie stock in the
market. Volume was boosted by a block of 5m shares taken at 295p and placed
at 298p.
Dealers said the company had already received more than Pounds 100m in
advance payments and was expected to net around Pounds 500m ahead of the VAT
deadline at the end of the month. The effect will be to boost earnings by
about Pounds 30m, according to some analysts.

FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the account and interest rate worries created a day of turmoil in
stock index futures, with an early fall to 3,081 turned around by US buying.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,138, about a point ahead of
its fair value premium of around 10 points, with exceptionally high
turnover. US institutions took it up to 3,147 in the afternoon before bond
weakness pushed it back down.
Meanwhile, traded options turnover was 40,000. Volume in FT-SE options was
18,577, and Land Securities was the busiest stock option at 3,079.

FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally pushes Footsie into
positive territory - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers were happy to see the back of a week of unrelenting pressure and big
losses on the London stock market that culminated in a surprising but
powerful end of account rally.
The FT-SE 100 Index, down more than 33 points in mid-morning responding to
another worrying slide in bonds and equities in the US overnight, rallied
with sufficient power shortly after American markets opened yesterday
afternoon to close a net 7.3 up on the session at 3,129. The FT-SE Mid 250
index, however, ended 20.5 off at 3,775.2 as institutions concentrated their
attentions on the market leaders. Over the week the 100 index showed a fall
of 89.1.
The late recovery was triggered by a solid opening by Wall Street, which
moved into positive territory shortly after it opened, and a resolute
showing by US bonds which were only marginally easier at the outset of
trading in the US after a similar performance on far eastern markets.
Rumours of Federal Reserve support for US bonds and Bank of England buying
of gilts accompanied the steadier trend in bonds in mid-afternoon.
Traders were rightly nervous at the outset of trading, lowering share prices
modestly to head off any attempted selling caused by the turbulence in US
markets following the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, a candidate
for the Mexican presidency.
The news from Mexico produced a series of tremors across international bond
markets where south American issues were heavily sold. 'The worry was that
some of the hedge funds, which are only just recovering from the recent
spate of bond market sell-offs, would have to sell more US and European
bonds to cover their south American losses,' said one dealer.
UK gilts, already weakened this week by worries about inflation and pressure
on sterling, dropped over two points at the long end of the market,
unnerving the equity market in the process.
The slide in gilts proved too much to bear for equities where a number of
the leading marketmakers, already suffering big losses on their trading
books after the violent swings in the markets recently, began to unload big
lines of stock.
This move resulted in the FT-SE 100 dropping to the day's low of 3,088.5, a
fall of 33.2. Thereafter the market began to creep better, as cheap buyers
moved in to buy top quality defensive stocks.
The market's big recovery began just after Wall Street opened and was first
seen in the FT-SE future, which, having lingered just above its 3,080
support level, suddenly bounded ahead amid talk of big US buying and short
covering from a number of UK institutions. Marketmakers in the cash market
also reported a sudden burst of buying in the financial sectors around the
same time.
Resulting gains drove the 100 index up to a session-high of 3,133.9, a gain
of 11.8, before profit-taking took the shine of the index at the close. The
financial sectors, which have underperformed substantially in recent months,
were in the vanguard of the rally.
Turnover of 850.5m shares was easily the week's highest, while the value of
customer business transacted on Thursday was revealed as topping the Pounds
2bn-mark, the highest for some weeks. Senior dealers said there was a
widespread feeling that the new account may see a technical bounce in the
market but warned of further violent swings until bond markets settle down.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar and sterling woes continued on the foreign exchanges yesterday, but
the two currencies managed to recover from earlier lows, writes Philip
Gawith.
Both were victim to the bearish sentiment sweeping through financial
markets. Analysts said there was no cogent explanation for the current
malaise where markets seemed determined to squeeze a bearish message out of
unrelated events.
Perhaps the worst case of jitters was in the sterling futures market where
there was a very heavy sell-off in the morning. The June contract fell to a
low of 94.55, effectively discounting a 20 basis points increase in three
month money by mid-year.
Prices later recovered and the June contract settled seven points lower at
94.66. The December contract was also seven points down at 94.18 after
touching a low of 93.97, implying base rates of over 6 per cent.
The performance of sterling provided a good measure of the confusion. While
futures were plunging, discounting a significant tightening of rates,
sterling was falling at an equally impressive rate.
The UK currency touched a low of DM2.4880 against the D-Mark before
recovering to finish in London at DM2.4978, slightly above Thursday's close
of DM2.4971. It finished slightly higher against the dollar at Dollars
1.4975 from Dollars 1.493.
Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers, said
sterling's weakness related to the general weakness of UK asset markets. He
said the UK had a much poorer inflation record than countries like the US
and Germany, so 'it is natural that there would be a bigger risk premium on
UK assets at this point.'
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
sterling was weak because the market was drawing an analogy between the UK
and the US, saying UK rates would also have to move up.
Most observers believe the market is too pessimistic about UK rates, with a
further 25 basis points cut a possibility, though it may have to wait for
the summer.
In the discount market the Bank of England offered late assistance of Pounds
240m after forecasting a Pounds 1.05bn shortage. Earlier it had put Pounds
718m liquidity into the market.
The dollar recovered from a five month low of DM1.6595 to finish in London
at DM1.668, down from Thursday's DM1.6726.
Mr Holtham argued that with higher US rates already discounted, the only
thing that can help the dollar is people changing their mind about Germany -
believing that German rates will go lower.
Mr Persaud said the market needed a more decisive signal about the future
outlook for rates than the weekly trimmings of the repo rate.
The D-Mark was firm in Europe yesterday, continuing to benefit from dollar
weakness, and selling in the bond markets. It was up against the French
franc at FFr3.426 from FFr3.424 on Thursday.
It was weaker against the lira which recovered from a low of L997.05 to end
at L988.8, compared to L993.2 on Thursday. Trading was nervous ahead of this
weekend's election.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee market hits 4-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee producers had the satisfaction this week of seeing the initial target
of their export retention scheme achieved. On Thursday the retention
indicator price for arabica varieties (grown mostly in Latin America)
exceeded 75 US cents a pound, triggering the reduction of the amount of
beans they are committed to put into storage from 20 per cent of export
shipments to 10 per cent.
Further encouragement was given by the fact that the news appeared to do no
damage to market sentiment on either side of the Atlantic. On the day of the
cut the July futures price on the New York futures market - which trades
arabicas - rose by 0.40 to 85.05 cents a pound, while at the London
Commodity exchange - which trades the coarser robusta type, grown chiefly in
Africa - the May futures price ended up Dollars 13 at Dollars 1,360 a tonne.
During the day the London price had touched Dollars 1,368 a tonne, the
highest since the abandonment of the International Coffee Organisation's
export quota system in 1989 triggered a market collapse.
Some traders suggested the market had become 'overbought' as the May price
rose Dollars 26 to Dollars 1,358 a tonne over the week, but they suggested
any retracement would be relatively brief. With consumer stocks continuing
to decline, most saw the market extending the 48 per cent advance it has
registered since the retention scheme was agreed last July.
The silver market also reached the highest level for more than four years
this week, as US investment funds continued to buy and speculators were
thought to be targetting the Dollars 6 a troy ounce barrier for spot metal.
But the technical chart barrier at Dollars 5.75 an ounce must be overcome
first, and this week's upsurge stopped just a quarter of a cent short of
that before edging back to Dollars 5.70 1/2 , up 29 cents overall.
Gold fed off silver's strength, and as Korean tensions were added to concern
about the pre-election situation in South Africa its price pushed above
Dollars 490 an ounce to two-month peaks on both Thursday and Friday. But
having failed to hold its gains on either occasion it closed relatively
tamely yesterday at Dollars 389.40 an ounce, up Dollars 3.20 on the week.
Platinum was also sensitive to situation in South Africa, and particularly
in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, where around 20 per cent of the white
metal is produced. After putting on Dollars 4 in each of the past two days
the London price was fixed yesterday at Dollars 408.75 an ounce, up Dollars
8.35 on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange copper and aluminium prices surrendered some of
last week's gains, the former ending Dollars 11.75 down at Dollars 1,956.75
a tonne and the latter Dollars 14 down at Dollars 1,332.50 a tonne, both
prices being for three months delivery.
But copper had ended the week with its tail up. After finding firm support
below Dollars 1,930 yesterday morning it climbed strongly, helped by another
fall in LME warehouse stocks. Aluminium also found support below Thursday's
closing level, which enabled it to put on Dollars 6.
Copper's rally helped to steady other LME base metals contracts yesterday,
notably lead, which early on had been moving closer to a widely-predicted
test of support at Dollars 450 a tonne for three months metal. After dipping
to Dollars 460.25 at one stage the price recovered to Dollars 465.75, up 25
cents on the day but down Dollars 14 on the week.

FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: BHP earnings advance to ADollars
284.2m in third period
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest industrial company, posted an
after-tax profit of ADollars 284.2m (USDollars 203m) for its third quarter.
The group was lifted by a continuing improvement in its steel division and a
record result from mineral interests.
The figure compares with ADollars 225.9m in the same period of 1992-93, and
is scored on revenues of ADollars 4.08bn, against ADollars 4.09bn.
It means that BHP has earned ADollars 924.2m after tax in the nine months
ended February, compared with ADollars 727.7m at the same stage a year ago.
Undiluted earnings per share, for the first three quarters, stood at 69.1
cents, up from 56.6 cents last time.
In operating profit terms, after tax but before finance charges, the
minerals division saw a 10.9 per cent advance, to ADollars 209.2m. BHP said
the record figure was due to the consolidation of results from the Ok Tedi
mine in Papau New Guinea - which performed strongly after shipments were
resumed in December following the local drought - and to higher shipments of
copper, manganese, Indonesian and western US coal.
The exchange rate with the US dollar, after hedging, was helpful, although
lower realised prices for most commodities partially offset this bene-fit.
A rise in the domestic market helped profits in the steel division, as did
lower unit costs resulting from higher production levels and cost-cutting
programmes.
The division made ADollars 103.5m, compared with ADollars 39.3m last time.
The petroleum business, hit by falling oil prices but benefiting from a
lower Australian tax rate, contributed ADollars 114.7m, an 8.1 per cent
increase - although results for last year were affected by losses on the
disposal of US gas properties. The service companies made ADollars 13.1m
against ADollars 10.1m.
For the group overall, interest charges fell to ADollars 60.7m, compared
with ADollars 77.2m in the third quarter of 1992-93.

FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at Societe
Generale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale last year bucked the downturn in the French banking
industry to increase net profits by 10.5 per cent to FFr3.61bn (Dollars
612m) from FFr3.28bn in 1992.
The bank is stepping up its dividend by 6.7 per cent to FFr16 a share.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said a strong performance from market trading
activities had helped to counter the negative effect of the sluggish banking
market.
He said the group was on course for another increase in profits during 1994.
The news of Societe Generale's profits growth came only a day after Credit
Lyonnais, one of its chief competitors, announced a FFr6.9bn net loss for
1993.
Credit Lyonnais disclosed details of a FFr44.9bn rescue package it has
negotiated with the French government.
Societe Generale, like Credit Lyonnais, has been adversely affected by the
impact of the economic recession on the French banking market.
However, it has been less vulnerable to the downturn, having adopted a more
prudent approach to lending, acquisitions and provisioning in the approach
to the recession.
The group saw its net banking income increase by 10.4 per cent to FFr40.35bn
in 1993 from FFr36.55bn in 1992.
However, it managed to restrict the increase in its costs to 8.5 per cent at
FFr28.04bn in 1993 from FFr25.85bn in the previous year thereby fuelling a
15.1 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr12.31bn from FFr10.7bn
over the same period.
Mr Vienot said most of the increase in operating profits came from market
trading. Societe Generale, like other Gallic banks, last summer made large
profits from its dealings in the French franc during the European currency
crisis.
However, the group was forced to make new provisions of FFr7.21bn, a 15.2
per cent increase over FFr6.26bn in 1992.
Mr Vienot said the bulk of these provisions were writedowns on commercial
loans and property holdings.
M6, the French television station due to be floated this year, reported a 60
per cent increase in net profits to FFr169.2m for 1993.
The company is owned by a group of institutional investors including
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez.

Orient Overseas (OOIL), the Hong Kong shipping group, yesterday underscored
its turnround in fortunes - brought about largely by non-recurring factors -
by awarding shareholders its first ordinary dividend since 1985.
Net profits rose to USDollars 136.5m in 1993, compared with Dollars 1.5m the
previous year, and the directors recommended a dividend of 1.3 cents.
Results were buoyed by the the sale of the group's remaining interest in the
Hongkong International Terminals group for Dollars 120.1m, which was taken
above the line.
While the core shipping activities still suffered from competition and
over-supply, investments performed well. Mr C. H. Tung, chairman, warned:
'The group's investment portfolio benefited from increased bond values and
buoyant equity markets, particularly in Hong Kong and south-east Asia.
Substantial returns on the portfolio were achieved. However, the group
believes it is unlikely that these returns will be repeated in 1994.'
OOIL held cash balances and portfolio investments of Dollars 477.7m at
December 31 1993, compared with Dollars 260.1m a year earlier.
The group has ordered six new container vessels costing Dollars 484m, and
expects further improvement in container transport business as a result of
higher load factors. Strategic investment in China began last year with a
property development project.
Operating profit after financing last year rose to Dollars 17.4m, which
compares with a loss of Dollars 28.2m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to
27.7 cents against a 1.6 cent loss.

Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers
controlled by the Kwok family, yesterday posted a strong rise in first-half
profits and announced a higher dividend.
Net profits rose to HKDollars 4.2bn (USDollars 545m) for the six months
ended December, an increase of 31 per cent over the HKDollars 3.2bn of a
year ago.
The company, which derives about 65 per cent of operating profit from
property sales, generated HKDollars 8.2bn in sales during the first half.
Sales for the first three months of the second half were 'very encouraging,'
the group said.
Since July the group has acquired four sites with an aggregate developable
gross floor area of about 1.4m sq ft. It owns 12.6m sq ft of investment
properties throughout the colony. The rental portfolio was almost fully let,
the company said. Its total land bank in Hong Kong is 40m sq ft
SHK Properties received about HKDollars 4bn cash from the conversion of 1993
warrants in the fourth quarter of that year.
Mr Walter Kwok, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for the property market
in Hong Kong remains optimistic. Because of continuing strong demand for
housing, residential property prices will stay firm. While local interest
rates are heading upwards, moderate increase in the prime rate is expected
to have only a minimal impact on prices.'
Earnings per share for the six months rose 25 per cent to HKDollars 1.94.
The directors are recommending a dividend of 53 cents against 45 cents in
the first half of last year.

FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: SAS cuts deficit to SKr492m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a 35 per cent
reduction in losses for 1993 and predicted it would return to profit this
year.
The airline, in the midst of a tough cost-cutting operation following the
failure last year of Alcazar, the planned four-way pan-European airline
merger, said pre-tax losses reached SKr492m (Dollars 62.3m) in 1993,
compared with a loss of SKr760m in 1992.
In spite of a more positive outlook for 1994, Mr Jan Reinas, the outgoing
chief executive, strongly criticised the commission of the European Union
for a recent report which proposed that big loss-making airlines in the EU
should be allowed a further round of state subsidies.
Mr Reinas, to be succeeded on April 1 by Mr Jan Stenberg, called the
proposal unethical and complained that SAS was not competing on 'a level
playing field'.
SAS turnover rose to SKr39.1bn from SKr34.4bn as heavier international
traffic lifted traffic volumes by 6 per cent. But operating costs grew more
sharply than sales to SKr37bn from SKr31.5bn.
Operating profit fell as a result to SKr249m from SKr1.4bn. The improvement
in the pre-tax deficit was due mainly to a profit of SKr810m from the sale
and leaseback of six Boeing 767-300 aircraft. Other sales, including two
catering subsidiaries, raised a further SKr556m.
SAS, jointly owned by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish companies in which each
government has a share, faces further deregulation this year in the internal
Nordic market.
However, it said it should return to profit partly through the effects of a
SKr3bn cost-cutting programme of disposals and 2,900 job cuts introduced
since the collapse of Alcazar.

slumps
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Spain's state holding group Instituto Nacional de Industria soared
by 69 per cent last year to Pta125bn (Dollars 893m), reflecting
deteriorating results in steel and shipbuilding and a sharply increased
deficit at Iberia, the national airline group.
However, Mr Javier Salas, chairman, expressed cautious optimism for an
improvement this year and said the group had to become 'smaller and much
stronger' in the next few years.
Group borrowing at the end of last year was Pta2,300bn, roughly the same as
annual turnover.
INI's shareholdings in steel production accounted for half the total loss.
Losses at Iberia and its subsidiaries doubled to Pta69bn, weighed down by
the company's interests in Latin America.
These include Aerolneas Argentinas, where Iberia has just reached agreement
on increasing its stake from 30 per cent to 85 per cent through conversion
of debt.
Other heavy losers were the Inespal aluminium company and arms manufacturer
Santa Barbara.
The latter is due to shed two-thirds of its 3,000-strong workforce with the
closure of five of its nine manufacturing sites.
The group's more successful interests, brought together under Grupo Teneo
and excluding INI's holdings in mining, defence, steel and shipbuilding,
remained in profit but with net earnings sharply reduced to Pta3bn from
Pta21bn, mainly reflecting the losses at Iberia.
Capital goods subsidiaries and the aerospace company CASA moved into profit.
However, the group continued to rely heavily on earnings from Endesa, the
partly-privatised electrical utility, which rose about 10 per cent to
Pta117bn.
A further 10 per cent of Endesa, in which Grupo Teneo now holds 75 per cent,
is due to be sold off shortly.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, plans to spin off its
ferry division into a separate company with an Oslo bourse listing and put
the company up for sale.
Vard said the reason behind the move was to help run down the
interest-bearing debt of the holding company, estimated at about Dollars
185m.
In 1993, the holding company, which owns the ferry division, spent NKr73m
(Dollars 9.9m) on debt servicing, down from NKr107m in 1992. It received
bareboat hire payments from the ferry division of NKr118m, against NKr114m
in 1992.
The company said it did not intend to retain any shareholding in the new
company - in contrast to an earlier plan in which it planned to maintain a
stake of up to 30 per cent in the ferry business.
Vard has appointed Elcon Securities and Sundal Collier, two Norwegian
stockbrokers, to find buyers for the ferry division. Vard reckons it could
take up to three months to complete a disposal.
In 1993, the ferry division saw pre-tax profits, after bareboat hire
payments, decline to NKr78.6m from NKr123.4m in 1992.

Deutsche Bank is to pay Frankfurt, Germany's most indebted city, about
DM650m (Dollars 382m) for its 2.88 per cent stake in Veba, the energy-based
conglomerate.
The bank emerged yesterday as the winner in a US-style auction handled by
private bankers B. Metzler seel Sohn.
Mr Andreas von Schoeler, the Social Democrat mayor, said the shareholding
had been sold to cut the city's annual interest payments on net debts of
about DM7bn.
The sale had been timed in the light of the relatively modest 4 per cent
dividend yield on the holding and the strength of Veba's share price.
Deutsche is to buy the 1.33m shares for DM470 to DM495, compared with
yesterday's closing price of DM485.50.

<TEXT>
A strong performance from the core flooring business was behind a 14 per
cent rise in interim profits at James Halstead, the Manchester-based
floor-coverings, weather-proof clothing and trailers group.
Pre-tax figures for the six months to end December were up from Pounds 3.97m
to Pounds 4.54m on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.5m). The interim
dividend has been raised from 2.5p to 2.75p.
Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said flooring sales were slightly up in
the UK, where the company has about 60 per cent of the sheet vinyl market.
European sales rose, including German business, while those in Australia and
south east Asia also improved. The directors said that the group has opened
a Hong Kong office as a bridge for sales into China.
Group capital expenditure of Pounds 4.9m for the half-year was concentrated
on the flooring division, which accounts for about two-thirds of turnover.
In July a Pounds 7m production line will be opened in Manchester, giving the
group some extra capacity and a great deal more flexibility, said Mr Knight.
Both sales and profits were ahead at Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's
coat company. However, margins at Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories
distributor, were under pressure from the absorption of another business and
currency factors.
Conway Products, the trailer tents, trailers and security cabins business,
reduced the usual first-half loss. The group, which is hoping to develop
further sales away from the seasonal camping market, lifted sales of the
steel security cabins used on civil engineering projects.
Net cash at the end of the half stood at Pounds 4m. Earnings per share were
10.16p (8.94p).

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Macallan-Glenlivet down but confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Macallan-Glenlivet, the once high-flying Scottish malt whisky
distiller, fell last year for the second time running. However, the company
predicted a profits recovery this year and raised the dividend by 20 per
cent.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 were down 19 per cent from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds
5.7m, on sales 7 per cent lower at Pounds 15.5m. Sales of new whisky
fillings to the trade were down by over 20 per cent by volume for the second
year running, though prices were marginally ahead.
Earnings per share were down from 4.45p to 3.62p. The final dividend is
0.74p (0.615p) making a 1.1p (0.915p) total.
Though the company's net cash position was broadly unchanged, interest
receivable fell from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 555,000 as a result of lower
rates.
Bottled sales of Macallan malt whisky, which make up most of the company's
turnover, showed little change on the year, said managing director Mr
William Phillips. This was because of high stocks in the trade at the start
of the year. 'We should see some movement this year', he said.
Prices were up slightly last year, but margins had been affected by higher
promotional costs.
The company expects a further decline in new fillings this year, but said
the Macallan brand is moving into a new phase of development. Mr Phillips
said higher levels of stocks previously laid down were now maturing, leading
to much greater availability of the product.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks sees benefits of changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newman Tonks, the architectural hardware group, emerged from a spell of
extensive reorganisation with a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for the
year to December 31.
Profits were Pounds 15.8m, against Pounds 4.36m, restated for FRS 3, for the
14 months to December 1992 as the group changed its year-end.
The comparable figure was depressed by provisions of Pounds 6.81m for the
sale or closure of unwanted subsidiaries. There was an exceptional credit
this time of Pounds 266,000, being the losses on disposals offset by the
release of provisions.
Earnings per share were 7.6p, compared with losses of 0.65p. With the
exceptional items stripped out, earnings were 7.38p, against 5.22p.
In line with the intention, announced last September, of bringing dividends
more closely into line with earnings, the proposed final is 3.67p, for a
total of 6.2p, against 9.3p. The previous total was a factor in lifting
gearing to 39 per cent at the year end, against 29 per cent 12 months
earlier.
Turnover was Pounds 257.6m (Pounds 266.5m), including Pounds 730,000 (Pounds
7.55m) from discontinued activities and Pounds 6.95m from acquisitions.
Operating profits were Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.1m), with continuing activities
showing a 17 per cent advance.
The rise reflected the revival of demand in the US and the continued
strength of the locks and security businesses.
COMMENT
Newman Tonks has been through a bridging year. The main costs of
reorganisation were taken in 1992 but recovery of demand in its main
markets, the US excepted, is for this year or perhaps 1995. Once that
recovery does come, then lower costs and the results of investment, which
continues at Pounds 8m a year, should have a quick effect on the bottom
line. In other words, the group is ready to ride up the cycle to pre-tax
profits of, perhaps, about Pounds 19m this year. This would give earnings
per share of 10.5p which, at yesterday's price of 169p, puts the shares on a
prospective multiple of 16 and suggests that, general market conditions
permitting, they have a distance yet to run.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Nat Express rises to Pounds 9.3m - Airport
contributes Pounds 2.2m with further acquisitions being considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Express Group, the coach operator, reported a 36 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the 1993 year following a maiden contribution from
East Midlands Airport, its new subsidiary.
The Leicestershire airport, acquired for Pounds 27.1m last July, contributed
Pounds 2.2m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 6.8m). Turnover rose
from Pounds 120.6m to Pounds 139m.
Increased revenue from airline passengers helped to offset falling demand
among travellers for long-distance coach services, where turnover fell from
Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 92m in the face of strong comp-etition from British
Rail.
Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, admitted the figures had been weakened by
uncompetitive pricing which led to a 6.6 per cent decline passenger
journeys.
He claimed, however, that ticket sales were now picking up following fare
cuts on cross-country routes, service improvements and a management
shake-up.
The shake-up was dominated by the departure of Mr Keith Taylor, who resigned
as managing director of the coach business last November after only a year
in the job.
Mr McEnhill said the problems had largely been solved and the company had
committed Pounds 3m to upgrade services, improve coach stations and
introduce mechanised ticketing.
Despite the difficulties, the express coach division benefited from
contributions by new acquisitions, including Scottish Citylink and
Eurolines, the Dutch coach operator, and improved results from both European
Coach Travel and Airport Coach Services.
The group also emphasised its determination to develop its airport business,
and Mr McEnhill said it was hoping to buy other regional hubs.
Earnings per share were 16.7p (16.8p). The group is proposing its first
final dividend since its December 1992 flotation with a 5p payment, taking
the total for the year to 7.5p.
COMMENT
A recent valuation of its East Midlands offshoot, which valued the site at
Pounds 55.1m, whetted the group's appetite for the airport business. With
its balance sheet thus strengthened, the group has looked at five other
airports and is expected to end 1994 with another one in its portfolio. With
coach services likely to recover following fare reductions and a full year
contribution from airport operations, this year's profits should reach
Pounds 11m. On a forward multiple of 14.5, that makes the shares an
attractive long-term prospect.

Two newly-floated groups saw their shares fall to a discount in first day's
trading yesterday.
Maid, the business information supplier, closed at 102p, an 8p discount to
the offer price. Beazer Homes, the housebuilder sold by Hanson, closed at
162p, 3p short of its price.
Maid, set-up nine years ago, came to market earlier this month via a placing
of 11.5m shares representing 14 per cent of the share capital.
Beazer saw 53.7m shares traded. Since the issue was priced the FT-SE 100
index has fallen 3.6 per cent. A total of 280.8m shares were sold, of which
a quarter were offered to the public. This part of the issue was only 1.3

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Next buys Clydesdale consumer credit side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The break-up of Clydesdale Group, the Scottish-based electrical retailer
which went into receivership in January, continued yesterday with the
purchase by Next, the fashion retailer, of Clydesdale's consumer credit
business.
Next's Club 24 subsidiary provides consumer credit and services for Next and
other businesses such as Kingfisher, British Telecom, Yorkshire Water and
Yorkshire Electricity. The Next credit card now accounts for less than a
fifth of Club 24's business.
Next is paying some 23.5m for the business. The assets are mainly consumer
credit receivables resulting from sales made in Clydesdale stores. Next is
buying the receivables on a discounted cash flow basis, with most expected
to be collected over the next 18 months. It said it expected to develop
additional business following the purchase.
Grant Thornton, the receivers, have now made sales totalling about Pounds
65m, compared with claims of creditors estimated at about Pounds 80m. There
are three businesses left - about 70 high street shops, the servicing
business and a captive reinsurance company.
However, Grant Thornton was not optimistic that sales of these activities
would add significantly to the total proceeds.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Garton Pounds 0.2m in the black after land
sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A profit of Pounds 275,455 from the sale of land stocks enabled Garton
Engineering to show a pre-tax profit for 1993 of Pounds 210,000 against
Pounds 254,000.
Turnover for this manufacturer of engineering components and fasteners was
little changed at Pounds 20.22m (Pounds 20.19m).
Mr Aubrey Garton, chairman, said that the markets had been severely
depressed resulting in reduced demand and severe competition.
He said there had been a Jmarked increase in orders intake in the present
this year, although some was at lower margins.
Operating profits were unchanged at Pounds 432,000. However, there was a
higher interest charge of Pounds 222,000 (Pounds 178,000) despite a 13 per
cent fall in borrowings over the year. Year-end gearing was 36 per cent,
against 41 per cent.
Earnings per share came out at 3.7p (4.83p) and a proposed final dividend of
3.375 makes a total for the year of 4.5p (4p).

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff to raise Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pittencrieff, which in January announced plans to split its oil and gas
interests from the rapidly growing US mobile communications operation, is
planning to raise Pounds 25m, net of expenses, through a placing and open
offer.
The proceeds will be used to help fund the cash purchase of a 50 per cent
working interest in three oil and gas fields in south Texas for Dollars 38m
(Pounds 26m).
After the demerger, Pittencrieff's oil and gas business will be renamed
Pittencrieff Resources and will apply for a London listing. The Texan
acquisition, which is conditional on the demerger, will be made by
Pittencrieff America, which will be a subsidiary of Pittencrieff Resources.
Pittencrieff Communications, Pittencrieff's 54 per cent owned subsidiary,
which is traded on Nasdaq, will also apply for a London listing.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the proposals should maximise
value for shareholders of both Pittencrieff and Pittencrieff Communications.
'The group reorganisation should produce significant commercial benefits for
the two business groups, which have distinct operating, financial and
investment characteristics.'
An extraordinary meeting to approve both the demerger proposals and the
acquisition is scheduled for May 16. A second EGM on May 23 would complete
the demerger.
Pittencrieff shareholders will be offered 1 share in Pittencrieff Resources
for every Pittencrieff share held and 5 shares in Pittencrieff
Communications for every 24 Pittencrieff shares held. They will also be
offered a cash alternative to the Resources shares.

For the year ended January 31 1994 pre-tax profits of Breedon, the limestone
quarrying and housebuilding concern, slipped from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds
1.62m despite a rise in turnover to Pounds 9.69m, against Pounds 8.73m.
Earnings per share were 3.86p (4.41p) but the dividend is maintained at 4.6p

The directors stated that in quarrying, continued low demand pressurised
margins, while latterly a wet winter restricted sales.

House of Fraser, the depart-ment store group, is expected to announce on
Monday that the public element of its flotation has been 'comfortably
oversubscribed'.
Applications for the offer, which closed yesterday were still being counted
last night. But it is thought that at least 70,000 private investors
applied, most of them subscribing for between 200 and 500 shares, priced at
180p.
House of Fraser's directors are meeting with brokers SG Warburg today to
decide the basis of allocation, also to be announced on Monday. Smaller
investors are expected to be favoured.
The flotation comprises 229.6m shares, valuing the group at Pounds 413.3m,
of which 75 per cent are being placed with institutions. Dealings begin on
April 6.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Capital Industries disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Capital Industries fell 15p to 154p yesterday after the specialist
packaging and financial services group announced a smaller than expected
increase in profits from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 4.5m pre-tax in 1993.
Mr Peter Underhill, chief executive, blamed the share price fall on the
group's failure to meet profit forecasts of Pounds 5.4m.
'We made a profit but nothing like what we expected,' he said yesterday.
Profits were held back by manufacturing problems at Samuel Jones, the
group's laminated packaging business where anticipated production
improvements did not materialise despite a Pounds 500,000 investment in new
machinery.
Mr Underhill admitted second-half profits had been hit but said the
subsidiary, acquired in late 1992, had increased group turnover to Pounds
74.8m (Pounds 24.3m).
Output had improved in recent months, he added.
A full year's contribution from Samuel Jones also lifted the industrial
division's operating profits to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 2.2m)
Group operating profits of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3m) were further boosted by
Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 1m) from the financial services division - dominated by
its Capital Ventures subsidiary.
Profits generated by the company - which manages Pounds 320m for enterprise
zones - is expected to offset funds lost by the end of the Business
Expansion Scheme, a main source of profits in the past.
Earnings rose to 12.9p (9.8p) and the final dividend is held at 2.4p for a
total of 4.4p (4p).

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frogmore jumps 74% to Pounds 7.3m in first
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frogmore Estates, the property investment company, announced a 74 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 7.26m for the six
months to December, aided by increased rental income from acquisitions.
The company has built up its portfolio and has invested more than Pounds 70m
on properties since June 1993, when it announced a Pounds 42m rights issue.
Some Pounds 45m of this has been invested in trading properties, the
directors stated.
Activity has also picked up in Frogmore's joint venture housebuilding
business, which is expected to sell 700 units in the current year, compared
with 443 last time.
Turnover increased by 34 per cent from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 29.7m while
operating profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 6.35m).
The 1992 figure was held back by a Pounds 1.53m charge, related to
litigation. Without this distortion, operating profits would have risen 22
per cent, directors pointed out.
The interim dividend is 3.8p, compared with 3.6p.
Earnings per share were 13.4p (6.7p), helped by a reduced tax charge from
the release of earlier provisions.
Borrowings were Pounds 74.3m at December 31, representing gearing of 37 per
cent. Debt servicing cost Pounds 2.74m for the half year, compared with an
annual rent role that has grown to Pounds 24.4m.

Portmeirion Potteries, the pottery maker, achieved a record Pounds 4.18m in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, a 14 per cent rise on the
Pounds 3.67m for 1992.
Turnover improved by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 22.5m) with sales
in the UK 17.2 per cent ahead and in continental Europe 21.4 per cent
better. Production difficulties in the glazing department of the Stoke
factory, however, led to low stocks in the US and sales there grew by just
2.7 per cent.
Operating profits on continuing activities improved to Pounds 4.12m (Pounds
3.7m) and the pre-tax result was after a Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 189,000)
contribution from associates and reduced net interest charges of Pounds
54,000 (Pounds 224,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 28.42p (22.67p) and the dividend is lifted to
9p (7.75p) with a proposed final 6.75p (5.5p).
Mr George Hesp, managing director, said 1994 had started well, with orders
being taken for the group's new china, marketed in five patterns, which
would be in the shops in May.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dissent at Lonrho's AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock made great show of their 'renewed
friendship' at Lonrho's annual meeting yesterday, but smaller shareholders
expressed anger at the cost of the joint chief executives' battle for
control.
The focus of resentment was a Pounds 2.4m payment to four supporters of Mr
Rowland, as compensation for their retirement from the board. It is a move
which shifts the balance of power in favour of Mr Bock.
The fairly cordial tone of yesterday's meeting took a sharp turn when this
compensation was put to the vote. A barrage of criticism was followed by
only marginal approval, of 134 votes to 117, in the first round.
The subsequent three rounds of voting seemed to sway further against the
proposals, to the visible discomfort of the four directors.
The chairman demanded a poll, which included the proxy votes of
institutions, and achieved overwhelming support. The company had already
held 260m proxies in favour and only 25m against.
Bitter shareholders questioned the purpose of having a vote, but they did
succeed in tarnishing what was meant to be a celebration of 'a year of
rationalisation and major progress'.
Mr Rene Leclezio, the outgoing chairman, also dented the image of unity put
forward by the joint chief executives.
In the chairman's speech, prior to the vote, Mr Leclezio called upon
colleagues 'not to destroy the unique character of Lonrho by trying to turn
it into a faceless company'.
This refers to Mr Bock's attempts to introduce a more conventional corporate
and management structure in an attempt to regain the support of the City.
Mr Rowland seemed to get the popular vote yesterday - one shareholder
suggested that political donations should be used to earn him a
'well-deserved' place on the honours list - but Mr Bock can feel satisfied
with events.
Despite vocal opposition and large expense, four supporters of Mr Rowland
will be removed from the board. This enables Mr Bock to consolidate his
position of power in a company that 12 months earlier was considered a
one-man concern.

FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gladiators give boost to Hornby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gladiators swung into action last year to help Hornby, the games, model
trains and boat maker, to report a small rise in 1993 pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 1.5m.
However, turnover was 10 per cent down from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 28.2m,
with a corresponding fall in operating profits from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds
1.64m.
Mr Alan Cox, finance director, said the UK market had been very difficult.
However, sales of the Gladiator range, based on the television series and
launched in August, had been very good, and were expected to continue
successfully this year.
Hornby model railway sales were ahead, while Scalextric model racing car
sales had held steady. The two account for over half the group's sales.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 134,000, reflecting
a fall in capital expenditure and lower seasonal borrowings. About two
thirds of sales are made in the second half, so the group pays no interim
dividend. The final dividend is maintained at 9p from earnings of 10.9p
(11.5p).
The group, which ended the year with net cash of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 3.1m),
reduced its operating costs from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 7.3m. But the savings
were offset by weaker sterling, which took about Pounds 900,000 off the
profits compared with 1992. Many of its toys are imported from the East Asia
and paid for in dollars.
The Fletcher speed-boat business broke even on turnover of around Pounds 3m.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Work, protest and affray: The causes of French youth unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of course, I am angry,' says Martin, a student at Toulouse university. 'This
is the first time I have been on demonstrations. I am going to go on
protesting until the government listens.'
Yesterday it was Martin's Parisian colleagues' turn to show their anger at
the Balladur government's new law which allows young apprentices to be paid
less than the national minimum wage. The march, by more than 30,000 young
people in the capital, passed off without serious incident, because of - or
despite - the presence of 2,500 police in riot gear and another 800 in plain
clothes.
But in contrast to the largely Paris-based student uprising in May 1968  - a
possible parallel in everyone's mind - the protest marches over the past
four weeks against the youth wages law have been nationwide, touching small
towns as well as provincial cities such as Lyons and Nantes, where violent
clashes have continued all week.
When clashes erupted on March 17, for instance, the eyes of the France's
Paris-centric media were on the 30,000 students and assorted union members
who demonstrated in the capital; not surprisingly, because some shop windows
were smashed, cars burnt and youths arrested. But the final tally for the
day showed that no fewer than 200,000 protestors had turned out in the
provinces. This week, in the south-western town of St Gaudens, about 100
secondary school pupils demonstrated behind a banner reading 'Oppression of
Schools = Explosion'.
French students and their government may be listening to one another, but
each is certainly not understanding what the other is saying. For his part,
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur seems baffled by what is going on. He
insists that his wage reform is 'for the young, not against them'. He says
it is aimed at making the 25 per cent without jobs more employable.
It is true that he has somewhat watered down the February 24 decree. This
lumped all youth - those with and without higher education diplomas -
together as eligible for 'contrats d'insertion professionelle' (CIP), under
which they would be paid 80 per cent of the minimum wage, known by the
acronym Smic, in return for training provided by employers. On March 3, Mr
Balladur agreed that diploma-holders should get at least the Smic or 80 per
cent of any wage pact agreed within an industry sector. But three weeks
later, students still do not believe his repeated assurances that he is not
trying to 'devalue' their diplomas. 'I believe in your good faith,' he said
in an open letter in the nation's youth in the Liberation newspaper last
week, 'please believe in mine.' They don't.
So, Mr Balladur is now doing what he has rarely done over his first prime
ministerial year - standing firm. One reason is precisely that he knows he
must correct his reputation for caving in to pressure, particularly when, as
so often in France, the challenge comes from the streets. But a further
motivation is his belief that French youth cannot reasonably ask him to make
any further concessions.
Unless the students protests soon peter out with the advent of the Easter
holidays and spring sunshine, the ingredients are in place for a crisis that
could knock foreign confidence in the French economy and currency. Mr
Balladur himself seems almost fatalistic about this prospect, if his recent
comments about his political mentor, Georges Pompidou, are a guide. Mr
Balladur said he learnt from Mr Pompidou, for whom he worked in 1968, that
'sometimes it is necessary to let things go to boiling point (paroxysme)
before they can get back to normal'.
But Mr Balladur's ministers and those in his private office in the Matignon
have claimed publicly that they detect 'political manipulation' behind the
student protests. This may merely be paranoia. But the Socialist and
Communist opposition parties, as well as the unions, have made clear that
they want the repeal of the CIP. This has disappointed any hopes Mr Balladur
may have had that his public show of consulting the unions over the past
year would pay dividends in his hour of need.
More irritating for the Matignon is the public silence on the part of the
Patronat employers federation, whose only private comment has been to say
that few of its members will actually use the CIP. Even the few individual
employers, such as Mr Claude Bebear of the AXA insurance group, who back the
broad principles behind the CIP measure, also deplore its clumsy
presentation.
This theme of government clumsiness has been taken up, to still more
damaging effect, by virtually all the party and parliamentary leaders of the
ruling conservative majority who do not hold ministerial office. They
include Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the centre-right UDF, and
 -ever with an eye on his forthcoming battle with Mr Balladur for the
presidential nomination - Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR gaullists.
Yet, the more convincing explanation for the crisis lies not in conspiracy,
but in a variant of Mr Balladur's favourite theme that France is a 'societe
bloque'. The most obvious blockage is the inability of so many young to
advance from school or university into gainful employment.
Most economists agreed with Mr Balladur's diagnosis that the Smic has helped
price lesser-skilled, and inevitably younger, workers out of the job market.
But where he is widely judged to have gone wrong is in discouraging students
from advancing themselves through higher education. 'Why should young people
be paid less to do the same job as others with the same qualifications?'
asks Mr Cyril Wone at Paul Sabatier university in Toulouse.
Such sentiments are widespread. 'People of our generation are finding it
harder than ever to find a job, whatever their level of qualification,' says
a student at the Sorbonne. 'There is a growing feeling that the future is
bleak.'
Paradoxically, the main organisers of the student protest come from a
section that has felt its future was not so bleak, at least not until Mr
Balladur stepped in.
This segment comes from the instituts universitares de technologie (IUTs),
set up in the 1960s inside universities, and the sections de techniciens
superieurs (STSs), set up to prepare secondary school students for technical
baccalaureats. These practical institutions, as their names suggest, have
had far more success in placing their diploma-holders in the job market than
older universities like the Sorbonne, with more generalist courses.
It is this technical 'aristocracy' that is most angry at Mr Balladur's
attempt to level youth wages downwards. It was the IUT in Paris' wealthy
16th arrondissement that organised the first February demo against the CIP,
but the rapid recent spread of IUTs and STSs around the country accounts for
the widespread nature of the student revolt.
Perhaps the most general blockage lies in France's political institutions,
which tend to thwart the sort of open debate that might have settled the
youth wage row in parliament and not in the street. Because France has a
weak parliament - and inside it a left-wing opposition that is numerically
small - the real debate about the CIP took place, not when the enabling law
passed the National Assembly last October, but months later with the
publication of the implementing decree. Moreover, what real opposition Mr
Balladur faces is to be found within his own massive conservative majority.
But in order to maintain the pretence of conservative unity, internal debate
 -of the kind that might have thrashed out problems with the CIP - is often
hushed up.
To compensate for this lack of political debate, Mr Balladur has reached
back to the habit of consulting, at least formally, with the trades unions -
a tactic he learnt under Pompidou. But time has moved on. Union presidents
are no longer the power, except in the state sector, that they were 25 years
ago. Today, more than before they are following, rather than leading, the
students. Among the latter steam has built up. And when that happens in a
societe bloque, there is always the danger of explosion.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Tools to secure a future: Plans for vocational training at
UK schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southborough School in south London is swimming against the tide. Its
14-year-old pupils are offered vocational courses on top of their academic
curriculum. But in the three years since it introduced this radical measure,
the school has found it awkward to fit vocational training into the strict
academic requirements of the national curriculum.
The school is determined to persist. As one teacher remarked, 'it is
improving standards because it means a more relevant and coherent curriculum
for youngsters.'
For the moment, Southborough's scheme is very much the exception to the
rule. But this may be about to change.
Government curriculum advisers plan challenging new vocational courses for
14-year-olds. They aim to create a new system of vocational qualifications
that pupils and employers would find as attractive as the academic path
towards A-levels needed for entry into higher education.
Few dispute that Britain's vocational education system needs an overhaul. UK
universities are internationally renowned for the quality of education they
give the top 30 per cent of academic achievers. But vocational education has
long been the poor relation.
The absence of high-quality vocational education is reflected in Britain's
shortage of qualified skilled workers, according to Professor Sig Prais of
the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Only 36 per cent of
the British workforce has a vocational qualification, against Germany's 74
per cent.
Professor Prais believes the lack of skilled technicians has harmed UK
industry. Work practices are inefficient, and qualified graduates are
sometimes 'wasted' doing jobs better left to trained technicians.
The latest attempt to fill the vocational gap in the UK comes from Sir Ron
Dearing, who chairs the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the
quango advising on the content of school education in England and Wales.
Sir Ron believes many teenagers have lost interest in academic study and
gain little from their final years of compulsory education. This week, he
suggested pupils aged 14 to 16 should be able to devote up to 20 per cent of
their time at school to vocational courses. The aim would be to provide
'pathways' into vocational education and training after leaving school at
16.
Sir Ron added the vocational courses should initially be in one of five
subjects: manufacturing; art and design; health and social care; leisure and
tourism; and business and finance. This list might later be extended.
The courses would lead to an as-yet unnamed qualification that would
complement, not replace, the General Certificate of Secondary Education now
taken at age 16. Candidates could still take as many as seven GCSEs
alongside the new qualification in a typical school timetable.
Sir Ron is considering making passes in vocational subjects dependant on
passing appropriate GCSE subjects. A pass in manufacturing, for example,
might require a pass in GCSE science.
The qualifications awarded for the new courses would count towards the
General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ). This 'vocational A-level'
is being introduced for 18-year-olds, amid controversy over whether it is
rigorous enough to carry the same esteem as A-levels.
Sir Ron plans to consult widely and run pilots for two years. But he already
has considerable support among employers and teachers. He also seems to have
the backing of the government which is keen to see an improvement in
vocational education post-16.
But the consensus in favour is not total. A leading critic is Professor Eric
Bolton of London university's Institute of Education, a former chief
inspector of schools. He warns the proposals risk recreating a stratified
education system in which able pupils take academic subjects and the rest
are fobbed off with vocational courses which would be perceived as inferior.
'Historically, whenever we've made these divisions in the past, they've
become hierarchical,' he says. The 1944 Education Act promised a tripartite
system of grammar schools, technical schools and secondary moderns with each
enjoying parity of esteem. But grammar schools were soon perceived as
offering a superior education, says Prof Bolton.
Sir Ron responds to the danger that this could happen by declaring his
determination to challenge the idea that vocational qualifications are
inferior. 'I am all too conscious of the common tendency to consider the
academic as first-rate and the practical applications of knowledge and
understanding as second-rate. It is a tragedy that we have the value
structures we do, and I rail against them.'
A key to changing these values lies in persuading employers that the new
vocational qualification will meet their needs, so that students believe it
is worth working for. As Prof Bolton says: 'What makes German youngsters so
interested in vocational qualifications is that they can't get into
employment without them. If British employers made vocational education pay,
youngsters would do it.'
The portents are good: the Confederation of British Industry backs Sir Ron's
proposals, saying they have 'the potential to transform young people's
learning'. The CBI wants more employer involvement in the courses, as
'children do not learn about manufacturing by sitting for two years in a
classroom'. And it believes there must be opportunities to 'mix and match'
vocational training with academic study.
Thus if Sir Ron can introduce a vocational qualification that employers are
willing to pay for, the British education system may at last start turning
out the skilled workers that continental education systems produce with
apparent ease.

<TEXT>
Sir, Buyers of books who hope to bequeath their libraries in useable
condition to their children will be saddened by your report (Commodities,
March 16) that 'buyers are reluctant to pay adequate premiums for the
chlorine-free product (paper)'. Five per cent extra on the price of a book
or periodical would cover the cost of paper destined to last a century or
more, and I would be more than willing to pay for it. Too many of my books
and periodicals bought 20 to 50 years ago are already beginning to turn
brown, to disintegrate.
Perhaps there is a case for pressure by governments, such as has worked so
well for 'green' petrol.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Roads programme view faulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LILLI MATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Quarries head for the coast' (March 23), Andrew Taylor succinctly
sums up the options put forward in the environment department's consultation
paper on minerals extraction (MPG6). However, the conclusion that forecast
demands for minerals will have to be met - either from Scottish
super-quarries or by increased dredging of marine aggregates - misses a key
issue: whether this is environmentally sustainable.
CPRE believes it is not and that we should be looking at ways to reduce our
demand for aggregates. We have to find ways of meeting our needs and
aspirations for goods and services in ways that use less building material.
A good place for the government to start would be by cutting its
road-building programme. New roads and road maintenance are major consumers
of aggregates. A shift in transport policy away from road construction would
help to reduce the number of holes threatening to appear in our coastline.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Working hours in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan wonders (Economic Viewpoint, March 17) what has happened
to the total number of hours of work being performed during the output
recovery - when the continuing reduction in full-time employment is set
against the rise in part-time and self-employment.
The answer can be obtained from the household Labour Force Survey, the
results of whose autumn 1993 enquiry have just been published in a volume
which also contains for the first time estimates of average actual weekly
hours of work by sector of activity, for men and women - a continuation of
an established series on hours worked by employment status.
In autumn 1993, a total of 830.1m hours of work were performed weekly - a
slight reduction on autumn 1992 (the best period for comparison using these
seasonally-unadjusted data). In fact, hours worked were down in each quarter
of 1993 relative to 1992 - though by an amount that is well within sampling
error.
Total hours worked are now some 15 per cent below the spring 1990 peak - one
possible measure of the 'output gap' (always bearing in mind that
unemployment was unacceptably high even at the peak of the previous
upswing).
The Labour Force Survey also contains the information that: the total of
International Labour Organisation unemployed non-claimants, 1.037m, is
59,000 up on a year earlier; ILO unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds (mostly
ineligible to claim benefit) stands at 146,000 - 7,000 higher than a year
earlier; while the number of 'discouraged' workers (those who would like to
work but have not looked as they believe no jobs are available) stands at
184,000 - 8,000 more than a year ago. ILO unemployment among ethnic minority
men stands at 24 per cent: Afro-Caribbeans (33 per cent), Indians (16 per
cent) and Pakistani/Bangladeshis (30 per cent).

FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory interest is no answer to
late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER DE B HOVELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the November budget the chancellor announced the publication of a
paper discussing the merits of statutory interest on the late payment of
accounts. Replies are requested by March 31 1994.
Late payment of accounts is a serious handicap to the speed of the recovery.
In particular it hits at the viability of small businesses.
At first sight the idea might appear to have merits. However, on closer
examination legislation would perform a disservice to small enterprises.
The reasoning behind this is as follows.
All businesses already have the ability to charge for late payment through
their terms and conditions.
Any statutory rate is likely to be at 8 per cent (the rate of interest used
by the courts) whereas businesses are free to charge a far higher figure.
Enforcement of a statutory charge would have to be through the courts which
is the present position.
A statutory rate is likely to lead to demands from larger customers for
extended credit terms.
SMEs would be caught between pressures for earlier payment by suppliers and
later payment from customers.
Many SMEs are reluctant to press for payment and are unlikely to change
their ways.
Statutory interest might be seen to sanction late payment.
Statutory interest could provide a further excuse for inadequate credit
control.
Legislation would erode freedom of contract.
There is already far too much government interference in commerce without
inviting further regulation.
Despite the apparently harsh economic climate few SMEs admit to, or suffer
from, slow payment, amazing as this may sound.
It is in the interest of all companies to say no to statutory interest.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Rationed and restless: FT writers ask if the state's grip on
people in North Korea is weakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pyongyang has 'a distinct and native life of its own and is known (in Korea)
as one of the wickedest cities of ancient and modern times', wrote US
diplomat William Franklin Sands a century ago.
That description could apply today. The city retains its 'wicked' image as
the capital of North Korea, which appears to be heading for an international
showdown over its suspected nuclear weapons programme. Next week the UN will
consider imposing economic sanctions, if North Korea does not open up its
nuclear facilities to inspection, while the US agreed this week to the
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea.
The 'distinct and native life' in North Korea consists of a political
culture that has transformed its 'Great Leader', Mr Kim Il-sung, into a
demi-god and has cowed a frightened population.
Life there is difficult and is becoming more so. The collapse of the Soviet
bloc cut off previous supplies of food and energy, while the high level of
defence spending has restricted investment in industrial and infrastructure
development.
Conditions are particularly tough in the countryside, where food shortages
are reportedly widespread. Growing food has never been easy in mountainous
North Korea. In the 1980s, it was able to feed its population of 21m through
intensive agricultural measures, which depended on heavy use of chemical
fertilisers. But since then, energy shortages have reduced fertiliser
production.
Falling oil imports and dwindling supplies of domestic brown coal, as mines
have become exhausted, have forced factories to operate at about a third of
capacity. Electricity power blackouts are becoming common. The government
has encouraged people to use bicycles - some sent by charities in Japan -
instead of trolley buses, to save fuel. Electrical appliances have to be
registered with local authorities, which stipulate the times they can be
used.
The picture is not uniform, however. In Pyongyang, supplies of food and
goods are more plentiful. The city's 2m residents are members of the
country's elite, and are frequently vetted for their political loyalty.
Those who do not make the grade must leave.
'There is a big gap between life in Pyongyang and life in the rural areas.
Pyongyang is a shop window for the rest of the world,' said Mr Masao
Okonogi, a professor of law at Tokyo's Keio University, who has visited
North Korea.
In the country as a whole, the state has needed a 'carrot and stick' policy
to retain public loyalty.
The carrot comprises a comprehensive welfare system that includes free
housing, medical aid and education. The stick consists of intrusive
political controls, including the rationing of food and clothing, and
mandatory indoctrination in classes on the country's juche, or self-reliance
ideology.
There is also an extensive network of informers. 'There is an atmosphere of
fear in North Korea, because everyone knows someone who has been packed off
to a labour camp for a political crime,' said Mr Michael Breen of Merit
Consulting, an investment consultancy in Seoul, who has travelled in North
Korea.
But there are signs that the government's controls are disintegrating as the
economic situation worsens. 'Corruption has become widespread among
bureaucrats since the mid-1980s and people resort to bribes to avoid
punishment,' said Mr Bradley Martin, a Fulbright scholar who is writing a
book on North Korea. 'The society is not as regimented as we once thought.'
Mr Toshio Miyazuka, a North Korean specialist at Japan's Yamanashi Gakuin
University, said the government had not been able to prevent the spread of
criminal gangs. Thefts and rapes are rising.
Black markets in food and other goods have emerged. The lack of food has
forced factories, which are responsible for feeding their workers, to rely
on them to supplement rations. 'A factory official travels the country to
find new supplies. These officials could eventually become the country's
first generation of businessmen, since they have acquired an expertise in
trading,' said Mr Martin.
The black markets have also helped to pierce the information vacuum imposed
by the government. 'People know what's going on in the outside world by
listening to radios bought on black markets run by Korean Chinese', who
smuggle them in, said Mr Miyazuka.
In spite of such knowledge, older people who grew up during the Korean war
in the 1950s appear relatively committed to the government. They recall the
sacrifices they made to reconstruct the economy after the war.
'North Koreans now realise that South Korea is richer, but they possess a
moral rectitude because they believe that the South has sold its soul to the
US,' explained Mr Anthony Michell, president of Euro-Asian Business
Consultancy in Seoul and a frequent visitor to North Korea.
The younger generation, however, tended to complain more about the lack of
consumer goods and bureaucratic restrictions, said Mr Michell.
Few dare criticise Kim Il-sung, who appears to have the genuine respect of
the public for his armed resistance to Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s
and 1940s - a period emphasised in school textbooks. 'Even North Korean
defectors I've interviewed have expressed admiration for Kim,' said Mr
Martin.
Instead, domestic opposition appears directed at his son and heir apparent,
Mr Kim Jong-il, the 'Dear Leader' and the head of the armed forces. He is
blamed for most of the country's problems, because he came to prominence
just as the economy was starting to deteriorate in the mid-1980s. There is
also resentment within the North Korean government that the Kims have
reserved most of the top administrative positions for their relatives.
'The situation is getting desperate in North Korea and it is highly
plausible that there is growing discontent against the Kim dynasty at both
the grassroots and top levels of government,' said Mr Adian Foster-Carter,
director of Korean studies at the University of Leeds.
Given that the foundations of North Korea's system appear so shaky, the US
may prefer to wait and see whether the government survives, rather than
invite a confrontation that could lead to war.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Avoidance of VAT on fuel bills is no
joke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Reverend ROY D BENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The portrayal of the devil in your article 'Dodge that VAT' (March 19)
was not without deeper significance. Surely there is something evil about a
society that allows the wealthier members to escape taxation, by means of
advanced payment for fuel in this case, yet insists that those poorer
members must pay the tax in full. The call by John Major, the prime
minister, to return to basic values has a hollow ring if it does not begin
by each of us accepting our responsibility as citizens to pay our taxes.
I wonder what would be the response of the Inland Revenue if I offered to
pay my mortgage in advance for five years to ensure continuing relief at 25
per cent? One law for the rich and another for the poor is no April fool's
joke - despite the date on the cartoon calender.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Late for the dance: IBM's attempts to find a new role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though still the largest computer company in the world by far, IBM knows it
will no longer set the pace for its rivals. 'I don't think we should plan on
owning huge segments of the economic value of this industry (in the
future),' Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, said on
Thursday. 'We are not going to set our mental attitude or our economic
structure on that assumption.'
Unveiling plans to revive IBM, after three years of heavy losses, Mr
Gerstner acknowledged that the company has failed to respond to changes in
the computer market. The company's biggest mistake, he said, was to ignore
the shift away from mainframe-based centralised data processing to networks
of personal computers.
IBM is now fighting to catch up. 'We're arriving late to the dance, but not
too late,' Mr Gerstner said.
For many companies, he said,computer systems based on networked personal
computers 'have turned out to be rife with problems, and those problems open
a very wide door of opportunity for IBM'.
He cited the case of an unnamed but 'very large financial institution with
tens of thousands of personal computers' which faced considerable
difficulties managing a network of computers acquired by different
departments at different times and running various software applications. Mr
Gerstner said the institution's chief information officer went to bed at
night never quite sure where the company's data on customers was stored.
'There is a very critical need to create information management tools for
distributed (networked) computing,' Mr Gerstner said.
IBM also hopes to become a leading supplier of technology for 'information
superhighways'. IBM will have a two-pronged approach to what Mr Gerstner
said would become an increasingly 'network-centric world'.
First, the company aims to become a big supplier of equipment and services
to the telecommunications and cable television companies that build the
'highways'. It also wants to build on its traditional strength in supplying
complex computer systems and offer company-wide networks.
As IBM searches for its new role in the rapidly changing world of
information technology, it is making painful adjustments; downsizing its
workforce and operations, cutting back research and development spending and
reorganising its salesforce.
Faced with intense competition from specialist companies - the 'piece-part
players' as Mr Gerstner calls them - IBM is retraining its salesforce to
create product specialist and industry focused groups.
'We have to make size pay for IBM, rather than size being a detriment,' said
Mr Gerstner. 'This is a major challenge. If we are ever going to succeed we
have to change IBM's culture.'
IBM hopes that the new phase the industry is entering will weaken the hand
of specialist suppliers. 'Customers have become very sceptical of the
constant flood of new information technology,' said Mr Gerstner. 'A customer
said to me: 'maybe you guys should slow down the pace of technology
innovation'.'
No longer able to set the pace of innovation, IBM is questioning the value
of its competitors' technology. 'How powerful a computer do you really need
on your desk,' asked Mr Gerstner, raising a question that his predecessors
at IBM would never have voiced.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Leading Article: More fear than greed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is part of the perversity of stock markets that they frequently fall on
good news and rise on bad. But where political shocks are concerned,
behaviour is more predictable. The murder of Mexican presidential candidate
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio on Thursday deflated global markets that were
already nervous after the US Federal Reserve had signalled a further
quarter-point rise in short-term interest rates on Tuesday. It has been a
dismal week for bond and equity investors, who have been swept along by a
strongly bearish tide since early February.
There is a growing political factor at work in markets. Putative plots in
Moscow and the threat of civil war in the Crimea are a nagging worry for
bond markets in Europe. In Japan, the unpredictable behaviour of North Korea
over a nuclear capability that may or may not be real has played a similar
role in unnerving yen bonds. Whitewater continues to undermine the political
authority of the Clinton administration, while giving rise to fears that the
president will try to extract himself from political trouble by pursuing a
more populist, and thus destructive, trade policy.
A more predictable influence is the electoral timetable, notably in Europe.
Apart from the Italian elections this weekend, there is a federal election
in Germany in October, while France has a presidential election in 1995.
Here the impact on markets is more subtly corrosive, because of the
longer-run political pressures on fiscal policy. Since the Amato
government's savage attack on the oversize budget deficit last year, the
government under Mr Ciampi has been blown off fiscal course.
Whatever coalition ultimately emerges from the present electoral process in
Italy, it would be ill advised to pursue anything other than an orthodox
budgetary path, given that public sector debt will exceed 120 per cent of
GDP by mid-decade. Yet media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi has been wooing
voters with promises of tax cuts.
Substantial subsidy
Perhaps more surprising has been the French government's backsliding on the
fiscal virtue so painfully acquired in the 1980s. This week's huge injection
of capital into the state-owned loss-making bank, Credit Lyonnais, comes
close on the heels of the substantial subsidy for Air France. Mr Edouard
Balladur, a potential presidential candidate whose poll rating is sinking,
appears ready to incur heavy economic costs in an attempt to restrain the
rise in the political temperature.
This is worrying for those who hope that the European markets will
ultimately uncouple from the US, leaving room for a recovery in European
bond prices. Apparently high real (inflation-adjusted) rates of interest may
be lower than they look if people are over-sanguine about the durability of
disinflation. Also worrying is the fact that the general trend in short-term
interest rates outside the US is either static or falling too slowly to
offer much of a gravitational pull for bond yields. In the UK, where
recovery is well established, a less benign than expected set of inflation
figures this week has made it harder for the chancellor to push for a rate
cut. In Germany and France, the beginnings of recovery are clearly
perceptible, implying that the scope for further cuts is limited.
Even in Japan, which has lagged the rest of the world on its way to the
upturn, the central bank governor Mr Yasushi Mieno has been suggesting that
the recession is past its trough. That, too, carries a hint that further
monetary easing is not on.
Subdued recovery
Paradoxically, the good news for markets may be precisely that recovery
outside the US looks like being subdued. Labour market weakness in parts of
continental Europe and Japan is a dampening influence on demand. Another
dampener is the recent rise in bond yields, since long-term interest rates
in continental Europe have a greater influence on real activity than in the
English-speaking economies where short rates are more important. That
suggests that neither inflationary pressure, nor the pressure of demand on
the global pool of capital, will prove unmanageable and that the the panic
in bonds is overdone.
The trouble with forecasting an end to a correction of this kind is that
markets overshoot. As Professor Gordon Pepper points out in his new book,
Money, Credit and Asset Prices, there are times when a degree in crowd
psychology might provide greater understanding of financial market behaviour
than a degree in economics. Expectations of a change in financial forces
can, he argues, cause a bunching of speculative transactions, leading to
volatile and disorderly markets.
At present, neurosis prevails and the central bankers lack the appropriate
bedside manner. Just as the Fed's earlier policy of small and repeated rate
cuts encouraged investors constantly to hope for more, gradual increases are
now causing fear to become self-feeding. The correction may have gone too
far. Yet it requires boldness to act on the assumption that it will not go
even further next week.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Man in the News: Canny operator draws world's eye - Alan
Greenspan / The political skills of the US Federal Reserve chairman are
being tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As US interest rates rose another notch this week, traders in London and
other European financial centres were reminded that the German Bundesbank is
not the only star in the monetary firmament. The US Federal Reserve is still
the world's most powerful central bank and its decision to start tightening
monetary policy while many of America's trading partners are still
economically depressed has sent shivers through bond markets from New York
to Tokyo.
It has also irritated the White House, which believes the Fed may be
overreacting to what are still only tentative signs of mild upward pressure
on inflation. Last week, President Bill Clinton summoned Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, to the White House for talks on economic policy. In
financial markets the ill-timed meeting was seen (perhaps unfairly) as a
blatant attempt to put pressure on Mr Greenspan. The Fed would probably have
increased rates anyway this week, but the administration's clumsy
intervention settled matters since inaction would have raised doubts about
the Fed's independence.
Critics fear that a tighter US monetary policy will slow the pace of
economic recovery which, on Main Street, is seen as having only just got
going. US banks are already raising their prime lending rates and mortgage
rates are up sharply, reflecting the steep increase in bond yields. The
Fed's action need not have much impact on growth overseas, but probably will
because European central banks are reluctant to see their currencies
depreciate against the dollar. To prevent depreciation, they may postpone or
abandon planned rate cuts.
Although the White House and the Fed disagree on policy, there is little
sign of personal animosity. As policymakers Mr Clinton and Mr Greenspan
share a love of detail; there is every sign that the White House appreciates
the quality of Mr Greenspan's economic advice, which many regard as the best
available in Washington. The Fed chief, a Reagan appointee in a city run by
Democrats, has also deliberately courted the Clintons. He sat next to
Hillary Rodham Clinton during the presentation of the White House economic
plan to Congress last year and subsequently pronounced the deficit-cutting
measures 'credible'.
Since the plan included the biggest tax increase on the wealthy in decades,
conservatives were infuriated. It seemed a strange lapse for a former
disciple of Ayn Rand, the ultra-libertarian author. But it stood Mr
Greenspan, a canny political operator, in good stead. So far, Mr Clinton has
refused to support congressional calls for legislation to reduce the Fed's
independence. And he has offered only lukewarm support for a Treasury plan
to strip the Fed of its powers as a bank regulator. Even on interest rates,
Mr Clinton is showing more restraint than George Bush, so far expressing
only mild misgivings in public about Fed policy.
Mr Greenspan has thus played his cards shrewdly. Administration officials
doubtless also appreciate the fact that the Fed chief, the most powerful
figure in international finance, is so willing to keep out of the public
eye. A fixture on the Washington media and political cocktail circuit (his
girlfriend Ms Andrea Mitchell is a reporter for NBC television), he often
meets privately with journalists. But he refuses to give on-the-record
interviews and unlike other top economic officials he never appears on TV
shows. The public knows him mainly through his dry, rather technical
testimony before congressional committees. The image he cultivates is of a
courteous, knowledgeable and pragmatic civil servant.
Occasionally, however, Mr Greenspan lets slip his private views and these
suggest a more radical temperament. For example, he advocates the abolition
of capital gains tax - not a view shared by many moderate Republicans. And
he recently shocked Democrats by admitting he was a bit of a gold bug. He
claimed that the gold price was a good indicator of inflation pressures and
even expressed nostalgia for the financial rigour induced by the 19th
century Gold Standard.
His views on the role of central banks are sometimes misunderstood. When Mr
Gordon Brown, the UK shadow chancellor, passed through Washington recently,
he naturally called on Mr Greenspan. Mr Brown's aides came out of the
meeting deeply impressed - Mr Greenspan apparently said the task of a
central banks was to promote economic growth as well as to control
inflation, thus distancing himself from the sterner rhetoric of his European
colleagues.
Sensitive to his audience, Mr Greenspan probably failed to add that his
recipe for stimulating growth is to push for zero inflation or 'price
stability' - not a policy that the British Labour party is likely to
endorse. Mr Greenspan defines price stability as inflation so low that it
can be ignored because it no longer interferes with the microeconomic role
of relative prices in guiding resource allocation. He does not think the US
has yet reached this goal even though many economists believe the true rate
of inflation is lower than the 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent shown by the
consumer price index.
If Mr Greenspan fears anything more than inflation, it is financial
instability. He reacted to the 1987 stock market crash in textbook fashion
by making unlimited liquidity available to endangered financial
institutions. He cut interest rates more rapidly in the early 1990s than
most central banks thought prudent because he feared the combination of
excessive borrowing in the 1980s and falling real estate prices might
threaten the stability of the US banking system. With hindsight the Fed's
policy looks finely judged: the US has emerged strongly from recession and
inflation, so far, has stayed subdued.
Cutting interest rates is easy. But Mr Greenspan has now embarked on what
may prove a long upward path. During the recession his 'gradualist' approach
 -lots of small quarter or, occasionally, half point interest rate cuts -
worked well. If the financial markets discounted future cuts all well and
good: share and bond prices simply surged, providing an additional economic
stimulus. But Mr Greenspan is now discovering that gradualism on the way up
is a little more problematic.
The Fed hoped that by raising short-term rates promptly it would convince
markets that it was serious about preventing a resurgence of inflation as
the recovery matures. In theory greater confidence that inflation would
remain low ought to have countered upward pressure on long bond yields
caused by higher borrowing needs as companies expand capacity to meet
increased demand. But this has not happened mainly because markets are
betting that Mr Greenspan's gradualist strategy will involve many future
rate rises.
Some Wall Street analysts are urging the Fed to act more boldly. If, instead
of nudging rates higher, Mr Greenspan quickly raised rates to a 'neutral'
level consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth, say 4-5 per cent,
markets might regain their composure. On this view, nothing is more
destabilising than the present 'drip drip' approach which critics dub
Chinese water torture.
While occasionally quibbling with his judgments, Wall Street nevertheless
regards Mr Greenspan as a class act. He has more than filled the shoes of
his admired predecessor Paul Volcker, partly because he brought diverse
qualities to the top Fed job: intimate knowledge of financial markets
gleaned from decades as a Wall Street consultant, mastery of economic
theory, and prior experience in public service - during the mid-1970s he was
chairman of Gerald Ford's council of economic advisers.
None of the people mentioned by Clinton aides as possible successors can
match this experience - another reason why nerves are on edge in financial
markets. For example, Mr Robert Rubin, the director of the National Economic
Council, is a respected former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, but he lacks Mr
Greenspan's economic expertise. Mr Larry Summers, the Treasury
undersecretary, is another potential candidate, but he lacks practical
experience of financial markets. And although he was an economics professor
he has a reputation as an inflation dove.
Mr Greenspan's critics should perhaps realise that the financial outlook
would be darker if he were less eager to nip inflation in the bud. US
interest rates might not be rising now, but if the economy was allowed to
hurtle into capacity constraints, they would eventually be forced into the
stratosphere. Unless Mr Clinton makes an inspired choice (which could
involve reaching out to a Republican), the expiration in 1996 of Mr
Greenspan's second term as Fed chairman could spell the end of a long period
of US monetary stability.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Giants jostle for a place to grow: Trends shaping strategic
thinking in the computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's computer industry, still reeling from three years of recession,
seems set to enter a new, dramatically different, phase. That at any rate
seems to be the conviction of Mr Bill Gates, the restless and relentlessly
ambitious chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest and best known software
house.
In the past few months he has struck a series of deals with cable companies,
telecommunications companies and satellite organisations, which suggest he
wants his software applied in areas far removed from the personal computer
operating systems for which it is best known.
He has also instituted a company-wide reorganisation of Microsoft's sales
and marketing methods. And in what seems a spectacularly speculative move,
he is putting his own money into a venture with Mr Craig McCaw, developer of
the US's largest cellular telephone company, aimed at creating a global
satellite system for data communication.
Meanwhile, Novell, a smaller, less charismatic software house, has this week
struck a number of deals intended to transform it from the industry's
leading network specialist to a broad-based software house.
Novell's moves are fuelling speculation that Microsoft faces its first
serious challenger in a decade. Another view, however, is that Novell has
made its move too late.
Novell paid Dollars 1.4bn of its own stock for WordPerfect, another
Utah-based company which was once market leader in word processing software.
It also paid Borland International, another large US software developer,
Dollars 145m for its 'Quatro Pro' word processing software and the rights to
sell to Borland's database programs. The acquisition of WordPerfect gives
Novell combined revenues of about Dollars 1.9bn compared with Microsoft's
Dollars 3.75bn.
Novell's moves appear, in turn, to have acted as a spur to Microsoft.
Apparently driven by fears that the company was falling behind Novell and
other competitors in the software industry, including Lotus Development
Corporation and Electronic Arts, in marketing, sales and support strategies,
Mr Gates demanded more aggression and competitiveness from his employees.
The company needed to take decisions and act on them faster, he wrote: 'It
is better to take action, make mistakes and be forgiven than to wait and ask
for permission'. (Microsoft's competitors may feel this is rich from a
company currently under investigation by the US Justice Department for
alleged anti-competitive practices.)
Within days of Mr Gates' comments, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, set out
IBM's plans to fight horrendous losses and re-establish a role. (see below).
The impression created is of computer industry giants jostling for postion
in an increasingly competitive business. The problem each faces is that it
is unclear what strategy will prove most effective in the face of three
broad trends.
First, industry leaders expect hardware and software manufacturing to be
concentrated increasingly in the hands of a few large players.
Mr Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, which makes personal
computers, sees conventional mainframes and minicomputers being replaced by
networks of personal computers and powerful network 'servers' based on
increasingly sophisticated PC technology. IBM, Apple and Compaq represent
today's premier division; others will be hard put to displace them.
In the software market, Novell has this week reinforced its position among a
handful of large companies - Microsoft, Computer Associates, Oracle and
Lotus Development Corporation - intent on carving up the cake between them.
At the same time, consolidation is creating specialist powerhouses; the
leaders in desktop publishing Aldus Corporation and Adobe Systems have
agreed to merge, as have Electronic Arts and Broderbund Software, experts in
educational software.
There will be room, however, for small software houses, because as Mr Rosen,
a founding director of Lotus, the developer of the best-selling spreadsheet
1-2-3, says: 'Talented software designers do not like working for big
companies.'
Second, the spread of common standards and sophisticated software has
allowed the development of programs which integrate with other
manufacturers' systems. Here Novell is in a strong position, dominating the
market in networking software. It also owns the rights to Unix, networking
software originally developed for minicomputers which many believe ideal for
today's more powerful PCs to run company-wide networks.
Microsoft has until recently had only a token presence in networking
software. A new operating system it has developed called Windows NT, may
redress the balance.
Third, and possibly the most significant development, has been the emergence
of small and medium-sized companies and individuals as prime consumers of
personal computers and their software.
For the past 40 years the computer industry has supplied the data processing
business - the administrative systems of big companies. Now as hardware and
software prices fall rapidly, individuals and small organisations are buying
personal computers faster than big businesses.
This provides a powerful logic to Microsoft's recent acquisitions and
alliances. It is developing multimedia products with Tele-Communications,
the US cable operator; it bought Soft Image, creators of computer generated
scenes in the film Jurassic Park; this week it invested Dollars 30m in an
advanced wireless data network being built by Mobile Telecommunications
Technologies.
These acquisitions signify a determined move to provide and control the
software that will manage informations flows - business data, education,
news and entertainment - into the home and office. Microsoft's software
would become ubiquitous: controlling radio communications, cable and
satellite links as well as telecommunications lines and compact disks.
Mr Gates says there is usually an eight-year gap between him spotting an
opportunity and the profits flowing: 'For some reason, I think this will
happen faster than that'.
Novell's strategy is different. It is taking Microsoft on in the traditional
business of data processing. The rewards seem likely to be reasonable but
the possibilities are limited. If Mr Gates is right about the future of the
industry, Novell will have invested in the wrong market.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Rural poverty 'hidden by cloak of prosperity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An influx of wealthy people has cast a 'cloak of prosperity' over the
English countryside which hides the poverty, inequality and isolation faced
by at least a fifth of rural households, says a study to be published next
week.
The report by the Rural Development Commission, a government agency, also
finds evidence of a significant 'black economy' in rural areas.
At least 20 per cent of households were living on or below the poverty line
in nine of the 12 counties surveyed, the report says. Even in well-heeled
West Sussex, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire between 20 per cent and 30
per cent of wage-earners in households had gross salaries below Pounds
8,000.
'The juxtaposition of wealth and poverty merely heightens the relative
impact of low-income lifestyles in these areas,' says the report by Bristol
University researchers.
During the 1980s, many well-off, mobile people moved into villages to retire
or commute to jobs in towns and cities, creating an image of affluence, it
says.
'The increasingly common assumption of countryside people as two-car-owning
merito-cracies can only serve to hide the plight of the non-mobile minority
in gaining access to basic and necessary lifestyle opportunities.'
The report was funded jointly by the Rural Development Commission, the
Department of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council,
a government agency. It was based on questionnaires from more than 3,000
households in 12 areas in England in 1990.
It argues for more government action to create jobs, fill the 'vacuum of
affordable property for rent' and improve public transport and other
services.
Migration to the countryside is not confined to the better-off, the study
says. 'The incidence of low-income households appeared to be being
reproduced in most areas through the 'in-migration' of a significant number
of lower-income households.' This runs counter to suggestions that rural
deprivation will disappear as disadvantaged groups 'move out or die off', it
says.
More than 60 per cent of respondents in most counties surveyed - 90 per cent
in North Yorkshire - believed local people, especially young married
couples, faced difficulty gaining access to accommodation.
Between 54 per cent and 74 per cent considered that there were 'significant
employment disadvantages'. But there was also evidence of a vigorous black
economy in many areas. 'Second jobs (done by) 'foreigners' or 'moonlighting'
 -or casual work done by those who would otherwise be unemployed - appeared
to be significant if hidden aspects of economic life.'
More than 90 per cent of people in six counties and more than 80 per cent in
two others believed public transport had declined while 16 per cent of
households had no car and 23 per cent of women had no access to a car.
For many country-dwellers, there is the compensation of a close-knit
community, proximity to nature, and being happy and healthy, says the
report.
'However, our surveys also emphasised that the experiences of these
characteristics can be highly differentiated. One person's splendid
isolation was another's loneliness; the close-knit community for many can be
prying, gossiping intrusion for others.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Reynolds casts for Ulster peace catch: The tactics of Irish
ministers may be a reminder of the nation's favourite sporting pastimes, but
they have caused confusion among those who think the joint declaration is
being undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed from London or Belfast, the Dublin government's recent efforts to
bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to the Northern Ireland
negotiating table have on occasion appeared contradictory, confusing and -
to unionist eyes at least - full of menace and duplicity.
At one moment Irish ministers stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their British
counterparts, insisting that there would be no concessions to Sinn Fein
without a permanent IRA ceasefire. At the next they appeared to change tack.
Having signed the Downing Street declaration in December, the Irish republic
lifted its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein in January and then made various
direct and indirect communications to Sinn Fein to spell out its
interpretation of the joint declaration.
Dublin has insisted that no deadlines will be put on Sinn Fein's acceptance
or rejection of the declaration. Last weekend, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, said a temporary ceasefire by the IRA would be 'welcome'.
So is Dublin undermining the joint declaration? Or is it that the Irish
government's recent manoeuvrings are simply a translation into politics of
two of the country's favourite pastimes - horse-racing and fly-fishing? Mr
Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, is a keen racegoer and has a reputation
as a man prepared to take a gamble in politics.
With the joint declaration he has in effect studied the form, checked the
going, and placed his bet that Sinn Fein and the IRA will eventually
renounce violence and enter the negotiating process.
Meanwhile, with the skills and patience of a fly-fisherman, he has
repeatedly cast his vision of Ireland's future past the suspicious eyes of
the North's republicans. He changes the 'fly' to suit the latest shifts in
wind or weather, but always with the same intention - to catch the biggest
fish in the history of the Irish state, an end to the IRA's military
campaign and the prize of peace in Northern Ireland.
One prominent Northern Ireland politician said recently: 'Sinn Fein is like
a salmon on a hook. It darts this way and that and puts up a tremendous
struggle to escape. But if you play it in gently, you will eventually land
it.'
Dublin has made no secret of its view that any efforts to renew political
talks in Northern Ireland are likely to founder without an end to the IRA
military campaign. It has therefore spared no effort to explain to Sinn
Fein's leaders both Dublin's and London's understanding of the joint
declaration, and of the steps that will follow an end to violence.
According to government officials, those contacts continue through
intermediaries. One said: 'The Taoiseach (prime minister) speaks to someone
who then speaks to someone.'
Senior Irish government officials say in private that Mr Reynolds believes
the British government could take similar steps to bring about an IRA
ceasefire without entering into negotiations or making concessions.
Dublin's latest cast is to emphasise that Sinn Fein does not have to accept
the Downing Street declaration as such, but that a permanent end to the IRA
military campaign would be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to what is seen as
the next phase of the peace process - the establishment of a Forum of Peace
and Reconciliation in the republic.
The forum was referred to in the joint declaration as a specifically Dublin
initiative, bringing together the nationalist parties of north and south to
work out a common platform from which to negotiate with the unionists and
the British government. Other parties would subsequently be invited to
attend.
It is unrealistic in Dublin's view to impose a precondition on Sinn Fein to
accept the declaration (other than the essential condition that the IRA
abandon its military campaign) when it has already been declared moribund by
the Ulster Unionist party and rejected out of hand by the Democratic
Unionist party. In Northern Ireland it has been welcomed only by the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the moderate Alliance
party.
In a recent interview with a Belfast newspaper Mr Reynolds said: 'Let (the
declaration) be a vehicle for a cessation of violence. If some people in the
republican movement have problems with some of the words in it that's fine.
That should not be a reason for staying away.'
Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring have since insisted that a temporary ceasefire
will not be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to the talks process, especially
as the IRA does not seem to be considering one.
That particular 'fly' has been put away for the moment, it seems, but it
should not come as a surprise if Dublin casts a few new ones across Northern
Ireland's troubled waters in the weeks ahead, as it waits patiently for Sinn
Fein to bite.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Smith urges European rates cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith yesterday called for an immediate co-ordinated cut in European
interest rates to stimulate demand as tax rises begin to bite.
The Labour leader used a speech to the Federation of Small Businesses in
Edinburgh to portray Labour as the natural ally of small companies.
It was a priority for Labour to ensure that the proportion of small
businesses that made the transition into medium-sized enterprises was
increased from only one in 50 at present, he said.
The latest retail sales figures indicated that a cut in interest rates was
needed, he added. They showed that consumer demand had fallen even before
the new batch of tax increases took effect.
In a speech that focused on the problems encountered by small businesses in
raising finance, Mr Smith called for legislation to 'make sure that those
who use late payment (of debts) as a matter of normal practice pay the costs
of that credit.'
He said companies should be required to publish statements on payment
practice and payment records in their annual accounts.
A 30-day period for payment of debt should be a standard in both the public
and the private sectors.
Commenting last night on the Labour leader's remarks, Lord Strathclyde,
minister for small businesses, said the government was taking the idea of
legislating on late payment 'fairly seriously', but there was 'no point in
doing it unless it will make a difference'.
He said the Federation of Small Businesses had told the government it did
not regard legislation as the top priority.
Welcoming recent moves to reduce the sector's dependence on overdraft
finance, Mr Smith nevertheless described the number of companies which took
advantage of the government's loan guarantee scheme for small firms as
'derisory'.
The scheme - whose costs were reduced and scope broadened in the Budget a
year ago - would have to be changed and improved if it was to have any real
impact on access to finance, he said.
Lord Strathclyde said the Budget changes had been 'a great success' with
applications rising and defaults falling.
Mr Smith gave a nod in the direction of the subsidised small business loan
fund that small firm lobbyists have long called for, saying Labour might set
up a private-sector managed investment fund to channel investment from
elsewhere in the private sector.
He said there was no reason why mutual guarantee schemes, of the type used
to raise capital by companies in some European countries, could not be made
to work in Britain.
The Labour leader also stole some of the government's clothes, calling for a
crackdown on unnecessary red tape and a network of 'one-stop shops' for
business registration to help cut down on form-filling.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Bidder for Swans may face redundancy bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French company negotiating to buy shipbuilder Swan Hunter may have to
meet the cost of another round of redundancies and then re-employ the staff,
it emerged yesterday.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie could face a redundancy bill of about
Pounds 1.5m. This consideration is likely to influence the price CMN offers
for the Tyneside yard.
Receivers Price Waterhouse this week warned unions that 490 jobs will be at
risk when Swan Hunter hands over the Type 23 frigate Northumberland on May
12, leaving insufficient work for the present 1,038 employees.
CMN is hoping to reach agreement within three weeks on the purchase of Swan
Hunter, conditional on the yard winning from the Ministry of Defence the
refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship - a decision not due to be announced
until July 20.
However, because CMN is now in negotiation with the receivers, it could face
the Pounds 1.5m redundancy bill if the gap in workload forces the 490
redundancies prior to its takeover of the yard.
'We are facing the possibility of having to pay for these redundancy costs,
then re-employ these people,' said Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid
team, yesterday.
'It's something we have to take into account in our bid,' he added.
The liability CMN faces should it eventually buy the yard, is enshrined in
the transfer-of-undertakings legislation set out in the 1978 Employment
Protection Act, and subsequent amendments.
A purchaser would also have to make redundancy payments in line with Swan
Hunter's own scheme. The 1,450 employees already made redundant since
receivership last May received the state minimum.
The receivers said yesterday that the cost of paying the 490 people for two
months while waiting for the refit decision would be at least Pounds 1.25m.
They said they were studying options including job sharing, lay-offs and the
possibility of finding other work to avert the redundancies.
Following confusion on Thursday over whether the 490 job losses were
definite, the receivers and unions yesterday discussed the issue. 'There's
no longer the confusion,' said Price Waterhouse afterwards.
The receivers have asked the Ministry of Defence to bring forward a decision
on which of five tenders is to win the Sir Bedivere refit.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Pounds 40m grant for London housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced the allocation of Pounds 40m from its
Estate Action programme to refurbish four council housing estates in London.
Mr Tony Baldry, junior housing minister, told the Commons during a debate on
inner cities that the funds would refurbish 3,500 houses and build 500 new
ones.
Mr Baldry also told MPs the vitality of urban life would be restored by
revised planning guidelines sent to councils this week by Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, which come close to banning retail developments on
greenfield sites.
Labour said the government had no strategy to deal with urban decay, which
had spread across the country since 1979.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Nissan to expand dealer network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, the Japanese car-maker, plans to expand its UK dealer network from
294 to 330 by the end of the year, Kevin Done writes.
Mr Andy Green, sales director of Nissan Motor (GB), said the company aimed
to increase its sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles this year by
18 per cent to 110,000 from 93,650 in 1993.
It is forecasting growth of about 7 per cent in the overall market for new
cars to 1.9m from 1.78m last year. With an expanded dealer network it is
seeking to raise its share of the UK new car market to 5.5 per cent from 5
per cent last year.
Nissan is seeking to rebuild its share of the UK market following the
setbacks it suffered during its legal battle with Nissan UK, its former
independent importer/distributor. It took direct control of its UK sales and
marketing operations in 1992.
Nissan also plans to change its vehicle distribution system with the
creation of a central vehicle storage centre in Sunderland.

FT  26 MAR 94 / M&amp;S withholds lottery endorsement: Branson foundation must
wait until result of bidding is announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson's Lottery Foundation has failed to win a formal
endorsement from Marks and Spencer before the winner of the race to run the
National Lottery is announced.
Mr Branson, who has launched the lottery bid with Lord Young, the former
trade and industry secretary, hoped the retail group would back the bid
because, unlike the other seven bidders, the foundation plans to hand all
the profits to charity.
When the bids were submitted in February, Mr Branson said M &amp; S was
'inclined to support' his bid and would decide in March whether to put
foundation computer terminals in its stores. This would have been a coup for
the foundation. The impression was given that M &amp; S might refuse to get
involved with other bidders.
In fact M &amp; S has decided not to endorse any bidder and will wait until the
Office of the National Lottery has chosen the winner in May. The store chain
 -which has said it is interested in the Branson/Young approach to running
the National Lottery - will then have talks with the winner to see whether
the company is interested in getting involved.
Meanwhile Rainbow, the consortium put together by Sir Patrick Sheehy,
chairman of BAT Industries, has submitted a detailed contract to the lottery
office on how its proposal would work.
Although Rainbow has bid for the main operator's licence, it intends to
subcontract the main part of the lottery - the on-line network of computer
terminals - to one of its rivals. Rainbow would concentrate on the instant
part of the lottery, the scratch cards. Sir Patrick claims more money would
be raised for good causes if there were competition between two lottery
operators with one specialising in terminals and the other on scratch cards.
Funds from the lottery will be equally divided between five 'good causes' -
the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport. Mr
Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, has said that money should be
spent mainly on capital projects.
Eight consortia have bid for the licence to run the lottery and the winner
is expected to be announced in May.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Investigators start search for train crash causes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crash investigators were last night trying to discover why two trains
carrying more than 150 passengers collided yesterday injuring 35 people, two
of them seriously.
The accident happened at Newton Abbot station in Devon just before 10am when
a Paignton-Cardiff train ran at low speed into the back of a stationery
InterCity train.
Some passengers were trapped in the crash and had to be freed by
firefighters, but most needed only minor treatment in hospital for
'whiplash' injuries, cuts and bruises.
Rail services were disrupted, but resumed later. British Rail said it was
looking at all possible causes of the crash including brakes, signals and
equipment. The Health and Safety Executive and the Railway Inspectorate were
examining both trains.
British Rail has been testing a computerised train safety programme,
Automatic Train Protection, which is intended to take over if a driver takes
a wrong decision or a train fails to respond to signals. Trials have been in
progress on two routes, London to Bristol and London to Aylesbury, for two
years but have been delayed by cash shortages and the complexity of the rail
network.
The cost to the taxpayer of rail privatisation is expected to reach about
Pounds 92m by the end of this month, Mr Roger Freeman, the transport
minister, said yesterday. He said the costs were small in relation to the
size of the business and the benefits of reform.
The government had made 'full financial provision' to BR and Railtrack, the
state-owned company set up to run BR's track and signalling after
privatisation, so there would be no effect on passenger services.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Howard backs new body to review criminal cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals for a new independent body to take over investigating
alleged miscarriages of justice from the Home Office were presented
yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary.
The Criminal Cases Review Authority was recommended by last year's report of
the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. It would act as a body of last
resort after normal avenues of appeal had been exhausted, and would have the
power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal.
The Home Office reviews about 700 cases a year, with the home secretary
referring about 10 to the of Appeal. Between October 1988 and March 1993 the
government paid Pounds 3.4m in compensation and ex gratia payments to 70
people who had been wrongfully convicted.
Mr Howard, launching a discussion document, said that Home Office thinking
differed from the recommendations of the Royal Commission in two respects.
The government proposes that the authority should have the power to refer
cases to the courts on grounds of sentence as well as conviction. The
government also wants the authority to take on responsibility for
investigating wrongful convictions in cases at magistrates' courts.
At the moment, once appeal procedures have been exhausted in summary cases,
errors can be corrected only by exercise of the royal prerogative.
Mr Howard said he hoped to introduce legislation as soon as possible but
could not guarantee space in the parliamentary programme next year.
Asked why he had delayed nine months before issuing a discussion paper based
almost exactly on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, Mr Howard
said it was important not to rush matters which involved such 'major
constitutional change'.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Braer captain escapes action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The master of the Braer oil tanker, which was wrecked in stormy seas off
Shetland in January last year, is not to be prosecuted.
Law officials in Edinburgh confirmed yesterday that no criminal proceedings
are to be launched against anyone over the incident, in which more than
85,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the sea.
No reason for the decision was given by the Crown Office in Edinburgh. Mr
Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, said he would seek
an explanation from Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the Lord Advocate.
The master of the Braer, Captain Alexandros Gelis, was criticised in a
report last January by the Department of Transport's marine accident
investigation branch.
It blamed him for failing to deal with steel tubes that broke loose on the
deck of the Braer and smashed into fuel tank vents, leading to fuel
contamination and engine failure.
Mr Wallace said that if yesterday's decision was taken on 'policy' grounds,
it would be a matter for concern. However, if it was felt there was
insufficient evidence to make a case beyond reasonable doubt, that decision
was for the Crown lawyers.
The decision not to prosecute does not prevent civil proceedings, but
Shetland Islands Council said yesterday that it would not pursue that
course.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Loophole in data protection to be shut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office is to close a legal loophole that could allow people to gain
unauthorised access to personal data held on computers.
Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, welcomed the move, announced in
Parliament on Thursday.
It follows his call last year for a tightening of the law to cover third
parties who obtain electronic personal data by deceit from organisations
such as banks and health authorities.
The British Bankers' Association said it was delighted by the Home Office's
plans and echoed the registrar's concern that individuals and agents
specialising in supplying private information have been using deception to
get at information such as bank balances and account numbers, pension
arrangements and salary details.
Although the Data Protection Act, the Theft Act and the Computer Misuse Act
are designed to guard such information, it is still difficult for courts to
prosecute individuals and agencies who gain unauthorised access by
deception. The amendment would make such procurement a criminal offence.
Earl Ferrers made the announcement in response to a question by Baroness
Nicol, who expressed concerns that 'several members of this House received
an offer of services from ACT Investigations Group offering . . . to supply
for payment details of personal telephone calls, of mortgage repayments, of
bank balances and of arrears on electricity and other bills'.
ACT said it 'does not obtain information by deception, but we could not be
responsible for all the third parties we deal with'.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Plea on libel action rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two environmental campaign-ers yesterday failed to persuade a court to let a
jury decide the libel action brought against them by the McDonald's
fast-food empire.
Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel of London Greenpeace - which has no
connection with Greenpeace International - are being sued over a leaflet
they distributed between October 1989 and April 1990 entitled: 'What's wrong
with McDonald's?'
It contained a number of allegations against the multinational corporation
including claims of a relationship between its food and illnesses such as
cancer, diabetes, heart disease and food poisoning.
The leaflet also attacked the fast-food chain's employment practices and the
alleged effect of some of their policies on the environment.
Mr Morris, 39, and Ms Steel, 28, who will represent themselves when the case
is heard within the next few months, were anxious that the issues should be
decided by a jury.
But Lord Justice Neill, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice
Steyn and Lord Justice Peter Gibson, upheld an earlier ruling that the case
should be tried by a judge alone.
He said that the issues relating to the safety of the company's food were of
such importance as to require careful and prolonged examination and
evaluation of the scientific evidence and available literature.
In the interests of both parties and of a fair trial of the issues it was
imperative that any decisions should be recorded in a detailed and reasoned
judgment.
Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Lloyds raps investment watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another cloud was cast over the Personal Investment Authority, the new
regulator to protect private investors, yesterday when Lloyds Bank described
the PIA proposals as 'seriously flawed'.
The comment came a day after Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, said
it would not apply to join the PIA but would insist on its right to be
regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
financial watchdog.
Lloyds, the high street bank which sells life insurance through its Lloyds
Abbey Life arm, said the new regulator offered 'neither the merits of
genuine self-regulation nor the settled framework and clear accountability
of regulation by a statutory body'.
The bank has so far stopped short of refusing to join the new regulator, but
the fact that it is prepared to make public its reservations at this late
stage will be a blow to the PIA, which is due to take over as the regulator
for retail financial services in July.
Its formation has been the subject of fierce controversy within the
financial services sector, and many organisations which have said they will
join have done so without enthusiasm.
Now the PIA's supporters are lobbying to ensure that important groups in the
sector, which have not yet declared their hand, will sign up for the new
watchdog. Earlier this week, Halifax, the UK's largest building society,
said it had 'serious reservations' about the PIA.
TSB, National Westminster and Barclays banks have either applied or made
clear that they will do so. Midland has yet to make an announcement.
While the position of some banks and building societies is still in the
balance, there is growing confidence at the PIA that even life insurers
which do not like the proposals - such as Friends Provident - will apply.
The government has made clear its determination to see that the PIA goes
ahead on schedule. But the political controversy over the plans will
intensify next Wednesday, when ministers will come under renewed pressure to
defend their preferred regulatory system in a Commons debate.
Labour, which has called the debate on personal pensions and regulation,
will use the occasion to press the government to respond to Prudential's
refusal to join the PIA.
Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, said he saw the decision as
symptomatic of significant dissatisfaction among many smaller companies and
independent financial advisers.

FT  26 MAR 94 / OFT chief attacks music charts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that
the way in which the Top 40 music chart was compiled was 'significantly
anti-competitive'.
Sir Bryan confirmed statements by the Office of Fair Trading last month that
the matter would be referred to the Restrictive Practices Court.
He said he was concerned about agreements under which the British
Association of Record Dealers undertakes not to supply sales information for
the compilation of the charts to anyone other than the Chart Information
Network and its research contractor.
The network earlier this year awarded the contract to compile the charts to
Millward Brown, a research company. The contract had previously been held by
Gallup, the polling organisation. Sir Bryan is asking the court to examine
both contracts.
The network is jointly owned by the British Phonographic Industry, the music
companies' trade body, and Spotlight Publications, publishers of Music Week.
Spotlight is owned by United Newspapers.
After Millward Brown won the contract, Gallup complained to the OFT that it
should continue to have access to sales data so that it could compile an
alternative to the official charts. Gallup yesterday welcomed Sir Bryan's
announcement.
Ms Catharine Pusey, the network's charts director, said: 'We will be
vigorously defending our agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court.
The only complaint to date about the arrangements has been from Gallup,
which was content to participate in and benefit from them for a number of
years.'
Mr John Pinder, Gallup's charts director, said that his company had never
asked for the exclusive right to record dealer information that it had under
the previous agreement.

FT  26 MAR 94 / BA fare cuts set to spark price war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday announced a package of bargain fares for customers
booking within the next three weeks.
The cuts, ranging from a third to a half, have been made in an attempt to
attract more leisure travellers.
Virgin Atlantic immediately pledged to file new fares in the next few days
to counter the BA move. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chief, said: 'We will
never let BA undercut us.'
BA said savings of more than Pounds 300 could be made on trips to the Far
East or Mexico, Pounds 200 to the Caribbean and Pounds 100 to the US, South
Africa and Europe. Trips to Europe or North America must include a Saturday
night and those elsewhere must be for at least a week.
Backed by a Pounds 3m advertising campaign, tickets go on sale today and
include return flights from London to New York for Pounds 239 - saving
Pounds 110 on the lowest BA fare.
Under the World Offers scheme, which lasts until April 15, a ticket to
Mexico will cost Pounds 349 (saving Pounds 387); and Jamaica will cost
Pounds 539 (saving Pounds 250).
Mr Robert Ayling, BA group managing director, said yesterday: 'We want to be
the leisure traveller's favourite airline as well as the business
traveller's'
BA added that these discounted fares are not eligible for air miles on their
Executive Club frequent flyer programme. Only full-fare tickets are eligible
for air mile credits.

public interest immunity (PII) during the Matrix Churchill trial.
In his final day giving evidence to the Scott inquiry, Sir Nicholas admitted
that both the trial judge and prosecuting counsel should have been told by
government lawyers from the Treasury Solicitor's Department that Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had objected to signing a PII
certificate.
Although insisting he was not trying to evade his responsibilities as the
minister responsible for supervising Treasury Solicitor's Department
lawyers, Sir Nicholas said he could not be expected to 'second-guess' the
way they carried out their work.
Mr Heseltine had been concerned that the PII certificate, which attempted to
prevent official documents being disclosed to the defence, would endanger
the chances of a fair trial. He consulted Sir Nicholas who then instructed
him that he was under a duty to claim PII and had no discretion in the
matter.
Sir Nicholas said he had trusted lawyers in the Treasury Solicitor's
Department to pass on the correspondence between himself and Mr Heseltine on
the issue to Mr Alan Moses QC, the chief prosecutor.
This had not been done and the failure meant the case for claiming PII was
wrongly argued by Mr Moses to the judge, Sir Nicholas admitted.
'There were a number of things that did not happen as they should,' Sir
Nicholas told Lord Justice Scott.
He agreed that instructions given by the government solicitors to Mr Moses
were too brief and misrepresented the position in stating that all ministers
concerned were seeking the disclosure of the documents.
The attorney-general agreed with Lord Justice Scott that it would have been
both possible and preferable for Mr Moses to have told the judge of Mr
Heseltine's concern for the documents to be disclosed.
Sir Nicholas said: 'I am a minister of the Crown. The Treasury Solicitor's
(Department) falls under my responsibility and I accept that.'
However, distancing himself from his staff, he said his job did not include
'day to day' supervision of their activities.
It was impractical for the small team of people in the attorney-general's
office to monitor all the activities of the Treasury Solicitor's Department,
he said.
Sir Nicholas also stated that Mr Moses had given him a firm assurance that
the documents the government wanted withheld would not endanger the
prospects of a fair trial.
Not having seen the documents himself, Sir Nicholas said he had personally
checked this with Mr Moses shortly before the trial started. 'Mr Moses did
indeed confirm it,' he said.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Tecs fear cuts to start-up scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business start-up scheme, which last year helped more than 30,000
unemployed people to become self-employed, may be severely curtailed in the
next few years, local development bodies have warned.
The warning comes from training and enterprise councils, which administer
government training schemes in England and Wales, and from enterprise
agencies, small business advice centres backed by funds from the private and
public sectors.
In the present financial year the scheme, which offers subsidies of about
Pounds 50 a week to unemployed people who want to set up their own
businesses, will cost the Department of Employment Pounds 62m.
From next month the scheme will transfer into the new single regeneration
budget, which brings together programmes from several departments.
Budgets for programmes will no longer be ring-fenced and Tecs, along with
local authorities and other organisations seeking money for economic
development and regeneration, will have to compete for the funds.
Tecs and enterprise agencies fear that the business start-up scheme could
suffer because of a new government emphasis on helping existing businesses,
which offer more prospect for creating jobs.
Their fears have been provoked by a cut of up to 50 per cent in budgets for
business start-ups in the next financial year, which is being treated as a
transitional period.
Mr Malcolm Allen, chief executive of Sussex Tec, said: 'There is concern
among Tecs that the senior regional directors will choose not to re-finance
the scheme because of demands from other areas.'
Mr Peter Brown, general manager of the London Enterprise Agency, said:
'Although concentration on job creation through existing businesses is
laudable I worry about the transfer of resources away from start-ups which
are also a potential job creator.'
The Workstart programme, aimed at getting the long-term unemployed back to
work, is to be extended by six months, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary,
said yesterday.
The pilot schemes will now run at least until the end of September, he said
in a Commons written reply.
The schemes began last summer, offering financial incentives to employers to
take on the long-term jobless.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Ashdown warns on EU reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday warned the European
Union that the next round of institutional reforms will fail unless national
parliaments are involved in negotiations.
Mr Ashdown told the European Movement in Brussels that the Commons 'will not
put up with another Maastricht in terms of being asked to ratify something
that appears to be a fait accompli'.
He said the next inter-governmental conference on EU constitutional reform,
due in 1996, should include both the European parliament and the parliaments
of member states.
He also called for the addition of employment trends to the economic
convergence criteria for European monetary union, from which Britain has
been granted an opt-out.
He said this would mean that 'before the EU could deliver a common currency
 -something which its people suspect - it would first have to deliver
something they welcome - jobs'.
Mr Ashdown's comments reflect the cautious approach being adopted by the
Liberal Democrats in the run-up to the European parliament elections on June
9, when the party expects to win seats for the first time.
Liberal Democrat leaders have played down the party's long-standing
commitment to European integration since last year's tortuous parliamentary
debate on the Maastricht treaty, when the party helped the government to
secure ratification.
However, Mr Ashdown attacked the government's 'negative' opposition to EU
proposals to change the union's qualified majority voting system after the
accession of Austria and three Scandinavian countries.
Accusing the government of 'playing the nationalist card,' he said it was in
Britain's interests to have a workable qualified majority voting system to
promote agricultural reform, rather than allowing 'stubborn minorities' to
defend vested interests.
'Maintaining the unity of the Conservative party by appeasing the nihilists
on the right is not a vital national interest,' he said.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Senior ministers combine fire on competition: Tories in
Plymouth launch blunt attacks - Alternative leaders discussed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading government figures launched blunt attacks on Labour and the Liberal
Democrats yesterday as the Conservative party kicked off its campaign for
the local and European elections.
In a series of speeches at the Conservative Central Council in Plymouth,
cabinet ministers gave detailed appraisals of the policies being carried out
by their departments.
However, most of their effort was concentrated on attacking the opposition
parties, with as much time spent deriding the Liberal Democrats as the main
opposition.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, promised delegates that the party was
fully committed to fighting both election campaigns, and had organised 'the
biggest series of ministerial tours outside a general election'.
But, amid several swipes at the Labour leadership, Sir Norman underlined the
impression given in recent days that Tory party managers see the Liberal
Democrats as the biggest threat. 'In May and June, we must take the attack
to the Liberals,' he said. 'They have had a free ride for too long.'
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, made a detailed attack on Labour's
economic policies, arguing that its commitment to a statutory minimum wage
and full employment was 'socialist nonsense'.
He added: 'If the trade unions want to end their years of decline, they must
sever their links with this sort of dogma. They must get back to the
workplace, selling their services to their members.'
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, emphasised that his tough stance on
punishing and preventing crime would not be undermined by recent reverses in
the House of Lords.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, hinted that reductions in his
department's Pounds 80bn expenditure on welfare benefits were still
essential if the government was to get a firm grip on public expenditure.
However, he underlined that there was no question of ministers making any
changes to the universal state pension. 'We Conservatives won't means-test
your pension,' Mr Lilley said. 'We have no intention of punishing the
prudent, and the basic pension is a platform people can build on.'
Speaking in Bath, the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, said Liberal Democrat
proposals for a carbon tax along with value added tax on domestic fuel at 5
per cent would cost the average household Pounds 160 a year.
He said the effect on the less well-off would be proportionately greater.
Mr Clarke added that Liberal Democrat proposals to raise income tax, to
limit the personal allowance and to increase National Insurance
contributions for the self-employed added up to a 'devastating tax demand'.
Accusing the Liberal Democrats of saying one thing and doing another, Mr
Clarke said the party was 'as usual . . . trying to have it both ways'. The
chancellor added that while claiming to be 'green' with Friends of the
Earth, the Liberal Democrats simultaneously condemned VAT on fuel as a
'death tax' even though they had once advocated it.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Lib Dems play down fresh race row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Embarrassed Liberal Democrat leaders were yesterday playing down the second
race-relations controversy involving the party's controversial Tower Hamlets
branch in three months.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said attempts by Tower Hamlets activists to
achieve an 'ethnically balanced' election ticket were 'well-intentioned, but
misguided'.
Mr Ashdown was responding to disclosures that a ballot of members in two
wards in the Liberal-Democrat controlled east London borough had been used
to produce a mix of white, Asian and Afro-Caribbean candidates for the local
elections in May. The disclosures were doubly embarrassing for Mr Ashdown,
who warned last month that the politics of race must not be allowed to get a
grip in London's east end.
The issue is sensitive for the Liberal Democrats after the internal party
inquiry last year, which ruled that some of the party's activists in Tower
Hamlets had pandered to racist sentiment during the Isle of Dogs by-election
campaign. The poll was won by the extremist British National Party (BNP),
which could win further east London seats in May.
Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat's London region, said the
Tower Hamlets party was trying to fight racism by fielding a slate of
candidates reflecting the borough's complex ethnic mix.
'There was no attempt to be racist by anyone,' he said. 'Their view was that
a balanced ticket reflecting the makeup of the area was the best way of
defeating the BNP.'
Tower Hamlets party leaders are expected to meet tomorrow to recount the
ballot results without regard to ethnic background.

Cinema admissions in the last quarter of 1993 were 25.7 per cent below the
figure in the third quarter, say Central Statistical Office figures, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
The fall comes against a background of rising cinema admissions in the UK.
There were an estimated 22.6m admissions in the period and 1,625 screens
were operating at 511 sites with average revenue per screen of Pounds
38,600. Estimates of cinema activity in the UK are calculated from the
returns made by a small voluntary panel of contributors.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Major supporters who harbour private despair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standing in one of the bars in the Plymouth Pavilion, the young delegate
from the Midlands drew on her cigarette and chose her words carefully.
'Talking on the record, I think John Major is the best leader we could
possibly have,' she said. 'Off the record, I think we need a change of
leader as soon as possible. The situation is desperate.'
Public satisfaction and private despair with the prime minister were much in
evidence in the bars and tea rooms at the Conservative central council
yesterday. Publicly, the 400 delegates who make up the party's most loyal
activists were full of praise for Mr Major: for his negotiating skills, his
human qualities, and a tough stance on Europe.
But cajole the delegate, and ask who they would like to see as party leader
by the end of the year, and it is clear they have thought the issue through
very carefully.
'Heseltine has all the charisma and the punch to give us the impetus we
need,' said a prospective parliamentary candidate, carefully turning over
his conference pass so his name could not be seen. 'He has the leadership
qualities, the oratorical skills, the judgment to bring us victory.'
Another prospective candidate agreed. 'Looking back,' he said, 'I think we
made a mistake not to choose Michael in the last leadership contest.' Six
months ago, Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, might have been
discounted by many for his role in bringing down the last leader. But as one
delegate said: 'All that was aeons ago.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, also had supporters. 'He is a class act,'
said a woman from the west country, 'and the Budget was a technical
triumph.'
There is no doubt that Mr Major retains strong support. 'I have met him
personally and he is stronger than any other candidate,' said Ms Glenys
Hurle-Hobbs, a councillor.
But the praise yesterday was often lukewarm, apologetic. 'He will stay as
long as he wants to stay,' said Mrs Dene Thomas from Brecon and Radnor. 'He
took over at a time of huge difficulty for the country,' said one delegate.
'He has done nothing wrong, it's just that people don't trust him any more.'
By chance, Mr Major, Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke will address the conference
today in what some Tory party managers are lightheartedly calling a beauty
contest.
However some delegates are troubled by deeper issues than who will be their
leader. After six months of revelations about Tory politicians' personal
lives, the Scott inquiry and questions over the accountability of
government, they are voicing fears that the party and its MPs are losing
touch with ordinary people.
'I don't care who is leader,' said a woman who runs one of the largest
constituency associations in the south of England. 'But if there is a
contest, I hope the candidates start it by putting on false moustaches and
glasses, getting out of Westminster and speaking to people.'

FT  26 MAR 94 / Charter Movement defeats three voting motions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigners for greater democracy in the Tory party yesterday said they had
given the leadership 'a bloody nose' in the annual battle over voting rights
at the central council.
The Charter Movement, a Tory splinter group that seeks greater party
accountability, defeated three motions by the national union executive that
would have deprived rank-and-file members of some voting rights.
The first sought to change the rules over the election of members to the
Conservatives' main executive body, the board of management. At present, the
national union executive - which brings together a cross-section of party
organisations - nominates three officials to the board of management. These
nominations must be ratified by the central council, the only body on which
junior members of constituency party organisations are represented.
The motion, which would in effect have deprived the council of its right to
vet the nominations, was passed by 273 votes to 178, but failed to achieve
the two-thirds majority required for inclusion in the rules.
Two other motions, including one which some delegates said would have
created 'oppressive burdens' on the right to convene an emergency meeting of
the central council, were defeated.
The charter group succeeded two years ago in passing a motion to convene an
emergency meeting of the central council to discuss party democracy. Sir
Basil Feldman, the chairman of the national union, has since claimed that
some of the votes in favour of calling the meeting were invalid, and it has
not been convened.
Ms Sharon Spiers, a leading activist in the Charter Movement, said
yesterday: 'Every time delegates come to the central council, they leave
more and more angry.' She said 43 per cent of the rank and file favoured
more democracy for the party's affairs, and in future years the movement
would be able to make far-reaching changes.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Media whip up a Whitewater froth: Bill Clinton stays cool
under press barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was not as if it had been a quiet week. The likely next president of
neighbouring Mexico had been assassinated; there had been coup rumours in
Moscow; North Korea had threatened war on the South; the last US troops were
leaving Somalia; the Fed had raised interest rates again; and budget and
health bills had made progress in Congress. Worthy subjects all for a
presidential press conference.
Not on Thursday night, though, and not to the White House press corps. It
took a journalist - from Honduras of all places - asking the 16th question
(about Mexico) of President Bill Clinton, to break the Whitewater litany.
It sometimes seems the capital's press - plus attendant politicians with
their own motives - is alone in driving the Whitewater story. Polls show a
public growing more concerned about it, but hardly surprising since that is
what they are being fed. One survey found the evening TV news shows over the
last two months had devoted three times as much airtime to Whitewater as
crime and healthcare, which polls suggest the public does care about.
In many respects, Mr Clinton was at his resilient and rational best on
Thursday night, ducking no questions, volunteering more information on his
taxes and Whitewater losses and stoutly denying any wrongdoing. He displayed
no animus - not to the media nor even to Jim Leach, the Republican
Congressman from Iowa, whose afternoon onslaught on the House floor had set
an uncomfortable stage.
He showed again that he is not to be messed with in one-on-one verbal
jousting. One reporter tried to trap him with questions on his
responsibilities towards, and relationship with, the federal agency in
charge of cleaning up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. 'I think
the last thing in the world I should do is to talk to the Treasury
Department about the RTC (Resolution Trust Corporation),' Mr Clinton cracked
back. 'You all have told me that that creates the appearance of impropriety
. . . you can't have it both ways.' He got his only laugh of the evening.
Even his heaviest critics conceded that he had rendered an impressive
performance. 'Cool and confident,' said the Los Angeles Times,
'magnificent,' said Jim Wooten of ABC News, 'well armed,' said the
Washington Post, more grudgingly. Those who had half-expected a Nixonian
'Checkers' speech were disappointed.
But far more serious was the sight of the White House press corps with the
Whitewater bit between its collective teeth - Terry Hunt, AP bureau chief,
Helen Thomas, UPI doyenne, Brit Hume from ABC, Andrea Mitchell of NBC.
They cannot let go now - and nor can their journalistic masters. For some
there are Pulitzer prizes to be won, along with the recognition of their
peers. Many of the younger breed, influenced by Watergate 20 years ago, seem
persuaded that all public servants are only in it for the power and the
money. Older hacks have their reservations, and write them up, but cannot
stem the tide.
Some publications have motivations of their own. The leader writers of the
Wall Street Journal see in Mr Clinton a counter-revolutionary force capable
of wrecking Ronald Reagan's legacy.
They have allowed only three days this month to pass without savage
editorial comment on the Clintons and their friends. Comparable assaults
last year on Mr Vincent Foster, the deputy legal counsel in the White House,
appear to have been a contributory factor to his suicide.
The New York Times, the best newspaper in the country by a city mile, has
always had problems with smart southerners, Presidents Johnson and Carter,
for example. Though much of its reporting has been careful and judicious,
some of its Whitewater stories give the impression that Arkansas is a smelly
object that has crawled out from under a prehistoric rock. A vast article
last week, leading off with Mrs Clinton's profits as a commodities trader in
the late 1970s and suggesting, without hard evidence, that the Clintons had
been bought wholesale by the state's chicken industry, was a classic case in
point.
The Washington Post has been spurred by suggestions that it has been
out-reported on Whitewater by the Washington Times, the arch-conservative
daily owned by a Korean evangelist, Rev Sun Myung Moon. But even one of the
Post's most famous products, Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, confessed
this week he was unimpressed by the quality of much Whitewater reporting.
Some opinion polls point to public concern with the media's Whitewater
obsession.
In this climate, Mr Clinton can only plug away, as he did on Thursday night.
Even the upcoming Easter recess is unlikely to offer much relief.

FT  26 MAR 94 / US turns its back on Somali troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent, and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US troops completed their withdrawal from Somalia yesterday, leaving an
emasculated UN force in charge of a country blighted by cholera, hunger and
banditry.
Virtually all that remains of Operation Restore Hope, launched 15 months ago
and aimed at feeding starving Somalis, is an orphanage in north Mogadishu
which bears its name.
'We are pleased with what we have done,' said Gen Thomas Montgomery, the US
force commander, shortly before boarding a helicopter that would take him to
a flotilla of warships waiting offshore. 'We know there are hundreds of
thousands of Somalis alive because of what we did.'
Ironically, the marine officer organising the departure was Colonel Matthew
Broderick, whose company was the last to evacuate the US embassy in Saigon
towards the end of the Vietnam war in 1975.
'This is an orderly withdrawal ordered by the State Department. Saigon was
anything but an orderly withdrawal,' he said.
US officials have been recalling the humanitarian success of the early days
in Somalia, when US foreign policy had been elevated to philanthropy, to
justify their disengagement from a troublesome country where no strategic
interests are at stake.
A veil has been drawn over the failure of the US-led multinational
peacekeeping force to disarm Somalia's warring clans.
The remaining UN peacekeepers, from African, Arab and Asian countries, have
a limited mandate to protect food convoys and guard key installations, such
as the port, airport and the heavily-fortified UN compound in Mogadishu. But
the UN soldiers have not intervened to halt the growing number of skirmishes
around these installations and looting is increasing.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Exports of toxic waste to be banned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All exports of hazardous wastes from rich countries to poor ones will be
outlawed from the end of 1997, the 64 members of the UN toxic waste
convention decided yesterday. Exports of toxic waste destined for final
disposal rather than recycling will be prohibited immediately.
The ban was greeted with jubilation by environmental groups and developing
countries which have waged a vigorous campaign to halt toxic waste dumping
in the third world and, increasingly, in eastern Europe.
Greenpeace hailed the decision, which was taken by consensus, as 'a striking
victory for global environmental justice'. Mr Chris Lamb, who chaired the
week-long conference of the parties to the Basle convention on transboundary
movement of hazardous wastes, said the international community had taken 'an
historic step'.
The turning point came on Thursday when European Union ministers in Brussels
decided to support the ban from end-1997. This brought into line two strong
opponents of an outright prohibition, Britain and Germany, the world's
biggest toxic waste exporter.
Other dissenters, Australia, Canada and Japan, were then isolated. The
United States, which also opposes a ban, is not a member of the convention
and is not bound by yesterday's decision.
A committee of the 1975 UN convention on international trade in endangered
species (Cites) has decided not to recommend trade sanctions against China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, despite evidence that continued use of
tiger bone and rhino horn for traditional medicines is bringing the
protected species close to extinction.

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A month after the Hebron mosque massacre forced the suspension of
Israeli-PLO peace talks, officials on both sides indicated yesterday that
most of the terms for resumption of negotiations had been agreed.
Israeli and PLO officials intend to meet again in Cairo on Tuesday to
finalise arrangements for the temporary deployment of about 100
lightly-armed Norwegian observers in the West Bank town of Hebron, in
accordance with a UN resolution passed last week, and for the recruitment of
several dozen Palestinian policemen to serve in the town.
Provided these details can be swiftly agreed, the two delegations will
broaden their discussions and focus on the 'Gaza and Jericho first' autonomy
deal - effectively resuming full peace talks.
Before Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 30 Palestinians in Hebron's
Cave of the Patriarchs on February 25, the autonomy deal was close to
completion. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, estimated yesterday
that it could be ready for signing within three weeks.
The Israelis have committed themselves to an accelerated withdrawal of most
of their forces from Gaza and Jericho once the agreement is signed. It is
also believed that the deployment of a first contingent of Palestinian
policemen would go ahead. A senior US official indicated last night that
such a deployment could begin by next Friday.
Signs of a diplomatic breakthrough have done little to ease the tension in
the occupied territories. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a
general strike yesterday in honour of the Hebron massacre victims and a
curfew was imposed on the towns of Ramallah and al-Birah. A Jewish settler
shot dead a West Bank Palestinian who was kneeling in prayer by a highway in
southern Israel.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Paris deal cuts Ivory Coast debt by Dollars 2.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Club of official creditor nations has agreed to a big debt
reduction and rescheduling package that will reduce Ivory Coast's Dollars
15.4bn (Pounds 10.5bn) external debt by at least Dollars 2.5bn.
The agreement is seen as a significant step in long-running efforts to
resolve Africa's crippling external debt crisis. Sub-Saharan African debt
has almost doubled over the past decade and now stands at nearly Dollars
180bn.
Debt service payments are well beyond the capacity of the region and
development agencies and African governments have been calling for a radical
approach to the problem.
A potential beneficiary of the breakthrough in Paris is Nigeria, whose
Dollars 34bn external debt could be reduced by several billion dollars if
the same terms were applied. However, the Nigerian government has failed to
renew a lapsed policy agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
The first stage of the agreement for the Ivory Coast applies only to the
non-concessional official debt totalling Dollars 5bn, and the eventual
benefit will be about half this amount. But it also provides for further
bi-lateral agreements which, when concluded, will lead to further
substantial debt reduction.
Ivory Coast is one of the world's most indebted countries in per capita
terms.
The move, one of the most substantial debt deals offered by the Paris Club,
follows an agreement on economic policy between the West African nation and
the IMF.
The agreement, based on the so-called Trinidad terms of debt relief, is
better than Ivory Coast might have expected. It is ranked as a middle-income
country, while Trinidad terms are usually offered only to the poorest
countries.
France, however, had promised at the time of the 50 per cent devaluation of
the West African CFA franc in January to press for the best possible terms
of debt relief for CFA zone countries, particularly middle-income countries.
Less than half the external debt is owed to official creditors represented
by the Paris Club, according to the latest World Bank figures.
The French Economy Ministry said the Paris Club met on March 23 to discuss
Ivory Coast's debt. The French Treasury acts as secretary to the club.
'(Paris Club members) welcomed the implementation, with the support of the
International Monetary Fund, of an economic adjustment programme and took
note of the very weak per capita income in Ivory Coast and the very big cost
of its debt, justifying, in this case, exceptional treatment in terms of
debt restructuring,' the ministry said.
The terms offer two options: a write-off of 50 per cent of the debt service
obligations due on non-concessional loans and credits and consolidation of
the rest of the debt at market rates over a 23-year period, with six years'
grace.
Alternatively the creditors can consolidate the total debt owed at
concessional interest rates over 23 years so as to reduce by 50 per cent the
net present value of the payments due on non-concessional loans and credits.
The Trinidad terms were first proposed in September 1990 by Mr John Major,
the British prime minister, but implementation has been slow, with the
Japanese government having reservations about the terms offered.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Japan's property prices fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese land prices dropped for the third consecutive year in 1993, writes
Paul Abrahams in Tokyo. The fall, the aftermath of property speculation
during the late 1980s 'bubble economy', is a serious problem for Japan's
banks which hold about Y14,000bn (Pounds 89.7bn) in bad loans, on which most
of the collateral is property.
The National Land Agency said residential property prices fell 4.8 per cent
last year and would fall further this year. That compared with an 8.7 per
cent fall in 1992. Commercial property prices dropped 11.3 per cent on
average, against 11.4 per cent the previous year.
Tokyo has been hit by the collapse in prices far more than other cities. In
many regional cities prices were unchanged or fell only slightly, according
to the agency. However, commercial prices in the capital fell 19 per cent
last year, while in central Tokyo they plunged 23.7 per cent. Residential
prices in central districts fell 24 per cent in 1993.
The continuing strength of the recession in Japan was underlined yesterday
when department stores reported sales down 4.2 per cent in February, against
the same month last year. Cold weather and consumers buying cheaper goods
were partly to blame.

FT  26 MAR 94 / ANC supporters march in Durban

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 100,000 supporters of the African National Congress marched yesterday
through the streets of Durban, in Natal province, to demand the freedom to
vote in South Africa's April elections.
The march was the first event in the ANC's planned mass action campaign
aimed at increasing popular pressure on KwaZulu homeland leader Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is boycotting the poll.
Political moves are also afoot to try to avert a threatened confrontation
between the multi-party Transitional Executive Council and Chief Buthelezi.
President FW de Klerk is expected to meet Chief Buthelezi at the weekend to
seek a political solution to the Natal crisis. He is expected to warn the
KwaZulu leader that if he does not ensure free political campaigning in the
homeland, and perhaps accept that his Inkatha Freedom party participates at
least in provincial elections, the president will have to allow the TEC to
intervene in the homeland's administration.
ANC officials said they did not believe Chief Buthelezi could be legally
removed from power, but that his control over areas such as homeland
policing could be withdrawn. This would be tantamount to toppling him, while
leaving him nominally in control.
They did not believe his government would be overturned by popular protest,
as happened in the Bophuthatswana homeland a fortnight ago.
About a quarter of South Africa's voters are in Natal, raising the risk that
a spoilt poll in the province could cast doubt on the national result.

FT  26 MAR 94 / A tractor driver from Harvard

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The success of a Harvard Business School graduate in seizing control of an
ailing Russian tractor plant this week provides a cautionary tale to
communist-era managers who are trying to rescue plants with old-style
methods doomed to failure.
Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, 42, was elected chief executive officer of the
Vladimir Tractor Plant on Thursday, just nine months after Mr Anatoly
Grishin, the plant's manager for 16 years, blocked his first takeover
attempt. The 60-year-old Mr Grishin convinced the majority of shareholders
that his rival had 'neither the moral right nor the qualifications' to run
the plant.
But Mr Grishin was forced to quit in January after he tried to keep the
plant going by taking out expensive bank loans to pay wages while delivering
goods free of charge to his connections - insolvent enterprises that
promised to pay him later but never did.
Mr Bakaleinnik, who is still officially employed by the International
Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private development arm, was at pains
to explain to a suspicious workforce why he was embracing a Dollars
300-a-month salary to try to turn round a company which has been standing
idle for the best part of four months. 'It's like climbing the Himalayas.
You go up and if you're lucky you come down.' But he has already asked the
IFC to keep a job open for him in Washington should he fail.
The plight of the Vladimir Tractor Plant is typical of many Russian plants
whose problems in a depressed economy have been compounded by gross
mismanagement.
With his western know-how and connections, as well as his plans for
overhauling the company's financial and marketing strategy, Mr Bakaleinnik
is seen, in the words of the plant's acting chief engineer, as a last chance
to 'save the company and the workers who survive in it'.
Mr Grishin's deputy until he went off to Harvard on a government
scholarship, Mr Bakaleinnik ensured his boardroom victory by marshalling the
support of the Russian government and institutional investors, who now hold
54 per cent of the company. His main backer is Renova, a US-Russian joint
venture which spent Dollars 1m acquiring a 17 per cent stake.
Mr Bakaleinnik will now try to raise the Rbs20bn-Rbs25bn (Dollars
11m-Dollars 14m) which he says the company needs this year to complete a
long-delayed modernisation and restructuring programme, which has begun with
efforts to cut the workforce from 14,500 to 10,500.
He will also look for a strategic partner abroad.
The company's bright spot is its hard-currency export market, which accounts
for 14 per cent of its output.
But Mr Bakaleinnik says that the flourishing of a domestic market will
paradoxically depend on the ability of the country's conservative agrarian
lobby - which opposes the radical reforms that made the plant's
privatisation possible in the first place - to extract extra farming
subsidies for peasants to buy his tractors.

Ukraine's Crimea peninsula is marking this weekend's elections for Ukraine's
first post-independence parliament by moving its clocks an hour ahead: to
Moscow time.
It will also be holding an opinion poll, banned by President Leonid Kravchuk
last week as a referendum in disguise, asking citizens if they want
dual-citizenship with Russia, equal status with Kiev and enhanced decree
powers for the region's president.
Crimea is one of three Ukrainian regions holding outlawed plebiscites this
weekend. Donetsk and Lugansk, in eastern Ukraine, will also be asking their
citizens if they support regional autonomy and making Russian an official
language. The polls will have immediate results and pose immediate problems
for Kiev, since they could arm all three regions with a popular mandate to
seek independence from Ukraine.
The outcome of the Ukrainian parliamentary election is likely to be far less
clear and far less immediate.
Election rules require the winner to poll at least 51 per cent in each
district, but with as many as 25 candidates in some districts, most races
will go to a second round of voting on April 10 and results will not be
known until mid-April.

<TEXT>
European foreign ministers will today try to break the stalemate over voting
rights in the European Union, but there seems little prospect of a deal.
Hopes rest on Britain and Spain offering 'a goodwill gesture' which would
avoid a breakdown in negotiations and coax their 10 EU partners into
reciprocal movement at the two-day meeting at Ioannioa, Greece.
'I don't think people are ready psychologically for a deal,' a senior EU
official said yesterday. The best outcome was likely to be an informal
understanding offering the prospect of a settlement before Easter, possibly
at a fifth meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday.
Britain and Spain are insisting on maintaining voting rules allowing two
large Union member states and one small country to block decisions in the
Council of Ministers. The impasse risks delaying the admission of Finland,
Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union next year.
The rotating Greek presidency of the EU, backed by Germany, remains adamant
that the Anglo-Spanish axis must accept an increase in the so-called
blocking minority to take account of the four new members.
Hopes of a compromise rest on a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede
that the blocking minority must rise from 23 to 27 votes. In return,
countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes would obtain an automatic right
to delay decisions for at least two months.
Britain is pressing for a legally binding protocol allowing it to delay
decisions on contentious matters such as social policy. But senior EU
officials said a commitment was 'out of the question' because it would be
rejected by the European Parliament, which must ratify the accession
treaties.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, raised hopes of an eventual deal with
an explicit declaration yesterday that he was prepared to reach a compromise
on the issue. 'We are flexible. We are willing to accommodate. But others
have to be so also,' he said.
Mr Hurd said the UK cabinet had allowed him 'some flexibility' to strike a
deal, but he was uncertain whether an agreement would be reached at the
weekend talks.
The voting rights row will dominate the two days of informal talks, with
little time to address pressing matters such as instability in the Ukraine
and Algeria and prospects for a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Bundesbank warning on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday issued a forceful public warning on the mounting
risks presented by the proliferation of financial derivatives trading in
global markets.
Financial institutions' should take care to install controls to ensure they
had a realistic picture of the dangers faced, Mr Edgar Meister, a central
bank director told a Frankfurt conference.
The difficulties of some managers in understanding the activities of the
analysts and mathematicians, 'today's sorcerer's apprentices', in their
trading departments was a serious problem, he said.
Mr Meister warned that no institution should consider entering the
derivatives business unless it was staffed by people with the necessary
know-how, competent supervisors and high-performance computer and software
systems. The trend towards ever more complex 'hybrid' products, linking
different derivative instruments, made risk assessment ever more difficult,
he said.
Non-bank newcomers to the business, operating outside the scope of banking
supervision, presented a special problem, and more information was needed on
them and their activities, he said.
'Statements to the effect that nothing has happened yet or that there is no
need for additional regulation are just as unhelpful as horror scenarios
such as the often-used picture of young people using their computers to
construct a hydrogen bomb for the financial world,' he said.
Mr Meister suggested that the dangers were often played down with claims
that only the big banks were active and they had risks under control: 'I
cannot accept this attitude and behave as though only good guys were
involved.'
In Germany, where regulation was relatively tight, derivatives trading had
reached a scale where it almost equalled the banking sector's entire
business volume, he said.
In response, the Bundesbank is discussing in detail the extent to which its
statutory obligation to maintain monetary stability was being hampered by
this business. Along with the federal supervisory authorities it was
reviewing the effectiveness of current minimum requirements for derivatives
trading, he added.

Eastern Germany's largest investment project was yesterday saved from

The compromise paves the way for a potentially viable chemical sector in

Had the Leuna oil refinery project collapsed, Buna, the nearby chemical and
olefin complex and a big buyer of refinery products, would have been denied
local supplies.
In 1992, Elf agreed with the Treuhand that it would rebuild the Leuna
refinery in a joint project with Thyssen Handelsunion, a subsidiary of the
German steel group. It agreed to take a 67 per cent stake in the DM4.5bn
(Pounds 1.75bn) project known as Leuna 2000.
In January this year, Elf said it wanted to cut its stake to 35 per cent as
part of a general cost-cutting strategy. However, under the terms of
yesterday's compromise, Elf will reduce its stake by a third.
The company's board is expected to endorse the deal when it meets in Paris
on Monday.
Rosneft, the state-owned Russian oil company, will join the Leuna consortium
by taking up Elf's surrendered 24 per cent share. The stake will be paid for
with crude oil deliveries.
As part of the price for cutting its stake, Elf will give up a third of its
500 petrol stations in eastern Germany.
Access to the region's petrol stations was the driving force behind Elf's
decision to invest in eastern Germany in the first place.
French President Francois Mitterrand had interceded on Elf's behalf, while
the Treuhand linked the company's entree into eastern Germany with
investment in the Leuna oil refinery, which is in the state of Saxony
Anhalt.
The Treuhand said yesterday that it would 'definitely not' be selling off
the lucrative petrol stations, in spite of enormous interest by Shell, and
Aral, the petrol distribution arm of Veba, Germany's large electricity
conglomerate.
Instead, the agency will allocate the stations to Buna, still under the
Treuhand, in a move designed to make the chemical complex an attractive
privatisation project. Thyssen Handelsunion and RAO Gazprom, the state-owned
Russian gas company, earlier this week signed a letter of intent to
negotiate a stake exceeding 25 per cent but less than 50 per cent in Buna.
Buna's privatisation prospects will be further boosted if Thyssen decides to
shed its 33 per cent stake in Leuna after construction. The stake, which
would have passed to Elf, will be passed on to Buna.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Outgoing parliament on trial in Italian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare to see a prime minister as a silent protagonist during a noisy
election campaign. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian premier, has stayed
aloof almost until the end. As the campaign for tomorrow's parliamentary
poll winds up today, he can look back on only one occasion when he broke his
silence.
This was to defend his government's record of economic management against
accusations by the media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi of falsifying the
public accounts. Though said during the heat of a television debate on
Wednesday and directed by Mr Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party,
against his arch-rival Mr Achille Occhetto, the leader of the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), the accusation touched a raw nerve.
Since being called in last April to run the government after 14 years at the
helm of the Bank of Italy, the 73-year-old Mr Ciampi has concentrated on the
public accounts. A curt statement from his office on Thursday, without
naming Mr Berlusconi, said: 'As a result of this serious accusation, I am
obliged to drop the reserve I imposed on myself during the election
campaign.'
Mr Berlusconi yesterday was doing his best to beat an elegant retreat to
avoid any fall-out from the man judged by the polls to be the most popular
public figure.
The incident highlighted the curious nature of these elections for Italy's
12th post-war legislature. The elections involve no challenge to an
incumbent government, which in this case is essentially technocratic with a
non-politician premier.
Mr Ciampi, widely praised for his firm managerial style and for recouping
Italy's international credibility, has refused to stand because he does not
see himself as a politician linked to a particular party.
It is parliament, elected in April 1992, that has lost the confidence of the
electorate as a result of the corruption scandals and collapse of the ruling
parties. The outgoing parliament is on trial; and the electorate is being
asked to decide which of the old parties have been recycled convincingly and
which of the new show promise.
Perversely, Mr Berlusconi, whose Fininvest business empire was built up on
the back of close ties with the discredited Socialists, has succeeded in
portraying himself as the new with his Forza Italia movement. Mr Occhetto,
though representing a party historically opposed to the old order, has
failed to present the PDS as the new.
Rather, in seeking credibility for the PDS-led Progressive Alliance, he has
leaned heavily on Mr Ciampi. Several times he has said Mr Ciampi would be
the PDS's choice to head the next government.
It was the PDS's identification with the Ciampi administration that lay
behind Mr Berlusconi's outburst about the public accounts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of students marched through Paris yesterday in a display
of opposition to a youth wage law, which has become a thorn in the
government's side.
More than 30,000 students were watched by some 2,500 police in riot gear and
another 800 in plain clothes, after Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior
minister, warned that any repetition of the looting on recent marches would
be punished.
However, several hundred demonstrators started throwing stones at police,
who responded with a baton charge and tear gas. The march followed a night
of clashes in Nantes, where a protest turned vicious when protesters hurled
petrol bombs at police.
Several thousand students also demonstrated in Bordeaux and St Etienne
yesterday against the government's move to allow employers the freedom to
pay young workers less than the minimum wage provided they provide some
training.
Students, backed by trade unions and left-wing politicians, have been
calling for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to withdraw completely his youth
wage law, ever since it was published in decree form last month. Mr Balladur
has modified it slightly to take account of complaints by graduates that
their qualifications were being ignored in the pay provisions and also to
tighten the definition of training under the law.
The prime minister now appears to be standing firm, with his interior and
education ministers warning students to stay off the streets.

FT  26 MAR 94 / EU steel deal a camouflage, say officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
They are too polite to use the fudge word. But as officials in Brussels
yesterday digested this week's surprise agreement forged between steelmakers
and Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, the mood in some quarters
was bitter.
Although Mr Bangemann's entourage insists it is delighted that the industry
has apparently met the European Commission's demands for further steel
reductions, in private officials admit the deal may have been little more
than a face-saving camouflage.
'All that has happened is that the problem has been put off for another year
or two - nothing has really been agreed at all,' commented one Commission
official.
From the perspective of some member states, at least, such an analysis may
seem too harsh.
Mr Bangemann's aides point out that his meeting on Wednesday with chiefs of
the big steel producers marked a significant shift in the negotiating
climate. In place of the political posturing which has dogged recent
negotiations, both sides are proclaiming a new climate of 'understanding'.
This involves agreement to aim for cuts totalling some 19m tonnes in
capacity, in exchange for extending the deadline for a restructuring plan
until November.
Furthermore, the steel industry's offer of a moratorium on state aid until
November has been welcomed by the Commission and member states, particularly
in the UK which has recently stepped up its demands that the Commission take
a tougher line on state aid. But with the details of the plan remaining to
be decided, some Commission officials fear that the extension of the
deadline will give the industry more scope to evade the cuts.
The steel market is expected to pick up in the summer, partly on the back of
a recovery in the motor industry, so further cuts are likely to be even less
palatable to the steel sector. These fears have been fuelled by continuing
ambiguities in the new 'understanding', including the source of the extra
reductions.
Although the Commission says the final figure has been boosted by 6m
tonnes-worth of cuts in the Italian private sector and 2m tonnes-worth
through private sector mergers, most probably in Germany, in practice these
figures appear to involve little more than a juggling of earlier offers.
There is also a question over the degree of industry support for the deal.
British Steel, one of the most hawkish of the private sector producers,
reacted cautiously to the deal as it did not attend Wednesday's meeting. But
it said anything which led to subsidies being ended permanently would be
welcomed.
The German steel federation was pleased that talks about capacity cuts had
been extended and that an Ecu240m (Pounds 181.4m) aid package to help pay
for redundancies had not been cancelled. 'The industry needs this. It is not
over the worst yet,' it said. But German producers were not likely to make
any extra capacity cuts.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Italian Elections: An upstart in the heart of Bossi country
 -A Forza Italia candidate for the right in a Northern League stronghold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Raffaele Della Valle is careful not to say so, but as candidate in Monza
for a four-party right-wing alliance in this weekend's Italian elections he
is a cuckoo in the nest.
He belongs to Forza Italia which had a tough job convincing the populist
Northern League to accept him as joint candidate. Monza, a town of 125,000
inhabitants on the northern edge of Milan province, has a League-dominated
council and the party, led by Mr Umberto Bossi, has grown accustomed in its
eight-year life to regarding it as home ground.
But an election victory for Mr Della Valle in this first-past-the post lower
house seat matters greatly to Forza Italia, both within Lombardy, where
Monza is the third largest town, and further afield. He would bring Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's new party considerable prestige as a lawyer famous for
the successful defence of the TV personality Enzo Tortara, who became
Italy's Dreyfus of the 1980s when accused of involvement with drugs and the
Camorra.
Mr Della Valle's chances are said to be strong but his candidature has
thrown up problems for the right wing typical of much of the north. Mr
Bossi's wild attacks on Forza Italia, which he regards as an upstart
stealing League support, have created tension and Mr Della Valle cannot
necessarily count on votes from the more radical League supporters.
Moreover, the chairman of the local industrial association has come out in
favour of the candidate of the centrist Pact for Italy.
Right-wing voters also have the option of the National Alliance, the former
neo-fascists, which has a pact with Forza Italia in the south but not in the
north where it is anathema to the League.
As both the League and Forza Italia have headquarters in Milan, they and the
two smaller parties fighting alongside them expect widespread northern
success. Indeed, in Milan and province Mr Roberto Cipriani, the Forza Italia
co-ordinator, claims the alliance can take 29 of the 31 first-past-the post
seats for the lower house.
For Prof Guido Martinotti of Milan university's political science faculty
the big question is whether Forza Italia backers will vote for League
candidates. 'That is what the other parties are capitalising on,' he says.
As the senior partner in the alliance, League nominees make up the lion's
share of candidates in Milan and province. But the knowledge that they are
shored up by reluctant Forza Italia support would weaken the right if it
entered government. The measure of support for each party will become
apparent in the seats reserved for proportional representation, which
parties fight under their own banners. These represent a quarter of all
seats and, in Milan and province, total 10, on top of the 31
first-past-the-post seats.
Prof Giuseppe Maria Longoni, a historian who lives in Monza, detects falling
support there for the League. 'People thought problems would be sorted out
but there has proved to be no magic potion,' he says. Among these is the
argument over how best to make use of the huge Villa Reale park, inside
which is the Formula One racing car circuit. The League says the track is a
vital Monza asset but the greens have opposed it.
Mr Della Valle's programme, based on making Monza and the neighbouring
Brianza an autonomous province, and setting up a university at Monza, is
certainly not one with which the Northern League would disagree. 'I want to
avoid the risk of Monza becoming absorbed as an outlying district of Milan,'
he says.
Like other Forza Italia candidates, his is not a new face as he used to be a
councillor for the now defunct Liberal party. What Forza Italia is counting
on is that the owners of the small textiles and furniture businesses at
Monza will find that his face inspires confidence in the party as a credible
national force.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Tietemeyer rules out 'hasty' rate reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank cannot simply ignore recent explosive growth in its M3 money
supply measure, nor can it count on continuing falls in import prices to
reduce inflation, Mr Hans Tietemeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday,
writes Christopher Parkes. Ruling out 'hasty' reductions in interest rates,
he told a meeting in Frankfurt the central bank had to keep a close watch on
price developments. Basic trends suggested further easing in price pressure
in the coming months, and February's M3 data, released earlier this week,
showed a slight slowing in monetary growth compared with January. But growth
at an annual rate of 17.6 per cent, compared with the bank's 4-6 per cent
target range, could signal inflation, Mr Tietmeyer said. A February
inflation rate of 3.4 per cent, which he compared with France's 1.8 per
cent, was still clearly too high.

FT  26 MAR 94 / OECD boost as Mexico edges toward stability
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico was recovering yesterday from the initial financial turbulence caused
by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, as a likely successor emerged
to be the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party (PRI).
Markets were reassured by the emergence of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former
budget minister, as the strong favourite to become the party's presidential
candidate and the likely successor to President Carlos Salinas.
Investor confidence was also boosted by the government's announcement that
Mexico will be formally accepted on April 14 as a member of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, the first new entry since 1973.
The US Treasury had helped to restore calm by agreeing to lend up to Dollars
6bn (Pounds 4bn) to Mexico in the event of a run on the currency.
Financial markets were relatively stable. The principal stockmarket index
closed down 0.9 per cent on the first day of trading since the
assassination, but this was mainly in response to sharp falls in New York on
Thursday. The exchange rate weakened a little to 3.35 pesos to the dollar,
after opening at 3.33.
Traders also reported a recovery in Mexican 'Brady bonds', issued in 1990 as
part of the country's debt restructuring.
A PRI official familiar with deliberations over the candidacy said a
decision would probably be taken the week after next.
Mr Zedillo, who was Mr Colosio's campaign manager, is not admired for his
political skills, but has a doctorate in economics from Yale University and
has worked at the central bank. He is expected to carry on the economic
reforms of Mr Salinas.
Mexico's constitution says presidential candidates cannot have held a senior
government position for 180 days before the election. Unless the
constitution was changed, which would be difficult, there are few serious
contenders other than Mr Zedillo.
One other candidate mentioned is Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, the PRI president,
but he has little experience in government. Another possible contender, Mr
Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the troubled southern state of Chiapas,
has ruled himself out of contention.
Mr Colosio was buried yesterday in his home town of Magdalena de Kino, in
the northern state of Sonora.
The man who has confessed to killing him, Mr Mario Aburto Martinez, was
yesterday taken to the capital from the border city of Tijuana, where the
assassination took place.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Clinton steps up attack on cigarette industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday launched a ferocious two-pronged
assault on the cigarette industry, already reeling from a wave of
anti-smoking measures.
As the Labour Department announced plans to ban smoking from the workplace,
federal health officials began an attempt to regulate nicotine as an
addictive drug.
Regulations proposed yesterday by Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary,
would in effect ban smoking from all workplaces, including rest areas,
except in enclosed areas with direct ventilation to the outside.
The proposed rules, which could come into force next year, would stop
smoking in bars and restaurants because no one could be required to work in
an area where smoking was permitted.
Complying with the proposed rules could cost businesses Dollars 8.1bn
(Pounds 5.5bn) in the first year and Dollars 6.6bn a year thereafter. But Mr
Reich said this would be outweighed by a Dollars 15bn a year improvement in
worker productivity. The move follows new evidence of the damage caused by
passive smoking.
However, Mr Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, defended
the cigarette industry, saying: 'I deny that cigarettes cause cancer.'
Dr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug Administration, yesterday
presented a strong case to the House of Representatives health committee for
regulating nicotine as an addictive drug - a move that could lead to the
withdrawal of cigarettes that contain nicotine.
Nicotine 'meets all the criteria of an addictive substance', Dr Kessler told
a House of Representatives health committee yesterday, citing studies
showing that laboratory rats would administer doses of nicotine to
themselves. He suggested cigarette manufacturers were manipulating nicotine
levels in their products. He added that he was aware of no evidence that
manufacturers left nicotine in their cigarettes for any reason other than
addiction.
Dr Kessler's comments implicitly contradicted Philip Morris, maker of
Marlboro cigarettes, which on Thursday filed a Dollars 10bn libel suit
against ABC, the US television network, over allegations of 'spiking' its
cigarettes with nicotine. Philip Morris acknowledges that it removes
nicotine during the manufacturing process and adds it back later, but says
it puts back less than it takes out.
Tobacco companies also face a stiff increase in taxes on their products as
part of the healthcare reform legislation now being considered by Congress.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Hurd hits out at Eurosceptics: Foreign secretary signals
Britain may compromise over votes crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last night acted to roll back the
recent tide of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party by strongly
re-affirming the government's fundamental commitment to the European Union.
In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the cabinet, Mr Hurd
publicly derided those who thought Britain could turn its back on Europe.
The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels remarks earlier this
week of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Hurd's speech to Tory
activists at the party's spring conference in Plymouth, left the impression
he was delivering an implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede
ground to the party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign
secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that Britain could
compromise on the voting issue as long as its European partners give ground.
As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece last night, he
said the dispute would sooner or later be resolved: 'At the end of the day
there is agreement. That's the way the Community works. That's the way it
will work this time.'
Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly veiled rebuke to
those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes row between Britain
and its partners into a broader onslaught against the European Union.
The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet ministers like Mr
Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more recently been echoed by
similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - both
self-avowed pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any
leadership contest.
But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt to the 'lunatic'
discussion of whether they were pro- or anti-European. Instead they had to
grasp the central message: 'The future of Britain rests in Europe.'
Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to reflect his
growing frustration at the way in which the dispute over majority voting
once the Union is enlarged next year has shifted the centre of gravity among
Tory MPs towards the Eurosceptics.
He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for Britain's interests
in Europe but the Conservatives must reject a 'sour, defensive attitude
which concentrates exclusively on the negative things about the European
Union'.
Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had agreed on Thursday
that it must fight a positive, pro-European campaign in the critical
elections to the Strasbourg parliament on June 9.
Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the Plymouth conference
later today, is now expected to tone down attacks on Brussels. He will be
joined on the platform by both Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke.
It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week that all future
ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in future be cleared through 10
Downing Street in order to minimise the appearance of divisions.
Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to maintain a positive
and consistent line if the Conservatives are not to suffer heavy losses in
the June Euro-elections.
The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the economic and

Europe. He concluded: 'Unless we can lift our sights we shall put at risk
Britain's position.'
Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could not argue its
case strongly in Europe.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Everyone a runner-up in win a holiday 'contests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Win a free holiday in the US] The promise of that prize in competitions
promoted at travel fairs and on railway platforms found many willing takers
across the UK in recent years.
Entrants were later delighted to receive telephone calls saying that while
they had not won the US holiday, they were runners-up and had won a
Caribbean cruise.
The problem was, everyone who entered a competition - apart from the winner
 -was declared a runner-up, and going on the cruise involved paying for a
variety of additional services, according to Mr Christopher Roan,
Cambridgeshire's assistant chief trading standards officer.
Yesterday, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he had
started legal proceedings against the company concerned - Inter-Club Travel
of Cambridge.
Sir Bryan said 46 county court judgments against Inter-Club had been brought
to his attention. The judgments resulted in damages of more than Pounds
16,000 being paid to consumers.
He said the company had told him the judgments were awarded because it did
not defend itself. He said, however, that the judgments indicated the
company acted in a way that was detrimental to consumers' interests.
Sir Bryan said: 'We have used our best endeavours, without success, to get
assurances from Inter-Club Travel and its officers about their future
behaviour. Legal action has become necessary.'
Inter-Club had also been convicted on four occasions in 1992 and 1993 of
offences under the Consumer Protection Act, relating to misleading price
information. It had been fined a total of Pounds 8,200.
Legal proceedings are to be taken against the company and two of its
officers, Mr Theodor Thomson and Mr William Wood, and Mr Ajit Kumar Patel, a
former officer.
The Association of British Travel Agents said it had received repeated
complaints about Inter-Club, even though it was not an Abta member. The
complaints concerned press advertisements offering holidays in Florida and
the Bahamas for Pounds 99.50.
Consumers who tried to take up the offer were asked for extra payments which
brought the total cost of the holiday to Pounds 1,000 or more, Abta said.
Mr Roan said Inter-Club had gone into liquidation earlier this month but was
now trading under another name. Inter-Club could not be contacted.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Skanska, NCC return to black
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skanska and NCC, Sweden's top two construction and property groups,
yesterday reported a return to profit in 1993 after severe losses in 1992.
However, both companies continued to be hit by the slump in the Swedish
market, relying on lower write-downs and income from divestments to see them
back into the black.
Revenues were down for both groups, reflecting another tough year -
especially in Sweden, where the property and construction sectors have been
hit hard by recession.
Mr Jan Sjoqvist, president of NCC, said property prices and rent levels were
stabilising, although there were variations between geographical areas and
market segments. Infrastructure investment was also regaining momentum.
However, he warned: 'Investments in the construction sector will remain low
in 1994 and 1995, but should begin to show growth again in 1996.'
Skanska showed the biggest improvement in 1993, swinging to a profit after
financial items of SKr1.1bn (Dollars 149m) from a loss in 1992 of SKr3.98bn.
NCC reported a profit after financial items of SKr175m following a deficit
in 1992 of SKr1.63bn.
Skanska increased its dividend to SKr3.25 per share from SKr1.50, but NCC
suspended its dividend, as it did for 1992.
Total revenues at Skanska were down 9 per cent at SKr28.9bn, with the share
of revenues taken outside Sweden rising from 14 to 23 per cent. Revenues
from Swedish construction slumped to SKr14.8bn from SKr17.4bn. Property
write-downs of SKr2bn were less than half the SKr4.3bn incurred in 1992.
NCC's total revenues slipped to SKr17.6bn from SKr20bn. But non-recurring
income of SKr463m, against a loss of SKr324m in 1992, and write-down costs
cut to SKr371m from SKr1.4bn, resulted in an operating profit of SKr961m
after a loss in 1992 of SKr649m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group which was formerly owned by
British Aerospace, is to be partially floated on the Amsterdam stock
exchange in an offering scheduled to take place before the end of April.
A minimum of 2m cumulative preference shares are to be offered for sale by
ING Group of the Netherlands, which bought Ballast Nedam for Fl 500m
(Dollars 263m) in December as part of a consortium that also included
Hochtief, the German construction group, and the Ballast Nedam pension fund.
The price of the shares will be announced later.
The consortium had said earlier that a flotation in the spring was expected,
but had given no details.
Ballast Nedam has a share capital of 10m shares, divided between 5.3m
ordinary and 4.7m cumulative preference shares.
The company plans to apply for a listing for all of its preference shares,
of which at least 2m will be offered by sale out of ING Group's stake of
49.99 per cent.
ING's banking subsidiary ING Bank will lead manage the issue.
Hochtief's stake will be unchanged at 48 per cent, as will the pension
fund's 2.1 per cent holding.
Ballast Nedam was listed on the Amsterdam bourse before its takeover by BAe
in 1987.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: French bank defies trend to lift
earnings by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Commercial de France last year withstood the pressures on the French
banking sector to lift net profits 10.2 per cent, to FFr1.08bn (Dollars
189m) from FFr978m in 1992. The gain came in spite of losses at the
recently-acquired Banque de Savoie.
Mr Charles de Croisset, who last summer replaced Mr Michel Pebereau as
chairman when he left to head Banque Nationale de Paris, said he expected
the group to continue improving this year, and record its '11th consecutive
year of profits growth'.
The principal problem for CCF during 1993 was Banque de Savoie, the regional
banking group in which it has raised its stake from 24 per cent to 96 per
cent. The bank, which has been badly affected by the economic recession in
its area of southern France, saw net losses deepen to FFr110m from FFr29.4m
in 1992.
Mr de Croisset said he planned a capital increase to refinance Banque de
Savoie. 'It ought to help Banque de Savoie to find its feet again,' he said.
In spite of Banque de Savoie's difficulties, CCF mustered a 12.7 per cent
increase in net banking income, to FFr9.2bn last year from FFr8.2bn
(restated).
CCF also lifted gross operating profits by 23.5 per cent, to FFr3.21bn from
FFr2.6bn (restated), over the same period.
However, the group was also forced to raise net new provisions by 15.7 per
cent, to FFr1.54bn from FFr1.33bn. Consequently, it trimmed the growth in
net attributable earnings per share to 5 per cent, with an increase to
FFr18.03 from FFr17.18.
The board has decided to increase the dividend to FFr4.30 from FFr4.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Volvo sells 4.6% stake in
Norwegian oil group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo of Sweden yesterday took another step to concentrate on its core motor
industry operations when it announced the sale to unnamed international
institutions of its 4.6 per cent shareholding in Norway's Saga Petroleum for
NKr458m (Dollars 62m).
The sale, which brought Volvo a capital gain of SKr350m, follows the
disposal last month of the company's 30 per cent voting stake in the
investment group Custos for SKr1.74bn.
The Custos sale was the first divestment made by Volvo after it pulled out
of a plan to merge its car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of
France.
Since then, Volvo has made clear that it intends to concentrate on
strengthening its car and truck divisions, where it will have to bear the
heavy costs of new model development alone - at least until it establishes a
new partnership with another motor group.
But so far Volvo has looked to peripheral holdings to divest and has given
no indication that it intends to cut its commitment to its main non-core
holdings in BCP, the consumer products group, and Pharmacia, the
pharmaceuticals group.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF warns of loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled French defence electronics company,
yesterday warned that it would report a loss for 1993 because of its 21.6
per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais, the troubled banking group, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The company, which made net profits of FFr1.52bn (Dollars 250m) in 1992,
said that it made a 'very good' operating profit in 1993. However, it has
been tipped into the red by its share of the FFr6.9bn net loss sustained
last year by Credit Lyonnais.
The bank has unveiled details of a rescue package, including a FFr1.2bn
capital increase. Thomson-CSF will be expected to participate in the Credit
Lyonnais rescue. The capital for the package will be provided by the Thomson
group, which is Thomson-CSF's parent company.
Thomson is considering financing the capital increase by selling up to 8.3
per cent of its 58.3 per cent holding in the defence electronics concern.

Liquide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
L'Air Liquide, the world's largest industrial gases group, saw net profits
stabilise last year at FFr2.225bn (Dollars 370m) against FFr2.221bn in 1992.
Mr Edouard de Royere, chairman, said the static result had been achieved
'despite the difficult economic situation'.
He declined to comment on the group's prospects for the current year but
noted the improvement in conditions in both the US and Europe.
L'Air Liquide mustered a 1.5 per cent increase in turnover to FFr30.37bn
last year from FFr29.92bn in 1992.
The group, which last year implemented a wide-ranging internal
reorganisation programme, maintained its level of investment during 1993,
but managed to reduce gearing by two percentage points, to 18 per cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (19): Supply chain
links grow tighter - A leading UK equipment builder exemplifies the changing
relations between engineering customers and suppliers / Construction
Equipment III: JC Bamford (JCB)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the best ways to examine the changing nature of the relationship
between customer and supplier in the engineering industry - producing
benefits for both sides - is to look at developments in the construction
equipment sector.
JC Bamford (JCB), Britain's biggest construction equipment producer, is a
case in point. Its supplier base has been thinned from 750 in the mid-1980s
to about 250, sorted by quality, and brought into continuous cost reduction
programmes much as has occurred at most leading producers of excavators and
other earthmoving equipment.
Within the past three or four years, JCB has moved to classifying its
suppliers depending on their strategic importance to the company, with the
most crucial being drawn into the company's new product development
programme at a much earlier stage.
In return for a reasonable guarantee of long-term business, so long as they
can satisfy JCB on cost and quality, the more important suppliers are
expected to make suggestions on how their own products can be better used
and are trusted to do a lot of the detailed design work themselves so long
as they keep to performance parameters.
The idea is to use suppliers' expertise rather than having to do everything
in-house, says Mr John Appleby, former JCB purchasing director for its main
machines and now, following a reorganisation last year, managing director of
its wheeled loader division.
For example, two suppliers, Airflow Streamline of Northampton and
German-based Rexroth, were deeply involved in designing respectively the cab
and hydraulics system for JCB's new wheeled loader after being shown the
prototype.
Alternatively, JCB has used a deeper relationship with a supplier to solve a
problem, such as it had with electrical wiring harnesses. Larger suppliers
geared to automotive industry volumes were not interested in supplying JCB,
and small suppliers were underskilled and undercapitalised, says Mr Appleby.
JCB identified one supplier, Wexford Electronics, with potential for
improvement and worked together with the Waterford-based company to develop
all the attributes necessary to become the preferred supplier, with a
dedicated team producing parts just for JCB.
A further approach is to give the supplier responsibility for delivery
direct to the production line. This is increasingly happening in the
crucial, yet perhaps somewhat humdrum area of industrial fasteners - nuts,
bolts and rivets etc.
Here, JCB has set up a direct line feed from MBS Distribution, the
Birmingham-based fastener distribution company which now supplies fasteners
on a daily basis to the production line, controls quality and stores goods
to JCB's specification.
The arrangement means that JCB does not have to worry about its fasteners,
but it also has benefits for MBS, says Mr Floyd Thorpe, its managing
director. Three years ago, before it started such arrangements, it had
23,000 different customers, and had to carry huge stocks because it was
living on a day-to-day basis. Crucially, it was not making money. It decided
to change course, and now 90 per cent of its business is on a customised
basis for 60-65 customers including JCB and other big names such as Black &amp;
Decker and Otis.
It receives advanced notice of changes in production levels so can prepare
accordingly, carries fewer lines of stock because it is more focused, and
can strongly influence the use of fasteners in new products.
'We have three people permanently on-site at JCB and the whole of MBS has
been turned into mini-businesses closely focused on customers,' he says.
There are costs, however, in such relationships, which mean the supplier is
holding stock for the customer and is also having to deliver fewer parts
less often. Last year, MBS commissioned an activity-based costings analysis
from World Class International, the Hampshire-based industrial consultants,
to enable it to cost with confidence any future just-in-time arrangements
which it takes on.
Mr Thorpe is convinced that the new strategy is the main reason for MBS'
recent turnround into profit and sharp rise in annual sales from about
Pounds 8m in the late 1980s to Pounds 15m-Pounds 16m at present.
The downside of such relationships, of course, is when the customer hits
trouble or goes bust. Leyland Daf was a big customer before it went into
receivership, and MBS would have lost 5 per cent of its sales if nothing had
survived of the van and truck producer. Happily, it has continued supplying
to the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham following last year's buyout.
Customers, though, can also have such problems, especially during a
recession. Mr Appleby recalls a situation where JCB heard on a Friday that a
strategic supplier of fabrications was to call in the receivers on the
following Monday.
Over the weekend, JCB had 22 truckloads of work-in-progress and tools
shifted to other suppliers, with executives including Mr Appleby operating
fork-lifts to complete the task. 'We don't want any more like that,' he
says.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (17): A letter from
Professor Rontgen - Siemens of Germany is a many sided company. On this page
Andrew Baxter examines its role in health and power equipment. Since
supplying X-ray tubes to their inventor in 1897, Siemens has become one of
the world's largest medical engineering groups - and plans to keep its
dominance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In November 1897, the company that is now Siemens' medical engineering group
received a letter from Professor Wilhelm Rontgen, discoverer of X-rays. Its
X-ray tubes were very good, he said, but could he have them for DM20 each
rather than DM30?
'From experiences I have made elsewhere this proposal should be quite
acceptable, since it is an exceptional case and you might perhaps be
interested in further orders from my side,' he wrote.
Nearly a century later, the Siemens business is one of the largest in the
medical engineering field worldwide, with sales of DM7.9bn in 1992/93 and
about 30,000 employees. It also has the broadest product line, ranging from
computed tomography (CT) scanners that fill a room to cardiac pacemakers and
hearing aids.
But the pressures on producers of medical equipment have intensified. As
with other fast-developing technologies such as personal computers,
customers for high-technology medical equipment bought by hospitals and
universities expect more performance for the same or lower prices. A DM1m
scanner could be priced at DM600,000 a year later.
The Siemens medical engineering group has traditionally been global, with
factories in the US and 10 other countries, besides Germany. Five of the 14
product divisions are based in the US and two others in Sweden.
But Germany, where the group employs 13,000 people, still accounts for some
40 per cent of its workforce and the company is committed to conserving the
considerable investment it has made in its domestic base.
Last year, it announced a DM85m investment to transform its plant at
Forchheim, near its base in Erlangen, into one of the most modern
medico-technical manufacturing facilities in the world.
The plant already assembles angiography systems, and will be expanded to
produce CT scanners from later this year. But the shake-up will also involve
moving all the functions of the two businesses to the factory, from product
development through to marketing.
The combined laboratory, office building and manufacturing plant is expected
to deliver a big reduction in the number of manufacturing hours per system
along with shorter lines of communication between departments to accelerate
product development.
Significantly, Mr Werner Maly, chief executive officer of the medical
engineering group, said the changes represented an important part of the
productivity programme with which the group would compensate for the
disadvantages of maintaining its operations in Germany - high costs and,
more recently, currency depreciation.
At the same time the investment is intended to capitalise on the advantages
of manufacturing in Germany, notably the country's highly qualified
workforce.
Some of the many other changes underway or being planned within the medical
engineering group illustrate the importance not only of reducing costs but
also responding to customers' changing needs as they bear down on the costs
of health care.
In the magnetic resonance imaging division, Mr Thomas Miller is planning a
big shake-up of everything from organisation to manufacturing - for a
product that was not even on the market until 1982. Mr Miller, who became
general manager nearly two years ago, says the division is world-class for a
'classical' engineering company but not for a modern one.
A weighty tome on his desk, The Plan, maps out the future for the division.
A classic functionally-oriented hierarchy is being thrown out in favour of a
process-oriented structure. This followed a successful experiment at
Erlangen in manufacturing coils - a key component that amplifies the
electro-magnetic signal from the human body - which put all those involved
into a group and produced coils faster and cheaper.
Mr Miller comments that the excellent training and competence of the
workforce had increased the barriers between different functions. 'But if
you can break down the barriers, the potential is even greater,' he says.
Strategically, the company is looking very hard at the advantages of
changing from being manufacturer of MR systems to an integrator, allowing it
to put more emphasis on core competences - the ones on which customers
decide which company's system to buy - and outsourcing everything else.
On the engineering and product development side, teamwork is replacing the
former very linear product design process, while by 1996, engineering and
manufacturing will be brought together under one roof in Erlangen. The
factory is currently three kilometres away but might as well be in China,
says Mr Miller. The aim will be to have a single assembly line producing
multiple products, thus responding to an expected proliferation of MR
products.
The overall plan is aggressive, Mr Miller admits, but his target of doubling
profitability in five years, even if revenues fail to rise, is 'absolutely
achievable', he says.
In the CT division, the move to Forchheim is viewed as an important
development by Dr Rolf Hupke, marketing manager. The closer links between
departments will bring further improvements in product development times and
in manufacturing times, he says.
The division also wants to be in a good position to offer more frequent
upgrades of products, in line with customers' demands, rather than announce
a big bang every five years. Consequently, it is taking a more modular
approach to product design.
Other changes also reflect the changing nature of the market place. The
research and development department is now aiming at developing what is
needed rather than what Dr Hupke calls the 'best of the best,' and products
are being designed with specification tailored to market needs, to reduce
the cost.
The division's latest Somatom AR range is the first to be developed on a
design-for-cost basis, and it is also designing machines so that
installation costs are reduced and service intervals extended. The result,
says Dr Hupke, is that the overall cost for the customer has been reduced
dramatically.
The clear link between cost reduction and business success is also apparent
in the group's lithotripsy products, which use shock waves to treat kidney
stones and gall-stones. Over the past two and a half years a 'cost-half'
programme has reduced the price of these machines to below DM1m. The price
cut will 'open up the market,' says Mr Wolfgang Feindor, executive director
of the lithotripsy, urology and surgery division and the Rontgen systems
division.
The programme has involved new attitudes in R&amp;D groups, and a new
organisation which has swept away walls between R&amp;D and manufacturing.
Significantly, by cutting development times on new products from five years
in the 1980s to two years, more money is released for spending on marketing.
Part of the programme has involved getting the message over to employees
about costs.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (18): Fossils still
have plenty of power - With Siemens' thermal generating equipment made
mostly in high-wage Germany, the company has to fight harder to remain
competitive among the world's top five producers / Steam Turbines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While some of the technologies in Siemens' medical systems business are no
more than a decade or two old, the fossil power side of the company's KWU
power generation business has roots going back to 1866 when Werner von
Siemens discovered the dynamoelectric principle.
But for Prof Klaus Riedle, executive director of the Erlangen-based fossil
power unit, the challenges of running the business are modern.
It is one of the big five competitors in an increasingly global market for
power generating equipment, but has a much higher proportion of its
workforce in the high cost centre of Germany than its rivals.
With some 10,000 of its 12,000 workers worldwide employed in Germany, Prof
Riedle says: 'We will have to make our German plants more competitive.'
In Germany, the fossil power business makes large steam turbines and
turbogenerators at Mulheim on the Ruhr, smaller generators in Erfurt, gas
turbines in Berlin, and industrial turbines at Wesel and Gorlitz. Overseas
it has a factory in Milwaukee which makes smaller gas turbines and
generators, a gas turbine joint venture in St Petersburg and a components
manufacturing company in Indonesia.
The spread of manufacturing gives a clue as to how the company is trying to
reduce its manufacturing costs. Prof Riedle sees two ways of doing this: one
is by decreasing the proportion of added value in its products contributed
by its older, domestic factories, implying the use of cheaper manufacturing
locations in Europe or elsewhere.
The second, closely-related approach is to combine manufacture of the
equipment with low cost producers, hence the joint ventures such as in
Indonesia. The company is negotiating others joint ventures in Asia for
manufacturing steam turbines and generators, says Prof Riedle.
KWU's long-running negotiations with Skoda in the Czech republic, for
example, are based around the premise that a lower-cost country can produce
a number of parts for a turbine more efficiently than the German factories,
provided quality is maintained and the logistics of marrying up parts for
the same turbine are addressed.
Parts such as casings or those involving labour-intensive welding are ideal,
but Siemens could move progressively to a much higher proportion of
manufacturing at Skoda if the deal is signed.
Already, it has moved in this direction on gas turbine manufacturing at
Milwaukee. 'Step by step we have increased the added value to half and half,
split between the two sites of Berlin and Milwaukee,' says Prof Riedle. All
gas turbines for the 60Hz market, North America and parts of Asia, are now
leaving KWU via Milwaukee.
Meanwhile, considerable improvement efforts have been made over the past
decade in the German plants. This began with rationalisation programmes,
where each factory had to save 2-3 per cent of its costs through
rationalisation each year. Realising that this was not enough, the company
introduced productivity packages at its factories, but these tended to focus
on discrete stages of the production process, for example the manufacture of
turbine blades, rather than viewing it in its entirety.
A third productivity programme was introduced three years ago, therefore,
which considered the process in its entirety, from receipt of an order to
dispatch of the product.
The aim of the productivity improvements is to keep Prof Riedle's unit
firmly in the Premier League of an industry where the financial implications
of productivity and lean production techniques have never been greater.
Prof Riedle admits that the KWU fossil power business still has a long way
to go. It has never cut its domestic workforce by more than 1-2 per cent a
year, but more severe reductions are foreseen over the next few years in
engineering and manufacturing jobs in Germany.
Meanwhile, with orders increasingly being won on the basis of a supplier's
ability to deliver more quickly, the efforts made by Siemens in reducing
production cycle times, and the overall time to build a power station, are
particularly important.
Already it has made considerable progress. It built the recently completed
Rye House combined cycle power station in south-east England in 30 months,
compared with an average three and a half years in the 1980s, and the next
step will be 24 months, says Prof Riedle. Cycle times for large steam
turbines are down from 30 months to under two years, and could be reduced to
18 months for standard machines, he says.
Because of the importance of combined cycle power stations, a new effort was
launched a year ago to benchmark the business on its performance producing
these gas-fired power stations.
Here it is judging itself against a 'synthetic' competitor combining all the
best qualities of its four big rivals - General Electric and Westinghouse of
the US, and the two other European giants, Asea Brown Boveri and GEC
Alsthom. Prof Riedle believes no single competitor has all the answers, and
believes Siemens can achieve the goals set out in the benchmarking process
in three years. With rivals making advances all the time he is clearly
determined that Siemens will not lose ground.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (15): Teamwork
discovers fresh territory - The full potential of CE (concurrent
engineering) has barely been used, Andrew Baxter learns on a visit to
TransTec / Management:  Concurrent Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concurrent engineering - using teamwork to get new and better products on to
the market more rapidly - has been a regular feature on the industrial map
for the best part of a decade. Now, however, it is moving into new
territory.
Most surveys suggest a large proportion of engineering companies in most
western countries are using concurrent engineering (CE) in some or all parts
of their business. Its benefits are understood, because companies realise
from bitter experience how expensive it can be to have to change the design
of a product at the last moment.
Some experts say the idea was invented first in Japan and has been rapidly
copied, adapted and improved by European companies to stay competitive.
Others say the term is simply management-speak for 'common sense'.
One company that claims to have been using CE long before the phrase was
coined is TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group. Since
its early days in 1982, says Dr Sami Ahmed, executive director, it has
frequently used project teams led by a full-time manager who pulls in
colleagues from different disciplines to ensure the right product gets to
market at the right time.
TransTec is now participating in an ambitious worldwide project to chart the
future for concurrent engineering, which can be defined as the consideration
during the design phase of the factors associated with the life cycle of the
product, including manufacturing, assembly testing, maintenance,
reliability, cost and quality.
The old, traditional alternative is a sequential approach, where a product
is typically designed, then engineered for manufacturing, then given to the
marketing department. It might only be very late in the process, for
example, that a maintenance problem might emerge - which could have been
spotted if the relevant employees had been involved at the outset. But how
can concurrent engineering be carried out in a global manufacturing context?
What happens if products are designed in one place and manufactured in a
different part of the world?
These are the questions being tackled by a project on global concurrent
engineering being carried out under the auspices of the five-continent
Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Initiative.
TransTec is leading the European side of the project, which is currently at
the feasibility study stage. Other members of the European team, which is
backed by funds from the European Union's Esprit research and development
programme, include Olivetti of Italy, De Montfort University in Leicester,
and the Odense Shipyard in Denmark.
The US team is the North Carolina State University and the California
Polytechnic, along with 25 small companies based around the NCSU, while the
Canadian team is Northern Telecom, and Carleton University in Ottawa.
The project has five aims: to establish the extent to which CE is practised:
to identify the 'critical constraints' or obstacles to global manufacturing
in terms of technology, technology management and human resources; to
synthesise the best practices of CE, and to develop the requirements
necessary to diminish the effects of the critical constraints; to design an
'architecture' of a CE system for global manufacturing; and finally, to
disseminate the results through a Global CE workshop in Patras, Greece next
month.
With Odense, one of the world's most sophisticated shipyards, producing
large products at big intervals, NorTel producing thousands of small parts,
and Trans-Tec somewhere in between, the project has plenty of its own CE
experiences to draw on.
But its main information source, says Dr Ahmed, is an elaborate
questionnaire which has been sent to hundreds of companies in six sectors:
automotive, aerospace, information technology, shipbuilding/marine,
telecommunications and electronics design.
In return for some useful information that benchmarks their own performance
in all aspects of introducing CE, the companies have contributed data on how
long they have been using CE, its benefits, problems faced when it was
introduced, and on what sort of employees became involved in the new product
development process. The major benefit of CE was seen to be shorter time to
market, followed by improved communication, improved product quality and
reduced design changes. The biggest problems were resistance to change,
managers' reluctance to implement it, and geographical dispersion.
These are the impressions so far: companies are very interested in
strategies for implementing CE, especially on a global basis; all CE
approaches are 'custom-built'; dispersed teams need to build trust through
initial face-to-face meetings; CE has industrial benefit through improved
quality and reduced changes; IT tools can help but are not an adequate
alternative to multifunctional teams.
Problem areas include: implementing CE at the working level; getting
managers to 'let go' or accept that they may have to delegate more to team
members in the interests of faster product development; integrating many
teams in large projects; and problems with team turnover and knowledge of
teamwork.
Dr Ahmed says it will be impossible to find an architecture for CE that is
applicable universally, but it should be possible to produce at least a
generalised architecture. This would have a number of requirements: it
should be flexible, to allow the design problem to be approached from a
variety of viewpoints; the designer should be able to design even if
complete information is absent; it should handle the large volume, variety
and interdependence of life-cycle information; it should readily interface
to database management and CAD systems; it should be easy to use, and should
support design audits.
The feasibility study ends this month but participants will now seek backing
for a full IMS project, which could last three years and would fully develop
an architecture for global CE.
Dr Ahmed sees benefits for TransTec from the project, as it is considering
expanding its manufacturing locations, and Japan would need to consider the
many human issues involved. TransTec is also a big exporter, so after sales
technical support is important, and needs to be included in the CE process.
TransTec may even end up with a new product out of the process, he says - a
global CE kit which it can sell to industry worldwide.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (16): Better news from
the grass roots - The UK lawnmower maker is flourishing again thanks to
flexible warehousing and manpower / Profile: Atco-Qualcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away at one end of Atco-Qualcast's half-mile long lawnmower factory
at Stowmarket, Suffolk, 16 workers grouped in an assembly cell aremaking a
new rotary mower.
No more than a week's supply of all the parts they need are stored on view
next to the cell, and conveyed on a carousel from which the team members
choose the parts they need. The team also chooses temporary workers to help
in busy times.
The cell is part of a pilot scheme introduced over the past few months at
Atco-Qualcast, and symbolises the changes underway - and long overdue - at a
company whose name includes two of the strongest brands in the UK lawn-mower
industry, but which in 1990 seemed destined for the corporate compost heap.
It is no easy job introducing change into a long-established, traditional
company but the challenge is no doubt greater when the company is based in a
small, quiet town that still displays some traditions rarely seen nowadays
in big industrial centres: There is no staff canteen, for example, because
many workers live nearby and go home for lunch.
But by avoiding moving too quickly, and by gradually fostering a spirit of
co-operation between management and workforce to replace years of
confrontation, Mr Stephen Roberts, managing director, believes the seeds
have been sown for turning Atco-Qualcast into an industrial success.
Mr Roberts joined Atco-Qualcast as marketing director in 1991, three years
after its former owner, Birmid Qualcast, had been acquired by Blue Circle,
the big cement maker. Atco-Qualcast had already been suffering from a
classic squeeze - declining sales and market share, and rising fixed costs
and stock levels at its two plants in Stowmarket and Derby - but the
acquisition also coincided with drought conditions that dented lawnmower
sales.
Blue Circle identified Atco-Qualcast as a non-core activity, but selling it
was never going to be easy. 'It was not viable on two sites and needed to
cut costs if there was to be any hope of selling it,' he says.
Against a background of overcapacity in a depressed market, and losses
during 1990 and 1991, the company eventually decided in April 1991 to close
the Derby plant, and consolidate manufacturing at Stowmarket. If the
decision had gone the other way, says Mr Colin Barker, manufacturing
director and a Derby man himself, it would not have been easy to have
persuaded Stowmarket workers to move.
Mr Barker had the challenging task of combining two operations with entirely
different philosophies. The Derby plant produced the mass-market Qualcast
machines, and was a high-volume low variety operation - an assembly plant
with some manufacturing, says Mr Barker.
Stowmarket, meanwhile, produced the large, premium-priced Atco machines and
the mid-range Suffolk mowers in medium to low volumes, high variety, and
batch-production rather than flow-line assembly. In contrast to Derby, it
was a manufacturing plant with some assembly.
The consolidation had an obvious effect on Atco-Qualcast's fixed cost base,
but it went a long way beyond simply bringing two plants together.
The company needed to make a number of other changes too, said Mr Barker. It
had to match production much more closely to sales, moving away from a
system which seemed always to produce too many or too few mowers.
Sales in the UK lawnmower industry depend on a unique mix of factors
including the weather and consumer confidence/spending power and are very
hard to predict. Inflexible manufacturing methods, therefore, make it
difficult both to react to overall changes in volume sales and to switch
quickly between products depending on market conditions. Last year, for
example, unit sales were nearly the highest ever at 1.39m but in a recession
consumers have bought cheaper mowers.
One important action taken was to reduce the permanent workforce to 500 from
900, through the closure of the Derby site, and increase the use of
temporary workers to around 120-150 each season - the first five months of
the year are the busiest time and many temporary workers then go to work in
agricultural jobs.
This has reduced the risk of short-time working for permanent employees and
 -along with the abolition of piecework - given the necessary labour
flexibility.
By moving warehousing off-site and ending the production of tractors and
cultivators, space was created for six assembly lines which were set up in
1991 to handle the extra work from the Derby closure. Large, inflexible
assembly lines based on moving conveyors were avoided.
Over the past two years, Atco-Qualcast reduced its finished goods and work
in progress by Pounds 8.4m, and in 1992 it returned to profit - Pounds 1.3m
before interest and tax.
By the end of that year a number of parties had become interested in what
had become a much more saleable company, but Mr Roberts and four other
executives - Mr Barker, Mr Brian Slythe, sales director, Mr Gordon
McMeechan, finance director, and Mr Arland Shawe-Taylor, technical director
 -pipped them to the post after being given seven days by Blue Circle to
organise a Pounds 17m buyout, backed by the Candover venture capital group.
The assembly cell for the rotary Quadtrack mower, and a nearby cell for a
new hedgecutter, are examples of further changes made since the deal.
A new Pounds 500,000 paint plant, which began operating earlier this year,
is aimed at dramatically raising productivity by replacing what Mr Barket
calls 'Dante's Inferno,' a manually operated paint shop. When this is
removed, further space will be created.
Some Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m has been spent since the buy-out, and there
has been a solid improvement in financial performance. In the first half of
last year profits rose 12 per cent to just over Pounds 4.5m on an 8 per cent
increase in sales to more than Pounds 30m on a comparable basis.
By reducing the cost base, the traditional losses in the much quieter second
half of the year will have been reduced. But the creation of space in the
factory gives the opportunity not only of plugging a few gaps in
Atco-Qualcast's lawnmower range but also, Mr Roberts hints, for eventually
finding a new business that might reduce the company's 'seasonality'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (14): A bucket, a
vehicle and a sketch pad - VME, Brussels based builder of loaders, was
formed in 1985 by Swedish Volvo and US Clark Equipment. It has come a long
way / Construction Equipment II: VME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A stroll round a small museum in Eskilstuna, Sweden, gives a clear
impression of the dramatic leaps in product development made by the
construction equipment industry over the past 30 years, writes Andrew
Baxter.
In the town that thinks of itself as Sweden's Sheffield, the museum
celebrates the achievements of two early Swedish engineers, Jean Bolinder
and Johan Theofron Monktell, and their successors.
One of these in the early 1950s had the bright idea of putting a bucket and
arm on to the back of a tractor, and turning the controls round so that the
back became the front.
Thus was born the wheeled loader, which is now Europe's biggest selling type
of earthmoving machine.
Messrs Bolinder and Monktell, meanwhile, are immortalised as the BM of Volvo
BM, one of five product ranges within VME, the Brussels-based construction
equipment producer.
VME, which was formed in 1985 from the merger of the construction equipment
interests of Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, is one of a
handful of global producers in the industry which are in the next size
category down from the two giants, Caterpillar and Komatsu.
All the companies continue the search for another spark of brilliance which
might create something earth-shattering - literally and metaphorically.
Grahame Miller, VME's UK promotions manager, says he often sits down with a
sketch pad, trying to work out a completely new design that would avoid the
need for hanging a 'dead' counterweight on to the back of many machines.
In the absence of any totally new concepts in machine design, the industry
is committed to a perpetual process of improvement in its current products,
replacing one series of loaders, excavators and other lines with another to
modernise the design, improve comfort in the cab, update the electronics,
and improve the efficiency and environmental friendliness of the machine.
Ranges that may have lasted a decade or more in the past now have a life of
as little as six years, and are also updated more frequently.
This process of incremental change means that a machine of the 1970s looks
almost primitive in comparison with what the industry is producing now.
There are sound financial reasons for the process. Many customers who are
looking to replace a machine after three or four years use expect to be able
to buy a more sophisticated product without necessarily having to pay more
in real terms, and are unlikely to be impressed by a supplier that is
standing still. A new, or even only partially updated product can give a
much needed lift to sales - and gives suppliers something to show off at
trade shows.
This year, it is the same as ever with a batch of new products being
unveiled at next month's Intermat show in Paris. VME is launching the new
Volvo BM L70B wheeled loader which incorporates a number of new features
already included on recently launched loaders, such as load-sensing
hydraulics and the so-called TP Linkage lift-arm system first introduced in
1991.
In its German-built range of Zettelmeyer small machines, VME has launched
the Zettelmeyer ZL802 loader, which replaces an earlier machine in the same
size bracket, and unveils two new Akerman excavators, to complete a range of
premium-specification Swedish-built machines that has been redesigned over
the past year.
Mr Chris Rees, managing director of VME's UK subsidiary, has high hopes for
the new machines. The relaunched Akerman excavators, which were previously
designed very much for the Scandinavian market, should give a much wider
presence in the UK market place, he says, and help VME achieve its aim of 10
per cent of the UK tracked excavator market by 1996, compared with 4 per
cent last year.
The new Volvo BM wheeled loader would help the company consolidate its
position while the Zettelmeyer loader would increase VME's market share in
the market for machines with a one cubic metre bucket. Overall, and other
things being equal, Mr Rees believes the new machines could raise VME's unit
sales in the UK from 470 machines last year to 550 in 1994.
VME has a strong reputation among users for its products, and has maintained
spending on new product development through the recession, even if its
published figures suggest otherwise. The group accounts in dollars, but some
70-80 per cent of R&amp;D spending is made in Sweden. So published spending on
R&amp;D of Dollars 39m or 3.1 per cent of sales last year would have been about
4 per cent if the dollar-krona exchange rate had stayed constant, compared
with 4.4 per cent in 1992.
As a group, the company is relying on its modern product range to complement
the dramatic downsizing in manufacturing it has undergone in the past three
years. Worldwide employment has fallen 40 per cent since the beginning of
1991 to about 6,400 at the end of last year and a 1992 loss of Dollars 93.6m
was turned into a Dollars 30m profit last year even though demand in many
countries remains weak.
The restructuring has lowered the company's breakeven levels but,
fortunately for VME, it has long realised that there is little point in
suffering the pain of job cuts and plant closures if the product range is
not being kept up to scratch.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (12): Big video is
watching you - Operatives at this Devon-based manufacturer of food and
beverage equipment were video-taped to see how work could be speeded. Andrew
Baxter describes the results / Case Study: Hobart Still
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Workers at Hobart Still in Barnstaple used to put a special drill for a new
machine tool in a drawer for safekeeping. On one occasion, a videotape
showed that 20 minutes were wasted when the drill was put back in the wrong
drawer.
The episode, recounted by Mr Graham Forster, UK engineering and
manufacturing director of the food and beverage equipment producer,
illustrates both the obstacles to change and the achievements at the Devon
plant over the past few years.
Why put a drill away in a drawer when it should be available close to the
machine tool, says Mr Forster, for whom reducing set-up times became a top
priority as the factory underwent a dramatic transformation.
The changes, however, could only be achieved through big changes in working
practices and flexibility, as symbolised by the willingness of workers to be
videotaped in an effort to reduce waste and save time.
Hobart is part of the food equipment group within Premark International, the
US company perhaps best known for its Tupperware products. In 1989, the
group bought WM Still, which makes beverage systems and two years later
decided to close the Still plant in Hastings, concentrating manufacturing in
Barnstaple.
Barnstaple had been working on a three-and-a-half day week at the time, so
had spare capacity. The addition of beverage equipment to the factory's
range of Hobart food mixers provided an excellent opportunity to change
practices at the plant, to reduce cost and increase flexibility.
'The feeling was that we had one opportunity to get it right,' says Forster.
The plant was producing more expensively than its counterpart in the US, and
there would have been a question-mark over its future if it had not
increased efficiency.
Over five months in 1991, the production of Still equipment was brought to
Barnstaple, and a number of key decisions were taken. The product range and
processes needed to be rationalised, production had to be relaid out, an
additional plant across the road was identified, investment was needed to
reduce space and cost, three manufacturing control systems had to be
consolidated and, by no means least, the plant's culture needed to be
changed.
Making the move had cost Pounds 3m, but the question was how much more would
need to be spent to get things right. There was certainly plenty to do: for
example, one measure of the plant's effectiveness was the ability to deliver
orders on time. In the upheaval caused by the consolidation, it could only
achieve this with one in four of its beverage equipment orders.
The company had been considering moving to cell manufacturing but felt it
needed some outside help, says Mr Forster. After talking to several
consultants it selected Peter Chadwick, the fast-growing consultancy which
specialises in detailed change programmes to improve companies' performance,
for an initial two-week analysis.
'The aim was to ascertain what the opportunities were at the company, for
improving its cost structure and its flexibility, and what the biggest
drivers for success were,' says Mr Peter Mounsey, who conducted the study
for Peter Chadwick and led the subsequent main 35-week project from February
to November 1992.
This began in the machine shop with the development of cellular
manufacturing, which was then implemented before the project team moved on
to the fabrication area. The intention, through moving to cells, was not
simply to get away from the old one man-one machine methods but, as Mr
Mounsey puts it, 'to drive the culture' by ensuring cell members had the
information and incentive to suggest how performance could be improved.
The 'cell facilitator' was given considerable lee-way to decide how to
schedule work on the different machine tools so long as the overall order
priorities were adhered to. The thinking behind this is that the people in
the cell are in a much better position to make such decisions than a
scheduler in an office.
Cells depend on multi-skilling, and their introduction can lead to workforce
cuts - the turning cell, for example, has saved eight jobs. They have proved
to be a much more flexible way of handling the kind of erratically-sized
batches and short delivery times in the food and beverage equipment
industry.
Throughout the factory, and at the small 'Unit One' site a few hundred yards
away producing smaller beverage equipment, there are some common elements to
the changes proposed by Chadwick and strongly supported by Mr Len Court, the
production manager who, along with Mr Forster, has been something of a
champion of the change programme.
They include line-side storage rather than big central stores, Kanban (card)
systems triggering deliveries from one cell to another, clearly visible
displays of each cell's performance updated frequently each day and backed
up by measurement methods which the company had previously lacked, and some
significant title changes: the old foremen are now 'area facilitators' while
the engineers who used to dictate to production have been renamed
'production service' operators.
The Chadwick team has promised the reorganisation would produce savings of
Pounds 700,000. This was effectively exceeded last year. There has also
been, as expected, a big improvement in cycle times. 'Nine times out of ten
we can complete an order in a few days. Previously, everything was so
rigid,' says Mr Forster.
At Unit One, whose layout has been completely reorganised over the past
year, area facilitator Colin Emery says a machine was recently assembled
within an hour for a salesman who wanted to show it to a customer.
Overall, Mr Forster says the hardest part of the whole programme was
convincing workers that changes needed to be made to improve future
performance. For example, recording improvements was viewed by workers
initially as time-consuming and thus counter-productive but within months
was helping to generate much more impressive improvements than would have
been possible otherwise.
And both Mr Emery and Mr Forster praise the willingness of the workforce to
be moved around to meet changing demand. 'Eighteen months ago you could
never have moved someone from assembly to fabrication, but people like the
change,' says Mr Emery.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (13): Do winners
succeed in the real world? - It is one thing to win prizes for ingenious
engineering. It is another for bright ideas to gain serious commercial
application. Clive Cookson examines the subsequent fate of some celebrated
UK award winners / Prizes for Innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain's premier prize for engineering innovation, the Royal Academy of
Engineering's Pounds 50,000 MacRobert Award, celebrates its 25th anniversary
this year. The roll of past winners demonstrates that the UK has continued
to display engineering skills in strength and breadth, through a quarter
century of decline in most of the country's manufacturing industries.
The MacRobert winners have been so diverse in their objectives that it is
impossible to lay down any general criteria for success or failure. But an
impressionistic analysis of the track record of the 29 innovations
recognised so far (a few years have had joint winners) shows that only two
or three failed completely to live up to the promise seen when they won the
award. Of the remainder, about half became unqualified successes and half
have enjoyed more limited but still significant success.
The inaugural award in 1969 was shared between Freeman, Fox and Partners for
the Severn Bridge - still considered a significant international innovation
in the design of suspension bridges - and Rolls Royce for the Pegasus jet
engine - still operating successfully on Harrier vertical take-off aircraft.
The 1970 winner is an example of an innovation which became a huge success
while remaining virtually unknown to the general public, because it involves
a process far removed from any consumer product. Three BP geophysicists won
the award for developing techniques for surveying accurately in Alaska
through arctic permafrost (permanently frozen ground). Their techniques
enabled BP to discover Alaskan oilfields worth billions of dollars.
BP was to win the award again in 1992 for another innovation that was
invisible to the public but worth a fortune to the company: hydraulic
fracturing technology that allowed oil and gas reserves to be exploited more
efficiently. BP estimated that this had saved Pounds 275m by the end of
1991.
The Gas Council (now British Gas) won the 1971 award for processes to
convert naphtha, the main petrochemical feedstock, to town gas. This was a
good example of an innovation that did not live up to its commercial promise
 -not because of any intrinsic failure but because external events did not
turn out as expected. The discovery of plentiful natural gas in the North
Sea and elsewhere made the processes for manufacturing town gas unnecessary.
The 1972 prize went to Sir Godfrey Hounsfield and EMI for inventing a new
type of X-ray scanner for diagnosing brain disease. Computerised tomography,
as it was called, was a stunning technical success, for which Sir Godfrey
won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1979. Unfortunately EMI itself failed to
capitalise on the initial innovation  - a classic lost opportunity for
British business - but medical equipment manufacturers overseas put CT
scanners into production and the technology has benefited patients
worldwide.
The 1973 winner was a more comprehensive failure: Dunlop's Denovo run-flat
tyre. It was not exploited by Dunlop or by anyone else in the motor
industry.
After making risky choices in the two previous years, the MacRobert
evaluation committee played safe in 1974 and awarded the prize to ICI for a
system that was already a proven commercial success in industrial chemistry:
high activity catalysts for making methanol. These have earned ICI
substantial royalties from overseas licences.
There was a double award again in 1975. Westland won the prize for
innovations on the Lynx helicopter (the semi-rigid rotor and conformal
gearing); the Lynx has turned out to be one of Westland's most successful
models.
The other 1975 winner was British Rail for developments in railway vehicle
suspensions. Part of this project led to one of BR's most ignominious
failures, the Advanced Passenger Train, but the work was not a total
disaster. It also led to improved suspension systems in other, more
successful trains.
The next year, 1976, was the only one so far in which the MacRobert
evaluation committee judged that none of the candidates was worthy of an
award.
The 1977 prize went to the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment and Malvern
Instruments for their joint development of an electro-optical instrument,
the Malvern Correlator, which uses laser scattering to measure the flow of
particles in a fluid. It has been applied widely in the chemical and
aerospace industries. The Correlator is a good example of something that
still happens too rarely in Britain - successful transfer of know-how from
defence research to civil industry.
Pilkington won the 1978 prize for its high-strength Ten-Twenty laminated
windscreen. This illustrates the unpredictable commercial consequences of
industrial innovation.
Although Pilkington had expected the main application of Ten-Twenty to be in
cars, the automotive manufacturers took little interest in it; they were
happy to continue with cheaper, lower performance windscreens. Instead, it
enjoyed commercial success in aircraft cockpits. The 1979 prize was the
first awarded for computer software. It went to Post Office
Telecommunications (now BT) for the Prestel viewdata system, which enabled
subscribers to call up written information over the telephone lines.
Although the system was technically a world leader - and was sold to five
other countries - Prestel did not take off on the grand scale its inventors
had envisaged.
On the other hand the 1980 winner, Johnson Matthey's catalytic system for
reducing vehicle exhaust emissions, has been an unqualified long-term
success. The company has remained the world's leading supplier of auto
catalysts.
The 1981 winner, the Microjector developed by Lucas as a miniature fuel
injector for diesel engines, was also aimed at the automotive industry. Its
initial export sales in the US were astonishing; in the first two years
Lucas shipped 2.5m Microjectors to Oldsmobile alone. But then Detroit turned
against diesel cars and the Microjector's commercial success faded away.
This article focuses on the first half of the MacRobert Award's track record
because enough time has passed to see the successes and failures in
long-term perspective.
The jury is still out on some of the more recent winners although a few,
such as Oxford Instruments' superconducting magnets for body scanners (1986
prize), are obvious long-term successes.
When the MacRobert Trust first established the award in the late 1960s, it
was worth Pounds 25,000 - more than a Nobel Prize at the time. But while the
Nobels kept pace with inflation, the MacRobert stuck at Pounds 25,000 until
last year when its value was doubled to Pounds 50,000.
In the world of engineering, the biggest award is now the Dollars 375,000
Charles Stark Draper Prize established by the US National Academy of
Engineering in 1988. In contrast to the MacRobert, which recognises recent
or current work in the UK, the perspective of the Draper prize is both
historical and global - in 1991 it went to Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain
for their work 50 years earlier developing jet engines in Britain and
Germany respectively. The greatest accolade for a MacRobert Award winner
would be to pick up a Draper Prize a few decades later.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (11): All change in
deepest Leicestershire - At Caterpillar, near Leicester, the product line
has been changed and the union has accepted derecognition / Construction
Equipment I: Caterpillar (UK)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Caterpillar's Desford plant near Leicester hit the headlines in
January after accepting lump-sum payments in what was widely seen as a
quid-pro-quo for union derecognition.
In reality, says Mr Jerry Swan, managing director of Caterpillar (UK), it
was recognition of employees' contribution to the company last year. It was
also an acknowledgement after the event of a series of changes over the past
few years at the plant, affecting everything from manufacturing methods to
products and culture.
The changes, in combination with a corporate reorganisation at Cat and the
US company's much vaunted seven-year Plant With A Future (PWAF) programme,
have brought big improvements in productivity and profitability, but have
also shown the importance of listening to customers,
For more than 20 years, the plant has been making lift-trucks, but
production is now tailing off following Cat's decision to put its lift-truck
operations into a global joint venture with Mitsubishi of Japan.
Within months, therefore, production at the plant will be concentrated on
small backhoe loaders and wheeled loaders. Cat began producing backhoe
loaders at the plant in 1985, and decided it made best economic sense to be
an assembly operation, buying virtually everything in from outside suppliers
or other Cat plants. There is hardly a machine tool in the entire factory.
It was not until 1989, however, when a reorganisation across Cat worldwide
put the Desford plant into a new decentralised building construction
products division, that it began to understand by talking to its customers
why the market for smaller machines is so different from that for larger
plant.
'That investigation had a big impact,' says Mr Swan, because Cat realised
the vital importance of controlling costs in a market where margins are
tight. Its backhoes cost about Pounds 26,000-Pounds 28,000, no more than a
top of the range Rover 800, and customers are very price-sensitive.
As a direct result of this, Cat closed a plant in Brampton, Ontario and set
about aggressively reducing costs, working with its suppliers to change
product designs, pruning support costs and only retaining activities that
added value.
At Desford, some Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m - a drop in the ocean compared with
the overall Dollars 1.8bn for PWAF, which was completed last year - was
spent on an automated storage system, and manufacturing has been
reorganised, moving away from a straightforward production line to a
flexible system where the machines are carried by self-guided vehicles from
one team of multi-skilled workers to the next.
Using modular assembly methods, the system gives the flexibility necessary
to handle the different options available to customers, such as four-wheel
drive etc.
The new system of manufacturing came on line in August 1992, just after Mr
Swan took over at Caterpillar (UK), with the introduction of a new backhoe
loader model, the B series. Success now depends crucially on the
German-built storage system, which is helping the company keep stocks to a
minimum. After initial teething problems, it is working well, says Mr Colin
Meddows-Smith, business manager for backhoe loaders.
But it also depends on people. Mr Swan emphasises that a lot of time and
effort has been put into developing employee involvement and creating a
framework in which teamwork can flourish. The original management team of 24
has been halved as responsibilities have been delegated and the management
structure flattened.
The benefits of the new system were shown last year when a new product line
 -small wheeled loaders - was switched to Desford from Cat's Gosselies plant
in Belgium, which is more geared to producing larger equipment. The wheeled
loaders are now being built almost entirely on the same assembly route as
the backhoe loaders.
This has enabled the plant to utilise its assets better, says Mr Swan. It
also led to a small increase in employment, although overall employment
on-site has fallen by 300 to 850 since 1991 because of the phased exit from
lift truck production.
In financial terms, the result of the changes has been a steady improvement
in profitability, says Mr Swan. Aggressive targets have been set for return
on assets and cash flow, and productivity has risen by about 15 per cent
since the new manufacturing methods were introduced.
Significantly, the plant is now structured in such a way that it can break
even when demand falls - important in a boom and bust business such as
construction equipment.
Conversely, it has the flexibility to expand quickly when demand picks up -
a high proportion of output from Desford is now being exported to the US
which has recovered early, and strongly, from the recession.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (9): A revolution
etched in fine copper - How a Pounds 10m new process revived a UK-based
producer of printed circuit boards / Case Study: Pressac Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The statement in the last annual report of Pressac Holdings was flat.
'Over the last three years the group has committed more than Pounds 10.3m to
improve its production facilities, which has contributed to greater
efficiency and created a competitive edge resulting in improved market
share,' it said.
The reality behind the investment was less routine than the careful prose
implied. Indeed, Mr Geoffrey White, the chief executive, was unequivocal.
'If we hadn't done that we wouldn't have been a supplier today.' Sales to
the world automotive industry account for 43 per cent of Pressac's turnover
and, of that proportion, 90 per cent is circuit boards.
These circuit boards, the production of which is thus the mainstay of
Pressac and the subject of its investment, are like electronic instruction
pads, taking the demand of the driver and telling the vehicle how to meet
it.
Without new investment, said Mr White, 'Pounds 12m-13m of turnover would
have been in terminal decline. We would have lost contracts as models were
replaced.' About four years ago, Pressac was reorganising, breaking out of a
centralised corporate structure.
In parallel, there was pressure for technological change. 'The method by
which we manufactured circuit boards was starting to come to the end of its
days,' Mr White recalled.
This method was die stamping. It had enjoyed a good run. Pressac had bought
a licence for the technology from the US in the late 1950s; its first
circuit board in Europe had been fitted into a Ford Corsair during 1964.
Die stamping is the process of stamping copper foil on to a base material to
produce a circuit. By contrast, the new technology etches the copper on to
the base material and it is this technique which Pressac has adopted.
The great advantage of die stamping was its economy and the ease with which
waste copper could be recovered. But there was a limit to how tightly the
tracks and spaces could be created on the circuit board and it was difficult
to create circuits on both sides of the board. Etching overcomes these
problems and fits neatly into an automotive industry trend - that of packing
more and more kit into less and less space.
In any case, said Mr Jeffrey Cullis, Pressac's commercial director, 'die
stamping is a bit of a black art - so many things to do with temperature and
pressure that it was difficult to control.' It was therefore a manufacturing
technique which was difficult to tie in with constantly rising demands of
automotive manufacturers for assured quality and reducing prices.
In some respects, the new technology was easier and quicker. It involved
manufacturing a circuit board in five stages rather than nine for die
stamping. The decision to adopt new manufacturing techniques for its basic
product led Pressac into taking three further steps which were fundamental
for the group's fortunes.
First, production of the new etched circuit boards would take place in a new
facility. So Pressac has been phasing down the die stamping which takes
place in an old Edwardian lace mill in Long Eaton, Nottingham, and
concentrating all production at a nearby factory built in the 1980s and
opened originally by Mrs Margaret Thatcher on one of her periodic
barnstorming trips, as prime minister, through the East Midlands.
Second, its US plant at Cullmann, Alabama, would be similarly equipped and
it would be the main supplier of Pressac circuit boards to GM, Ford,
Chrysler and the Japanese-owned car plants in the US. In the event of
trouble on one side of the Atlantic there could at least be back up from the
other.
The third step was the introduction of a new way of organising the
manufacture. Pressac, like so many of its peers in the UK engineering
industry, switched from batch manufacturing to cellular manufacturing.
Linking together the different steps of production in a cell has raised
quality levels: the next stage cannot be started if the preceding stage has
not been completed properly, while in batch manufacturing, where processes
rather than products are linked together, locating a quality problem was
difficult.
Mr Cullis calculated that Pressac had made productivity gains of between 40
and 50 per cent with the cellular manufacturing of the etched process. In
1989, Pressac employed 1,800 people. Now it employs 700 for a similar
turnover of around Pounds 33m a year.
Because higher demands are being made on each employee, much greater
attention is being paid to training. On the cell notice boards at Long
Eaton, alongside the photographs of the cell members, there are charts of
their training accomplishments.
'The next stage is that each cell will have a self-improvement programme,'
said Mr Cullis.
As in-house skills widen, so does Pressac's ability to diversify the
products to which the skills can be applied. This diversification has
started. The circuit board technology is being applied to heated wing
mirrors and to the control of air bags.

The best way to come out of a recession is to innovate,' says Mr Jean-Pierre
Lefebvre, president of LVD, Belgium's biggest machine tool producer and a
manufacturer of machines that cut, bend and punch holes in sheet metal.
Most machine tool builders agree, but not all have been able to achieve that
in the past two years of virtually worldwide gloom in the capital equipment
industry. Throughout this period LVD has continued investing in more new
products than ever.
But LVD, founded in the early 1950s and based at Gullegem, is not the
average machine tool builder. With turnover of about Pounds 60m and 900
employees worldwide, it is significantly bigger than the norm in the
industry. Yet it remains in the control of the three founding families - Mr
Lefebvre is son of one of the founders.
LVD's location in what was predominantly an agricultural area has created a
sense of independence, preferring to make components rather than buy in.
With no outside shareholders to worry about, LVD has been able to take a
very long-term view of its future needs, says Mr Lefebvre. But he is not
dogmatic about keeping the company privately-held.
So far, LVD has managed an almost unblemished record of year-on-year growth
in turnover, which peaked in 1989. However, the downturn since then has been
relatively mild by machine tool industry standards. Sales in 1992, when the
company made its first ever loss, were down 4.5 per cent on 1990 levels. The
company failed to return to profit last year when sales fell a further 12-13
per cent to about BFr2.6bn. But that was still about 25 per cent higher than
in 1987.
The company has built its success on a policy of product and geographical
diversification in sheet-metal machinery, to protect itself from
overdependence on any one sector. It has also been careful to control its
worldwide distribution channels with sales and service sites in all major
markets, rather than having too many agents.
The relatively wide product range for a company making metal-forming
machines means that LVD cannot throw as much money on individual product
areas as some of its larger competitors, notably Trumpf of Germany and Amada
of Japan. It also has to fund the relatively costly systems for its
machines, which it has been using for the past 20 years to differentiate its
products from its rivals'.
The development of new products or entry into new markets, therefore, is an
area where LVD has little margin for error. It regularly spends 7-8 per cent
of sales on research and development, and always likes to have new products
ready for when a recession ends.
It has consequently looked to acquisitions and technical co-operation to
help develop its range rather than concentrate totally on internal R&amp;D.
Another development has been a shift in manufacturing strategy. Employment
at Gullegem has fallen from 670 to 600 since 1990 because of the recession
and the need to raise productivity.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (8): Foundry finds a
giant niche - DPC tells Paul Cheeseright what was involved in its decision
to switch to the heavy castings market / Profile: Deritend Precision
Castings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deritend Precision Castings has been looking for size and not just in the
normal corporate sense of expansion. Rather it has sought and found the
ability to cast ever larger components for use in power station turbines.
Production of these large components by investment casting, as opposed to
fabricating or forging, is what earns it a specialist market niche. Plenty
of companies can cast the small components but, said Mr Paul Farrow,
managing director of DPC, 'there is only one other site in the world capable
of casting large casings,' and that is in the US.
This concentration on the heavy component end of the turbine market is of
relatively recent duration, but in some respects it has saved the company.
DPC has been a foundry player since 1948 and a leader in UK investment
castings. By the late 1980s it was under threat.
'People come up with cheaper products. You've got to offset this by coming
up with a product which is better and for which there is a high entry cost,'
said Mr Farrow. At the same time the company 'perceived a requirement for
large investment cast components for the industrial gas turbine which would
substitute for forgings and fabrications'.
The market analysis went further. It forecast that, with any peace dividend,
there would be problems with sales to the defence and aerospace industries.
So there was a case for trying to shift the direction of sales. The share of
the industrial turbine makers in DPC's customers has risen to 85 per cent
from 48 per cent in 1988.
Supplying the industrial turbine market has been a focal point of Triplex
Lloyd investment. Triplex Lloyd acquired DPC in 1989 and its power division,
of which DPC is a part, has consistently raised profits. DPC's own sales
have been on a steadily rising trend as the power business proved almost
invulnerable to recession.
DPC had annual sales of Pounds 7m in 1988, just before the Triplex Lloyd
takeover. In the year to March 1993 sales were Pounds 18.6m and for the
financial year just finished they will probably turn out to be about Pounds
20m.
The way the activities of the group have been switched round is apparent in
its international market share. In some areas, like the very large vacuum
castings, it has 100 per cent, but at the level of the smaller castings its
share drops to 12 per cent. The larger products now account for 30 per cent
of DPC's business.
The cost of this switch in the emphasis of DPC's business so far has been
Pounds 5m on equipment with another Pounds 1m left to spend and between
Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m on product development. This enabled it to handle
castings weighing up to 500 kg, compared with only 30 kg previously.
To handle such heavy castings, a fresh approach to the making of the wax
moulds into which the metal is poured has been required. Larger furnaces
have been needed. Because the weights involved have increased there has had
to be a greater reliance on robotics. The creation of larger and larger
castings has meant that strains in the metal alloys, different from those in
smaller components, have needed new metallurgical insights.
With the new equipment, DPC will be able to push its sales up by 50 per cent
to Pounds 30m a year. But the arrival of new equipment has meant changes to
the physical lay-out of DPC's plants at Droitwich, Worcestershire. There
production is concentrated in two plants - Vines Lane, which has been
redeveloped, and Berry Hill, half a mile distant, where finishing takes
place and support services are situated. Like other engineering companies,
DPC has coalesced its move to new products and new techniques with a change
in manufacturing organisation. It too has adopted cellular manufacturing. At
Vines Lane, the cells are based on the large products, the smaller products
and a jobbing operation which produces components to special order in small
quantities.
Introduction of cellular manufacturing has had familiar effects. The lead
time for orders has been reduced from 16 weeks in 1991 to between eight and
12 weeks, with the aim of coming down to eight. The overall capital base -
that is fixed assets and working capital - has been reduced by eight per
cent. 'We have stopped component tourism,' declared Mr Farrow - that is
half-made products do not wander around the plant any more. These changes
were accompanied by a new emphasis on training and DPC management now claims
that each employee is multi-skilled.
These investments in equipment, products and people have kept DPC in the
game it has chosen to play. The gas turbine market has grown steadily. 'It
has probably reached a peak in terms of placing orders,' said Mr Farrow.
'But there is a spares requirement later and this has not started. Over the
next 10 years we don't see any decline in the total of parts required.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (7): Perkins, Cummins
take off the gloves - US engine makers' British subsidiaries use contrasting
tactics in their contest for sales of the smaller range of diesel power
packages / Diesel Engine Wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are happy to show anyone interested in seeing world class manufacturing
around our plant,' says Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins, the
Peterborough-based diesel engine producer. 'Except Cummins of course,' he
adds with a grin.
The feeling is mutual some 160 miles north at the Cummins engine plant in
Darlington, which Mr Denis Welch, plant manager, believes can show
competitors a thing or two.
The two plants are the biggest producers of diesel engines in the UK, and
compete directly at the smaller end of the market. Each plays a vital role
in the worldwide competitive battle that pits Indiana-based Cummins Engine
and US-owned Perkins against each other and a handful of other big US,
European and Japanese producers.
The history, appearance and size of the plants is very different - the
Perkins plant opened in 1947, so looks older and still employs 2,750
overall. At Darlington, Cummins only began manufacturing in 1965 and at its
peak employed 3,100 people. It now employs 650, of which 500 are involved in
UK manufacturing.
But there is one striking similarity: although the starting points may have
been different, both plants have been through considerable upheaval over the
past three to four years.
In particular, there has been a fundamental cultural change based on
teamwork and 'empowerment' which encourages the workforce to think for
themselves and make suggestions. 'People are paid to improve the business,
not just perform to the status quo,' says Mr Welch.
At both companies, the concept of 'customer-led quality' has been adopted
with enthusiasm - and an acceptance that competitive pressures in the
industry make the need for continuous improvement imperative.
The transformation of the two plants leads observers to conclude that UK
diesel engine manufacturing is in pretty good shape. 'It's alive and
kicking,' says Mr Allan Rawnsley, an industry consultant. 'It's significant
that Cummins has made the UK a major base while Perkins, with its roots in
the UK, has built on local strengths.'
The achievements of the industry are all the more remarkable because of the
complexity of diesel engine production. At Peterborough, Perkins has more
than 13,000 part numbers and at any time 8,000 part numbers will be going
through the production system, says Mr Miles Coleman, general manager for
manufacturing at the main Perkins Engines (Peterborough) business unit.
It is mass production, but flexibility has to be built-in too. Perkins
produces 720 engines a day at Peterborough with an average batch size of
five, says Mr Gilroy.
At Darlington, meanwhile, there are 1,600 'live' engine specifications and
200 specification alterations a month, says Mr Dave Womersley, manufacturing
manager. In 1986, the plant only handled 84 specifications, showing how
customers' demands have changed.
Production levels also vary widely, requiring action to ensure plants stay
profitable at lower capacity usage levels. Cummins is producing 105 engines
a day now, but Mr Welch cannot remember a quarter where production has not
varied by less than 15 per cent from the previous three months.
At Cummins, what Mr Welch calls the 'major vehicle for change' has been the
so-called Cummins Production System, a system of improved material flow
through the factory which aims to reduce manufacturing lead times by
shortening production routes and to eliminate waste through Japanese-style
Kaizen or continuous improvement methods. 'Continuous improvement beats
postponed perfection,' says Welch.
The system uses five guiding principles which are translated into 10
practices to help improve performance. They are:
'the customer comes first'
'quality in everything we do'
'people make the difference'
'education and training are the foundation for improvement,' and
'we are in it for the long haul'.
In production terms, the specific aim was to iron out bottle necks which
were restricting output to nine or 10 engines an hour. 'We said, 'what do we
have to achieve to get production up to 16 an hour?'' says Mr Welch.
The system has reduced the average throughput time from 4.5 days to three
days since 1986, and Mr Womersley is looking for a further 30 per cent
improvement over the next 18 months. The 16-engine-an-hour target has been
achieved, and installed capacity has been improved from 40,000 engines a
year to 56,000.
Darlington is essentially an assembly plant but Peterborough has
historically done a great deal of its own machining. About five years ago,
however, it decided only to make internally what it could do better than
outside suppliers.
The result, says Mr Gilroy, was the sale of all manufacturing of parts such
as flywheels and manifolds, which are still produced in Peterborough by
Precision Components, a Triplex Lloyd unit. Perkins still machines basic
parts such as engine blocks and cylinder heads.
This was followed in 1991 by a major total quality initiative. That was a
relatively late move into TQ by international standards, but, as Mr Rawnsley
comments, Perkins have grasped the nettle.
An external investigation by Quest consultants had established a year
earlier that, by world class standards, Perkins was suffering from poor
product and service quality, and Mr Gilroy was determined to change that.
The programme has three interlocking elements - 'customer led,' 'continuous
improvement' and 'involvement and culture change'. Each began with a set of
goals, followed by a number of key steps for achieving them.
The 'customer-led' element, for example, had three goals; to anticipate
customer needs by knowing its business, to be seen to add value to
customers' business, and to be first choice in diesel selection.
Using approaches such as setting joint improvement plans with customers and
distributors and fixing aggressive targets for improving performance,
achievements have included reducing engine lead times from 12 to two weeks
for major customers. Delivery reliability has also been increased.
Some elements of the changes on the factory floors at both plants are
similar. Both companies have, where appropriate, adopted line-side storage
to give individual teams a highly-visible means of controlling their stocks.
Cellular manufacturing, with its inherent flexibility and multiskilling, has
also been introduced where possible. At Cummins, reorganisation of cylinder
head sub-assembly has reduced floor space by nearly 40 per cent, cut
throughput time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes and halved employment from
four to two.
A larger section at Perkins for the assembly of engine blocks has seen
employment fall from 17 to 14, while quality and productivity have been
enhanced through a computer-based system that shows workers which parts to
use and makes it easier to cope with mixed production runs. Cummins also
uses error-proofing techniques to ensure flexibility is not compromised by
lapses in assembly.
Significantly, both companies say that no worker will lose his or her job
because of the improvement programmes - although there may be other reasons
such as market conditions.
This is a vital pledge. Not only does it help smooth the path to improvement
in heavily unionised environments, it could also be one reason why the
workers at both plants are willing to make suggestions for improvements.
Both companies have spent heavily on training as part of the cultural change
programmes, in an effort to maximise employee involvement in the business
and, as Mr Gilroy puts it, to 'change attitudes so that workers can feel
they are making a contribution to the business'.
Highly public, incentivised methods are used to recognise quality and other
improvements, through everything from noticeboards to medals, and special
events.
By training to achieve true teamwork, the pay-off comes from suggestions
made by the teams, who are often in the best position to make them anyway.
At Cummins, workers on the oil cooler assembly section worked out a simple,
pc-driven system to identify the right parts for each different unit. The
parts, which until recently were piled in a heap, have been sorted out on
racks to reduce errors and improve stock rotation. There have been many such
'low-cost or no-cost' improvements, says Mr Womersley.
At Perkins, says Mr Coleman, 'we are encouraging and tapping into people's
suggestions'. An example was a suggestion last year from a TQ team for
barcoding to be used on engines, replacing an often difficult to read sticky
tape.
Another example quoted proudly by Mr Gilroy involved a shopfloor worker
drawing up a 'process map' for engine production that covered an entire
table. This was the basis for a successful initiative simplifying the map.
As for results, sales per employee have risen dramatically. At the Cummins
plant they have leapt from Dollars 65,000 in 1986 to Dollars 408,000 last
year. At Perkins, for the same period over the company as a whole sales per
employee rose from Dollars 77,000 to Dollars 185,000 at Perkins. And neither
company is resting on its laurels.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (6): Back to the
school desk with Rover - Growing numbers of UK engineers are going on
skill-raising courses. At Rover Group, CPD is seen as vital to raising the
calibre of the company's senior staff / Continuing Professional Development
</HEADLINE>

After 26 years with the Rover Group Mr David Hackett can see how the company
has changed since its doldrum days a decade or more ago.
Now the company has a fluid structure that aims to 'exploit the knowledge
and experience' of its workforce. Employees must show the adaptability and
flexibility needed to go 'as and where required by company needs'.
His own recent experiences illustrate the point. Five years ago he became
one of Rover's new breed of 'cell managers', heading up around 100 shopfloor
workers on the recently-launched K-Series engine. After a subsequent spell
as a shift manager he moved into product design to assist further
development work. Currently he is Conformance Manager for K-Series
Manufacture with responsibility for quality and processes in the machining
and assembly areas. Next year he will be helping oversee the introduction to
manufacture of the enhanced engine.
This has required the exercise of a broad mix of managerial and technical
skills. Accordingly shortly after he became a cell manager he embarked on
the two-year part-time Integrated Manager Development Scheme (IMDS) run by
the Warwick Manufacturing Group at Warwick University specifically for Rover
employees.
Through a mix of tutored course and project work he acquired new expertise
in areas such as corporate management, finance, quality, statistics and
information technology. It was, he says, his first experience of formal
education since he had completed his apprenticeship over 20 years
previously.
But Mr Hackett is only one of around 700 Rover employees to have embarked on
IMDS or its equivalent. Moreover 1,500 of Rover's cadre of 4,000 managers
have taken some sort of course at Warwick and many more of the 33,000 total
workforce have undertaken a personal development and learning initiative
over the past five years.
The reason is Rover's recognition that continuing professional development
(CPD), the constant effort to improve the quality of its people, is crucial
to overall business success.
CPD is gaining recognition across UK industry. Figures from the Engineering
Council, the umbrella body for Britain's engineering institutions, show that
between 1989 and 1992 the proportion of senior engineers reporting
involvement in CPD activities rose from 49 to 71 per cent.
The Council is keen to promote CPD, and has regional co-ordinators visiting
companies to ensure individuals are pursuing it. A Council working party is
already drafting a code of practice, which is likely to be published in
about a year's time.
At Rover, the CPD initiatives are spearheaded by Rover Learning Business
(RLB), a wholly-owned subsidiary with 42 staff set up in 1989 to design and
develop education and training programmes for Rover's own needs.
Mr Ken Simmons, director for learning programmes, says RLB has three
distinct missions - to educate the company's dealers, to facilitate the
management of change within the company and to support general management
development.
The main thrust of Rover's management development effort lies in a series of
interlocking courses at Warwick. Recently the IMDS was replaced by the
Integrated Manager Learning Programme (IMLP), again a two-year part-time
course but now allowing attendees to mix a mandatory core of nine general
management modules with seven more specific subjects of their own choice.
The core modules include, for instance, Human Factors, Commercial Law and
Distribution Efficiency. Options range from technical subjects like CADCAM
to business issues such as Collaboration and Contracts. Mr Simmons says the
new structure allows employees more leeway to promote 'their own personal
aspirations'.
Beyond IMLP lie two more levels of achievement - the Integrated Graduate
Development Programme (IGDS), a three-year MSc degree programme, and a
four-year Engineering Doctorate. Below it is the basic Improving Business
Effectiveness course comprising three one-week modules intended to provide
an introduction to business issues for individuals lacking academic
self-confidence.
Within Rover numerous other initiatives are under way all of them ultimately
relating back to the company's Corporate Quality Strategy Document, which
specifically identifies 'learning' as a fundamentally important activity.
The document is written by about 400 of Rover's senior managers and the
courses devised by RLB are the result of similar broad-based consultation.
The Rover Employee Assisted Learning (REAL) scheme allows every Rover
employee to claim a Pounds 100 subsidy towards tutored learning in any
subject - even ballroom dancing - the point being simply to get individuals
used to the idea of learning new skills.
Around 70 per cent of all employees have a Personal Development File, a
comprehensive set of documentation that allows them to map out their own
career progress plans.
This year the company is also implementing new Personal Development Reviews,
in which individuals discuss with their immediate managers their success in
achieving personal objectives defined in the context of cell, departmental
or wider corporate performance targets.
A fundamental principle in the whole of Rover's CPD efforts, in fact, is the
delegation to line managers of responsibility for assessing the training
needs and progress of their charges and frequently for providing it.
All this costs Rover around Pounds 35m per year in direct charges and time
lost from immediate productive work. But Rover is confident that its people
development initiatives are a crucial factor in its renaissance and equally
adamant that it is not consciously copying the example of any other firm.
Enthusiasm for CPD continues unabated at the car manufacturer. Mr Hackett,
for instance, is thinking about applying for the IGDS scheme and, says Mr
Simmons, the very first morning after the takeover by BMW was announced RLB
took a dozen phone calls from Rover staff wanting to learn German.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (5): R&amp;D spending
holds up - Six companies canvassed by the FT indicate that product
development is buoyant in spite of lower output / Money for Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may not be much consolation to engineering workers who have lost their
jobs over the past three years, but an informal Financial Times survey does
at least suggest that the cuts in manufacturing have not been repeated in
product development, writes Andrew Baxter.
The six engineering companies which the FT has been tracking out of
recession all have high hopes from new or recent product introductions. They
will be hoping to continue the British tradition of innovation in
engineering while avoiding the other great British practice of failing to
profit from it.
There are all sorts of reasons why that has happened, including the lack of
finance available to help innovators turn an idea into money and other
external factors such as a comparatively unfavourable tax regime for
encouraging research and development.
'Culturally we are a nation of innovators, we have been for many, many
generations,' says Mr Mark Abrahams, Fenner's finance director. 'Where we
have failed as a nation is in marketing, we do the clever bit and we let
other people take it away.'
Dr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, says part of the problem
is that innovation is an individualistic activity and marketing is a group
activity. 'We are much better as a nation of individuals than we are working
in groups, which is almost the reverse of the case with the Japanese.'
Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering, even talks about
the 'myth' of Japanese engineering - they are very good at applying new
ideas but not the best original engineers.
Bloxwich, for example, has developed a process for making one-piece car
power train pulleys - they are normally two-piece and welded together, which
can cause corrosion problems. After an 'enormous' R&amp;D programme, it is now
negotiating to sell the pulleys into Japan, where manufacturers have been
unable to produce it. These are some of the new products which the FT Six
have recently developed and hope will have a big impact financially:
FENNER: the Hull-based industrial group's fluid power division has developed
a vapour recovery pump for garage forecourts, in response to legislation
that is already enacted in German and Sweden and likely in most of the
developed world, to remove potentially carcinogenic vapours. Mr Abrahams
says that, with 2.5m petrol pumps in the developed world, the potential is
'really quite enormous.' There are rival products, but the clever bit about
Fenner's pump, he says, is its ability both to compress vapour and to take
neat liquid down a coaxial pipe without jamming.
600 GROUP: the machine tool and materials handling equipment group has been
active in both the traditional and more high-tech ends of its business. Next
month it unveils its new Tornado range of CNC lathes after an unprecedented
market research exercise designed to match the product to the needs of small
engineering companies.
It has also recently introduced a laser marker which Dr Gaskell believes has
'enormous potential' because of its versatility. 'You can struggle your way
out of almost anything if you've got the right products at the right time,'
he says. 'If you research the market right and you've got a distribution
network, and you've got the right product, hopefully it will go, and that's
what we are doing.'
JCB: the UK's biggest construction equipment producer has invested heavily
over in new product development over the last three years, and mostly in
smaller machines where the market is fast growing, says Mr Martin Coyne,
chief executive. Last month in Spain JCB rolled out seven new products and
it's a very exciting time for the company, says Mr Coyne. The pace of new
product development has been maintained, and indeed the recession is a good
time to be launching and preparing new products, he says. In recent years
the much expanded presence of Caterpillar, the industry's biggest producer,
has produced very serious competition for the first time at the smaller end
of the market where JCB mainly operates. But JCB hopes to hit back at the
larger end of the market with two big new wheeled-loaders.
BLOXWICH: the manufacturer of vehicle and other parts is still in business
only because over the last 10 years it has been concentrating on R&amp;D and new
designs, says Mr Burton. In its security seals business, Bloxwich decided
six years ago to build its own range of metal seals and related
manufacturing equipment, ending the need to pay royalties to a US licensor.
On the automotive side, Bloxwich is a big producer of door checks, one of
the hundreds of car parts which only get noticed if they start making a
noise. The company recently developed what Mr Burton calls the best door
check in the world through innovative designs of plastic materials. 'We
believe that this product will take off,' he says.
SENIOR: the tubing, ductwork and specialist engineering group has 'bought
in' its major innovation in the past three years through the 1992
acquisition of Flexonics in the US, but has developed its new business
quickly since then, says Mr John Bell, chief executive. Flexonics makes a
range of flexible hoses and expansion joints used for example in exhaust
systems in the the automotive industry.
Investment in the new business has continued and Flexonics is now supplying
the Japanese transplants in the US as well as the Big Three. 'We have also
brought the technology into the UK we are one of the few companies that can
boast we have opened a greenfield factory in the past year,' says Mr Bell.
POSIVA: the Scunthorpe-based company sells gears and drives produced by its
German parent, and Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director, says innovation does
not stop at new product development. His innovation has been to take a fresh
approach to marketing. 'I increased the number of people I had to sell the
products, to at least maintain my market share. We also concentrated on
products coming through which had not previously sold very heavily in the
UK.'
New product devlopment in Germany, meanwhile, has continued apace, with
recent offerings including a range of flexible couplings for off-the-road
vehicles, which Mr Bricknell says is innovative and also good value.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (4): Just let the
dears get on with it - John Dunn describes tools which are so reliable that
they can be left unattended to cut metal all night if necessary, thereby
doubling or tripling their productivity / Machine tools
</HEADLINE>

TAKE one fresh egg. Clamp gently in chuck. Insert 2mm diameter drill in
spindle. Switch on machine and drill hole in egg. Wipe up egg yoke.
Now tap end of drill lightly with hammer to blunt it. Repeat the drilling
operation.
Result? The machine tries to drill a hole but detects the extra force on the
spindle caused by the blunt drill and stops before it smashes the egg.
Drilling holes in eggs is not, on the face of it, the most profitable way to
use an expensive computer controlled CNC machining centre. But cutting-tool
maker Sandvik Coromant likes to use the occasional egg to demonstrate how
modern machine tool technology can dramatically increase the payback from
metal cutting operations for British industry. A machine sensitive enough to
stop a blunt drill from breaking an egg can safely be left to cut metal
unattended, all through the night if necessary, thus doubling or trebling
its productivity.
Mike Swaffield, general manager of Sandvik's automation division, says a
typical CNC machine tool is only cutting metal for 30 per cent of the time.
The rest it spends standing idle, waiting for materials, cutting tools, jigs
and fixtures, for a broken tool to be replaced, or to be programmed for the
next job.
'Our business is to unlock that 70 per cent of unused machining time,' he
says. Sandvik Automation, formed last May, is breathing new life into an old
machine tool technology - direct numerical control or DNC.
This creates a factory floor network by linking each machine tool by wire or
cable to a terminal in the design office. Programs can then be downloaded
electronically to each machine, and data on a machine's performance fed back
up the wires to a central monitoring point.
But, says Swaffield, once that network is in place, then 'squirting part
programs into machine tools' is just a tiny fraction of what can be done to
improve machine tool useability.
In the hands of Sandvik, the network becomes a conduit for 'paperless
manufacturing' in which a range of software and hardware connects machine
tools, inspection machines, tool room, design office, planning office and
stores in a two-way flow of data.
The aim, says Swaffield, is to ensure that the right tools and materials are
always at the right machine at the right time to do the right job and to
keep it cutting metal.
With the basic CoroNet network installed, CoroPlan - 'containing everything
Sandvik knows about cutting metal' - will plan the best way to do a new job
and list what tools are needed and their settings. It will calculate to a
fraction of a second how long the job will take.
CoroTAS then takes over to look after all the tooling, ensuring that the
tool room is told what tools to get ready for each job. It monitors tool
inventory and tracks tools around the factory. Savings in tool stocks alone
can pay for CoroTAS in a few months, says Swaffield.
IntelliTool will keep an eye on tool wear, automatically stopping a machine
and alerting the toolroom when a tool blunts or breaks. And the system will,
of course, send out part programs and collect data on machine utilisation.
When boiler maker Babcock Energy of Renfrew spent Pounds 100 000 on a
CoroNet DNC system to link up 16 machine tools, it paid for the system in
just eight months from the savings it made by getting programs to its
machines electronically rather than by paper tape.
'We only sell systems on the basis that we will save the customer money,'
says Swaffield.
If only life were that simple for the machine tool makers. The demand for
higher speeds, shorter cycle times, increased accuracy and reliability at
stable, if not lower, prices have brought remarkable changes to machine
tools. 'Today, we are selling machines that size for size are 15 per cent
cheaper in real terms than the machines we sold in the mid '80s - and they
are faster and more accurate,' says Mike Ryan, sales director of machining
centre maker Cincinnati Milacron.
At Cincinnati's Birmingham plant, the use of simultaneous engineering has
led to the redesign and relaunch of its complete model range in just four
years. Spindle speeds have leapt from 4,000rpm to 10,000rpm, doubling metal
removal rates. Tool movements between cutting operations are three times
faster, slashing 'chip-to-chip' time from 15-20 seconds to 5-8 seconds.
'A job can now be done in a fraction of the time it took 10 years ago,' says
Ryan, adding that speed is all important in reducing a machine's hourly
costs and shortening its payback.
The quality of machine tools is now taken for granted, says Ryan. Thanks to
lessons learned from the Japanese, reliability is no longer an issue. 'We
have designed out the need for maintenance by doing away with mechanical
assemblies such as clutches and gear boxes and reducing the number of parts
by over 40 per cent. Our machines now only need an hour's maintenance a
week.'
Les Pratt, general manager of Yamazaki Machines in Worcester, says the
machine tool industry today is giving its customers far more value for their
money. 'They're buying a machine that in real terms is cheaper than 10 years
ago. It will run longer with less supervision.
'It's faster and more accurate. But the problem remains that UK
manufacturing industry is driven by the need for much shorter paybacks than
its competitors. Payback is out of step with the operating life of a machine
tool. As a result, industry is suffering from not replacing its ageing
machine tool stock.'
Next month Europe's largest lathe maker, the 600 Group, will unveil a new
CNC lathe, the Colchester Tornado. It will cost Pounds 35,000, almost Pounds
15,000 less than the old Colchester 350 launched a few years ago with a
similar specification.
It is the outcome of extensive market research which showed that the drive
by lathe manufacturers for more and more added value was pricing machines
out of the range of small jobbing shops.
Colchester decided to design the Tornado down to a price - an hourly rate -
that small firms could afford. 'We're not introducing a cheap machine. It
will cope with 95 per cent of the requirements of small engineering firms,'
says managing director Colin Gaskell.
'We've taken out the features that don't add to productivity. The average
job shop doesn't want a third axis or live tooling.' What they want, says
the company, is low cost of ownership and until now none of the lathe makers
has been addressing the small engineering firm sector. As a consequence,
Colchester believes the Tornado will boost its low 6 per cent UK market
share to 25-30 per cent within 12 months.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (3): Financial
training for the new generation - John Chelsom, professor of engineering
management at City University, tells Andrew Baxter about ways of making
engineers more at home with finance and communications / Interview:
Professor John Chelsom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the many criticisms lobbed at the UK education system over the past
decade or so is its failure to produce enough engineers with the right
financial and communications skills to make it to the top in British
industry.
The resulting dominance of senior boardrooms by accountants and finance men
is, in turn, seen as a symptom of all that is wrong in UK industry and a
reflection of the confusion over who engineers are and what their status
should be.
But while all sorts of commentators, academics and government officials
identify a need in the UK for more engineers who are financially aware, it
is not something that can be achieved overnight. Even so, Prof John Chelsom
looks on the whole situation as an opportunity rather than a disaster area.
A former purchasing director at Ford of Europe, Prof Chelsom can remember
several promising UK machine tool companies in the 1970s which were run by
engineers. 'About 80 per cent of them went bust,' he says, 'largely because
these very good engineers did not have even enough financial training to
realise they needed more financial expertise. They also lacked the financial
training to deal effectively with their sources of finance, such as the High
Street banks.'
Since July 1991, Chelsom has been professor of engineering management at
City University, giving him an important role in the battle to produce
engineers who can manage. It is by no means an impossible task, he says:
'Engineering training does equip people extremely well to be excellent
managers. It is a lot easier to turn an engineer or a person with a
technological background into a very good manager than it is to turn, for
example, a social scientist who is a good manager into someone who
appreciates the technology issues.'
This is particularly relevant, he says, in an era when technology issues are
widely seen as being among the most important business drivers. 'Senior
executives have learnt the financial skills of management, but now when
confronted by the implications of technology, and having to develop parallel
technology strategies along with business strategies, they are not really
equipped to do it.'
Having engineers in senior positions in industry is not only beneficial
because they will then encourage their companies to adopt practices such as
concurrent engineering and rapid prototyping, he says. Some of the methods
of analysis used by engineers for designing products can also be applied to
a business.
City University is taking a twin-track approach to developing engineering
managers. The engineering management content of its undergraduate
engineering degrees courses has been increased in recent years. 'We hope
that people are leaving here with a grounding in management issues, rather
than just being an expert in some particular aspect of engineering,' he
says.
The other group being targeted is postgraduates, for whom an MBA in
engineering management began in 1989. This is aimed at graduate engineers or
the equivalent, and contains all the usual constituents of an MBA programme
but with an engineering industry slant. The course, full time for one year
or part-time for two years, will equip technicians and engineers for
development into senior managers, says Prof Chelsom.
There are, naturally, challenges to be surmounted in producing the supply of
engineering managers that the UK needs. For one thing, says Prof Chelsom,
business developments point to the need for people who are multi-skilled and
can work in mixed groups - 'We're trying to give engineers a chance of doing
that in academic surroundings, by problem solving, learning about
communications, making presentations, as well as giving them the information
to develop skills,' he says.
Yet, he adds, the mechanism for delivering this information, in terms of
government funding, does not provide the means for realising the identified
needs. 'There seems to be more and more compartmentalisation.'
Another problem area he identifies is the relationship between industry and
academia. Here, he says, there have been some welcome developments through
the increase in participation by senior engineers from industry as teachers
in universities. This can take two forms, the late career change or part
time involvement, and both bring the 'real world' into the lecture room and
have been followed extensively at City University. There is also increasing
use of academic engineers in industrial research.
What is missing, though, is continuous interchange that involves young
academics in the management of engineering companies. Something is being
done about this through the Teaching Company Scheme, a partly-government
funded scheme under which academics supervise recent graduates working in
business and industry, but this is project related and may not expose the
academic to corporate management issues.
Improving engineers' communication skills is seen by Prof Chelsom as
particularly important because, he says, the shortage of such skills is
often the reason why engineers lack the confidence to go forward into senior
management.
He quotes the view of one senior UK engineering director who says he wants
the education of engineers to enable them to shine in groups that include
lawyers, accountants and others.
Another challenge, he says, is to find ways for engineers from small and
medium-sized companies - often seen as the UK's best growth opportunity - to
participate more easily in engineering management courses. In particular, he
says, the financing structure of grants for postgraduates puts an embargo on
part-time programmes, but many engineers from such companies could not
afford to be away from work full-time.
But Prof Chelsom insists that there is already evidence of how engineers can
reach senior positions in industry which do not necessarily involve
engineering, at companies such as ICI and British Gas. 'That could be more
widely known,' he says, 'and might influence the selection of engineering as
a potential career, and as a subject for study.'
And, he says, 'we have to be optimistic about the next five years, otherwise
the last five have been in vain. There are signs that more and more
companies recognise that an engineering degree should have a strong element
of management.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (2): Untouched by
human hands - Intelligent machines are a familiar sight on motor production
lines. Now they are expected to turn their 'hands' to the high-speed packing
of food and drink / Robots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A PLATOON of raw recruits drafted in to the French army to pack combat
rations are having to look lively. Up to 10 different menus are needed each
month.
Each ration consists of 18 items ranging from a pack of biscuits and a tin
of meat to purification tablets and a miniature stove. In order to keep the
fighting troops fed, the new recruits have to pack rations at the rate of 24
a minute.
The luckless legionnaires are 13 industrial robots, part of a FFr25m
automated packaging and palletising line built for the army by ABB Robotics.
Three robots unload boxes of goodies from pallets on to a conveyor which
delivers them to the ration packing station.
Here another nine machines, using videos cameras to recognise the right
items, pack them into ration boxes in just 2.5 seconds. The 13 robots stack
the ration boxes on to a pallet for delivery to the barracks. Five different
menus can be put on one pallet to match a barracks' order.
David Marshall, responsible for customer training at ABB Robotics in Milton
Keynes, fervently hopes that the food, drinks and confectionery industry -
including even army rations - will become the next big market for robots.
'The whole robot industry has depended on the automotive industry since day
one. Look at the figures - 80 per cent of the world market for robots is in
the automotive and automotive supply industry. We are looking to the food
industry to perform as well as the automotive industry.'
The reason for his optimism is that industrial robots have become more
attractive to the food industry for packing and handling, particularly in
the light of new health and safety regulations restricting the weight of
loads that can be lifted manually.
They have become faster, reliable, more accurate, and easier to incorporate
into a production line. Better motor control software has allowed ABB, for
example, to squeeze 25 per cent more performance out of the same robot.
Robots are also simpler to program, operate and maintain. And they can lift
bigger loads. They can also be washed down with a hosepipe. And prices are
coming down to a level where paybacks are acceptable to the food industry.
'The food, drink and confectionery industry is surviving on low-cost female
labour. Despite their flexibility, using people to pack those army rations
would have been a nightmare,' says Marshall. Also, the industry is looking
to cut costs. Although robots are flexible and reliable, so far they have
been too slow and too expensive, says Marshall.
But what is good for the food and drinks makers is good for manufacturing
industry. Mike Wilson, marketing manager at Fanuc Robotics in Coventry, says
of the improvements in robot performance: 'Our new ARC Mate welding robot,
for example, is 30 per cent cheaper in real terms than a similar model three
years ago. And it is 20 per cent faster. A spot welding robot can now do one
spot weld every 1.5 seconds.' Ten years ago, says Wilson, it would have
taken three.
Some of the gain has come from the improved mechanical performance of robots
 -faster acceleration and deceleration and better overshoot behaviour. And
some has come from better integration of the robot into the process, says
Wilson. 'The spot welding gun will begin to close before it gets to the
weld, for instance.' The load capacity and accuracy of robots has come on in
leaps and bounds, too. 'The biggest robot we do carries 300kg. That was
unheard of 10 years ago for an electric robot,' says Wilson.
Reliability has also greatly improved, he says. An example is the arc
welding robot. Weld wires occasionally get stuck in the solidified weld pool
at the end of a weld. A few years ago, as the robot moved away it would rip
the welding torch off the arm. Today, says Wilson, 'wire-stick' sensors
prevent this and automatically send a pulse of current down the wire to burn
it free.
A similar example of improved capability is 'scratch start'. If a bead of
silica from the flux gets left on the end of the welding wire, it will not
strike an arc and has to be snipped off manually. Today's robot will sense
this and scratch the tip of the wire along the component to rub the bead
off. It will then go back to the correct place on the weld and start
welding.
Overall, says Wilson, the cost-to-performance ratio of robots today is
considerably better than a few years ago. Most people now buy a robot
'package' which includes some process engineering expertise and an
application software package. 'This avoids a lot of programming and makes
them quicker to install and easier to operate.'
When Vauxhall bought 120 Fanuc welding robots for its new Astra line at the
Ellesmere Port plant a couple of years ago, it handed them on to six
companies building the welding lines. 'We designed a software package for
Vauxhall that would interface the robots with all the hardware and provide
an operator interface. That forced all the line builders to use the robots
in the same way. It made maintenance a lot simpler and saved money. We only
had to write the software once and copy it six times. Each line builder
would have had to develop their own.'
Yet despite the advances in robot technology, Britain has one of the
smallest robot populations of all the industrialised nations, around 7,600,
compared with Germany's 39,000 and Japan's staggering 350,000.
Even the former USSR has more robots per employee in manufacturing industry
than Britain. The problem is the 18 month to two year paybacks demanded in
Britain, says Wilson, compared with as long as five years in Japan. 'It is
very difficult to justify any capital expenditure on an 18 month payback.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (1): Survivors from

parts of Europe / The state of the industry

Any hard-pressed engineering company executive wondering whether it is worth
putting years of effort into developing successful businesses while staving
off recession and adapting to change would have found some answers at a
birthday party in Cambridgeshire last month.
The occasion was the silver jubilee of the Caparo Group, the steel and
engineering products business built up by Dr Swraj Paul from a small company
in Huntingdon - hence the lunch in nearby St. Ives, attended by the local
MP, Mr John Major, the Prime Minister.
Dr Paul began with Pounds 5,000 in 1968 and has built Caparo into one of the
largest family-owned businesses in the UK, basically by adding value through
turning steel into engineered products such as fabrications, forgings and
fasteners.
'There are those who once wrote off the steel business and advised against
continued investment in it,' said Dr Paul. 'I think we have proved that
there is no such thing as a bad business, there is only bad management.
Times may be difficult and conditions may be adverse, but managers with
skill and with faith in human resources will always be able to prosper.'
Dr Paul said the importance of Mr Major's attendance went well beyond
celebrating Caparo's success. It signified the Prime Minister's direct
endorsement of a 'vision in which we all participate - the revival of
prosperous, modern British manufacturing'.
Mr Major, in turn, made it clear where he stood on the importance of
manufacturing. 'There are some who regard manufacturing as almost marginal,
and some who regard it as fundamental,' he said. 'I take my stand with the
second school. I don't regard manufacturing as a cinderella industry -
making things matters.'
Mr Major's remarks must have been a relief to people in engineering who
endured the 1980s when service industries were all the rage and must have
wondered if an incumbent of 10 Downing Street would ever talk like that
again. Even so, there are many who still feel the government is only paying
lip service to the importance of the engineering industry.
The Prime Minister also talked about the success, innovation, skill and
far-sighted judgment he had seen as he went round manufacturing and
non-manufacturing activities in the UK. Too little is heard of some of these
remarkable successes, he complained.
Today's second FT Ingenuity Survey chronicles some of the success stories in
the UK engineering industry as companies use innovation, in the form of new
products and new manufacturing methods, to enhance their productivity and
competitiveness.
It looks, for example, at new product development at the six engineering
companies which the FT has recently been tracking out of the recession. It
also includes examples from continental countries such as Germany and
Sweden, where the phrase 'making things matters' is taken as read but
important changes are underway as engineering companies react to new
circumstances.
In Germany, for example, the changes in manufacturing and organisation at
Siemens are an attempt to mitigate the effects of high labour costs by
further exploiting the advantages of manufacturing in Germany - notably a
highly-skilled workforce.
The survey also looks at the suppliers of equipment to engineering companies
 -notably machine tools and robots - and what they are doing to help
customers increase their productivity, and hence profits.
This is perhaps of crucial importance in the UK, where the decline in the
manufacturing and engineering base over the past 15 years makes it all the
more important that what is left is internationally competitive, even world
class.
As Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British
Industries, said in a lecture last month at the City University, the UK's
manufacturing base has declined more and faster than those of other
countries.
In 1960, the UK accounted for 16.5 per cent of world trade in manufactures,
while Germany had 19.3 per cent and France had 9.6 per cent.
By 1990, the UK share had fallen to 8.6 per cent while Germany's rose to
20.2 per cent and France's edged up to 9.7 per cent. The Japanese made the
biggest gains during the period but the US lost only about a quarter of its
share while the UK's fell by nearly half.
Mr Davies described engineering's contribution to the decline as
significant, with a third of the sectors that make up engineering moving
into a trade deficit during the 1980s, joining the one sixth that were
already showing a negative balance.
The decline in the manufacturing base has had two important effects, he
said: first, a very significant change in the shape of the economy is likely
to leave a large number of casualties in its wake, and secondly, the UK has
found it difficult to benefit from the newly-growing areas of the world
economy.
With the emergence of new competitive threats from low-wage economies, Mr
Davies foresees two significant pressures on the engineering industry.
First, even though wages in industrialising nations
will not stay at the current levels as the aspirations of their populations
rise, there will be cost pressure, especially on manufacturing wages.
Secondly, he says, 'we will face an absolute requirement to upskill our
workforces and move up the value chain. We will need to compete not just on
cost, which will be difficult if not impossible to do, but also on the
quality of our product, its design, its marketing, and overall, its
inventiveness. Engineering will play a key role in that upskilling,
upgrading process.'
Evidence from the battlefield in the engineering sector confirms these
pressures: negotiating price increases is virtually a thing of the past, and
there is constant pressure to reduce costs and yet increase quality and
service in the supply chain.
Hence the efforts to improve processes and - to use modern management-speak
 -to 're-engineer' engineering. The process will continue irrespective of
short-term market conditions.
Fortunately, the evidence from this Survey shows that the re-engineering is
occurring throughout the engineering industry, and not just in the
automotive and aerospace sectors where many of the best ideas in world class
manufacturing first take root. Clearly, engineering companies are taking the
view that their long-term competitiveness relies as much on their own
efforts as it does on the creation by the Government of the conditions in
which manufacturing can prosper.
There is still plenty more to be done, of course. But one of the most
encouraging things to emerge from this Survey is the extent to which the
acceptance of the need to improve has permeated all levels of engineering
companies. Energised by teamwork, shopfloor workers are making their
contribution by coming up with suggestions for improvement. Even five years
ago, most would have said that was a job only for management.

FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Allied tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The surprise Pounds 739m takeover by Allied Lyons of Spanish spirits group
Pedro Domecq won plaudits from across the market, although the accompanying
profits forecast proved disappointing. Allied suggested its profits for this
year will come in at Pounds 604m, whereas drinks analysts had been expecting
in the region of Pounds 625m. This was the chief factor in pulling down the
shares, which tumbled 44 to 561p. There was also some concern at the deep
discount of the 2-for-13 Pounds 651m rights issue priced at 490p.
The deal will catapult Allied from fifth to second in the spirits league
table and give it critical mass in the lucrative Spanish and Latin American
spirits markets. Mr David Thompson at Kleinwort Benson said: 'This gives
Allied a strong position in some of the best markets.' Mr Geoff Collyer at
NatWest Securities said: 'This is an outstanding deal. Domecq has been one
of the best performing spirits businesses of the last five years.'
Allied's lower than expected profit forecast hit other spirits groups, with
Grand Metropolitan sliding 10 1/2 to 455p and Guinness 15 to 467p.
Better-than-expected preliminary results and a highly successful
post-results meeting with insurance analysts saw Sun Alliance shares record
the best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 index.
Sun Alliance shares closed a net 12 higher at 326p, after touching a
session-best of 337p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 8.4m, the highest
single-day's activity in the shares since December 1992.
Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he was preparing
to upgrade his current year forecast for Sun Alliance and reiterated his buy
recommendation on the shares.
Shares in tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries failed to
respond to a 25 per cent dividend hike and closed 5 lower at 454p. The
conglomerate is the first UK company to take advantage of legislation going
through parliament and declare that its final dividend is the result of
foreign income and so not liable to advance corporation tax (ACT). The hike
means that funds such as pension funds which are allowed to reclaim ACT will
not lose out while straightforward investment funds will benefit. BAT Due to
a technical fault, Thursday's edition carried a table of New Highs and Lows
for 1993/94 unchanged from the previous edition.
believes about 40 per cent of its shareholding is with non-tax paying funds.
Mr Nyren Scott Malden from BZW, the company broker said: 'The market has
given a grudging response to a company which is trying extremely hard to do
right by its shareholders.'
The shock of a Pounds 63m rights issue, the passing of the final dividend
and heavy losses for the year triggered a massive mark-down in shares of
John Mowlem, the construction group.
Marketmakers chopped their opening price for the stock to 120p, attempting
to stave off any avalanche of selling but nevertheless encountered a flurry
of sellers who drove the price down to close 40 lower at 112p.
There was talk that Great Universal Stores (GUS) had settled a problem with
the inland revenue over a plan to buy some of its shares back. The story,
unconfirmed by the company, was first heard following its share
restructuring late last year. GUS, which has over Pounds 1bn in cash, saw
its shares climb 7 to 574p.
Anticipated good results from Morrison (Wm), the northern supermarket group,
saw the shares edge up 3 to 120p. Results from Booker, which saw better than
expected cash generation, helped the shares gain 18 to 429p. Allied Lyons'
rights issue reminded the market of one of its perenniel favourites Cadbury
Schweppes and the shares slid back 14 to 473p.
A buy note from Credit Lyonaise Laing helped Granada gain 3 to 545p.
Transport and construction group P&amp;O was one of the best FT-SE 100
performing stocks after analysts upgraded profit forecasts following better
than expected full-year figures. The shares jumped 27 to 695p. UBS turned
buyer and raised its current year estimate by Pounds 40m to Pounds 320m.
Equipment and services group APV slipped 7 to 121 1/2 p, after reporting a
fall in profits.
A two-way pull in business services group BET brought volume of 12m by the
close, making it the day's most actively traded stock. The shares eased a
penny to 128p. The company has been seeing analysts this week before going
into closed season.
United Newspapers rose 5 to 643p after announcing figures at the top end of
the range of analysts' forecasts.
The day's two new issues both made perfectly respectable debuts, considering
the big losses across the market and the big tumble, around 6 per cent, the
market has suffered since the stocks were priced.
Computer service solution group MDIS opened a couple of pennies below the
issue price, but held up well, eventually ending the session at 257p after
turnover of 5.5m shares.
Brightstone Properties, placed in the market at 125p, ended the day at 136p,
albeit in thin trading of 223,000 shares.
There were, however, widespread fears that the flotation of Beazer Homes,
hived off by the Hanson group, could see the shares open at a discount to
the 165p issue price.

FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome hit by R&amp;D fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shock news over its research and development programme took any potential
shine off Wellcome's interim figures and saw the shares slide 51 to 550p the
biggest drop in the Footsie, on turnover of 12m.
The fall continues a depressing trend for the hard hit pharmaceuticals group
 -last year's interim figures were accompanied by a 72-point tumble from
just under 900p. It also reinforces the gloom for investors who paid around
800p-a-share for the 290m share stake sold by Wellcome Trust more than 18
months ago.
Wellcome's profits were within the range of analysts' estimates, but sales
growth was significantly lower than most had anticipated. This was
accompanied by news that the company had withdrawn a new anti-shingles
treatment at a time when Zovirax, its headline anti-viral treatment, is
coming under increasing competitive pressure.
The results may have been honey for the bears but supporters such as Lehman
Brothers were clearly disappointed. Analyst Ms Jo Walton of the US house
argued that Wellcome still offered the best value in the sector, but
conceded that: 'The risks throughout the whole pharmaceutical sector are
extremely high.' She shaved her full-year forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds
700m after exceptionals.

FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond weakness returns and hits share
prices - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK stocks suffered a further setback yesterday as European and US securities
markets continued to grapple with the uncertain interest rate outlook.
British government bonds fell heavily after sterling weakened against the
German mark, and although London stocks bounced back from the day's lows,
the closing picture was darkened by a 50 point fall in early dealings on
Wall Street as more US banks raised prime rates.
The session opened fairly calmly, with European markets at first taking a
favourable view of a sharp rise in February M3 money supply in Germany.
Later, however, opinions on the German money data changed and doubts were
cast over the Bundesbank's chances of cutting its discount rate.
Equities were overshadowed from the opening by news of a Pounds 651m rights
issue from Allied Lyons to help fund its purchase of Pedro Domecq, the
Spanish drinks group. Shares in Allied fell heavily, and the Footsie Index
was also hit by a sharp setback in Wellcome after the interim trading
statement was received badly by City analysts.
Interest rate optimism continued to recede in London as investors digested
the implications of the Retail Price Index news of the previous day.
However, not all analysts were bearish; several leading brokers remained
confident that base rates will be cut next month and urged fund managers to
see the present shakeout in equities as a buying opportunity.
The fall in the Footsie was held to around 20 points until the second half
of the session when losses in government bonds were extended to nearly two
full points at the longer end. The Footsie dropped to 3,111.8, a net loss of
43.5, as pressure from stock index futures cut into the blue chip stocks.
Although bonds remained depressed, the stock market rallied, helped by
encouraging post-results meetings with analysts at Sun Alliance and P &amp; O.
Once again, the stock market escaped heavy selling, and it was the futures
markets which took the brunt.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,121.7, with the day's fall
reduced to 33.6 points. Traders again pointed out that the Footsie lacks a
support level above the 3,080 area and is vulnerable to any selling
pressure. Some institutional selling was reported yesterday but the day's
Seaq total of 703.5m shares compared with 714.5m in the previous session. On
Wednesday, retail, or customer business was worth Pounds 1.79bn, well up to
the best daily average levels of the past twelve months. Institutions tend
to make their immediate move in the futures markets, and trade the
individual stocks when market prices are suitable.
Some comfort was taken from the market's ability to rally, and also to show
some resistance to the slide in the UK bond market. Analysts pointed to the
steady flow of increased dividend payments from British companies, which was
described as the more positive side to the pressures from economic recovery
which are upsetting fixed interest markets.
The clear signs of dividend and earnings recovery now coming through in UK
company results was put forward as the arguement for buying equities at a
time when the bond market has become a high risk arena.
However, the markets this morning faces the March report on business trends
from the Confederation of British Industries.

FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures were led lower by the sharp retreat in gilts, and fears
of another fall today were heightened by a slide in the June futures
contract in after hours trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,125, down 30 on its
previous close and around 8 points below its fair value premium to cash of
about 10 points. Volume at the official close was 18,246 contracts.
Buying mostly by independent traders (locals) helped the contract record a
high of 3,164 in the first half of the session, before sellers gained the
upper hand.
June suffered further in after hours trading following a slide in the S&amp;P
futures in the US which were down 7.7 points at the worst. It fell to 3,105
prompting fears of another sell off in the UK market today.
In the Liffe mid-250, June closed at 3,770 on favourable volume of 632
contracts.
In Liffe traded options, total volume slipped back to 41,170. The FT-SE 100
option saw business of 18,067 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 3,415 lots.
Among stock options, British Gas was the most active with a total of 2,382
lots and was followed by Kingfisher at 1,439. BT, Wellcome and Allied-Lyons
were also busy.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges in wake of
killing of Colosio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks went into a tail-spin yesterday after the assassination of the
leading Mexican presidential candidate deflated confidence in the financial
markets, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.37 lower at 3,821.09, after
recovering somewhat from a downturn of nearly 64 points at 1.30pm. During
mid-morning, the NYSE's 'uptick rule', which restricts program selling, was
triggered when the blue-chip index's decline first breached the 50-point
mark.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.19 at 464.35.
Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 303m shares changing hands. Declining
issues overwhelmed advances by 1,720 to 519.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 3.72 to 469.66,
while the Nasdaq composite lost 10.83, or 1.3 per cent, to 786.68.
Despite speculation that equity investors would become less focused on the
direction of bond prices after this week's increase in short-term interest
rates, stocks closely mirrored activity in the US Treasury market.
Bond prices plunged as dealers sold off their Treasury holdings amid
confusion in the market for Brady bonds and other emerging-market debt
instruments. A subsequent surge in gold prices added to the selling
pressure.
The action came in the wake of the previous evening's shooting of Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party. By midday, yields on the benchmark
30-year government bond were again approaching the 7.00 per cent barrier,
rattling investors in both markets.
The lingering rate worries were brought into sharp focus with the decision
by leading US commercial banks late Wednesday to lift their prime lending
rates a quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 per cent. The higher rate will
only modestly increase the cost of borrowing for businesses, but the move
reinforced the impression that a period of easy money, which has fuelled the
economy's recent recovery, was nearing its end.
As result, cyclical stocks, which generally benefit from glad economic
tidings, suffered severe setbacks. Caterpillar plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to
Dollars 116 7/8 , DuPont was marked down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 and
3M shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 100 1/8 . Automobile issues, a chief
beneficiary of low rates, showed marked weakness. General Motors lost
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 , Ford backtracked Dollars 2 to Dollars 61
3/8 and Chrysler Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 .
Banks, which sought to protect their profit margins by lifting their prime
rates, held up relatively well amid the general downturn. Citibank dipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 33 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks tumbled in active trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell
40.28 points, or 0.87 per cent, to 4,569.65, with declines outpacing
advances 505 to 326.
The volume of 87.22m shares was below Wednesday's 90.77m but trading value
rose to CDollars 1.12bn from CDollars 949.0m.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Latin America): Uncertain prospects for
Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the country's financial markets closed yesterday following the
assassination of thepresidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio on
Wednesday, active trading in Mexican equities was seen in New York and
Europe.
A rush of sell orders initially led to the suspension of Telmex ADRs in New
York. They were later requoted and at the close of trading had fallen
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/8 .
Ms Sarah Lavers of Latinvest in London commented that European investors had
taken a measured view of events so far, with expectations of a possible
correction in the market of between 5-10 per cent.
A more important test would come from US investors, she added, while the key
determinant of the market's future direction would come from the currency
markets. If the local currency weakened appreciably, then this would clearly
put a certain amount of pressure on companies with dollar debt, she said.
Investors were waiting to see whether Mr Manual Camacho Solis, who had
announced earlier in the week that he would not put his name forward as a
presidential candidate, would change his mind.
Kleinwort Benson's Latin American team commented that the central bank was
likely to allow the peso to break out of its trading band in the short-term,
while interest rates were also expected to rise.
Elsewhere, equities opened sharply lower in BUENOS AIRES where the Merval
index dropped 2.2 per cent to 589.16.
This followed a gain of 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, and a rise of 2.8 per
cent on Tuesday.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris worried by new issue
procession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weak dollar and lower US treasuries undermined European debt and equity
markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was buffeted both by Alcatel Alsthom's FFr5bn convertible bond
announced after the close on Wednesday, and rumours that Total might be
planning a FFr7bn issue on Monday.
Combining this with weakness elsewhere on the continent, the CAC-40 index
lost 47.61 or 2.1 per cent to 2,152.56. The market had already discounted a
cut in the intervention rate, a 10 basis point cut coming at lunchtime.
Turnover was FFr6bn on the last day of the account.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe said that investors were becoming
worried by the number of companies tapping the market, either through
convertibles or rights issues.
Total lost FFr12.20 to FFr319.40, while Alcatel was off FFr26 at FFr680.
Credit Lyonnais came out with a 1993 loss of FFr6.9bn after the close, worse
than most analysts' forecasts, the CI's ending the session down FFr5 at
FFr714.
FRANKFURT did a double take, rising first on February's M3 growth rate of
17.6 per cent, not as high as some flights of fancy suggested on Wednesday,
then falling as professionals decided that the Bundesbank, which still had
obvious money supply problems, would not be accelerating its interest rate
reductions in the near future.
The Dax index closed the session 0.55 higher at 2,161.68, but dropped to an
Ibis-indicated 2,144.36 in the post-bourse. Turnover rose again, from
DM9.1bn to DM10.6bn, but Mr Thomas Nolten, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said
that this seemed to reflect trading, rather than investment decisions.
On the afternoon slide Mr Nolten said that the bond market went sour, the
dollar down, and that US equities were also a weakening influence. Even the
recent strength in cyclicals, he said, had come into question by the end of
the day.
AMSTERDAM weakened sharply as the market came to terms with the rise in US
interest rates earlier in the week. The AEX index fell back by 7.29, or 1.8
per cent to 408.09.
Financial issues were among the heaviest losers; cyclicals, such as the
chemical groups DSM and Akzo Nobel, which have been notable performers in
recent days, also dipped. DSM fell Fl 1.60 to Fl 124.50 and Akzo Nobel by Fl
5.60, or 2.5 per cent to Fl 219.20.
Philips and its associate Polygram fared better than the norm, with
respective falls of 50 cents and 80 cents to Fl 52 and Fl 76.20: Polygram
yesterday announced the purchase of a Russian record company.
ZURICH turned back after an early rally, unable to maintain the firmer trend
of of the previous two sessions. The SMI index finished 6.2 lower at
2,850.8.
Nestle fell SFr16 to SFr1,213 with its 7 per cent profits rise coming at the
bottom end of expectations: analysts commented that restructuring costs had
been higher than expected. Sandoz registered shares and certificates rose
SFr20 and SFr50 respectively to SFr3,970 after the pharmaceuticals group
announced a higher dividend and plans simplify its share structure.
MILAN was becalmed for much of the day by the fraught political situation
ahead of the general election, although a selling flurry enlivened the end
of the session. The Comit index fell 4.05 to 667.25.
Stet put on L104 to L5,107 on heightened expectations that it was about to
sell Italtel, its telecommunications equipment maker subsidiary, to Siemens.
Fondiaria, the insurance group, lost L617 or 5.1 per cent to L11,401 after
the French insurer, Groupama, said that it would exercise an option to sell
its 20 per cent stake in the Fondiaria Assicurazioni subsidiary. Toro,
Fiat's insurance subsidiary, fell L195 to L26,000 in spite of its
announcement of higher premium income.
MADRID's general index fell 4.78, or 1.4 per cent to 330.58. Banesto dropped
Pta45 to Pta805 although it secured union support for its restructuring plan
ahead of Saturday's shareholders' vote.
ISTANBUL dropped another 5 per cent, although selective buying interest
emerged towards the close. The composite index fell 686.45 to 12,980.72.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns positive as
region falls back

<TEXT>
Index-linked buying by investment trusts lifted share prices and the Nikkei
index closed higher for the first time in five days, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 75.80 to 20,037.90 after a low of 19,870.09 in
the morning and a high of 20,075.81 in the afternoon. Selling by
institutions and arbitrageurs depressed prices following an overnight fall
in the Chicago futures market. Investment trust buying and small-lot
purchases by foreign investors later absorbed the sales.
The Topix index rose 0.49 to 1,614.91 but the Nikkei 300 fell 0.18 to
296.34. Gainers led losers by 553 to 467 with 163 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.36 to 1,333.63.
Volume was 360m shares, down from Wednesday's 425m, as most investors
remained inactive ahead of today's end of the March account.
Volatility on the bond market also kept investors away from stock
investments. Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, said that the
situation now was similar to 1987, when Japanese bonds followed global bond
markets down. Since cyclical shares outperformed the interest rate sensitive
shares in 1987, he advised a move into cyclicals from financials.
A rise in commodity prices, such as cotton and copper, supported textile and
non-ferrous metal stocks. Nisshinbo Industries, a textile company, rose Y40
to Y1,120 and Fuji Spinning gained Y34 to Y564. Dowa Mining advanced Y16 to
Y560 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y13 to Y914.
Fuji Heavy Industries, a financially troubled car manufacturer, was the
day's most active issue rising Y12 to Y413. Mounting expectations of better
earnings attracted investors, although some car makers lost ground on
profit-taking, with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y2,020 and Honda Motor losing
Y10 to Y1,740.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 2.32 to 22,173.10 in volume of 194.6m shares.
Roundup
The pendulum swung back, mostly reflecting interest rate worries, bond
market declines and profit-taking.
HONG KONG took profits ahead of an expected rise in domestic interest rates
today, the Hang Seng index ending 144.78, or 1.5 per cent lower at 9,320.75.
Brokers said that many positions were futures-linked.
Turnover shrank from HK8.15bn to HKDollars 7.01bn. The Jardine group stayed
under pressure on its decision to delist from Hong Kong, the parent easing
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 48.25 while its affiliate, HK Land, lost 40 cents
at HKDollars 21.40.
Cheung Kong dropped HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 39; it showeda 56 per cent
jump in 1993 net profit after the close.
KUALA LUMPUR fell 1.6 per cent, giving back a good part of Wednesday's gains
on renewed selling which reflected a new KLSE rule covering stockbroking
firms, and the length of their clients' purchase positions. The KLSE
composite index closed 16.43 lower at 983.52.
KARACHI took a technical correction after rises for six consecutive
sessions, and the KSE 100 index fell 38.74, or 1.5 per cent to 2,622.57.
BOMBAY fell in low volume, still reeling under the impact of a ban on carry
forward trade and a broker default, and worried further by the prospect that
tainted shares involved in a two-year old securities scandal might be
attached by the income tax authorities. The BSE index dropped another 45.35
to 3,681.47.
NEW ZEALAND dropped mainly on a weaker domestic bond market, the NZSE-40
index closing 33.91 lower at 2,174.81. Telecom was the biggest loser on the
day, down 19 cents to NZDollars 5.31, and brokers suggested profit-taking.
Turnover was NZDollars 66m.
AUSTRALIA, similarly, blamed the bond market, and subdued overseas equities
as the All Ordinaries index closed 11.1 lowerat 2,169.8. Turnover was
ADollars 627m.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Fed move hits European turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity trading in the leading European markets declined in February after
the strong growth of the previous two months. Turnover declined by 8.2 per
cent last month after rising by 15.3 per cent in January and 12.2 per cent
in December.
February's fall accompanied a 4.4 per cent decline in the FT-A Europe index,
following the decision by the Federal Reserve to raise US short-term
interest rates on February 4. The move took the markets by surprise: they
had not been expecting any tightening until mid-year. It also triggered
panic selling by hedge funds in the bond markets and the instability quickly
spilled over into equities.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities notes, however, that in contrast to
the declining activity in domestic markets the volume of European stocks
traded on Seaq International, the London screen-based system, managed a 0.2
per cent rise on the month. This took London's share of trading in
continental European equities to 16.1 per cent of the total activity in the
domestic markets in February, up from 15.2 per cent in January and 14.8 per
cent in December.
'This continuing faster volume growth in international trading, compared
with domestic market activity, confirms continued involvement of
international investors in the European markets, including sales by US
institutional investors as the going became tougher,' says Mr Cornish.
February's turnover downturn accompanied falls in the market indices for all
eight countries. The Italian market, down only 0.6 per cent, suffered less
than the others while its turnover, against the trend, rose by a massive
46.7 per cent to a record level. This represented an 82 per cent rise on the
average for the previous three months and took Italian turnover, for the
first time, above that seen in France over the month.
Italy saw record inflows into mutual funds in February while strong US
demand for Italian equities has also emerged this year, with the investors
tending to overlook immediate political uncertainties ahead of the general
election on Sunday and Monday. Instead they are concentrating on the longer
term corporate and economic outlook.
The privatisation programme held the key to Italian trading with February
seeing the successful sell-off of the IMI financial services group and the
run up to the sale of BCI.
In addition, the telecommunications sector returned to favour as plans went
ahead to bring together five separate companies under one umbrella, in
preparation for privatisation later in the year.
Germany was the month's biggest loser with turnover down 19.5 per cent, and
12.9 per cent on the average for the previous three months, as the motor
sector, and particularly BMW put in a strong performance but financials were
neglected.
But with share prices down 3.7 per cent overall, the large fall in turnover
was regarded as a return to more normal, but still good, levels after the
records seen in December and January.
Switzerland was another loser, with turnover down 14.6 per cent from
January's record, as investors judged that the time was ripe to take profits
in the banks after the sector's strong run-up to its reporting season.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling and dollar suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling and the dollar yesterday fell to four month lows on the foreign
exchanges against a resurgent D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
Both currencies fell below key support levels. Yesterday evening the dollar
was trading below DM1.67 and sterling was just above DM2.49 having earlier
breached the key DM2.50 level.
Their decline, which came amid a general climate of interest rate pessimism
in Europe, was sparked off by an annualised 17.6 per cent growth in German
M3 in February. Although this poor figure - way above the Bundesbank's 4-6
per cent target range - was widely discounted, it introduced a cautionary
note into the market's view about how quickly German interest rates might
fall.
This feeling was accentuated by the perception that Europe will find it
difficult to decouple its interest rates from the US which has started a
process of credit tightening.
These views were reflected in the D-Mark which finished the day higher
across the board. It closed in London more than a pfennig stronger against
the dollar, finishing at DM1.6726 from DM1.685 on Wednesday.
In Europe it closed higher against the French franc, closing at FFr3.424
from FFr3.418. Against sterling it was nearly two pfennigs higher at
DM2.4971 from DM2.5165.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America, said
sterling's weakness could be explained by the fact that it seemed to suffer
disproportionately at a time of general D-Mark strength. He said this
reflected the market view that the UK remained vulnerable to a politically
inspired rate cut.
Personally unpopular, and facing potentially large losses in local elections
in May, and European elections in June, some observers believe prime
minister John Major is under pressure to cut rates.
This view was not shared by either the gilts or short sterling futures
market where prices fell. Futures contracts were lower across the board. The
June contract settled at 94.73, ten basis points down on the day. The
December contract fell 14 basis points to 94.25, while the June 95 contract
was 29 points lower at 93.44.
Contrary to those who are looking for a further cut in UK rates, the market
is signalling that three month interest rates will be 5.75 per cent at the
end of the year - 50 basis points above the current level of 5.25 per cent.
In the discount market the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 535m. Earlier it had put Pounds 341m liquidity into the system after
forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage. Overnight rates moved between 5 per cent
and 6 per cent.
Analysts yesterday expressed some surprise at the D-Mark strength given the
backdrop of falling interest rates in Germany. It appeared to provide yet
further confirmation of the unravelling of 'consensus trades' in foreign
exchange markets.
At the beginning of the year the market built in long dollar and short
D-Mark positions. Now there is evidence these positions are being reversed.
Although the February M3 figure lent support to the D-Mark, the money supply
figures are so anomalous at the moment that the Bundesbank seems unlikely to
use them as an excuse for not lowering rates.
The fact that the Bundesbank allowed the repo rate to fall by eight basis
points the day before the M3 figure was released lends support to this view.
This sentiment was reflected in the cash markets where, helped by adequate
liquidity, German call money rates eased to 5.70/80 per cent from 5.75/85
per cent on Wednesday.
The futures markets sent a different message, with Euromark contracts
softening slightly. The June contract was unchanged at 94.50, but the longer
contracts lost ground.
Elsewhere in Europe the Bank of France said it would cut its intervention
rate to 6.00 per cent from 6.10 per cent at a securities repurchase tender
held to allocate funds for injection into the money market.
The intervention rate at which the central bank allocates repo funds was
last cut, from 6.20 per cent, on February 24.
The tardy pace of interest rate cuts has not helped the franc which has
weakened steadily over the past two weeks. Indeed, some commentators cite
the franc as evidence of a return to the ERM log-jam of old, where markets
believe interest rates need to fall faster than the pace set by the
Bundesbank, to forestall domestic political pressures.
The Italian lira continued its recent weakness ahead of Sunday's election.
It closed in London at L993.2 from L988.9. Investors are expected to stay on
the sideline until the result becomes known on Tuesday.
The dominant view among analysts is that a centre-left government will be
lira positive. It would be able to introduce the sorts of fiscal and
institutional reforms which markets would welcome.
Under this scenario, Mr Steven Yorke, chief European analyst at Chase
Manhattan, believes the lira could reach L950 by the year end.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ploughing up profits in
Pakistan - A look at the financial shenanigans of the 'tractor Mafia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Saeed Ahmed, a tractor dealer, points to a brand new Massey Ferguson
tractor parked in his showroom, just outside Lahore, Pakistan's second
largest city, and offers to sell it for 10 per cent less than the factory
price. The only catch is that the tractor cannot be legally transferred to
its new owner for another 8 years.
We are at Shadab Tractors, where a consignment has just been released from
the factories after payment of loan money. Many buyers, however, have no
intention of taking delivery. They prefer to sell on at a discount, knowing
they can repay the loans at interest rates up to 10 per cent below
commercial bank rates, or even default without worrying too much about banks
calling in collateral.
Farmers who own at least five hectares of land are eligible for Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan loans. But banks in general have few successes
in recovering bad debts, largely because of a lax legal system which
sometimes allows civil cases to drag on for several years. Almost 30 per
cent of the USDollars 100m Pakistani farmers spend each year on tractors
comes from loans that eventually turn bad, senior ADBP officials
acknowledge.
'There is almost a tractor Mafia out there,' says a senior executive at
Al-Ghazi, the Pakistani affiliate of Fiat. Mr SA Khan, general manager of
Fecto, which assembles Belarus tractors, imported from Russia, explains:
'Certain people buy the tractors and sell them in the open market to make
money. Recovery (of loans) is a difficult exercise'.
Such concerns have been getting wider attention since last summer, when the
government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, began a campaign
to recover loans. That campaign began because the credit system, set up
initially to help poor and middle income farmers to mechanise their farms
and increase productivity, was in danger of collapsing. But the
five-month-old government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has shown little enthusiasm
for following up Mr Qureshi's initiative.
Some ADBP officials warn against aggressive measures to recover loans. 'We
know that we are only able to recover up to 70 per cent loans. But then,
taking tough action against farmers is also politically sensitive. There
would eventually be an uproar in the parliament,' says one. Others complain
that the tractor business has increasingly become a form of patronage by
politicians in successive Pakistani governments, who have tried to appease
constituents through supporting the sanction of such loans.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, who stepped down in July,
announced a 'yellow tractor scheme', designed to charge a 10 per cent
down-payment in advance, recovering the rest in easy installments from
farmers.
The scheme, which could have created another financial nightmare, was
abandoned by the new government, when officials argued that it was only
meant to attract voters during the election campaign rather than becoming
the basis for improving crop output.
Some other businessmen acknowledge that the procedures involving the
disbursement and recovery of tractor loans ought to be tightened, but also
argue that farmers must be encouraged to use their tractors more efficiently
as a step towards improving agricultural output.
'People who have got tractors are not fully utilising them. They are not
using the right kinds of implements,' says Mr Sikandar Khan, chairman of
Millat Tractors, referring to the argument by many experts that Pakistani
farmers have yet fully to appreciate the possibilities of tractors, rather
than using them only for tillage and towing trolleys.
'The yield per acre in Pakistan is one of the lowest in the world. It is
farm mechanisation that is going to pick us out of that.'
Tractor loans could well be central to political concerns in rural
constituencies, but it remains unclear whether the government can continue
to subsidise sales through this discredited system.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec warned of sharp price
falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Geneva today to
debate whether to cut production in the hope that it will lift prices.
Market expectations are that the 12 oil ministers are most likely to simply
roll over the 24.52m barrel a day production ceiling agreed last September.
But the OPEC secretariat is reported to have warned delegates last night
that further sharp price falls could occur unless they agree to a cut.
A secretariat report predicted that prices could fall to single digits
unless action was taken. It said only a 1.5m barrel a day cut would be
enough to give prices a substantial boost. But a Gulf Arab delegate said the
report was clearly 'biased' in favour of those advocating a production cut.
The report will be one of the first items on the agenda when ministers
formally meet today. A series of informal contacts, including a meeting
between the Saudi and Iranian oil ministers, took place last night.
The main issue is whether the current ceiling is appropriate for market
conditions. Earlier this year it proved to be too high in light of a surge
in oil production from non-Opec countries, in particular from British and
Norwegian fields in the North Sea. Pressure on supplies sent prices tumbling
to five year lows.
In recent weeks severe winter weather in the US boosted demand and helped to
underpin oil markets. But prices have struggled to rise above the Dollars
13-Dollars 14 a barrel range for the benchmark Brent Blend.
Even the wealthiest Opec states, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have had
to rein in budgets. The impact on the poor and populous Opec members such as
Iran and Nigeria has been such that some observers predict that their
fragile political stability might be undermined unless oil revenues can be
increased.
The roll-over option is unlikely to bring about any short-term relief for
producers. But it is supported by analysts who predict that demand for Opec
oil is likely to grow later in the year. 'They don't need to make any grand
gestures,' according to Dr Leonidas Drollas, economist at the London-based
Centre for Global Energy Studies. 'Stocks are not that high and the call on
Opec oil is roughly at current levels.'
An Iranian delegate yesterday indicated that a roll over was not the
favoured option. But analysts say Iran may be struggling to maintain current
output.
A small cut of 500,000b/d or so would not impress the markets, however.
'What is the point of a symbolic cut?' asks Mr Mehdi Varzi, director of
energy research at London brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'If they cut, they have
to make it convincing.' Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant producer, objects to
any strategy which would result in non-Opec producers winning additional
market share. It is also worried that a large cut would trigger renewed
over-production by some members.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices showed a very slight overall rise this week taking
the market indicator 4 cents up to 558 cents a kg., having touched 560 cents
on an intervening day. If anything the week ended a little softness among
finer merinos but not enough to disturb market sentiment unduly. Some
stockpile wools sold quite well in Melbourne, the first to be sold by
auction, with larger offerings next season a possibility. Australia is now
closed for auction purposes until after Easter. Business in wool textile
products generally is not as active as strength in wool markets indicates.
Prices are intensely competitive and stocks of tops are heavy enough to
prevent buyers from getting too concerned about rising prices. Only in the
carpet sector have developments led to pressures further down the trading
line.

Non-core divisions of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, will be allowed
to raise private finance and to form joint ventures if proposals put forward
yesterday by Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president, are accepted.
Mr Villarzu said non-copper divisions, such as the 530MW Tocopilla power
station, would be able to raise finance through flotation of shares or the
issue of bonds. This would allow Codelco to concentrate on exploiting,
refining and selling copper, he said.
To recovery efficiency, lost largely during the military regime, Codelco
would need to increase its annual investment budget to Dollars 400m-Dollars
450m, to be spent primarily on the expansion of Andina and the start-up of
Radomiro Tomic.
Mr Villarzu set targets for the year 2000, which he said were 'tremendously
demanding' but 'achievable'. These were: to cut output costs to 50 cents a
pound from 69 cents; to raise productivity by 8 per cent a year to 80 tonnes
of copper annually per worker; to halve the accident rate; and to spend 15
per cent of the annual budget on improving Codelco's patchy environmental
record.
To sharpen Codelco's management structure, Mr Villarzu confirmed his
intention to allow divisions to operate autonomously under the umbrella of a
holding company. He also said he wanted to change the 'anomalous' role of
the board of directors which currently has little control over the
day-to-day running of the company.
Codelco would no longer speculate on metals futures, Mr Villarzu said, but
would continue to use the market to cover risk. Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the
former trader accused of losing Codelco Dollars 206m, was charged earlier
this week with defrauding the state.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ireland awards exploration
licences

Ten companies, grouped into five consortia, have been awarded petroleum
exploration licences under Ireland's 1993 'frontier' licensing round.
The 16-year licences cover 28 of the 128 blocks in the Slyne and Erris
Troughs lying some 70km off the west and north-west Ireland, and represent
the first major offshore exploration effort in the Republic since the early
1980s.
The licence terms require some 5,000km of seismic and other geophysical
testing to be carried out, followed by the drilling of exploration wells.
Eleven of the 28 blocks have been licenced to a consortium headed by Statoil
(UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company.
In announcing the licence awards this week, Mr Noel Treacy the Irish energy
minister, said the response to the round had been 'very encouraging and
vindicates our recent efforts to promote offshore exploration, particularly
the 1992 licensing terms and taxation measures'.
These measures include a concessionary corporation tax rate of 25 per cent
for companies producing oil and gas under licence.
The Slyne and Erris Troughs lie in water depths ranging from 200m to over
1,000m, and is a relatively unexplored area, having had only three
exploratory wells drilled to date, although seismic surveys carried out in
1991 and 1992 suggested a 'significant potential' for both oil and gas.
The current licensing round, covering 178 blocks in the Porcupine Basin off
the west of Ireland, closes in December this year.
Existing gas reserves in Ireland, at the shallower Kinsale and Ballycotton
fields, are expected to be exhausted shortly after the year 2,000.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee ignores retention cut -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures market shrugged off
confirmation yesterday morning that the recent rise in prices had triggered
the halving to 10 per cent of the amount of exports producing countries are
obliged under their retention scheme to withhold from the market. And in the
afternoon it kept its head in the face of a decidedly shaky New York market.
At the close the May position stood at Dollars 1,360 a tonne, Dollars 8
below the peak reached earlier but still Dollars 13 up on the day.
At the London Metal Exchange an expected break below support levels in the
COPPER and ALUMINIUM markets did not materialise as late bouts of
short-covering in the afternoon mingled with trade and commission house
buying to stem early losses.
Dealers said both metals were under pressure from the outset, although solid
underlying chart patterns remained supportive.
Three months delivery copper spent most of the day probing below the Dollars
1,940 support level but as the selling pressure lifted slightly prices moved
higher.
LME stocks and deteriorating charts continued to erode ZINC'S recent gains,
while LEAD prices eased further, with traders suggesting that a test of
underlying support at Dollars 450 a tonne was likely to be made soon.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver climbs to 4 1/4-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US investment funds that are attempting to force up the silver price
helped push it to 574.75 cents a troy ounce in London early yesterday, its
highest point since November, 1989. The market failed, however, to breach
the important technical level of Dollars 575 an ounce and fell back to close
in London at Dollars 570.5, up 5 cents on the day.
Hedge funds, including the Quantum Fund operated by Mr George Soros, the
high-profile financier and currency speculator who started the run-up in the
gold price about this time last year, are rumoured to have spent USDollars
1bn to buy physical silver.
'There certainly does seem to be an investment programme under way in silver
by some of the big US hedge funds,' said Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at
the Merrill Lynch financial services group, in his latest analysis of the
market. 'They are prepared, my informants say, to put in another Dollars
1bn. Their spot price objective, it is generally agreed, seems to be Dollars
8 an ounce.'
Mr Tony Warwick-Ching, analyst at the CRU International consultancy group,
said the outlook for silver was certainly better than for some time
following three years of supply deficits. But he estimated there was still
between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes of silver in stocks world-wide, enough to
satisfy demand for at least a year.
The US funds were attracted to silver partly by a big buying spree in India
following liberalisation of import restrictions there last year - CRU
estimates India imported 2,800 tonnes in 1993 compared with 800 tonnes the
previous year. Mr Warwick-Ching pointed out that Indian demand had dropped
dramatically when the silver price reached Dollars 5 an ounce, showing how
price sensitive it was. 'And India could start selling again,' he warned.
'India exported a great deal of silver when the price boomed in the early
1980s.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall sharply on Colosio
assassination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds plunged yesterday as news of the assassination of the
leading Mexican presidential candidate sent a chill through an already
jittery market.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 25/32 at
91 1/8 , with the yield rising to 6.957 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/16 lower at 100 1/32 , to yield 5.092 per cent.
The sharp downturn came in the wake of the turmoil which hit the Brady bond
market following the shooting of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio at a campaign stop
in Tijuana the previous evening. Treasury bonds were suffering, along with
US share prices, as investors juggled their portfolios in anticipation of
further declines in Brady bonds and other emerging-market debt instruments.
It also became apparent that nervousness over the upward direction of
interest rates had not subsided with the Federal Reserve's lifting of the
Fed Funds target two days earlier.
Surging gold prices and the decision by some US commercial banks to increase
their prime lending rate contributed to the dismal mood.
In yet another concern, President Clinton was scheduled to hold a press
conference later in the evening. Traders were nervous about further
revelations on the Whitewater affair which could damage the president's
political standing.
Amid the whirlwind of developments competing for attention, the day's
economic news passed with little notice. The Labor Deparment said claims for
unemployment benefit last week dipped by 5,000, against expectations of a
2,000 fall.
A sharp fall in US Treasuries at the opening and deteriorating expectations
of a further cut in UK interest rates sent long-dated UK government bonds
tumbling by more than two points yesterday afternoon. Fears that
international investors would further lighten their holdings of European
government bonds to offset losses on their investments in Latin American
debt also contributed to the sell-off, analysts said.
Traders said the sheer pace of the fall prompted the Bank of England to try
to stabilise prices by offering to buy back cash gilts from a number of
gilt-edged market-makers. They said the Bank was seen intervening between
the levels of 107 1/8 and 107 5/16 on the June contract of the long gilt
future on Liffe. The amount of the intervention was thought to be less than
Pounds 50m. There was no comment from the Bank.
Some analysts said the gilts market appeared to have lost touch with its
fundamentals but they feared that the market still had further to fall. 'The
market has been spooked. . . but the fall is not justified by the UK's
inflation prospects,' said Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman
Brothers.
Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg, agreed
that Wednesday's inflation data did not warrant such a severe drop in
prices. But he said there had been some significant selling of short-dated
maturities which indicated that hopes of further rate cuts were fading fast.
'If the economic recovery is as solid as it appears to be . . . we are going
to experience upward pressures on inflation in 1995,' he said. He also noted
that the December 1995 short sterling contract reflected market expectations
of a base rate of 7 per cent by the end of 1995.
Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the fall in
the June contract below 108 7/32 , the low for the year, unleashed a rush of
stop-loss selling in the futures market. This in turn dragged down the cash
market where the yields on short-dated paper rose by 17 basis points and by
as much as 24 basis points on 10-year gilts.
By the late afternoon, the June contract traded at 106 13/16 , down 2 1/4
points, in active volume of 134,626 contracts.
German government bonds initially held firm, supported by
better-than-expected M3 data for February. But by mid-afternoon, bunds
succumbed to the uncertainty which was dragging down other markets.
The June contract of bund future on Liffe stood 0.77 point lower at 95.47 in
the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.55.
Nevertheless, analysts said the M3 results, combined with the strength of
the D-Mark, held out some promise for bunds since those factors should
enable the Bundesbank to continue to ease monetary policy. The Bundesbank
said February M3 rose 17.6 per cent, which was broadly in line with market
expectations and well below Wednesday's rumours of 30 per cent.
Yesterday's 10 basis point cut in the Bank of France's intervention rate to
6 per cent was in line with market expectations and failed to protect French
government bonds completely from the weakness in other markets. But they
fell less than their European counterparts, with the June contract of the
10-year notional French government bond on the Matif giving up 0.42 point to
122.60 in the late afternoon.

Mayr Melnhof Karton, the Austrian packaging group, expects to raise Sch3bn
when it issues equity next month as part of its initial flotation, Reuter
reports from Vienna.
The group, Europe's number two cardboard packaging maker, is to offer 4m
shares from April 19. One third of the proceeds is to be used to increase
capacity, with the balance used for funding acquisitions, the company said.
Morgan Stanley International, which is placing the international tranche,
expects turnover of Sch8.7bn this year. Pre-tax profits are expected to
total Sch210m, rising to Sch436m next year.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Bonds: EIB DM1bn offering starts firmly in
nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurobond dealers had another frustrating day, with only a handful of issues
dribbling into the market amid volatile trading in European and US
government bonds.
After the recent heavy flow of floating-rate notes, a handful of borrowers
brave enough to issue fixed-rate bonds saw their efforts thwarted by a
further tumble in underlying bond markets.
Amid current nervousness, traders expect issuer and investor-activity to
remain thin ahead of the Easter break. 'We're seeing zippo client flows of
real consequence or depth in this environment,' said a London syndicate
manager.
The European Investment Bank issued DM1bn of 6.5 per cent 10-year bonds
which started out on a strong footing, supported by early strength in the
German government bond market.
'We launched it 10 minutes after the M3 (money supply) numbers - which were
slightly better than expected - and placed a lot of paper quickly,' said an
official at lead manager Deutsche Bank.
However, when government bonds fell in the afternoon, the EIB bonds slipped
in line with bunds.
Their spread over the benchmark 10-year Treuhand bond, however, tightened by
one basis point to 14 basis points, the lead manager said.
'This shows the deal is in good shape,' said a dealer at another house.
Meanwhile, Germany's triple-A rated reconstruction agency, Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau, issued L200bn of 8 3/8 per cent five-year bonds via Deutsche
Bank in London. Despite the Italian government bond market's turbulence, the
lead manager reported a solid syndicate and investor response. The bonds
closed at around 98.90 bid, just outside fees.
At the initial offer price of 98.95, where they yield 8.64 per cent, the
bonds pay a juicy yield pick-up over comparable lira paper: Bayerische
Landesbank's 7.5 per cent bonds due 1999 yield 8.42 per cent, while the
EIB's 7.45 per cent bonds due 1999 yield 8.01 per cent, the Deutsche Bank
official said.
In the Ecu market, General Electric Capital Corporation launched Ecu100m of
6 1/8 per cent five-year bonds. The deal, jointly led by Credit Commercial
de France and Merrill Lynch, was targetted mainly at Swiss and Benelux
retail investors.
Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency affirmed its triple-A ratings on the
long-term senior debt of France Telecom and British Telecommunications (BT).
It also affirmed its A-1 ratings on both of these issuers' short-term debt.
However, it said the long-term rating outlooks for both are changed to
negative from stable as momentum builds to foster competition in the
European telecommunications market.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Latin American issues tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mexican bonds slumped following the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio,
the country's leading presidential candidate. In early trade they fell by
more than five points, though they later bounced off their lows in thin
volume.
Other Latin American debt markets suffered in sympathy. Mexico is considered
a benchmark in the LDC market, and weakness there often spills over into
neighbouring markets.
However, losses in neighbouring markets were not as dramatic as in the
Mexican market.
In general, the more liquid and volatile Brady bonds fell more sharply than
Eurobonds, said Mr Denis Loubignac, a trader at Paribas Capital Markets in
London.
Mexico's benchmark Brady bond, the 30-year par bond, fell by more than 5
points in hectic New York trading, hitting a low of 66 1/2 before bouncing
back to close at 69 1/2 , down from 73 on Wednesday. The Mexican benchmark
Eurobond, a 10-year dollar-denominated bond for Bancomext, fell from 90 to
86 1/4 , but rose from its intra-day low of 84, he said.
Argentina's benchmark par bond fell one point to 57 1/2 , while its global
Eurobond due 2003 fell by about a point to 90 1/2 . Venezuela's par bond
slipped by two points to 53 5/8 .
Market participants now hope the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
will quickly name a new presidential candidate to reduce political
uncertainty and calm the markets.
Although the fundamentals of Latin American haven't changed dramatically,
the events served as a reminder that 'we are dealing with very volatile
emerging markets: there are large risks and large returns,' said Ms Ingrid
Iversen, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell in London.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: OOIL steams ahead to bolster
balance sheet - A look at the shipping group's turnround as a full set of
results is announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shipping crisis of the mid-1980s claimed two of the industry's biggest
names in Asia: Sanko of Japan, and Orient Overseas Holdings of Hong Kong.
In Japan, Sanko was placed in receivership and was eventually dismembered.
The collapse of the company ruined Mr Toshio Komoto, its founder and senior
Liberal Democratic Party politician.
Today, the other casualty of the shipping crisis, now known as Orient
Overseas International Limited (OOIL), reports its first set of full results
since a series of corporate reorganisations which were occasioned by its
near insolvency in 1985.
OOIL is expected to report much improved profitability on the USDollars 8m
it made in 1992. But the aspect of the company's operations which executives
are keen to highlight is the strength of OOIL's balance sheet - at the end
of 1993 it had USDollars 480m in cash and investments - and the coherence of
its business strategy for container shipping.
OOIL was a classic example of John Maynard Keynes's dictum that if you owe a
bank Pounds 10,000 you had a problem but if you owe it Pounds 1m then it has
the problem. At the time of crisis in 1985 OOIL's predecessor and the Tung
family, its controlling shareholders, owed the banks nearly USDollars 2.5bn.
To save the company Mr C. H. Tung, scion of the family fortune and OOIL's
chairman, called in debts and wrote some IOUs. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank
advanced the company HKDollars 1bn in credit; the Chinese government
advanced it USDollars 100m, an enormous sum for a developing country and an
indication of just how valuable an asset Beijing perceived the Tung family
to be.
The price of reorganisation was high. The Tung family - much as Hong Kong
entrepreneurs still do - had run their private interests and public
obligations in tandem. In 1985 the interlocking structure that bankers
encountered was extremely complicated. Only recently has the company
reorganised itself in such a way that bankers and investors understand who
owned what.
Today the overlap between OOIL and the Tung family - which owns more than 50
per cent of the company - is limited to sharing the same offices in Wan Chai
and the use of a container terminal at the port of Kaoshiung in Taiwan.
On the issue of conflicts of interest, Mr Simon Brough, the company's chief
financial officer, is firm. 'There are no inter-company loans and nor would
the board permit it,' he says. 'I'm not aware of what the private side does
and nor am I interested.'
His pride and joy is the state of OOIL's finances, about which he enthuses:
'We have one the strongest balance sheets in the industry and one of the
most liquid,' he says. For a company which was nearly undone because of the
state of its finances, this is clearly an achievement. Mr Brough says OOIL
has a policy of maintaining at least USDollars 200m in liquid assets.
But the health of the company's finances is just one aspect of the pitch
OOIL wants to make to investors. It believes it has a good management story
to tell as well.
At the beginning of the 1990s OOIL embraced the concept of total quality
management and, according to Mr Tung, it has enabled OOIL to climb into the
first division of container operators in the world.
'We are very quality conscious,' says Mr Tung. 'In our business if you make
a mistake in documentation it reverberates around the world. So if you do
things right the first time, you save a lot of money.'
He speaks in the language of the modern manager. He talks of 'critical
success factors' in business, of being 'customer focused', and of doing
things 'right the first time'.
His embrace of western management technique has been well received among
knowledgeable managers in Hong Kong.
According to one senior Hong Kong businessman who knows the company well:
'CH runs OOIL in a modern democratic western style.'
Says Mr Tung: 'I try to emphasise the importance of team play. All sorts of
nationalities work for us and work very well together. We consider ourselves
a Hong Kong-based multinational.'
People are one of the 'critical success factors' Mr Tung likes to talk
about. Another is 'quality' in the delivery of the services OOIL provides.
This has become particularly important as the company has sought to lift its
game in the international cargo transportation business.
This has involved providing what Mr Stanley Shen, general manager of quality
assurance, calls 'third-party logistics support' to customers, such as
support for just-in-time inventory control, better information and
distribution.
In this context the company is particularly pleased with its American
President Lines (APL) alliance. It has joined with APL to provide 'shuttle'
services across the Pacific. This has enabled the two to pool resources and
target higher value cargoes.
To bolster its position in container cargo transport, OOIL earlier this
month said it had placed a USDollars 500m order for six container vessels,
each with the capacity to carry 4,950 20ft containers.
The ships - to be delivered from the second half of next year until the
first quarter of 1996 - will be funded 20 per cent from internal resources
and 80 per cent by borrowings.
The new ships will replace older vessels in OOIL's 25-ship fleet, a fleet
which currently has an average age of 13 years.
Mr Tung believes his company is on the verge of a new beginning. 'It seems
to be a business permanently incapable of doing well,' he says. 'But there
are some shippers which make a 15 per cent return on shareholders' funds
even in difficult years. It all comes down to how you organise yourself to
do it. I think we can.'

claim

<TEXT>
Pancontinental Mining, the thwarted suitor for Australia's Aztec Mining, has
been given leave to go ahead with a legal action against Poseidon Gold,
which outbid Pancon and seized control of Aztec via a ADollars 287m
(USDollars 203m) cash offer earlier this month.
A Sydney court has ruled that some elements of the Pancon claim have no
foundation and should be struck out, but that other sections are legitimate.
The mining group has alleged conspiracy to injure and a breach of the
corporations law. It is seeking punitive damages for PosGold and other
parties, as a result of the way in which PosGold gained control of Aztec.
This was achieved when the bidder upped its cash terms and, the following
day, quickly snapped up more than half its target's shares. Alumax, the US
company which held a critical 37 per cent interest in Aztec and is also
named in the action, led the selling wave.
The mine, which contributed a loss of ADollars 700,000 to Renison's results
in the first half of 1993-94, has been earmarked for closure for some time.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cheung Kong profits surge 56%

<TEXT>
Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire,
yesterday surprised the market with a 56 per cent growth in net profits last
year. Earnings came in at HKDollars 9.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn), compared with
HKDollars 6.3bn in 1992.
Cheung Kong derives some 85 per cent of net profits from property
development - broadly Laguna City, South Horizons and Kingswood Villas  -
and its 43 per cent stake in Hutchison. Analysts say its performance was
lifted by investments and share dealing, such as the sale of 100m Hopewell
shares.
The pre-tax contribution from associated companies last year stood at
HKDollars 7.64bn, compared with HKDollars 4.2bn the previous year. Turnover
was flat at HKDollars 10.7bn, compared with Dollars 10.3bn.
The cement operation, Green Island Cement, showed an increase over 1992, but
conversely competition in the concrete and quarrying products market hit
Anderson Asia.
Earnings per share rose 56 per cent to HKDollars 4.45, up from HKDollars
2.85 in 1992.
Mr Li, chairman, said the group had been actively expanding its land bank,
and had already signed deals to purchase or jointly develop several projects
with large land areas. 'This will build a good foundation for the group's
business developments after 1997,' he said.
Further contracts have been secured with mainland companies in
infrastructure, power, property and hotel businesses, and funds have already
been directed into these projects. These mainland investments would likewise
provide a stable source of income for the group in the future, Mr Li said.
The directors are proposing a final dividend of 76 cents a share, giving a
total payout of HKDollars 1 a share for the full year, an increase of 25 per
cent over the 80 cents paid in 1992.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic to delist in
Hong Kong at year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Jardine Strategic, the holding company for many of the Jardine group assets
in Hong Kong, yesterday followed Jardine Matheson and said it would cease
the trading of its shares at the end of this year.
Jardine Strategic, which is 52 per cent owned by Jardine Matheson, holds
controlling interests in Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land and Mandarin Oriental.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said that with 'change impending in Hong Kong',
the company attached great importance to remaining subject 'to a
British-based system of securities regulation'.
It believes it has achieved this by having the Bermudan government enact
laws to bring the company and its subsidiaries under a statutory version of
the London takeover code. Jardine does not believe that a level regulatory
playing field will prevail in Hong Kong after China resumes sovereignty in
1997.
In spite of plans to cease share trading of the group's constituents, the
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) still claims jurisdiction over the
company.
The Hong Kong takeovers code is broadly drafted and covers public companies,
whether listed or not, which have a large proportion of its shareholders,
assets, operations and management in Hong Kong.
Jardine has many shareholders in Hong Kong and it is one of the largest
non-government employers in the colony. Moreover it derives more than half
of its profits from Hong Kong and is operationally controlled from the
colony.
The SFC's ultimate sanction in Hong Kong is to 'cold shoulder' an individual
or company. This means that no financial company would be allowed to act for
the company; in addition, the full facilities of Hong Kong's market would be
withdrawn.
The Jardine group was the object of furious criticism in Hong Kong yesterday
for its decision on Wednesday to delist. The 'Princely Hong' was described
in the pro-Beijing media as having delivered an 'irresponsible' blow to Hong
Kong's status as a financial centre.
Many newspapers said that the company had received its come-uppance because
the SFC had refused to give it special treatment. As one English-language
newspaper noted: 'The bottom line is that Jardines needs Hong Kong more than
Hong Kong needs Jardines'.
Jardine Matheson's share price fell by HKDollars 1 to Dollars HK48.25 and
Hongkong Land's by Dollars HK0.40 to Dollars HK21.40. Overall, the Hang Seng
index declined by 1.5 per cent to 9,320.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Loral heads Dollars 1.8bn
satellite consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Loral, the US defence electronics and aerospace group, said yesterday it had
assembled a group of 'strategic partners' and secondary investors who would
provide initial financing for its Dollars 1.8bn satellite communications
system known as Globalstar.
The group, which includes leading US and European telecommunications
operators and manufacturers, is to invest Dollars 275m to begin the
construction and launch of 48 satellites providing voice and data
communications services to at least 33 countries.
The announcement comes at a time of heightened activity by high-technology
companies seeking to secure their positions in the market for wireless
communications. Earlier this week McCaw, the US cellular operator bought
last year by AT&amp;T, and Microsoft, the California-based software concern,
disclosed plans to set up a Dollars 9bn system of 840 communications
satellites.
Globalstar is expected to begin full operations in 1999. Initially the
partners would provide services in 33 countries. Later, local telecom
providers are to be granted licences to extend Globalstar's reach to other
regions.
Loral, which will design and build the satellites and control centre,
projected a customer base of 2.7m and revenues of Dollars 1.6bn within three
years of the system's launch. By the year 2012, subscribers were expected to
total 16m.
Globalstar would offer 'substantially' lower rates than other
satellite-based systems, according to the lead contractor, and its cost to
customers would be only a little higher than that offered by cellular
providers.
The European investors in Globalstar are Alcatel, the French communications
systems supplier, and Vodafone, the UK's largest cellular operator.
Alcatel, a leading supplier to the international mobile communications
market, is responsible for design and delivery of payload modules to be
mounted on the satellites. Vodafone, which is investing Dollars 37.5m, will
use the system to offer subscribers using special handsets a global roaming
capacity and a service in remote regions of countries - such as Australia
and South Africa - in which it is building terrestrial networks.
Loral said the key to Globalstar's cost competitiveness was its use of an
advanced digital transmission technology, developed by Qualcomm, a
California high-technology supplier. The system is compatible with existing
wireless communications systems.

at Kemper

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GE Capital yesterday put forward four of its own nominees for election to
the board of Kemper, the Chicago-based financial services group. The move
signals the outbreak of open hostilities in its Dollars 2.2bn struggle for
the group.
If elected, the four nominees - all former executives of either GE Capital
or its parent, General Electric - will push for the sale of Kemper for at
least the Dollars 55 a share being offered by GE Capital, the company said.
Kemper's board last week voted unanimously to reject GE Capital's offer,
which had been made to the company's directors. GE Capital's response
yesterday marks the outbreak of the first full-scale proxy solicitation
battle in the US for several years.
In a proxy battle, one or more shareholders seeks to impose their will on a
company's board by gathering support from other shareholders. GE Capital
said yesterday it held 100 shares in Kemper.
The GE financial services subsidiary said it would write to Kemper
shareholders in the next 10 days to put its case for a sale of the company.
Its four nominee directors will come up for election at the Kemper annual
general meeting, on May 11.
The nominees will contest the four board seats up for re-election at the
meeting, among them that of Mr David Mathis, the Kemper chairman.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carolco to merge with retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carolco, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, is to merge with
the video and music retailer Live Entertainment in a stock-swap deal valued
at about Dollars 15m.
The two companies said the merger would create Hollywood's biggest
independent film production and video distribution company.
Carolco already owns more than a third of Live's stock. After the merger
Live shareholders will own between 22 per cent and 29 per cent of the new
company, to be called Carolco Entertainment.
Under the merger terms, one share of newly issued Live common stock will be
exchanged for 5.5 Carolco shares, but a 'collar' has been built into the
transaction that will keep the total value of the deal within certain limits
if the share prices of Carolco and Live fluctuate wildly before the merger
is completed.
The deal is the latest attempt by Carolco to survive a prolonged battle with
financial insolvency.
Although the studio has scored box office successes, rising debts, incurred
partly because of lavish spending on big-budget films, have threatened to
overwhelm it.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Northrop to shed 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northrop, the US defence company which is engaged in a Dollars 2bn battle
for control of Grumman, plans to cut 3,000 jobs this year, or 10 per cent of
the total.
The cuts mark the latest in a series of steps to shrink the company to cope
with falling US defence spending. Its workforce has fallen to 30,000 from
more than 48,000 in early 1988.
Northrop's cost-cutting has been driven by declining sales. It expects total
sales this year of Dollars 4.4bn, compared with Dollars 5.1bn in 1993 and
Dollars 5.6bn in 1992.
The company's main product is the B-2 bomber, which employs 11,400 staff.
Around 1,300 people will go from this division, with roughly the same amount
from the separate aviation division, which employs 9,300. The remaining
losses will be in electronics.
Northrop is itself widely seen as a potential takeover target, following its
emergence as a bidder for Grumman in competition with Martin Marietta.
Grumman, which agreed earlier this month to a Dollars 55-a-share merger with
Martin Marietta, said yesterday that its board had decided to start talks
with Northrop, which has launched a rival bid for Grumman worth Dollars 60 a
share.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Digital plans its recovery
around PC market - Success in personal computers is critical to the US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of recovery at Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer maker, were
boosted recently by indications that the company is reversing its previously
disastrous performance in the key personal computer (PC) sector.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, general manager of Digital Equipment's PC business unit,
said that if the improvement were maintained, Digital could become one of
the world's leading PC suppliers within two years.
It sold some 500,000 units in 1993, up from 200,000 the year before, with
revenues of Dollars 1bn. At that level, he said, the unit was not
profitable. 'We lost quite a bit of money.'
For 1994, however, he expects to sell more than 1m units, generating
revenues of Dollars 2bn, and trading profitably.
To become one of the world's top seven PC vendors, however, it will have to
sell between 2.5m and 3m PCs a year, worth Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn.
Success in PCs is critical to Digital, struggling back from two years of
losses. It failed to appreciate the importance of the PC revolution in the
1980s, and lost ground to competitors. The PC is a key factor in networked
or client-server computing, where Digital is betting its future; Compaq, for
example, recorded PC revenues of Dollars 7.2bn last year.
Mr Pesatori sees no hope of overtaking the industry leaders - IBM, Compaq
and Apple - but plans to be among the best of the second-tier companies,
such as Hewlett Packard, Dell and Packard Bell of the US, and NEC and
Toshiba of Japan.
Mr Pesatori was brought in to head Digital's worldwide PC operations a year
ago. An industry veteran, he had 21 years with Olivetti of Italy before
moving to Groupe Bull of France to revitalise its ailing Zenith PC arm.
At Digital his strategy has three objectives. First, to build from scratch a
PC organisation. In this he was helped to some extent by Digital's lack of
interest in PCs. He started with 40 people and now has 800 worldwide; new
links with distributors and value-added resellers had to be forged, and new
managers hired.
Mr Pesatori scoured the industry for talent, employing 'slightly
over-qualified people'. Mr Bernard Auer, formerly with Compaq, was hired to
run the European territory. Other top names included Harry Copperman from
JWP Businessland, Carl Gustin from Apple, Winnie Briney from IBM and Ray
Wedock from Epson.
Second, the product line had to be rationalised. Digital had been selling
Olivetti PCs in Europe and Intel machines in the US; now, it is selling its
own range of computers and network servers. Only about 20 per cent of
machines sold in 1993 were not of Digital's design and manufacture.
It intends to move into the SoHo (small office/home office) market. 'How and
when we enter this market is something we are discussing now,' Mr Pesatori
says.
The link with Olivetti will not be abandoned, but converted to a design
partnership whereby the two companies will develop computers with Digital's
'look and feel'.
The third part of the strategy is to build a company with the cost structure
of a PC maker rather than a mainframe manufacturer. Digital as a whole
spends more than 25 per cent of revenues on overhead costs, compared with a
typical PC company's spend of only 13 per cent; Compaq, for example, spends
12 per cent of revenues on overheads.
Bringing down overheads involves pushing up product volumes (theoretically,
if volumes double, overhead costs fall by four points).
One test of Digital's PC ambitions is the proportion of personal computers
it can sell to customers who do not already use Digital equipment. In 1993,
20 per cent of its total PC sales went to new customers, but Mr Pesatori is
confident the proportion will show a significant rise this year.

Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, the US bank, was paid Dollars

rises in the US financial sector announced recently.
Morgan said Mr Weatherstone's remuneration, in the form of Dollars 3.1m cash
and Dollars 3.5m of restricted shares, reflected the bank's 'very strong
earnings' during 1993. The New York-based institution, one of the most
profitable commercial banks in the US, made after-tax earnings of Dollars
1.73bn, up from Dollars 1.13bn the year before.
The British-born Mr Weatherstone, who has headed the bank since 1990, was
paid a base salary of Dollars 700,000, with the rest of his income linked to
performance.
Among other high-paid bank chairmen, Mr John Reed of Citicorp received
Dollars 6.2m, while Mr Dan Tully, chairman of Merrill Lynch, received
Dollars 9.6m, a rise of 30 per cent.

Westpac, the large Australian banking group, and Australian Mutual
Provident, which owns the Pearl and London Life groups in the UK, yesterday
announced significant changes to their troubled 1991 'strategic alliance'.
These will in effect return certain distribution and fund management
activities to the respective partners.
Under the new arrangements, the bank will take full control of Westpac
Financial Consultants, formed as a joint venture between the two and which
distributed retail life insurance and superannuation products designed by
AMP through the Westpac network.
WFCL's sales force, which was largely drawn from Westpac ranks, will be
'fully integrated' back into the Westpac network. The partners claimed this
would 'streamline operations and improve teamwork'. The bank stressed it
would continue to sell AMPAC products, and receive a distribution fee from
AMPAC Life.
AMP will also resume management of the AMP Approved Deposit Fund. Under the
original agreement, Westpac purchased Approved Deposit Fund business, but
then provided products to be sold under the AMP name by AMP agents.
The new agreement removes the requirement that AMP hold 13-15 per cent of
Westpac - although the insurance group said it had no 'present intention' of
reducing its stake. This stood at 13.93 per cent at end-November.
Mr Philip Twyman, AMP's chief operating officer, said the new arrangement
meant that 'AMP will wholly focus on the product and Westpac will wholly
focus on the distribution channel'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: R H Macy in bid to exit from
Chapter 11

<TEXT>
RH Macy, the US department store group, has revealed details of a plan
designed to lead it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by January.
The package, agreed by Macy's board a day earlier and submitted for review
by Mr Cyrus Vance, the court-appointed mediator, is a compromise between
secured and unsecured creditors, who clashed over the terms of the proposal.
However, the future of the New York-based retailer remains uncertain.
Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival of Macy's and one of its
biggest secured creditors, has proposed a merger between the two groups.
Fidelity Investments, which holds Dollars 490m in Macy's debt, suggested
that it was dissatisfied with the proposed reorganisation plan, which may
lead it to abandon its support for Macy's independence.
Under the proposals, Macy's creditors would initially receive a total return
of Dollars 3.6bn on their claims, including Dollars 2.1bn in cash and debt,
and Dollars 1.5bn in equity in the re-organised company.
However, the plan also calls for an additional Dollars 500m to be
distributed in July 1997 if the value of Macy's stock appreciates to at
least Dollars 2.2bn, or by about 47 per cent, before that date.
The two-stage valuation was a concession by Macy chairman, Mr Myron Ullman,
to a dissenting faction on its 11-member board. Mr Ullman, supported by two
of Macy's biggest secured creditors, Fidelity Investments and GE Capital,
had originally proposed a Dollars 3.5bn value on the company.
A second board group, led by Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews and CBS
and one of Macy's biggest bond holders, had backed a plan which suggested a
valuation of at least Dollars 3.8bn.
The higher valuation would provide a greater return on the claims of
unsecured creditors, including public bondholders and trade suppliers.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Veba slips 9% but increases
dividend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Veba, the German energy conglomerate, saw profits slip by 9 per cent in
1993, but the dividend will nonetheless rise DM1 to DM13, Mr Ulrich
Hartmann, chief executive, said yesterday.
Net profits fell to DM825m (Dollars 489m) from DM906m, while group turnover
was marginally higher, up 1.4 per cent at DM66.3bn.
Preussenelektra, Veba's electricity arm and strong-est performer, increased
profits by 6 per cent to DM833m.
Mr Hartmann noted that Veba had spent DM500m buying stakes in six region-al
electricity suppliers in eastern Germany, and looked forward to completing
negotiations for a 26.25 per cent stake in VEAG, the east Germany
electricity net-work.
However, turnover in the transport and trading division fell 2 per cent,
slightly worse than at Huls, the group's chemicals company, where sales
dipped 1.1 per cent to DM10.1m.
A further 3,000 jobs will be shed in the chemicals sector, but Veba said it
does not expect to see any profit until 1995.
A new company, Veba Telecom, will bring together the group's interests in
corporate networks and the mobile phone and cable sectors, and continued
investments in tele-communications would see the Dusseldorf-based group
expand into a fifth division alongside its electricity, oil, chemicals and
trading arms, Mr Hartmann said.
However, Mr Hartmann was non-committal on the timetable for Veba's listing
on the New York Stock Exchange. The group is widely tipped to become the
second German company to seek a listing, following Daimler-Benz last
October.
Feasibility studies on the listing have yet to be completed.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: US banks move to protect their
margins - A look at the industry's response to rising interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US banks had seldom had it so good. The falling interest rates and steep US
yield curve of the 1990s had created an ideal banking environment. How,
though, will they cope with a reversal of these benign factors?
The question has bedevilled bank stocks since last October, when the rally
in long-term Treasury bonds first hit a block and yields began to climb.
Now, with long-term bond yields a full percentage point higher, and seven
weeks after the Federal Reserve first moved to push up short-term rates, the
banks have made their most direct reply to the Fed.
Led by NorWest and BancOne, a raft of money centre and regional banks pushed
up their prime lending rates by a quarter of a percentage point late on
Wednesday and yesterday, to 6 1/4 per cent. It was the first general rise in
prime rates - used as the basis for pricing mainly small business, credit
card and some other consumer loans - since 1989.
By the banks' calculation, the move will help to protect lending margins,
which remain at historically high levels. Bank net interest margins last
year were around half a percentage point higher than they had been at the
start of the decade - some 3.75 per cent at money centre banks, and 4.5 per
cent at the big regional banks.
Strong consumer loan demand has made it easier to raise rates. According to
BancOne, the Ohio-based bank with one of the country's biggest regional
groups, demand from consumers was up 20 per cent in the final months of
1993, compared with a year before.
Although dented slightly by the bad weather of January and February, that
demand continues strong, it says.
Even commercial lending is looking up, after three years of declines.
Commercial loans are up 3 per cent, BancOne reports.
The fact that the prime rate rise was restricted to a quarter of a point,
though, indicates lending margins will inevitably narrow as market interest
rates rise.
The rise falls short of the half point increase which the Fed has engineered
in market rates since the beginning of February.
As a result, the spread between the Federal Funds rate and banks' prime rate
 -a key determinant of lending margins - has fallen to 2 3/4 percentage
points, from 3 percentage points.
But the prime move is only one of several factors affecting bank margins.
For a start, the interest rates charged on residential mortgages - the
fastest-growing category for banks last year - are tied directly to bond
yields, and have ratchetted up in recent months.
Competition for some types of asset, such as credit card loans, has also
already forced margins down. Chase Manhattan, for instance, saw its average
credit card loans fall slightly last year, to Dollars 5.9bn, as a result of
'aggressive offers made by new entrants in an already competitive
marketplace'. Its response: to cut the average interest rate on its cards
during the year to 16.66 per cent, from 17.48 per cent in 1992.
As interest rates rise, it will be difficult for credit card companies to
increase their borrowing rates, putting pressure on what are still
substantial lending margins.
While these factors suggest bank margins will fall, a secular shift in their
business suggests they also have ways to mitigate the damage.
With big companies turning to the capital markets for finance, banks have
lent more of their money to the smaller businesses and consumers who pay
higher interest rates. Four years ago, some 47 per cent of Chase's lending
in the US was to consumers: by last year, that proportion had risen to 65
per cent.
While banks wrestle with the question of how far to push up the pricing of
their loans, bank treasurers face a different dilemma.
For the past three years, their treasury departments have boosted bank
profits, partly by investing their floating rate money in the fixed-income
markets. The opportunities have diminished: the spread between three-month
and 10-year Treasury notes, at 355 basis points at the start of 1993, had
fallen to 265 basis points by the start of this year. (Rattled by the Fed's
February increase, it has since edged back up to 300 basis points.)
Bank treasurers have also used the swaps market to enhance their margins,
agreeing to make floating rate payments in return for receiving fixed rate
payments.
How far have swaps boosted margins - and to what extent will rising rates
affect the position? Given the lack of published information about how banks
use the swaps markets, those questions bemuse analysts and have added to the
uncertainty surrounding bank margins, helping to destabilise stock prices.
Even serious attempts at keeping the markets informed seem destined to fail.
Mr John McCoy, chairman of BancOne, whose big swaps book had long been an
object of investor concern, made an unprecedented attempt to educate
analysts and investors last year about how it used these derivative
financial instruments. His reward: the bank's stock fell even further,
undermining at least one all-stock takeover it had planned.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shareholders keep Banesto
guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely in Spain has a shareholders' meeting been so anxiously awaited as the
one being staged in Madrid tomorrow by Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto).
Three months after the Bank of Spain sacked the board and took the bank
under its wing, the extraordinary meeting is being asked to approve a rescue
plan designed to recapitalise Banesto and restore its balance sheet in
readiness for handing over control in May.
Three other leading Spanish banks - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander
and the state-controlled Argentaria - are preparing to compete for the
controlling stake in Banesto which, with 2,500 branches, has one of the
biggest networks in the country.
The Bank of Spain wants to move quickly to avoid further damage to Banesto,
one of the traditional pillars of the Spanish financial establishment.
However, any group among the bank's 300,000 shareholders with a 5 per cent
interest between them is entitled to challenge the plan, which includes
writing down the nominal value of current shareholdings by 43 per cent.
Even if such a challenge were overruled, the legal process would take up to
45 days, threatening to hold up the rescue scheme. Bank of Spain officials
say they would try to try to press ahead with the injection of new capital
regardless.
A majority in favour of the scheme is assured, with sufficient votes
delegated to the current Banesto board, including most of the 10 per cent
held by Banesto employees.
Crucially, J. P. Morgan of the US, whose Corsair fund has the biggest single
shareholding of 8 per cent, has finally consented to the plan. The main
figures on the dismissed board are also understood to have agreed not to
oppose the scheme. These include the controversial former chairman Mr Mario
Conde, who owns about 3.8 per cent of the stock.
The new board may take up legal proceedings against Mr Conde and his former
colleagues if asked to do so by shareholders representing at least 5 per
cent of the capital.
Official intervention followed a Bank of Spain inspection which found
Banesto had grossly overvalued its assets. An audit subsequently estimated
this 'hole' in the balance sheet to be 20 per cent bigger than the Bank of
Spain's earlier reckoning, at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.3bn). This compared with
capital and reserves of just under Pta360bn.
Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, to which private banks and the Bank of Spain
contribute in equal proportions, is to sink Pta285bn into Banesto under the
plan. It will also contribute Pta30bn in the form of a five-year
interest-free loan to offset current losses.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund will also, in the first instance, subscribe to a
Pta180bn capital increase, making up 73 per cent of Banesto's restructured
capital.
Other banks will have four weeks to put bids together, either individually
or in consortia, for this entire holding. Among the conditions is that the
winner will then offer a 13 per cent slice at the new par value of Pta400 to
existing shareholders, on the basis of one share for two held.
The bid process is intended to bring a profit for the Deposit Guarantee
Fund, reducing its costs in the Banesto rescue. Mr Jose Lus Leal, chairman
of the Spanish Private Banking Association said yesterday the rescue plan
would cost the banks Pta44bn a year for the next four years, or between 7
and 8 per cent of combined pre-tax profit.
He added emphatically: 'There is no other problem bank in Spain.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sandoz share split plan welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said its consolidated
net income jumped 14 per cent last year to SFr1.7bn (Dollars 1.2bn). It
attributed the rise to increases in drug sales volume, improved margins in
its chemicals and environment sector and higher financial income.
This news, plus the proposal by directors to split the shares five-for-one
and convert the participation certificates into registered shares, was well
received in the markets. The registered shares gained SFr20 to SFr3,970 and
the certificates put on SFr50 to SFr3,970.
Sandoz also announced that Mr Marc Moret, the chairman, would pass on the
function of chief executive to Mr Rolf Schweizer, the vice-chairman. It said
the move should not be read as a slight to Mr Daniel Wagniere, appointed
chief operating officer a year ago. It was designed to ensure a step-by-step
succession.
Group sales rose 5 per cent to SFr15.1bn and operating income was up 9 per
cent to SFr2.2bn. Sandoz said its operating margin in the life sciences
sector - comprising pharmaceuticals, nutrition products and seeds - advanced
from 16.6 per cent to 16.7 per cent in spite of the unfavourable business
climate.
Directors proposed a 23 per cent rise in dividends.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Paris unveils Credit Lyonnais
rescue deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government has unveiled details of its long-awaited rescue
package for Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-controlled bank. The plan
includes a FFr4.9bn (Dollars 857m) capital injection and the transfer of
FFr40bn of bad debts into a new company partly guaranteed by the state.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who last autumn was drafted in as chairman to
orchestrate Credit Lyonnais' restructuring and prepare it for privatisation,
said the package should enable the group to almost break even this year
after a devastating FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993.
The bank's problems stem from the aggressive strategy on loans and
international acquisitions pursued by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman from
1988 to 1993.
Mr Peyrelevade also announced plans for radical cost-cutting which will
involve shedding 10 per cent of the group's 38,449-strong French workforce
over the next three years, and 4 per cent of its 32,861 staff outside
France.
Credit Lyonnais will sell at least FFr20bn of assets by the end of next
year, and intends to raise additional capital through a share issue later
this year.
The scale of the rescue package and depth of Credit Lyonnais' 1993 losses
were worse than analysts' expectations. However, observers last night seemed
confident the FFr23.3bn deal would be sufficient to stabilise the bank's
finances.
Mr Sasha Serafimovski, European banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the
figures were 'much, much worse than anything we imagined'.
The state aid for Credit Lyonnais has to be vetted by the European
Commission in Brussels, where it was announced that Mr Pascal Lamy, chief of
staff to President Jacques Delors, would shortly be joining the bank.
Credit Commercial de France last year withstood the pressures on the French
banking sector to lift net profits 10.2 per cent, to FFr1.08bn from FFr978m
in 1992. The gain came in spite of losses at the recently-acquired Banque de
Savoie.
Mr Charles de Croisset, who last summer replaced Mr Michel Pebereau as
chairman when he left to head Banque Nationale de Paris, said he expected
the group to continue improving this year, and record its '11th consecutive
year of profits growth'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skanska and NCC, Sweden's top two construction and property groups, returned
to profit in 1993 after severe losses in 1992. But both companies continued
to be hit by the slump in the Swedish market, relying on lower write-downs
and income from divestments to see them back into the black.
Revenues were down for both groups, reflecting another tough year -
especially in Sweden, where the property and construction sectors have been
among the hardest hit by a three-year long recession.
Mr Jan Sjoqvist, president of NCC, said property prices and rent levels were
stabilising, although there were variations between geographical areas and
market segments. Infrastructure investment was also regaining momentum.
However, he warned: 'Investments in the construction sector will remain low
in 1994 and 1995, but should begin to show growth again in 1996.'
Skanska showed the biggest improvement in 1993, swinging to a profit after
financial items of SKr1.1bn (Dollars 149m) from a loss in 1992 of SKr3.98bn.
NCC reported a profit after financial items of SKr175m following a deficit
in 1992 of SKr1.63bn.
Skanska increased its dividend to SKr3.25 per share (SKr1.50), but NCC
suspended its dividend, as it did for 1992.

Credit Commercial de France last year withstood the pressures on the French
banking sector to lift net profits 10.2 per cent, to FFr1.08bn (Dollars
189m) from FFr978m in 1992. The gain came in spite of losses at the

Mr Charles de Croisset, who last summer replaced Mr Michel Pebereau as
chairman when he left to head Banque Nationale de Paris, said he expected
the group to continue improving this year, and record its '11th consecutive

The principal problem for CCF during 1993 was Banque de Savoie, the regional
banking group in which it has raised its stake from 24 per cent to 96 per
cent. The bank, which has been badly hit by the recession in its area of
southern France, saw net losses deepen to FFr110m from FFr29.4m.
Mr de Croisset said he planned a capital increase to refinance Banque de
Savoie.
Despite the difficulties, CCF mustered a 12.7 per cent increase in net
banking income, to FFr9.2bn last year from FFr8.2bn (restated).

Nestle, the world's largest foods and mineral waters group, has reported a
stronger-than-expected 7 per cent rise in 1993 net income, to SFr2.89bn
(Dollars 2bn).
It has also dampened recent speculation that the arrangements between it and
L'Oreal, the French cosmetics group, would change soon.
A 20-year contract, under which Nestle and Ms Liliane Bettencourt, daughter
of the L'Oreal founder, share ownership of the 51 per cent controlling stake
in the cosmetics group, expires tomorrow.
Nestle said yesterday the contract provided for the continuation of the
right of first refusal for both sides.
It said the gain in its trading profits last year was greatest in countries
outside of Europe and the Americas, giving support to the recent view in
investor circles that its commitment to developing countries is beginning to
pay off.
Total trading profits were up 8.9 per cent, to SFr6.14bn, with those in
North and South America advancing 5.9 per cent to SFr2.29bn. In Europe, they
gained 9.6 per cent, to SFr2.59bn, and in the rest of the world they jumped
13 per cent to SFr1.27bn.
Total sales advanced 5.5 per cent to SFr 57.5bn, in spite of a 1 per cent
decline in Europe to SFr26.37bn. Sales in North and South America were up
10.5 per cent, to SFr21.24bn, while those in the rest of the world increased
14.2 per cent to SFr9.89bn.
Nestle said cashflow improved 6.3 per cent, to SFr4.97bn. This helped the
group reduce its net debt at year-end to SFr8bn, compared with SFr9.9bn a
year earlier, following the SFr2.2bn Source Perrier acquisition. Net
financing costs last year jumped 15.2 per cent to SFr885m.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Executive upheaval lifts wages
bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sackings and resignations among the Volkswagen leadership contributed to a
sharp rise in the loss-making group's boardroom wages bill last year.
Payments to members of the management board rose by around 25 per cent,
while remuneration and pensions for former directors more than doubled,
according to the group's annual report, published yesterday.
Although there were only seven directors at the end of 1993, compared with
nine a year earlier, total boardroom remuneration rose to DM12.9m (Dollars
7.7bn) from DM10.2m.
Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director, said he was not able to explain the
increase.
However, a spokesman later attributed the difference to the overlap effects
of incoming and outgoing directors, which had markedly increased the number
of monthly salary payments last year.
He also noted that board members' pay had been cut 20 per cent this year,
following the recent introduction of a four-day working week for the German
workforce, accompanied by substantial pay cuts.
According to the report, the group's supervisory board appeared to have
taken its pay cuts last year, when its total remuneration fell from more
than DM1m to DM190,000. Mr Schmidt said the numbers were too small to
concern him.
Golden handshakes for three departing main board directors are understood to
have contributed to the jump, to DM16m, in payments to 'retiring' members,
which are covered from provisions for current pensions. These provisions
also rose, from DM78m to DM107m.
Last year was marked by a bout of boardroom turmoil following the arrival in
January of the new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech and his hiring of the
controversial Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General Motors' former
global purchasing chief, in March.
At the time, the company repeatedly denied reports of an excessive salary
for the newcomer.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: VW cautious despite reduced loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Volkswagen, Europe's leading volume carmaker, hopes to return to break-even
this year after a first-quarter loss of around DM400m (Dollars 238m),
compared with a DM1.25bn deficit in the same period of 1993.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, advocated caution in the light of last year's
'surprises', when his spring forecast of a break-even result became a crash
into a DM1.94bn loss.
Results at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse was blamed for
the 1993 earnings slump, would be the deciding factor, he said.
According to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, group production director,
the aim was for Seat to turn the corner in mid-1995.
The VW brand was likely to improve its earnings. The Audi quality car
division was budgeting to break even, as were the North American businesses.
However, Mr Piech forecast heavy losses at Seat and deficits in Latin
America. Skoda, the Czech subsidiary, would have a tough time to break even,
he warned.
Hinting at a brighter medium-term future, the chairman said the group had in
one year carried through 20 per cent of the cost-cutting measures so far
identified. The remaining potential for economies was 'the stuff of dreams'.
Manufacturing costs in Germany had been reduced by DM1,000 a car, he
claimed. Domestic factories had reached the point last year when they could
break even working at 79 per cent of capacity, compared with 102 per cent in
1992.
The level would fall to 74 per cent in the current year, and be reduced
progressively to 65 per cent, Mr Piech said.
Further job cuts this year - mostly outside Germany and concentrated in
Spain and Latin America - would cut the global workforce by 25,000 to some
226,000.
Group-wide productivity would be lifted by 25 per cent by the end of 1995,
he said. Meanwhile, the introduction of the four-day week in six German
factories making VW vehicles would reduce labour costs by DM1.6bm this year,
according to Mr Peter Hartz, personnel director.
Audi earlier this week announced a similar scheme involving a 10 per cent
cut in working hours and pay.
According to Mr Piech, VW was out-performing its competitors and the market,
helped by price-cuts. European orders for VW models had risen 11.8 per cent
in the first quarter, and German demand was up 54 per cent. Audi orders were
down 14 per cent.
Total group deliveries to customers were up 4.7 per cent at 838,000
vehicles.
According to a breakdown of last year's results, published yesterday, the VW
AG parent company earned a net DM71m - just enough to cover a DM2 dividend.
Seat lost DM1.84bn, while the North American businesses lost more than
DM460m.
Skoda results, affected by new company legislation, showed a loss after tax
of DM247m against net earnings of DM233m in 1992.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa net surges
107% to HKDollars 6bn

<TEXT>
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
yesterday marked an end to its troubled start to the decade with the
announcement of a 107 per cent surge in net profits, to HKDollars 6.3bn
(USDollars 546.4m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 3.05bn the previous year.
The profits were achieved against a HKDollars 1.4bn provisions bill related
to the write-off of the loss-making Rabbit CT2 telepoint business in the UK.
This was offset by the Dollars 1.6bn profit made on the sale to News
Corporation of its stake in Hutchvision, the programme supplier to Star TV.
Both items were taken above the line.
Taken on a per-share basis, earnings were up 86 per cent to HKDollars 1.79,
against 96 cents in 1992. Turnover improved a more modest 18 per cent to
HKDollars 24.7bn.
Earnings, which were broadly in line with market forecasts, were driven by
increased rental income as the group built up its portfolio of investment
properties in the colony's buoyant market. The group's container terminal
investments, and a positive contribution from the 49 per cent-owned Husky
Oil, also helped lift profits.
Mr Li, chairman, said the group's land holdings in Hong Kong were being
depleted through re-development. Progress was being made in the search for
suitable property development projects in China. Joint ventures in a range
of infrastructure and retail projects, including power plants, had already
been established.
Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), the group's container terminal
operator, handled a record through-put of 3.49m TEUs (20ft equivalent
units). During the latter part of the year, Hutchison lifted its
shareholding in HIT by 17 per cent to 77.5 per cent.
Mr Alex Ho, head of research at Jardine Fleming, reckoned property
development contributed around HKDollars 1.8bn to net profits, with more
than a further HKDollars 1bn coming from the container terminal operations.
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 49 cents which, together with
the interim of 19 cents, represents a 24 per cent increase onthe 1992
payment of 55 cents.

FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: South Africa seeks bank to
advise on bond market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Africa is seeking to appoint an international bank to advise the new
government's entry into the international bond market. Several banks have
been interviewed.
Mr Etienne Calitz, director-general of the department of finance, said
yesterday the multi-party Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which is in
charge of government policy leading up to next month's elections, had
compiled a shortlist of candidates. He declined to name the banks involved.
However, they are thought to include First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers.
The first task of the successful applicant will be to guide the new
government through the delicate process of obtaining a credit rating from
the two leading international rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp;
Poor's. Discussions with the agencies are expected to begin once the
elections are over.
South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating, as
this would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the
Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. An
investment-grade rating would also reduce South Africa's funding costs and
allow a broader range of investors to buy its bonds.
The adviser will be selected by the technical committee of the TEC's finance
sub-council, which has the responsibility of drawing up a foreign loan
finance strategy for the new government.
The first foreign debt issue of a new government will be an important test
of international confidence in South Africa's new administration, and of the
ANC's economic policy in particular, given its likely victory in the April
elections. Mr Calitz said a new issue would primarily have 'benchmark
value'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Monument rises 65% in spite of weakening
oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monument Oil and Gas, the independent exploration and production company,
raised pre-tax profits by 65 per cent last year despite the steady weakening
of the oil price.
The company earned Pounds 7.86m in the year ending December 31, up from
Pounds 4.79m the year before. The profit attributable to shareholders nearly
doubled from Pounds 4.12m (equivalent to earnings of 0.62p per share) to
Pounds 8.11m (1.22p). As in previous years, the directors are proposing to
reinvest profits rather than pay a dividend.
Monument said the result showed the benefit of its policy of realising the
value of mature properties, mainly in the North Sea, and replacing these
reserves with new, lower cost developments. A major factor in the improved
result was a reduction of the depletion charge from Pounds 16m to Pounds
10.1m as a result of the transition to lower cost fields.
The main challenge during the year was securing the Pounds 300m financing
for its major Liverpool Bay gas development, which received the go-ahead
after some concern that it might be stopped by the government to avoid
damaging the coal market.
Overall production in 1993 averaged 7,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
down from the previous year. But output should rise to 30,000 barrels by
mid-1996 when the Liverpool Bay, Johnston and Sierra Chata fields come fully
on stream. Monument said its policy of active asset management, exploration
and cost cutting placed it well for continued growth.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: APV falls to Pounds 13m but upbeat about
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries,
reported another drop in annual profits but was upbeat over the progress of
its extensive restructuring programme.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 13.4m in the year to
December 31. Sales from continuing operations rose by 3 per cent to Pounds
834m, although exchange rate changes inflated the figure by Pounds 70m.
Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said: 'Significant progress has been made
during 1993 in positioning the group for growth and a return to acceptable
levels of profitability.'
Despite the difficult economic environment, the chairman said APV was
achieving good orders in a number of its chosen markets and overall, the
order book was 10 per cent ahead of last year.
He added: 'Our trading and financial position is stronger and I feel more
confident about the group's prospects now than at any time in the past four
years.'
APV said it had responded to difficult conditions by continuing to
rationalise capacity, improve efficiency, divest non-core businesses and
focus on identified target markets.
Mr Clive Strowger, chief executive, said 10 plants had been closed or were
closing and the workforce had been reduced by 2,500 to below 10,000 since
1992, the year he was appointed.
Economic conditions in the US improved during the year and there were some
signs of recovery in the UK.
Recessionary conditions prevailed throughout continental Europe, although
Asian economies continued to grow strongly, apart from Japan.
APV expected no significant improvement in the economic environment in
continental Europe, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of the
group's orders and sales, during 1994.
Gearing fell from 31 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 0.9p (3p) but the final dividend is being held at
3.4p giving a maintained 5.4p total.
COMMENT
Analysts found the results a mixed bag, with further rationalisation costs
partly offset by an unexpected gain on an interest swap deal. However, the
management has taken a cautious line on accounting standards. Most interest
focused on the positive note struck concerning orders and future prospects,
given the scale of recent surgery on the sprawling portfolio which Mr
Strowger inherited. The scale of the cost-cutting should make APV highly
geared to any volume increase. Forecast profits of up to Pounds 25m put the
shares, down 7p at 121 1/2 p, on a prospective multiple of 25, which clearly
puts them in the recovery bracket. But few such stocks are underpinned by a
prospective yield of 5.4 per cent and can already point to a 10 per cent in
rise in orders - even although its main market is still flat on its back.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Raising a glass to prospects of growth - A
look at the logic of Allied-Lyons' Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro Domecq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, Allied-Lyons' proposed Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro
Domecq is a splendid proposition.
Allied becomes, on its own reckoning, the world's second biggest spirits
producer after Grand Metropolitan, overtaking Guinness. It gains some
powerful brands with which to attack the fast-growing South American market.
It also recruits some able managers, mostly members of the Domecq family,
who thoroughly understand the Hispanic world of drinks.
On closer inspection, the sceptic might ask just what Allied is getting for
its money.
The overwhelming bulk of Domecq's profits - 97 per cent - come from two
countries, Mexico and Spain. Allied's products in those countries are
already distributed by Domecq. Domecq's own brands mostly have limited
appeal outside those two countries, so there is little scope for Allied to
push them through its own distribution system.
And Allied already has a blocking vote in the shape of a 32 per cent holding
in Domecq.
Outright control of the business, Allied argues, means a great deal. This is
a little at odds, however, with the praise it lavished on Domecq's
management yesterday, and the fact that the same management will remain in
place.
So what does Allied think it is getting? The answer, above all, is the
prospect of growth.
'The logic of this is not about bringing together two big companies to take
out a lot of cost,' Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive said yesterday.
'It's getting faster growth in fast-growing parts of the world.'
Mr Michael Jackaman, Allied chairman, develops the point. Take Mexico, for
instance, which contributes half of Domecq's trading profits, and where
Domecq has more than 40 per cent of the spirits market and an 80 per cent
share in brandy. 'The fact is that the Mexican business has to develop and
change', he said. 'It probably has to change its focus from the domestic
brandy business to imported products. That's a 10 or 15 year job, and it
will be much easier to do when you call the shots than when you have to
persuade your partners.'
Equally, he added, there were a number of markets, especially in Europe,
where Domecq still has its own distributors. In most of them Allied will
take over the distribution.
In the really long run, Mr Jackaman was hopeful that Domecq's brandies could
be sold in that fabulous goal of all consumer marketers, China. 'Long term,
that's going to be a strong cognac market,' he said. 'Spanish and Mexican
brandies are good-tasting products, and I don't see any reason why there
shouldn't be some space for them ultimately and we have a sales and
distribution operation in China already.'
Mr Hale was more pragmatic. 'The biggest opportunity', he said, 'is for us
to sell more Scotch through their network, and more tequila through ours.'
As part of the deal, Allied will buy control of Tequila Sauza, the second
biggest-selling tequila in the world, with 35 per cent of the Mexican
market.
For Mr Jackaman, the deal has a further attraction: cash. Domecq was a very
strong cash producer, he said. In the past, as a minority shareholder,
Allied had profits but not cash. 'Profit is all very well, but it's cash
that pays the bills.'
This was slightly at odds with a point made yesterday by Mr Ramon
Mora-Figueroa, Domecq's chief executive. Explaining the Domecq family's
motive in selling, he said: 'When you have 500 members of the family who
have seen Domecq grow so rapidly, especially over the past six years, while
(the Domecq-Allied partnership) has been more interested in growth than in
paying big dividends, some of them wanted to realise the value of their
shares.'
In other words, it sounds as if Domecq has been absorbing cash to grow,
rather than throwing cash off. Mr Jackaman disputed this, saying the family
had been brought up to expect 'really sexy' dividends, far more than an
institutional shareholder would require.
Nor did he accept that the family's desire to sell obliged Allied to buy.
'This is something I've been hoping for for a long time. It was just a
question of when the shareholders got restive.'
Meanwhile, the deal carries Allied further in its stated policy of
concentrating on drinks and retailing, which includes pubs, Baskin-Robbins
ice cream and Dunkin' Donuts. By implication, this leaves two unwanted
divisions: food manufacture, and the Carlsberg Tetley joint venture in
brewing.
Yesterday, Mr Jackaman said Allied was not engaged in any active talks about
selling its food interests. On brewing, he was non-committal. Allied was
happy with the current arrangement, despite the tough times facing UK
brewers. Then again, he said: 'We are not natural developers of a worldwide
beer business as Carlsberg is.'
The deal also confirms Britain's remarkable dominance of the world drinks
industry. Allied is now lodged at the top of the tree with two other British
groups, Guinness and GrandMet. The only other company in the same league is
Seagram of Canada.
Perhaps, in the end, this is as persuasive an argument as any for the deal:
that if the British have found something they are good at, they should make
the most of it.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison forecasts upgraded after 17%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Morrison's shares rose 3p to 120p in a falling market yesterday as
the market moved to upgrade forecasts for the Northern supermarket chain, on
the back of stronger than expected results.
The group announced a 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
97.8m, against a market consensus of about Pounds 90m. Sales also rose by 17
per cent to Pounds 1.54bn for the year to January 30.
The City revised 1995 forecasts from about Pounds 100m to between Pounds
105m and Pounds 110m.
The better than expected performance was based on a strong margin recovery
in the second half and contributions from new stores. Excluding new stores,
like for like sales were 3.5 per cent higher.
Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said sales had increased above
expectations partly due to the decision to abandon opposition to Sunday
trading.
'If there are five major groups opening on a Sunday and one doesn't, he will
suffer,' Mr Ackroyd said. He had not changed his mind about the essential
lack of benefits in Sunday opening, however. 'I do not think we have earned
anything. We have just recovered the losses.'
Margins benefited from passing on price pressures to suppliers. The decline
experienced in the 12 months between July 1992 and July 1993 - when Morrison
sought to woo back customers tempted by discounters - had more than been
recovered by the second half, he said.
Mr Ackroyd warned, however, that there was cause for caution. 'The current
year will no doubt continue to be extremely tough,' he said. 'If it becomes
an all-out price war, then we will join the skirmishes with everyone else.'
Morrison racked up capital expenditure of Pounds 120m in 1993-94, including
the costs of opening eight stores. The group was currently trading from 67
stores and planned to have 72 by the end of the year. Capital expenditure of
about Pounds 170m was budgeted in 1994-95.
Gearing is expected to increase to about 25 per cent this year, against 13
per cent previously.
The dividend was increased from 0.64p to 0.8p, for a total 25 per cent
higher at 1p (0.8p). Fully diluted earnings were ahead 11 per cent at 8.05p
(7.23p).
COMMENT
William Morrison has recaptured its shine with these results after the
interim disappointment. It has managed to get its payroll costs under
control in the second half and begun to squeeze suppliers. However, this
does not go all the way towards explaining the dramatic improvement in gross
margins of 1 per cent, with promises of more to come. This is a well managed
and traditionally conservative company, so such questions may be dismissed
by some as nit-picking. The shares, on a prospective p/e of 12.7 times, are
trading at a 15 per cent discount to the market and look cheap for the
moment.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Takeover of a famous and independent family
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The words 'British sherry' are anathema to the proud businesses of Jerez de
la Frontera - the name of an inferior product they do not even recognise as
wine. How poignant it is, then, that the most famous of all sherry names
should become a British company through takeover by Allied-Lyons.
Domecq is a resonant name in Spain, associated not only with wine and
spirits but equally with bulls, jet-setting, conservatism and a
many-tentacled family.
Although many of the best-known sherry businesses have British - or in
Domecq's case French - names, they have a strong tradition as independent
Spanish family concerns. But in the last few years foreign multinationals
have broken into this preserve, the absorption of the Pedro Domecq group
being only the latest in the series.
Grand Metropolitan, through International Distillers and Vintners, has the
Croft sherry and port concern and an important stake in Gonzalez-Byass.
Sandeman, also combining sherry and port, is controlled by Seagram, and the
Williams and Humbert bodega in Jerez by Bols of the Netherlands.
Allied-Lyons already has Harveys in its stable as well as its interest in
Domecq.
Independent companies such as Osborne, among the sherry houses, and the
Larios spirits group are now the exception.
Rapid change of this kind goes against the grain in the sherry
establishment, but it is accepted with resignation as companies face the
need to diversify. Domecq, with its core business as a brandy producer
facing declining consumption, has already diversified with the acquisition
of new spirits brands, which have helped it to boost profits.
It also became a multinational in its own right, especially through its
strong presence in Mexico.
However, it faced another problem of its own - long-standing discord among
different branches of the family over the company's future. Because of its
many ramifications nobody appears to be able to determine exactly how much
of the company is still owned by the Domecqs. Names are misleading. For
instance, Mr Ramon Mora-Figeroa, chief executive, is a Domecq through his
mother.
Mr Mora-Figueroa was instrumental in establishing the first links with
Allied-Lyons in the 1970s. In 1982 a bid was fought off from Rumasa, the
holding company headed by Mr Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos, who had built an empire
from a small-time sherry business which was later expropriated by the
Spanish government.
Lehman Brothers has been working towards a deal on behalf of shareholders,
including members of the Domecq and Benjumea families, for more than a year.
Last July the company sought an evaluation from Goldman Sachs, which then
worked with Allied-Lyons' advisers, Barings, to formulate an agreement.
Family pride has not been discarded, though. The Spanish company's board was
insistent yesterday that the deal would leave intact 'the structure and
personality, the style and tradition' that had been behind its success so
far.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Booker at Pounds 87m and debt cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first fruits of the new management regime at Booker, the food group,
were shown in a 1993 rise in profits from Pounds 67.9m to Pounds 86.9m. The
figures were struck after losses on disposals of Pounds 2.8m, against Pounds
2.5m.
Underlying earnings per share rose by 16.8 per cent to 28.5p, covering a
maintained total dividend of 21.75p by 1.3 times.
Mr Charles Bowen, the chief executive who joined the group last summer, said
the group had begun to meet its three prime objectives of generating more
cash, increasing the focus of the group, and improving head office control
of the business.
Investors were surprised by the reduction in net debt the group had
achieved, with borrowings down from Pounds 155m to Pounds 125.7m, cutting
gearing from 95 to 71 per cent. The shares rose 18p to 429p, against the
market trend.
Mr Bowen said further sales of small, non-core activities could be expected
this year, with some likely soon. Booker would concentrate on three areas,
food distribution, processed food and fish, and agriculture.
He said after cutting debt by Pounds 29.3m in 1993, there were aggressive
targets to cut working capital further in 1994. Capital expenditure would
not be cut, indeed investment hurdle rates had been reduced from 25 to 15
per cent.
Group sales were 3.7 per cent up at Pounds 3.57bn, and operating profits
rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds 103m. Profits from continuing operations were
10.4 per cent up at 100.2m. Interest took Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 20.6m).
Food distribution profits rose 13.7 per cent to Pounds 48.1m despite flat
sales in the UK. Costs were cut and there was strong growth in Portugal.
Profits from the food service division, which suffered severe problems at
Booker Fitch in 1992, recovered to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 9.6m).
Fish processing profits were flat at Pounds 8.4m, while prepared foods
profits fell from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 13m as margins were squeezed by
supermarkets.
Changes in demand patterns for chicken meat hit profits from US
agribusiness, down from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 6.8m. But in the UK a
recovery in salmon farming and the devaluation of the green pound lifted
profits from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 9.3m.
COMMENT
Mr Bowen appears to be working wonders already at Booker, if only by giving
investors pleasant rather than nasty surprises. These figures showed a new
clarity and also demonstrated how getting basic things right could transform
cash flow. That said, the trading environment is still poor and profits are
unlikely to rise much this year, perhaps to about Pounds 92m pre-tax.
However, the quality of earnings is improving more rapidly than the
quantity, and though the prospective p/e of around 15 is not particularly
attractive, a yield of 6.3 per cent - which looks increasingly secure - is
and the shares should rise with Booker's credibility.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: The end of life with the Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons' proposal to change its title to Allied-Domecq will mean the
loss of a name that has played a significant part in British social history.
Lyons Corner House tea shops and restaurants were common meeting places from
the turn of the century until the 1950s when they began to be supplanted by
fast-food outlets.
The first Corner House opened in London's Coventry Street, between
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square in 1909; a second opened in the
Strand in 1915; a third at the junction of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court
Road in 1928; and the fourth, at Marble Arch, was completed in 1933,
enabling J Lyons to boast that 'the four Corners of London' were serving 50m
customers a year.
Most of the tea shops, including the Corner Houses, had disappeared by the
time Allied Breweries bought J Lyons - formed as a public company in 1894 -
for Pounds 60m in 1978.
One of the last tea shops, in the Strand, closed in 1981, although there was
later a short-lived attempt to resurrect it as a Corner House.
Lyons, the second largest tea company in the world, is also the proud
inventor of the round tea bag, which has helped to give its Tetley brand a
leading position in the UK, Ireland and Canada. Other produce bearing the
Lyons name includes biscuits and ice-cream.
The Lyons name was also attached to one of the oldest and best-known British
coffee brands. However, Allied-Lyons sold its coffee interests in February:
instant coffee went to Kraft Jacobs Suchard, while real coffee went to
Paulig, the Finnish food group.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;O ferries weather the storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ferries business put
in a strong performance in the second half, and Lord Sterling, chairman,
said bookings were 30 per cent higher than a year ago.
The ferry operations, separated for the first time in the group's accounts,
made profits of Pounds 81.7m for the year to December 31, up from Pounds
72.9m. The Channel Tunnel will undoubtedly affect revenue, but its late
opening should at least secure flat 1994 earnings.
Lord Sterling said excess capacity on the cross-Channel business could be
moved to profitable European routes.
COMMENT
The market was pleased with the group's results and the evidence that
dividends will finally be covered by recurrent earnings in 1994. Brokers
have upgraded forecasts, but assuming Pounds 320m profits in 1994, the
shares are on a p/e of 18.5 and a defensive yield of 4.4 per cent, assuming
no increase in dividend. P&amp;O has weathered the recession without jettisoning
capacity, and now offers exceptional operational gearing, particularly on
the container shipping side. The Channel Tunnel may haunt senti-ment, but
recent investment sales hinted at P&amp;O's underlying asset value and earnings
are on a strong cyclical upswing, even without expected property sales. The
shares look attractive, even after yesterday's 4 per cent rise.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest jumps 32% to Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbeycrest, the designer and manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits 32 per cent ahead to Pounds 1.78m for
the year ended December 31 on turnover which rose by 17 per cent to Pounds
51.9m.
At this level the profit is still way below the record of Pounds 6.8m
achieved in 1989.
The shares closed at 109p, down 6p.
Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said that progress was encouraging during the
year and despite flat conditions the group had increased its market share,
with maintained operating margins.
He added that he was cautious about projecting current levels of business
forward, but reported that turnover and order books were ahead of 1993 and
that he expected further progress in the current year.
The chairman said that sales to the catalogue shops and home shopping sector
increased significantly. The group now exports to 20 countries, and turnover
in overseas markets grew to Pounds 5.1m.
Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent from 3.8p to 5.2p while the dividend
is maintained at 3.2p with a final of 2p.
Year end gearing went up from 7 per cent to 40 per cent. This reflected
higher levels of activity in November and December and increased projections
for the early part of 1994.
The group's year end is to be changed to February and the next accounting
period will be for 14 months.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dowding doubles to Pounds 3.34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, nearly
doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 3.34m in the six months
to December 31.
Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said the improved first-half results were
mainly because of increased productivity and cost control rather than an
overall increase in activity. Sales rose from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 45m.
Earnings per share increased to 1.37p (0.61p). The interim dividend
increased to 0.94p (0.92p).
The group said that trading at the start of the second half had continued at
a similar level to the first, and if this trend continued then profits for
the full year would be ahead of last year's Pounds 5.04m.
Mr Hollings said: 'The decline in activity in the UK over each of the last
three years has finally ceased and production has levelled out, whilst
elsewhere in Europe business remains difficult with no signs of immediate
improvement.'
He added that the level of activity in American operations continued to be
satisfactory.
Following a reduction last year, expenditure on plant and equipment had
increased to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 655,000), while gearing was maintained at
19.2 per cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Further expansion in US for Williams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced its
second US acquisition in three months with the Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m)
purchase of Forney International, a provider of burner management systems
for power stations.
Williams is paying Dollars 41m in cash for Texas-based Forney, and is taking
on debt of Dollars 9m. Forney's net assets after completion are estimated at
Dollars 12m.
Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams chairman, said the acquisition would reinforce the
group's presence in the rapidly-growing third world market. 'It is a real
growth business,' Mr Rudd said.
The acquisition was expected to be neither earnings dilutive, nor to be
significantly enhancing in the current year.
Analysts said the purchase was slightly pricey, but made strategic sense. It
follows hard on the heels of the acquisition of the Corbin &amp; Russwin locks
business in January for Dollars 80m. There was substantial scope to increase
margins, analysts said, which would bring substantial returns in 1995.
However, 'the problem is that it is doing damage to the balance sheet,' said
Mr Richard Rae, conglomerates analyst at Hoare Govett.
The broker estimates that after the goodwill write-off, Williams' gearing
will rise from 60 per cent to more than 70.
The group is forecast to generate cash of Pounds 35m this year, which leaves
year-end forecasts for gearing about 12 points higher than previously at 56
per cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ruberoid beats flotation forecast with
Pounds 7.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ruberoid, the roofing subsidiary spun off by Tarmac, yesterday marginally
beat the forecast made when it floated in November with pro forma pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7.1m for the year to December 31.
Mr Ian McPherson, chief executive, offered cautious encouragement to
Ruberoid's new shareholders by saying confidence appeared to be returning to
some sectors. The leisure and health markets, in particular, had begun to
show tentative signs of life.
Turnover was expected to rise this year, Mr McPherson said, although 'it
will be 1995 before there is a noticeable upturn in commercial and
industrial new build activity'.
Contracting orders were about 20 per cent ahead of last year, excluding the
effects of wet weather which hinders construction activity.
Mr McPherson said the group intended to focus this year on improving margins
through cost reductions and getting synergies from businesses previously run
as separate entities. So far, Ruberoid had made cost savings of about Pounds
10m year on year, and a further Pounds 1m was expected to be squeezed out
this year.
Ruberoid was created in November to hold businesses spun off by Tarmac. As a
result, the accounts cover only the trading period to December 31. These
showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 86,000 on sales of Pounds 42.85m.
On a pro forma basis, which assumes all the businesses had been trading
together for 12 months, profits were Pounds 100,000 ahead of expectations at
Pounds 7.1m, on sales of Pounds 232.6m.
Two of the three divisions showed operating profit increases. Cost
reductions helped the building materials business return operating profits
of Pounds 4.7m, against Pounds 2.5m last time. Sales were Pounds 400,000
ahead at Pounds 44.2m.
A rationalised building services reversed losses of Pounds 800,000 into
profits of Pounds 500,000. Sales fell from Pounds 117m to Pounds 84m.
The European division was hit by margin pressure in France and the
Netherlands. Profits fell from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.9m. Sales were Pounds
1.6m higher at Pounds 104.4m.
The dividend was 1.8p per share. Pro forma earnings were 10.6p. The group's
shares, issued at 150p, closed in a declining market yesterday 2p down at
193p.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: MJ Gleeson flat at Pounds 4.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ Gleeson Group, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property
concern, yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for the six
months to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.06m.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 80.2m), but operating profits
increased by 6.6 per cent to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 3.55m).
This improvement was partly offset by a decline in interest receipts to
Pounds 336,000 (Pounds 564,000) while interest costs fell from Pounds 48,000
to Pounds 22,000.
Earnings per share were very slightly lower at 27.06p (27.09p) partly
reflecting a marginally higher Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.35m) tax charge, and
the interim dividend is maintained at 3.35p.
Despite a small increase in UK contracting turnover, the directors said the
profits contribution from the construction operations was very modest and
added that, 'trading conditions in this sector seem likely to remain
difficult for some time.'
However, the group said the upturn in the housebuilding market, which became
apparent last year, has been sustained and the turnover of Gleeson Homes was
significantly higher during the latest period than a year earlier.
Provided that house buyers' confidence is not adversely affected by the
forthcoming increases in personal taxation or other factors, the directors
said they expected to sell a record number of homes this year.
As a result they were 'cautiously optimistic' that overall trading profits
for the year would be satisfactory.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mowlem to repair balance sheet - City
Airport losses coincided with problems in other activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Mowlem's problems with London City Airport emphasises the serious risks
undertaken by construction companies investing large sums in expensive high
profile privately financed infrastructure projects.
These can cause intense balance sheet problems for investors like Mowlem -
which owns 90 per cent of London City Airport - if traffic fails to live up
to expectations and they are faced with repaying large borrowings and
funding operational costs from reduced income.
Government, bankers and construction industry executives examining ways of
attracting more private money to pay for large scale roads and railway
investments such as the Channel tunnel rail link, might do well to heed
Mowlem's experience.
The company's adventure in east London would have caused serious problems
even if its main businesses of contracting and supply scaffolding and
construction equipment had not gone into recession.
A Pounds 33m provision imposed in 1992 to cover losses at the airport ran
out two years ago and last year the airport lost a further Pounds 4.8m. Sir
Philip Beck, chairman, is convinced the investment will eventually come
right. Passenger figures in the last few weeks, he says, have been close to
levels needed for break-even.
The airport estimates it needs 500,000 passengers a year to break even
compared with 245,000 last year, well below levels expected when it opened.
Mowlem has previously announced that it plans to sell the airport and says
the rights issue will enable it to achieve a better price without being
forced to make a 'distressed sale.'
Disposals during the past 18 months have raised about Pounds 100m. Even so
Mowlem's net debt at end-February was Pounds 76m and is heading for a peak
of about Pounds 100m this year compared with shareholders' funds, before the
rights, of Pounds 91m.
Its difficulties have been compounded by problems elsewhere in its business
as UK construction output has fallen. The scaffold and access equipment
contracting hire and sale companies, in hindsight, entered the recession
carrying too much excess fat.
This is evidenced by the surgery which Mr John Marshall, chief executive
designate, has carried out in the last 18 months, reducing the division's
workforce by more than a fifth and cutting overheads in the UK and
continental Europe by more than Pounds 20m.
The division made a Pounds 600,000 pre-tax loss last year but in better
times was capable of achieving pre-tax margins of 10 per cent on annual
sales of more than Pounds 300m. With costs under control it should be able
to achieve that again as construction markets improved, Mr Marshall said.
Capital expenditure, however, will need to increase. This has fallen from
Pounds 40m in 1990 (perhaps not the best time to have been spending large
sums with the UK construction industry in recession) to just Pounds 14m last
year.
Nonetheless, the group is starting to reap the benefit of previous cost
reductions. Profits at SGB Youngman, the UK hire and sale business, have
risen sharply recently.
UK building and civil engineering has generally been resilient, achieving
profits of Pounds 11.9m on a turnover of Pounds 703m last year - an
operating margin of 1.7 per cent, which compares favourably with other large
UK contractors.
The division's performance, however, has been soured by difficulties over a
couple of UK power station and chemical plant contracts as well as minor
problems in Germany and the US which means that after provisions the
division made a Pounds 4m trading loss.
Mr Marshall said a stronger balance sheet would make potential large
customers feel more comfortable and enable the company to tender for a wider
and more profitable range of work - particularly if it was not having to
incessantly chase cash - with the aim of restoring margins to at least 2 per
cent on a turnover of Pounds 1bn.
On this basis the group, with better management controls and properly
targeted capital expenditure should be capable of returning pre-tax profits
of Pounds 40m, said Mr Marshall. He did not expect this target to be
achieved, however, before 1996.
The extent to which some of Mowlem's wounds may have been self-inflicted may
be gauged by the sweeping senior management changes which have occurred both
at board and divisional level over the past 18 months.
The company had little choice but to refinance with a rights chosen as the
best solution after consultation with its institutional shareholders and
bankers. The institutional shareholders are supporting the group by
sub-underwriting the issue. Yesterday they seemed likely to get left with a
sizeable tranche of shares. Their hope must be that the bottom has now been
reached and things can only get better.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: John Laing climbs to Pounds 18.3m - Reduced
operating costs and housing provisions behind 58% jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at John Laing, the construction group, rose by 58 per cent
last year from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 18.3m, helped by a 9 per cent fall in
operating costs and reduced provisions in the group's UK and US housing
operations.
Group turnover fell by just Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.26bn, while earnings per
share by almost 60 per cent to 15p (9.4p). The group is paying a maintained
final dividend of 6p making a same-again total for the year of 9p.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said that construction profits in difficult
markets in the UK had fallen from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 9.9m on turnover
reduced from Pounds 1.08bn to Pounds 1.02bn, with the group 'declining to
chase work at the expense of profitability.'
Given low profits available on traditional UK contracts won in open tender -
construction profits last year represented just 1.8 per cent of turnover
(including interest earned on advance cash payments) - Laing intends to seek
a greater proportion of its work abroad.
This currently accounts for about ten per cent of the company's order book
of about Pounds 900m, but could rise to a fifth over the next few years.
The company also intends to increase its involvement in privately financed
infrastructure projects. The company has already indicated that it will
acquire small equity stakes and has made investments worth Pounds 27m at
Birmingham Airport (Pounds 5m); the Severn road bridge (Pounds 3.5m); a
hospital at Clydebank; two Spanish motorway companies (Pounds 2m) and
Malaysian power stations (Pounds 12.2m).
The company last year raised Pounds 38.9m through a placing and offer for
sale of convertible preference shares to help fund private infrastructure
initiatives. This has left the group with net cash of Pounds 45.8m at the
end of December compared with Pounds 7.2m at the end of 1992.
The UK housing division helped by an absence of provisions and with sales up
from 2,175 to 2,430 homes moved from a Pounds 900,000 loss in 1992 to a
Pounds 4.3m profit last year.
US housing losses, in spite of a further Pounds 2.7m provision, were reduced
from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.7m.
COMMENT
Laing is a class contractor carving out respectable margins where other
construction companies might struggle. Its performance during the recession
has been impressive. Its weakness is its housing operations which still hold
a high proportion of more expensive land acquired during the late 1980s.
Southern California, although improving, also, remains a difficult housing
market. With housebuilding leading the industry out of recession and UK
contracting margins likely to remain low, Laing's rating looks full on a
prospective p/e in the mid twenties on pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m this
year.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Disease provisions put Geest Pounds 3.8m in
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political uncertainty over bananas, coupled with disease on its Costa Rican
plantations, pushed Geest Pounds 3.8m into into the red for the year ended
January 1.
'Our problem is all about bananas,' said Mr David Sugden, chief executive of
the fresh produce and prepared food group, describing the year as 'a bit of
an aberration'.
The pre-tax loss, compared with profits of Pounds 3.1m, was struck on
turnover of Pounds 636m, against Pounds 658.9m, which included Pounds 53.1m
from discontinued operations.
Geest warned in January that it would incur an exceptional charge of Pounds
8.9m to cover the cost of an attack of fungal disease on its banana
plantations in Costa Rica. It also incurred an exceptional charge of Pounds
4.6m on restructuring its produce sector.
Profits before tax and exceptional items were Pounds 8.2m, down from Pounds
22.2m.
Mr Sugden said the group had suffered great difficulties with the transition
of the European banana regime. Latin American countries were yesterday in
Brussels for further negotiations on the dollar-banana quota. Geest remained
concerned that the regulations were still subject to political changes.
However, the first quarter this year had seen a substantial improvement in
the European banana market.
The food preparation division, which supplies chilled salads and other
products, reported operating profits of Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds
107.3m. Profits were similar to 1992 in spite of start-up losses of Pounds
1.2m from a new pasta facility. Mr Sugden expects the division's profits to
double next year.
Capital expenditure for the year totalled Pounds 39m, including Pounds 17.4m
on the food preparation division, which is expected to account for most of
the Pounds 20m to be spent this year.
Net debt rose from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 43.5m, giving gearing of 60 per
cent. This is expected to fall below 40 per cent this year.
Losses per share were 7.6p, (3.8p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.4p is
proposed, making a maintained total for the year of 8.1p.
COMMENT
In spite of the diversification into food preparation, the swing factor for
Geest remains bananas. The market has started well this year, but political
crosswinds could easily blow it off course again. While the world supply and
demand equation is improving, it is well to remember that only four years
ago profits were Pounds 20m when the group was importing bananas for the UK
alone. So the foray into Costa Rica could be seen as an expensive detour,
although Geest would argue that it now has 12 per cent of the European
market. Forecasts for this year range from Pounds 18m to as high as Pounds
25m, giving prospective multiples of 10 and 15 respectively. Those who view
it as a recovery stock should be prepared for a bumpy ride.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: W Hampshire Water rises to Pounds 1.58m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West Hampshire Water, owned by Biwater, the water engineering group,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.58m for the year to end-December,
against Pounds 1.29m.
The outcome was struck on turnover up from Pounds 8.83m to Pounds 9.57m and
the advance was achieved, the company said, in spite of the absorption of
increased compliance costs.
The net interest charge for the year fell from Pounds 780,000 to Pounds
580,000. Tax took Pounds 129,000 (Pounds 79,000) and earnings per share came
out at 182p (152p) fully diluted. A final dividend of 60p is proposed,
making 76p (36p) for the year.
The company said it intended to put a resolution to the AGM for a 1-for-1
scrip issue and would apply to the Stock Exchange to delist the share and
loan capital.

Caverdale Group, the motor retailing and industrial products group,
continued the recovery seen in the first half and achieved pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.5m for the year to December 31 compared with losses of Pounds
950,000.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 12.9m) with Pounds 22.2m from
acquisitions, and there were operating profits of Pounds 1.86m against
losses of Pounds 203,000.
The improvement in the motor retailing division was fuelled by an increase
in used car sales, the company said.
The industrial products division also continued to improve, the directors
added.
Earnings per share amounted to 1.02p (0.94p losses) and the company has
returned to the dividend list with a final of 0.15p.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Consumer credit side boosts Cattle's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from its consumer credit division enabled Cattle's
(Holdings) to achieve a 28 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to
Pounds 15.8m.
The Pounds 13.7m comparative figure was adjusted to take in a Pounds 1.4m
exceptional gain from the flotation of Rosebys, previously treated as
extraordinary.
The 1993 figure was in line with expectations, with profit struck on
turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 217m (Pounds 210m).
Consumer credit, the main contributor, made profits of Pounds 14.9m, a 21
per cent increase on 1992's Pounds 12.29m. The division's bad debt charges
remained unchanged despite a 3.5 per cent increase in its customer base.
The group's corporate finance operations, which include hire purchase and
asset leasing to businesses, turned round from a Pounds 1.1m deficit to a
Pounds 280,0000 profit following restructuring in 1992.
Outstanding balances on customer accounts were reduced from Pounds 42m two
years ago to Pounds 20m. Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, expected a further
improvement in the current year.
Insurance services, through the Swinton CIB franchise, made a profit of
Pounds 493,000 (Pounds 769,000) in an increasingly competitive market. It is
currently reviewing its market strategy.
Cattle's chains of video libraries and travel agencies, however, incurred
small losses.
Unless there is a marked recovery, these businesses will be wound down.
Net assets amounted to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 38.83m) at year-end, but the
company's 43 per cent stake in Rosebys, the textile retailing company, is
carrying a book value of Pounds 5.6m, against its current market value of
Pounds 16m.
Basic earnings per share emerged at 9.8p (7.8p, or 9p adjusted to include
the Pounds 1.4m exceptional gain) A recommend final dividend of 3.1p makes a
5p (4.2p) total.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps lift CIA to Pounds
4.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA Group, the UK's largest independent media buyer, announced pre-tax
profits up by 17 per cent from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 4.28m for the year to
December 31 1993, following a strong upturn in business during the second
half.
The group is recommending a 2-for-1 scrip issue 'in order to improve share
marketability'. CIA's share price has increased about fivefold since it came
to the market in 1989.
Yesterday the shares closed unchanged at 390p.
Turnover increased by 21 per cent from Pounds 235m to Pounds 285m, although
new business gains were down from Pounds 76m to Pounds 69m. The group said
there had been strong growth of business from existing clients and client
losses were lower than for many years.
Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said he expected growth of
between 5 and 6 per cent in clients' media budgets in 1994.
This year would see faltering recovery in the UK and continuing recession in
mainland Europe, he said.
The group expects to continue building its European network and increasing
the number of joint ventures during the year.
The fall in interest rates meant a drop in investment income - down from
Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 916,000.
Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent from 15.72p to 18.54p.
A proposed final dividend of 3.68p makes a total of 5.14p, also up 18 per
cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze leaps to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA REA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manganese Bronze Holdings, the maker of black London taxi cabs, returned
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.27m, more than double last time's Pounds
577,000, helped by a reduction in interest charges from Pounds 223,000 to
Pounds 35,000.
Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said: 'Our businesses have maintained a
good stream of profits throughout the recession and we are feeling positive
that things will get even better over the next half year.'
In the six months to January 31, overall turnover was down by 3 per cent
from Pounds 37.8m to Pounds 36.6m. Operating profit was up by 63 per cent to
Pounds 1.31m.
Steep competition and weak markets continued to mean disappointing results
for the components division, LTI Homer, the fuel tank business, and Fairway
Nissan, the car dealership.
However, this was offset by a strong performance from the vehicles division
which continued to produce 36 taxis a week. Pre-tax profits here were Pounds
1.34m (Pounds 30,000) on turnover of Pounds 25m (Pounds 22.3m).
It was a poor half year for the precision castings business due to
unexpected cuts in demand; also a significant fall in the price of cobalt
was partly responsible for a reduced turnover from the metal powders
business.
Mr Borwick said that more than Pounds 2m would be invested in the Ipswich
plant, which manufactures sintered automotive components.
An interim dividend of 1.5p (0.5p) was declared, payable from earnings per
share of 5.01p (2.19p).

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Campbell &amp; Armstrong cuts loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, reported losses
before tax of Pounds 294,000 for the nine months to end-December, a
significant improvement on the Pounds 3.94m deficit for 1992-93.
The company has changed its financial year end from March to December to
balance the seasonal influences of activities over the two halves.
Comparisons, therefore, are for the 12 months to March 31.
Turnover for the nine months amounted to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 50.6m).
Losses per share came out at 1.7p (24.6p). No dividend is proposed, although
the directors said they intended to seek the necessary approvals to
eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account by a reduction of the
share premium account.
The company last paid a dividend in 1992, when the distribution totalled 2p.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower palm oil prices hit plantation
results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower palm oil prices, offset by higher investment income were factors in
the annual results of two plantation companies in which Rowe Evans
Investment has substantial holdings.
Beradin Holdings reported marginally higher pre-tax profits of Pounds
485,000 (Pounds 476,000) for the year to December 31 on turnover of Pounds
931,000 (Pounds 1.02m). It said that the palm oil price was an average 10
per cent lower, but it had received increased dividends from other
plantation companies of Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 66,000).
Earnings per share, helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 186,000 (Pounds
226,000) were 2.01p (1.69p) and it is proposed to increase the single final
payment to 1.2p (1.1p).
Padang Senang Holdings showed profits down from Pounds 183,000 to Pounds
161,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 597,000). It said palm
oil prices had fallen 12 per cent while rubber prices continued at a low
level. Investment income was doubled at Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 42,000).
Earnings per share helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 59,000 (Pounds
90,000) were 2.05p (1.88p) and the proposed single final payment is
unchanged at 1.2p.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expanded Malaya cuts losses to Pounds
378,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaya Group, the fast expanding USM-quoted motor retailer, reported a
reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 378,000 for 1993, down from Pounds 982,000.
During the first full year of a planned expansion in the London and the home
counties, the group grew from two franchises at the start of 1993 to 10 by
the end of the year, with eight new and used car outlets. The group has also
been appointed the concessionaire for Bugatti in the UK.
The board said the restructuring and development, initiated by its new
management in the latter part of 1992, 'progressed wholly in line' with its
expectations.
Reflecting the expansion, turnover increased sharply to Pounds 49.7m (Pounds
8.35m), including Pounds 38.5m from acquisitions. At the operating level
losses fell from Pounds 692,000 to Pounds 331,000.
The reduced pre-tax loss was struck after a Pounds 43,000 profit on a
property disposal and reduced net interest costs of Pounds 90,000 (Pounds
290,000).
Losses per share were cut to 0.54p (4.93p).
In view of the loss, which the company said was in line with expectations,
no dividend is recommended.
In June Malaya raised Pounds 9.7m net of expenses through a placing and open
offer. The group said the remaining planned acquisitions in London and the
home counties would be funded from existing resources. It added that it had
experienced improved trading conditions since the start of 1994 and 'looks
forward to a return to profitable trading.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: National Grid in Indian link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Grid, operator of the England and Wales power transmission system,
is in talks with Power Grid of India to set up a joint venture to undertake
transmission projects in the sub-continent.
A deal is thought to be close for a venture which would build, operate and
maintain systems. National Grid, which is owned by the 12 regional
electricity companies in England and Wales, is believed to be considering an
investment of up to Pounds 25m.
The Indian venture would be the second significant equity deal overseas. The
first was in Argentina.
Last year National Grid said it planned to invest Pounds 370m overseas over
the next five years.
The expansion abroad reflects the limited opportunities UK electrictiy
comapneis have in the relatively mature UK power market.
Power Grid is examining several projects in India which will require
significant investment including the linking of separate zones of the
country.
National Grid could not confirm yesterday the details of its negotiations.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs leave Bridon Pounds 23m
in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridon, the Doncaster-based wire rope and engineering products manufacturer
which announced a substantial restructuring last month, yesterday reported a
Pounds 22.7m pre-tax loss for 1993 after Pounds 22.4m of exceptional
charges.
The expected deficit, which compares with a previous profit of Pounds 1.2m
after a Pounds 1.1m of exceptionals came on flat turnover of Pounds 315.7m.
Losses per share of 39.9p compare with earnings of 1.9p the previous year.
However, reflecting the board's increasing confidence in the future, the
final dividend is maintained at 2.75p making an unchanged 4p total. Bridon's
shares closed down 3p at 148p.
Commenting on the results Mr Brian Clayton, chairman, said 1993 saw a
continuation of recessionary pressures in many of Bridon's markets. Demand
in the UK stabilised but conditions deteriorated in continental Europe -
particularly Germany and Italy.
The group's wire and wire rope manufacturing operations had to contend with
increases in raw material costs in the second half, while market conditions
prevented the full recovery of these higher costs.
Group operating profits before exceptional items fell to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds
7.6m). Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive who joined the group in
September, said higher raw material prices in the second half reduced
operating profits by around Pounds 400,000 in the UK and by about Dollars 1m
(Pounds 600,000) in the US.
The bulk of the exceptional charges - which will cover the costs of a new
strategy aimed at improving the group's market focus and manufacturing cost
base - relates to the planned restructuring of the wire and wire rope
operations.
Last year these activities recorded reduced operating profits of Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 4m) before Pounds 16m (Pounds 1m) of exceptional costs, on sales of
Pounds 216.1m (Pounds 210.7m.)
In contrast, operating profits improved slightly in the fibre products and
industrial textiles operations, but engineering profits slipped to Pounds
800,000 (Pounds 1.9m) before exceptional costs of Pounds 6.1m (Pounds
100,000) on flat sales of Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 45.6m.)
The 1993 pre-tax deficit also took account of a Pounds 2.6m loss on the sale
and termination of operations and reduced net interest costs of Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 4.2m).
COMMENT
Bridon faces fierce competition from east Asia in its core wire and wire
rope business and its strategy for the future - code named Project 360 -
which was also unveilled yesterday, is in essence a survival plan.
Implementation will take time and will probably involve further disposals.
In the meantime, the group is fortunate in having a strong balance sheet. No
benefits are expected before 1995 at the earliest, so results are
particularly difficult to predict. For the moment the 3.3 per cent dividend
yield is supporting the share price.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: United Newspapers rises 25% - All-round
growth and Pounds 19.6m exceptional gains behind advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express, yesterday reported a
25.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 109.9m to Pounds 137.7m,
with all divisions contributing despite difficult trading conditions.
The outcome was flattered by exceptional gains of Pounds 19.6m mostly the
sale of Extel Financial to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, against
gains of Pounds 10.4m a year earlier. Before exceptionals, pre-tax profits
rose by 18.7 per cent to Pounds 118m in the year to December 31.
Lord Stevens, the chairman of the group, whose interests range from regional
newspapers and business magazines to exhibitions, warned that the pace of
economic recovery in the UK and the US 'is not consistent.' United expected,
however, its 'recent major investments to perform well.'
Turnover for the year rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 908.4m and earnings per
share rose 15 per cent to 44.9p a share, or before exceptionals by 8 per
cent to 35.6p. A final dividend of 14.5p is proposed for a total of 22p
(21.5p).
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson said
yesterday: ' This is quite a good set of results and for all the right
reasons.' There had been improvements across the group and the second half
recovery was being sustained in the first half of the current year.
United said that particularly strong results had been achieved in the US by
its advertising periodicals and the PR newswire. The US contributed
operating profits of Pounds 44.9m on turnover of Pounds 243.6m.
The group's UK national newspapers increased operating profits by 2 per cent
to Pounds 33.7m on turnover of Pounds 300.4m although 'turbulent market
conditions', price reductions by competing titles and extra spending on new
supplements held back profits. The UK and Europe contributed operating
profits of Pounds 85.5m on Pounds 664.9m.
The sale of Extel Financial for Pounds 73.5m and the Pounds 190m rights
issue left the group with net cash of Pounds 4.5m at year end compared with
net debt Pounds 308.6m at the start of last year. This year, however, net
debt has risen to Pounds 100m because of the acquisition of Harmon Homes and
the Hong Kong International Trade Fair.
COMMENT
United makes little fuss and avoids headline catching stories such as the
battle for the future of The Independent or big takeovers. It has, however,
got on with quietly managing its businesses with solid results across a wide
front. With so many of its businesses sensitive to advertising, it should be
poised to take advantage of cyclical recovery. In meetings with City
analysts yesterday the atmosphere was a little less cautious than in the
formal statements. Pre-tax profits should rise to about Pounds 140m this
year for a prospective p/e ratio of 16, a moderate rating for such a broadly
based publisher.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water, the privatised UK utility, yesterday stepped up its presence
in the US, with the Dollars 27m (Pounds 18.4m) cash purchase of a
California-based membrane technology company.
Fluid Systems, sold by US conglomerate Allied Signal, will have net assets
of Dollars 6m after completion. It is Anglian's second purchase in the US.
It follows last year's acquisition of a small Massachusetts-based company
through the purchase of Nordic Water, the Swedish process engineering group.
Mr Andy Nield, finance director of Anglian Water Process engineering, said
the group had sought access to the technology in the UK, but this had proved
difficult.
The process, which uses a cloth membrane to separate impurities from water,
was more advanced and in greater demand in the US, he said. 'We see the
technology will be increasingly important in the future,' he said.
Anglian intended to expand Fluid Systems' client base through its operations
in Scandinavia, France, Germany and Australia.
Fluid Systems last year made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 2.3m on sales of
Dollars 18.6m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chez Gerard, the London restaurant group, finalised its flotation yesterday,
pricing the shares at 112.5p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds
21m.
After the flotation there will be 18.67m shares in issue of which 70 per
cent are being placed with institutions. It will raise Pounds 4m of new
money, of which Pounds 1m will be used to clear the company overdraft,
leaving Pounds 3m for further acquisitions.
The company forecasts in the prospectus a 69 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 1.62m for the year ending June 26.
Groupe Chez Gerard owns Bertorelli's in Covent Garden, Cafe Fish off
Haymarket, Soho Soho in Frith Street and three Chez Gerard restaurants. It
also operates and has a 25.5 per cent stake in Chutney Mary in Chelsea.
Mr Neville Abraham, chairman and chief executive, said the company would be
investing up to Pounds 5m in further restaurants over the next two to three
years. For the foreseeable future they would be sited in central London.
'That's our patch, and we have demonstrated our success.'
Mr Abraham and Mr Laurence Isaacson, deputy chairman, entered the restaurant
business in 1980, converting a banana warehouse next door to the Royal Opera
House into Cafe des Amis du Vin, which they sold in 1984 for Pounds 2.2m.
The two men and their management team will retain 30 per cent of the
enlarged share capital.

In its first set of preliminary results since obtaining a full listing in
May 1993, Bruntcliffe Aggregates returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 835,000.
Turnover totalled Pounds 4.77m and basic earnings per share emerged at 2.2p.
A single dividend of 0.5p is proposed.
All turnover and profits relate to continuing operations from acquisitions
during the year.
With order books remaining buoyant the directors looked for a satisfactory
year ahead.
They said acquisitions would be the primary engine for growth but that they
would only consider opportunities that were cash generative, profitable and

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Maunders rises on more normal trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to more normal trading conditions enabled John Maunders Group, the
Manchester-based housebuilder, to report pre-tax profits for the six months
to December 31 more than doubled at Pounds 3.03m, against a restated Pounds
1.4m.
Mr John Maunders, chairman, said that the result had also been helped by
management changes and the implementation of tighter cost controls.
Turnover rose to Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 23.9m) with completions rising to 489
units (363) at an average selling price of Pounds 68,500 (Pounds 65,900).
Operating margins improved to 10.25 per cent, compared with 8.54 per cent in
the second half of the previous year.
The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest charges of Pounds 406,000
(Pounds 834,000) and gearing at the period end was 34 per cent.
Earnings per share came out at 8.18p (3.79p) and the interim dividend is
being raised to 2.45p (2.3p).

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ayrshire Metal surges to Pounds 1.35m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ayrshire Metal Products jumped 17p to 95p yesterday after the
producer of cold rolled steel profiles maintained its first half progress
with a surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds 209,000 to Pounds 1.35m in the
year to end-December.
After a two year absence, the dividend has been restored with a final
payment of 1.5p.
The company attributed the sharp recovery to the impact of cost reductions
implemented over the past three years, together with small improvements in
trading conditions.
Cost cutting had continued in areas where there had been no sign of improved
trading conditions - this resulted in further redundancy costs of Pounds
133,000 being incurred.
Turnover on continuing operations grew from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 32.8m in
the year. Earnings per share came to 8.3p (2.1p).

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Era Pounds 0.83m in loss and seeks Pounds
5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Era Group, the specialist retailing and distribution group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 5.2m cash call and a scrip issue in lieu of preference
dividends, after reporting a Pounds 1m reversal into a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 826,000 for 1993.
Mr Anthony Fay, chairman, blamed the loss - which was after a Pounds 280,000
provision for reorganisation and closure costs - on a continuing lack of
consumer confidence, an erosion of gross margins and increases in occupancy
costs.
The 1-for-1 rights issue of 63.12m new ordinary shares is at 9p per share.
Convertible preference holders can participate on the same terms as ordinary
holders, on the basis of two new ordinary for every three preference shares.
In addition, the entitlements of convertible preference holders to accrued
and certain future preference dividends, amounting to Pounds 1.05m, will be
cancelled and replaced by the issue of 5.27m scrip shares with a value at
the rights price of Pounds 474,475.
Turnover in 1993 was marginally higher at Pounds 74.3m (Pounds 73.3m). The
group - whose retail operations include Beatties, Tecno and Fox Talbot - did
not open any new shops in 1993.
Losses per share increased from 0.46 to 1.31p and again no dividend is being
paid for the period.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slimline Baird improves to Pounds 19.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Baird, the textile group, reported virtually static operating
profits of Pounds 24.7m for the year to end December.
At the pre-tax level they rose from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 19.6m, reflecting
lower interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.3m) and a smaller
exceptional charge of Pounds 2.9m on the disposal of the group's Darchem
Engineering businesses, compared with Pounds 7m of exceptionals in 1992.
Mr Donald Parr, chairman, described trading conditions during the year as
erratic, with markets continuing to be extremely competitive. But he was
confident that the group's strategy of focusing on the core clothing and
textiles business would show increasing returns.
Turnover from the textiles businesses rose from Pounds 439.8m to Pounds
472.2m, including a contribution of Pounds 20m from Richard I Racke, a maker
of women's wear and casual clothing acquired last August. Operating profits
were flat at Pounds 21.1m, including Pounds 2.3m from acquisitions.
Operating profits from the engineering side of the group were Pounds 1.3m
(Pounds 1m). The division's turnover fell from Pounds 101.7m to Pounds
50.4m, leaving total turnover at Pounds 522.6m, down from Pounds 541.5m.
Last July the main Darchem Engineering businesses were sold to the Weir
Group for Pounds 16m.
The acquisition of Racke, which turned Baird into the third largest supplier
to Marks and Spencer, helped Baird's contract clothing division to lift
turnover by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 230m. Like for like turnover grew by 7
per cent, and margins improved from 3.7 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Mr Parr said the integration of Racke into Bairdwear Racke under a single
management team was almost complete, with the consequent operating economies
coming on stream.
The branded clothing division, which includes Windsmoor and Dannimac,
increased turnover by just 1.9 per cent to Pounds 213m. Operating profits
were down from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 11.3m as margins were squeezed to 5.3
per cent (5.8 per cent).
Basic earnings per share rose from 8.4p to 10.9p. An unchanged final
dividend of 5.35p is proposed, giving an unchanged total of 8.9p.
COMMENT
The disposal of the engineering side has absorbed a lot of management time
that could have been devoted to making the textile assets sweat. The virtual
completion of the disposal programme and management changes in the textile
divisions suggest that the company is ready to do just that - the question
is how long will it take to turn round. Margins on textiles were around 4.5
per cent last year, well down on the company's past achievements. Profits
this year are likely to be around Pounds 27m, giving a prospective multiple
of around 15. The shares have been supported by the yield of 4.6 per cent,
but otherwise look dull.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hepworth shares fall 8% in spite of 30%
rise to Pounds 58m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, fell 8 per
cent, or 35p, yesterday to 418p in spite of its announcement of a 30 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits in 1993 from a restated Pounds 44.8m to Pounds
58.3m.
The market was more concerned at the company's warnings about the slow pace
of the UK construction recovery and worries that Hepworth's price increases
were unlikely to stick in what remain very competitive markets.
Turnover increased from Pounds 627.5m to Pounds 654.7m. The rise in earnings
per share from 15.6p to 19.2p was in line with market forecasts. The final
dividend was held at 9.35p keeping the year's total at 14.85p.
Many of the group's markets remained flat with the decline in construction
activity reaching bottom in the UK but still falling in many continental
European markets.
Nonetheless, margins improved in a number of areas as a result of previous
cost-cutting, rising exports and product development. The group's range of
products ranges from clay pipes to central heating boilers: this gives it a
wider exposure to the construction industry than most building materials
groups.
Mr John Carter, managing director, said that European construction markets
were likely to remain demanding in the short term but ultimately would
benefit from lower interest rates.
Gearing fell from 136 to 12 per cent following last year's conversion to
equity of Pounds 100m of convertible bonds.
Profits in the building products division rose from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds
20.1m helped by exports of clay pipes to the busy German housing market.
Profits in the home products division rose 10 per cent to Pounds 11.7m
(Pounds 10.6m) helped by an 8 per cent rise in the UK boiler market.
Profits of Saunier Duval proved very resilient - they fell by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 25.2m - given the problems facing continental European construction
markets. Hepworth Refractories' profits rose from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds
6.5m, while profits from the minerals and chemicals division dipped to
Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 8.5m).
COMMENT
Comments by Hepworth and John Laing that the UK construction revival may not
be proceeding as fast as had been previously thought may increase concern
ahead of next month's tax rises, which may yet undermine confidence in the
housing market. That, and fears about the effect of public spending cuts on
the UK road programme were enough to send Hepworth's shares falling. The
company, like Laing in contracting, is a quality performer but its strengths
are well known. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 75m in 1994 put the group on a
prospective p/e of 20 - high enough given uncertainty about the pace of
recovery.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates advances 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday
announced a 14.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.4m to
Pounds 53m for 1993 and a rise in net assets per share from 265p to 269p.
The group posted a valuation surplus on its investment property portfolio of
Pounds 115.6m or 7.6 per cent. A 13.1 per cent surplus on its UK properties
was offset by a 6.8 per cent deficit overseas.
'For Slough, the immediate mood is cautious optimism,' said Sir Nigel Mobbs,
chairman. 'The outlook for 1994 is much improved as a result of stronger
business confidence and the prospect of sustainable economic recovery.'
Rental values were likely to start their recovery later in the year for good
properties in prime locations, he added.
The company said it was increasing its development programme, particularly
on the Slough trading estates. Its current construction programme amounts to
139,000 sq ft in the UK and Canada. By the year end, it expects to have
another 285,000 sq ft of new industrial and retail warehouse space in the UK
under construction.
Slough said it would place emphasis on development of its existing portfolio
rather than acquisitions. Sir Nigel criticised the 'extravagant' prices
currently being asked by vendors.
Provisions against the carrying value of trading stock fell from Pounds
18.8m to Pounds 7.3m.
Operating profit of utilities fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 4.1m), as a result
of continuing commissioning problems.
Last March's rights issue raised Pounds 147m, which pushed year-end gearing
down to 56 per cent (83 per cent). Cash balances stood at Pounds 69m.
Earnings per share was 7p, compared with a restated figure of 7.9p for 1992.
An final dividend of 5p per share was recommended, which together with the
3.1p interim, represents an unchanged 8.1p on increased share capital.
COMMENT
The value placed on Slough Estates' assets was above most analysts'
expectations, giving a small fillip to the share price, which rose 2p to
255p. But enthusiasm was tempered by the lacklustre rise in earnings, which
left its dividend barely covered. Analysts were also critical of the further
provisions against trading stock, the high level of interest capitalised and
the continued weakness of Slough's utilities business. Nor has the
management been forgiven for past errors of strategy and timing.
Nonetheless, a strong performance from the company's core portfolio
encourages confidence in the quality of its assets and the decision to
invest money in developing its own portfolio makes clear sense. Estimates
for this year's pre-tax profits range around Pounds 65m; the continuing
mediocre prospects for future revenue growth and the weak dividend cover are
likely to restrict the scope for any dividend increase. But the shares look
reasonably valued on the assumption that the net asset value increases to
Pounds 3 per share this year, putting them on a discount to net assets of 15
per cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger dollar helps Reckitt rise to
Pounds 260m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in the dollar helped Reckitt &amp; Colman, the consumer goods
group, to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 165m to Pounds 260m on an FRS
4 basis. The 17 per cent appre-ciation in the dollar against the pound, and
other exchange rate moves, added some Pounds 16m to Pounds 17m to pre-tax
profits.
Excluding the Pounds 19m coupon on the group's Pounds 200m of convertible
capital bonds, profits rose 51.4 per cent to Pounds 279m up from Pounds
184m, restated for the Indian activities' move from associate to subsidiary
status.
A proposed final dividend of 11.1p (10.25p) gives a total of 17.55p (16.2p)
a rise of 8.3 per cent. Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said the dividend
increase reflected Reckitt's policy of progressive increases above the rate
of inflation.
Group sales rose 8.4 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn, and operating profits were up
from Pounds 275m to Pounds 315m. Interest charges, excluding the bond
coupon, rose from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 35.6m as sterling deposits fell and
attracted lower returns. Strong cash flow cut net debt by Pounds 97m to
Pounds 216.5m, excluding the capital bonds, compared with shareholders'
funds of Pounds 704m (Pounds 618m).
Mr Sankey said that one objective in 1993 had been to increase the
proportion of profits from North America, which includes Mexico, and this
had gone up from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Another was to raise the
proportion from faster growing economies such as South America and South
East Asia, and these had risen from 16 per cent to 20 per cent in spite of
hyper-inflation in Brazil.
Operating profits from household and toiletry rose from Pounds 188m to
Pounds 206m, helped by new product development. Pharmaceutical profits rose
from Pounds 42m to Pounds 45.5m, with extensions of products such as Dettol
and Lemsip. Food profits were up from Pounds 45m to Pounds 54.3m, in spite
of the effect of a soft drinks price war on Robinsons and poor summer
weather.
Stated earnings per share were 45.02p (25.16p), but the underlying earnings
growth was 10.1 per cent to 43.64p (39.62p).
COMMENT
Although the shares fell 10 1/2 p to 605p yesterday, this probably had more
to do with the market than any real disappointment with the numbers.
Reckitt's merits lie in its strong cash generation, high margins, strong
brand positions and geographical spread, all of which contribute to the
regular progression in dividends. However, unlike its mustard, Reckitt never
lights the fire of the mass of investors. Hence a low prospective p/e, of
around 12 1/2 on pre-tax forecasts of Pounds 310m-plus, and a historic yield
of 3.6 per cent which should continue rising faster than inflation. For
investors seeking reliability rather than fireworks, Reckitt is a good bet.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance returns to black - Pounds 350m
turnround achieved by emphasis on sound underwriting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Alliance, one of the UK's largest insurers, returned to profit in 1993,
after three consecutive years of losses, with Pounds 221.7m pre-tax, against
losses of Pounds 129.6m.
The group said the turnround was achieved by an emphasis on sound
underwriting and generating sufficient profits on the general insurance
business to absorb continuing losses on its domestic mortgage indemnity
business.
The year also saw a strengthening of the balance sheet, with shareholders
funds rising by Pounds 465m to Pounds 2.01bn and solvency - net assets as a
percentage of non-life premium income - returning to 64 per cent, compared
with the 54 per cent of last year.
Earnings per share were 22.3p, against losses of 16.1p and the board is
recommending a final dividend of 9.5p, for a total of 14.75p (14.25p). The
shares closed the day 12p up at 326p.
Premium income from general insurance in Sun Alliance UK fell slightly to
Pounds 996m (Pounds 1.01bn), but was accompanied by a return to underwriting
profit of Pounds 3m against losses of Pounds 190m.
General insurance business in Sun Alliance International generated premium
income of Pounds 859m, up from Pounds 825. Losses on underwriting were lower
at Pounds 136m (Pounds 248m).
Though underwriting of the general business in Sun Alliance Overseas once
again made a loss of Pounds 110m, premium income was up sharply, to Pounds
1.54bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The life side premium income rose to Pounds 394m
(Pounds 260m).
This increase came partly from the acquisition of Hafnia in Denmark during
the year.
On the life side Sun Alliance suffered a drop in its premium income in the
UK to Pounds 740m (Pounds 1.04bn) as a result of a fall in its single
premium business, although its annual premium income rose.
The group said that it had been prepared to sacrifice some market share
rather than write business at a loss.
Mr Roger Taylor, who will be group chief executive from July, warned that
the favourable recent period of mild weather would not last, and said that
in many classes of insurance premium rates were too low for the risks being
underwritten.
Sun Alliance is not making any special provision for potential compensation
to be paid to any of its 18,000 clients who had transferred out of
occupational pension schemes.

FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frost increases 33% and plans further
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frost Group, the UK's largest independent petrol retailer, boosted profits
by 33 per cent for the year ended December 31 on the back of a 43 per cent
rise in turnover.
Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 5.75m to Pounds 7.65m on turnover of
Pounds 177.2m (Pounds 124m).
Earnings per share rose from 7.7p to 9.5p. A final dividend of 2.7p (2.2p)
is proposed, giving a total of 4.9p (3.9p).
Mr John Murgatroyd, finance director, said yesterday that the company had
opened another 50 sites during the year, taking the group total to 181. The
group now accounted for 1.65 per cent of UK petrol sales.
Frost, which trades as Save Service Stations, increased its market share
against a background of a 1.5 per cent fall in UK volume, and a fall of 3.1
per cent in the number of petrol stations to just under 18,000.
Last October Frost made a 5-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 21.3m in
order to repay bank debt and clear the way for further acquisitions. It
ended the year with cash of nearly Pounds 7m and unused existing facilities
of Pounds 21m. Net assets rose from Pounds 27m to Pounds 50.9m.
Mr Murgatroyd said the group planned a further 45 to 50 sites this year.
Frost sites its shops in towns and local communities, believing that
motorists tend to fill up at the beginning or end of their journeys. Each
site has a Smilies corner shop, selling goods ranging from coal and
grow-bags to milk and bread. The shops are open 16 hours a day, seven days a
week.
The group has also introduced a smart card which effectively knocks 2p a
gallon off the price of petrol to loyal customers.

Shares in Wolstenholme Rink put on 37p to 695p yesterday as the company
reported pre-tax profits up by 52 per cent from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 4.4m
for the year to end-December.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 7m to Pounds 57m.
Earnings per share came out at 39.6p (23.4p) and a proposed final dividend
of 11.2p (10.5p) raises the total for the year to 18p (17p).
Based in Lancashire, Wolstenholme Rink has reorganised its activities into
three sections: supplies to the printing ink industry; supplies to the
printing industry; and other businesses.
Mr Tony Rink, joint chairman, said the business climate in the group's more
developed markets, particularly Europe and America, remained somewhat
disappointing.
However, the wide geographic spread of its sales had assisted in offsetting
those markets suffering from recession.
Mr Rink said the last quarter of 1993 had shown signs of recovery in the UK
printing industry and added that this trend had continued into the the
current year.
International business remained at encouraging levels.

FT  25 MAR 94 / BAT to increase payout by 25% under FID plan: Move to new
scheme set to save Pounds 90m in advance corporation tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries yesterday became the first company to say it would definitely
use the foreign income dividend (FID) scheme introduced in last year's two
budgets.
The move will put pressure on other companies to make similar moves. One
finance director said he was glad to see another company move first, so that
market reaction could be judged. BAT shares fell 5p to 454p, in line with
the fall in the stock market.
BAT, which has worldwide interests ranging from tobacco to insurance, said
it would lift its final dividend for 1993 by 25 per cent, from the 12.2p it
announced earlier this month, to 15.25p, so that non-taxpaying shareholders
would not be disadvantaged by the payment of a FID. It will delay paying the
dividend from June until July as the scheme comes into effect on July 1.
The payment of a FID will save BAT around Pounds 90m in advance corporation
tax (ACT), which will be passed on to shareholders through the higher
payout.
The FID scheme was introduced to help companies with a structural surplus
ACT problem. Companies such as BAT, which earns around 70 per cent of its
profits outside the UK, suffer under the UK tax regime when their mainstream
corporation tax liability is insufficient to offset their ACT liability on
dividends.
Under the scheme, first proposed in the March budget and detailed in the
November budget, companies can opt to pay a dividend out of foreign income,
which they must remit to the UK, and in effect avoid paying ACT on the
dividend.
The idea has met some opposition. Companies say the scheme is complex, and
the requirement to remit foreign income could make them liable for
withholding tax in other territories.
Non-taxpaying shareholders, such as pension funds, have also expressed
concern about FIDs as they can reclaim ACT paid on ordinary dividends. As
ACT would not be payable on FIDs, non-taxpayers could not reclaim it, and
their total income would be cut. BAT said the extra 25 per cent would
compensate non-taxpayers, who hold about 40 per cent of its shares.
Tax-paying investors would be better off under the FID scheme as they are
deemed to have paid tax at 20 per cent on the dividend even though no ACT
would have been paid.
One institutional shareholder said that FIDs could change a company's
shareholder base.
BAT said its interim dividend for 1994 would not be a FID, but would be
delayed by 2 1/2 months to January 1995, to maximise ACT savings in 1994.
Thereafter it would review the pattern of dividend payments.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Gerstner outlines strategy for IBM: Product line to be
recast from 'top to bottom' with focus on client/server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of International Business Machines, yesterday
outlined six 'strategic imperatives' to revive the fortunes of the ailing US
computer company.
In the first public discussion of his strategy since joining IBM 12 months
ago, Mr Gerstner made clear that mainframe computers will no longer be the
primary focus. IBM's product line would be recast from 'top to bottom'.
Although IBM is developing a new generation of mainframes based on
microprocessor technology, it will increasingly focus on client/server
computing, based on networks of computers.
'The failure to capitalise on this seachange in our industry (from
centralised 'host' mainframe computer systems to distributed networks) is
the single most important mistake IBM has made in the last decade,' said Mr
Gerstner.
'We have to take all we know about powerful host-based systems and create
new . . . products for the open, distributed world. We should have done it a
decade ago . . . I'm not trying to create a complete IBM make-over, a brand
new IBM, but rather a sense of urgency, direction and engagement,' he added.
Mr Gerstner also outlined five other 'strategic imperatives' for IBM:
Exploiting the company's technology: In the past, IBM has invented new
technologies, but failed to bring them to market as fast as its competitors,
Mr Gerstner acknowledged. IBM will also license its technologies more
broadly. The company's royalty income has nearly doubled over the past two
years to almost Dollars 500m.
Networking: IBM aims to establish itself as a leader in 'information
super-highways'.
Realigning sales and distribution: IBM is transforming its salesforce into
groups of 'highly segmented and focused product specialists', while creating
groups that provide services ranging from business re-engineering consulting
to systems integration. to particular industry sectors.
Geographic expansion: IBM will expand operations in emerging markets such as
China and South America.
Making size an advantage: in contrast to his predecessor, Mr John Akers, who
planned to break up IBM into 'auto-nomous business units,' Mr Gerstner aims
to 'leverage our economies of scale across research, development,
manufacturing, distribution and services'.
Mr Gerstner is encouraging the use, for example, of common technologies and
components across different product lines and spoke of centralised
purchasing as another way to cut costs.
'If our strategies fail,' said Mr Gerstner, 'it will be because we got in
our own way.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Growth in sales slows at Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellcome tumbled 8 per cent yesterday after the drug company
reported slower than expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it
was dropping the development of a new anti-herpes compound.
The company also plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by around 350 over the
next 12 months. Similar cuts in the US workforce of 4,000 are thought
likely.
Interim pre-tax profits, which rose 10 per cent to Pounds 358.1m, were above
market expectations, but the shares fell 52p to a three-year low of 549p.
Sales rose 5 per cent to Pounds 1.08bn, against analysts' forecasts of
around 8 per cent, with volume growth of only 3.5 per cent. Operating
margins rose from 30.5 per cent to 32.9 per cent.
Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, admitted that the dropping of
the new herpes drug, netivudine, was a disappointment but expressed surprise
at the market's reaction to the sales figures. 'Given the three factors
which depressed our sales, two of which will be non-recurring, the growth
was respectable.'
The biggest impact on sales was caused by preliminary conclusions of a study
which cast doubt on the efficacy of Wellcome's Aids drug Retrovir. Retrovir
sales fell 16 per cent to Pounds 110m in the six months to February.
Group sales were also squeezed by pricing pressure in Europe and by the
introduction in Japan of a rival to Wellcome's herpes treatment Zovirax.
This was subsequently withdrawn after 15 patients died. However, sales of
Zovirax rose from Pounds 369m to Pounds 418m, with underlying growth
recovering to 10 per cent.
After 15 years, Zovirax now faces competition from SmithKline's Famvir,
recently introduced into the UK. Famvir has some advantages over Zovirax and
Wellcome's own successor, Valtrex, is a year behind.
Earnings per share excluding exceptional items rose 11 per cent to 25.7p but
the interim dividend jumped from 4.8p to 8.6p. Mr Robb said this stemmed
partly from a decision to reduce dividend cover, and to compensate
shareholders for the plan to change its financial year-end to December.
A second interim dividend of 5.8p will be paid in October and a final in
May-June 1995.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Laing chairman hits out at banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and institutional shareholders which have supported 'enfeebled
contractors' have added to damaging over-capacity in the UK construction
industry, Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, said yesterday.
His remarks, which accompanied the the construction group's annual results
for 1993, were made as rival contractor Mowlem launched a Pounds 63.1m
rights issue to refinance the group.
Laing, which announced a 57 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds
18.3m, has previously complained that the efforts of banks and shareholders
to prop up ailing companies has left too many contractors chasing too few
orders in the recession.
Mr Laing said that highly borrowed contractors needing a regular flow of
cash payments to meet interest charges were desperate to win work 'at the
expense of profit'. He estimated that there was up to 30 per cent
over-capacity among UK contractors.
The comments run contrary to traditional criticisms that banks are too quick
to call in receivers. Mr Laing stressed he was not aiming his comments at
any particular contractor.
In response to low UK profit margins, Laing was seeking more work overseas.
It was also increasing its involvement in privately financed infrastructure
projects where these provided satisfactory returns. Laing was prepared to
take small equity stakes in these developments if required.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Optimism lifts P&amp;O shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company rose
27p to 695p yesterday, as the shipping, transport and property group
revealed a recovery in earnings, and an optimistic outlook. Pre-tax profit
was Pounds 523.7m, against Pounds 270.4m, boosted by Pounds 278.5m profits
from investment sales.
Lord Sterling, chairman, said the businesses had performed well across the
board since the start of the year. 'For the first time, it may be that we
will find ourselves firing on all cylinders at the same time.'
Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 5.75bn, but excluding discontinued
operations, such as the sale of Sutcliffe Catering, the figure increased 12
per cent to Pounds 5.59bn. Operating profit after interest, but before a
Pounds 15m provision, rose 25 per cent to Pounds 260.2m, outlining the
improvement in underlying businesses.
Bovis Homes, the UK housebuilder, rebounded into a Pounds 8.2m profit, from
a Pounds 26.6m loss, because of a 46 per cent increase in unit sales. Bovis
Construction Group also returned to profitability with a Pounds 10.3m
contribution, and its worldwide order book rose 32 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn.
Investment properties contributed Pounds 104.9m (Pounds 90.9m), but the
development business lost Pounds 17.6m from write-downs.
P&amp;O announced a Pounds 15m provision for restructuring its ferries business
before the Channel tunnel opening. However, the cruise and ferries
operations saw profits rise 10 per cent to Pounds 168.5m.
The container division increased profits marginally, because of rising cargo
volumes and stable costs, but bulk shipping continued to suffer from
recession. The combined division fell slightly to Pounds 31.1m.
P&amp;O Australia had a record year with a 20 per cent increase in profits to
Pounds 30.4m, helping to push the contribution from Asia Pacific to 17 per
cent of group sales.
Gearing has been cut from 84 per cent to 53 per cent, due to asset sales,
and the company is close to covering interest costs - Pounds 125m (Pounds
130m) in 1993 - with investment property income.
The dividend is maintained at 30.5p, with a final dividend of 6.5p. This was
not quite covered by recurrent net profits, and analysts do not expect an
increase in 1994. Earnings per share were 68.5p (32.3p).

FT  25 MAR 94 / John Mowlem launches Pounds 63m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Mowlem, the UK contractor and construction equipment group which owns
London City Airport, yesterday launched a Pounds 63.1m rights issue after it
revealed that it would breach loan covenants.
Mowlem, which last year made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 124.2m after
provisions and property writedowns of Pounds 61m, also intends selling its
UK housebuilding business.
The company had pre-viously raised Pounds 100m from disposals.
It has already announced that it intends selling London City Airport, which
last year incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.8m. Group losses included
Pounds 48.8m of goodwill previously written off to reserves and now charged
against profits following last year's sale of the HSS plant hire business.
Sir Philip Beck, who is standing down as Mowlem's chief executive but
remaining part-time chairman, said that following the latest writedowns the
company would breach bank loan covenants requiring minimum levels of net
assets, as well breaching financial covenants made on a Pounds 50m bond
issue in 1988.
To prevent this, Mowlem shareholders are being offered three new shares at
100p each for every five already held. Mowlem's share price fell 40p to 112p
following the announcement.
Mr John Marshall, who takes over as chief executive in August, said the
proceeds would be used to reduce debt and fund working capital as the
construction businesses recovered.
Mr Brian Watkins finance director, is to retire and will be replaced by Mr
Charles Barton, previously finance director of Laird Group.
The company said that net debt of Pounds 76m at end of February could
possibly have reached Pounds 100m at the highest point this year compared
with shareholders funds of just Pounds 91m.
Net debt, based on levels prevailing at the end of December, would fall
following the rights issue to Pounds 12m representing gearing of just 8 per
cent.
The issue has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson, with US institutions
represented by Morgan Stanley agreeing to take up their rights on their
combined 19.4 per cent of the shares.
Other UK institutional shareholders of Mowlem have agreed to sub-underwrite
the issue. Brokers are Hoare Govett.
The company, provided shareholders agree to reduce the share premium account
by Pounds 60m, will not pay an interim dividend for 1994 but intends to
recommend a final dividend of 2p.
It is not paying a final dividend for 1993
The latest provisions include Pounds 17.4m to cover redundancies and
restructuring costs, Pounds 36.3m of asset writedowns and bad debt
provisions and Pounds 7.3m against discontinued businesses.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Pressure grows on Lyell after clashes with Scott:
Attorney-general's immunity advice challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, JOHN MASON and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell's position as attorney-general came under renewed
pressure yesterday when Lord Justice Scott challenged the government's
conduct of the Matrix Churchill case at the heart of the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry.
In his most sustained cross-examination since the inquiry began in May, the
judge repeatedly clashed with Sir Nicholas over his interpretation of the
law on the use of public interest immunity (PII), which the government used
to withhold documents which the defence considered vital.
In a nervous performance, Sir Nicholas at one point appeared suggest that
ministers had some discretion with regard to PII certificates and that he
had wrongly advised Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
who had been reluctant to sign a PII certificate.
However, he later issued a statement that his remarks had not been intended
as a com-ment on the Matrix Churchill case.
The case against the three businessmen accused of illegally exporting
machine tools to Iraq collapsed in November 1992 after a judge ordered that
documents covered by PII certificates should be handed to the defence.
Opening his evidence, Sir Nicholas read out a four-page statement in which
he defended his role as the government's legal adviser. He said suggestions
that ministers suppressed documents to save themselves while risking that
the defendants be sent to jail were 'utterly untrue.'
The exchanges with Lord Justice Scott focused on the advice given by Sir
Nicholas to the four ministers who signed PII certificates that they were
under a duty to do so and could not use their discretion in the matter.
This was repeatedly challenged by the judge. At one point he described the
attorney-general's argument that ministers could not disclose sensitive
documents without being advised to do so by counsel as a 'proposition which
has no legitimacy or auth-ority'.
Sir Nicholas's attempts to present a coherent defence appeared to weaken as
he was forced to qualify his opening statement.
He told the inquiry that a minister with 'an instinct for justice' who
disagreed with the advice he received could 'in conscience' refuse to sign
if he thought that the clear balance in the interest of justice lay with
disclosure of documents.
He also conceded that the judge's proposal that the PII system required
reform 'deserved very serious consideration'.
Mr John Major, prime minister, pressed by Labour to sack Sir Nicholas,
warned MPs not to be 'misled' by news reports of the attorney-general's
evidence.
However, the attorney-general did little to convince Conservative MPs that
he would survive the next ministerial reshuffle.

FT  25 MAR 94 / EU averts crisis over steel cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, ANDREW BAXTER and JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An end to the crisis in the European Union steel industry was in sight last
night after the European Commission agreed to give private sector
steelmakers more time to finalise cuts in capacity.
The agreement, between industry chiefs and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry
commissioner, averts a collapse in relations between the Commission and
unsubsidised EU steel producers.
These companies have been reluctant to offer capacity cuts, which are vital
to the future of the industry, because they do not believe the Commission
has taken a tough enough line on curbing subsidies to some producers, mainly
in Germany, Italy and Spain.
The plan, agreed on Wednesday night, is expected to result in total cuts of
about 19m tonnes of hot-rolled product capacity in the industry. Last month
the industry indicated the maximum cuts it could offer would be 17m tonnes,
compared with cuts of between 19m and 25m tonnes demanded by the Commission.
But offers of reductions in the Italian private sector, including the
Bresciani steel mills, and proposed mergers would increase these cuts by
several million tonnes, the Commission said.
In exchange, Mr Bangemann has backed down from a threat to halt an Ecu240m
(Pounds 181m) aid package offered to the industry, to help with the
restructuring and capacity cuts being demanded. Last month he threatened to
block this aid, along with monitoring of imports from eastern Europe, if the
industry did not provide a viable restructuring plan before a meeting of the
EU industry council on April 22.
The industry has now persuaded the Commission to delay a decision on the
proposed aid package until November, to give the industry more time to
develop a restructuring plan and allow the Italian government to introduce
the legislation needed to carry out cuts.
At the same time, it was unlikely that the German government would be able
to approve proposed mergers in the German industry before the autumn, the
Commission said. Brussels refused to specify the precise level of the
proposed cuts, admitting that final details remained uncertain.
But 'even if 70 per cent of the cuts occurred' this would result in a
reduction of more than 19m tonnes, it said.
The new reductions on offer appear to be little more than a cosmetic
juggling of previous commitments. Eurofer, the European steel confederation,
insisted that the final figure for reductions was still likely to be
'slightly less than 19m tonnes'.
'The figures are not that different, but the big difference is that . . .
the process cannot occur in a short time,' it said.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Clinton to release more tax returns on Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton said last night it appeared he had lost less money on
the Whitewater land investment in Arkansas than he had previously stated. He
promised to release today tax returns dating back to the 1970s which would
reveal to the public that he was concealing nothing.
In relaxed mood at a nationally televised press conference dominated by
Whitewater questions, Mr Clinton insisted that 'the American people should
know that I and my administration will not be distracted'.
Wryly noting media fascination with Whitewater, he said he was surprised
that his poll ratings had not fallen by more than they have. He reiterated
that nothing would be withheld from the independent counsel, Mr Robert
Fiske.
Mr Clinton ducked no questions. He maintained his administration had higher
ethical standards than its predecessors and said that, if mistakes had been
made, 'we learn as we go along'.
His specific confession was that he had simply forgotten that, in 1981, he
had raised a short-term personal loan from Mr James MacDougal, his
Whitewater partner and formerly chief of an Arkansas savings and loan firm,
to help his late mother buy a house in Arkansas.
Mr MacDougal has said in interviews he remembers making a personal loan to
Mr Clinton. The president said he had racked his brains to remember this and
it had only come back to his mind when he was proofreading the unpublished
memoirs of his mother, Mrs Virginia Kelley, who died in January.
He calculated this meant that his total Whitewater losses, previously stated
to be about Dollars 69,000, should be reduced by a further Dollars 22,500.
Should he be found liable to any additional back taxes, he would pay them.
Mr Clinton denied he had interfered with federal investigations into various
aspects of Whitewater. He specifically refuted, though without anger,
allegations by respected Congressman Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican, of
interference with an investigation by the Kansas City branch of the
Resolution Trust Corporation, the savings and loan clean-up agency, into Mr
MacDougal's bank.
Mr Clinton staunchly defended his wife, Hillary, whose 'moral authority'
would emerge from Whitewater 'stronger than it has ever been'. He said she
had never earned income as a lawyer in Arkansas from state business while he
was governor.
Indeed, he showed no animus to anyone. He merely reflected that he had
learnt that 'there is a level of suspicion (in Washington) greater than I've
been accustomed to in the past'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to accuse BAT of being stuck in the mud. The company pioneered
the controversial enhanced scrip dividend last year, and is leading the pack
with the foreign income dividend now. Both have the express purpose of
saving unrelieved advance corporation tax, but BAT may find that fewer
others will copy its latest innovation. In part that is because the FID
regulations are onerous. Despite earning almost three-quarters of its income
abroad, BAT only decided that it should issue a FID after extensive work.
Other companies may not pay enough overseas tax on their earnings to
qualify. Nor do FIDs have the same cash-flow advantages as enhanced scrips,
which were often used by companies with as much of a cash flow as a tax
problem.
Institutional reaction may also be mixed. BAT has structured its FID so that
tax-exempt funds do not suffer, but the main gain goes to tax paying
shareholders. There may be some resentment of this, despite the fact that
FIDs put taxpaying and tax-exempt shareholders on an equivalent footing.
Equally, however, taxpayers will have to accept that if the company does not
pay a FID in future years, their payment may fall.
Unless companies are allowed to stream foreign income to taxpaying and UK
income to tax-exempt shareholders, FIDs will have limited appeal. Permitting
that would, however, make it difficult for the Treasury to distinguish
between the sheep, who earn substantial sums abroad, and the goats, who pay
excessive dividends from inadequate UK profits.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The practice of laying down reserves against future claims makes insurance
companies' figures extremely difficult to judge. Releasing reserves against
mortgage indemnity and subsidence claims yesterday helped Sun Alliance
deliver full year results well above the stock market's expectations. That
is not to belittle the underlying improvement in underwriting performance.
Premium income in the UK actually fell last year as the company surrendered
market share in the interest of profit.
But Sun Alliance cannot watch its UK business shrink indefinitely. The
company needs to show it can compete with low-cost insurers such as Direct
Line, which are turning their attention to household as well as motor
insurance. True, 1m policyholders buy directly from Sun Alliance, mainly
through newspaper advertisements. But it is doubtful whether that business
has the technology or low enough costs to compete on price with
telephone-based sellers. The 700 loss-making insurance broking offices
operated under the Swinton banner might help defend UK market share. But
since Swinton lost around 200,000 customers last year, time is running out.
Having underperformed the market by 30 per cent since last summer, though,
the shares stand on a yield of 5.5 per cent and a multiple of only nine
times this year's forecast earnings. On all but the most pessimistic view of
the insurance cycle, Sun Alliance - in common with the rest of the sector -
is starting to look cheap.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 8 per cent drop in Wellcome's shares seems a particularly virulent
response to a company which has had the good grace to raise its interim
dividend 79 per cent. But Wellcome's results confirmed many of the market's
worst fears about its earnings prospects. Volume growth fell to 3.5 per
cent. The 2.4 percentage point growth in margins to 32.9 per cent was
striking but may quickly be reversed. The withdrawal of an anti-herpes
compound fuelled further worries about Wellcome's drugs pipeline, while the
looming expiry of Zovirax's patents causes great uncertainty.
By valuing it on 11 times historic earnings, the market clearly views
Wellcome as a dud investment story. That may prove justified in the
immediate future. But from a long-term perspective it seems faintly absurd.
Wellcome boasts a solid balance sheet and strong cash generation. It retains
impressive expertise in anti-viral medicines. Health is the most certain
growth business in the world.
Given the low penetration levels of its main drugs and the substantial
under-utilisation of its manufacturing capacity, Wellcome could yet grow its
markets by driving volume and dropping price as theory would suggest. The
sums are hugely complicated by the regulatory restrictions affecting the
marketing and distribution of drugs. Even so, Wellcome's experience
reinforces the view that pharmaceuticals companies should rethink the basic
economics of their business.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Allied's Latin adventure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is odd that Allied-Lyons' shares should have fallen by 7 per cent if its
deal with Domecq really is a strategic breakthrough. A significant part of
the fall reflected disappointment with the 1993-94 profits estimate included
in the rights issue document. It does not help that the issue was announced
on a day when the market was fretting about the future course of interest
rates. Nor was yesterday the best time to announce the purchase of a
business which derives half its profits from Mexico. Still, the strategic
benefit must also be qualified.
On the plus side, Allied appears to be paying a reasonable price for a
purchase which sharpens its focus on drinks. The multiple of 15.2 times is
substantially below the that Guinness paid for Moet Hennessy, and while the
latter's brands are stronger, Allied is buying a controlling stake. The
operational advantages may be limited, since Allied already distributes its
products through the Domecq network. But it may now be easier to use Domecq
as a springboard to develop its regional presence. Allied will also be able
to consolidate an earnings stream from the fast-growing Latin American
drinks market.
Less certain is the benefit in terms of cash. Allied has hitherto received
only small dividends from its investment in Domecq. Now it will have control
over Domecq's entire cash flow, but that will not necessarily help reduce
group debt. Domecq's small dividends evidently reflected the reinvestment of
cash in its business. After the deal Allied will still face the constraint
of a 72 per cent gearing ratio. And it will have to wait before playing the
rights issue card again.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Mexico after Mr Colosio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shocking murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the man most likely to be
Mexico's next president, heralds a period of deep uncertainty in a country
still reeling from the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas.
Taken together, these two events show that Mexico's current economic and
political transition - while necessary and inevitable - is causing strains
which may hitherto have been underestimated, both within the country and
elsewhere. They need not, however, signal protracted or deep-seated
instability. Mexico will emerge formidably strengthened if its politicians
learn how to manage the transition better.
The attempt by President Carlos Salinas to transform his country into an
open, modern economy has had severe costs. Economic growth has ground to a
halt - in part because too much Mexican industry was unable to compete in
the international market; in part perhaps because the government has
sacrificed growth to a single-minded fight against inflation.
The difficulties have been exacerbated, however, by Mr Salinas's ambivalent
approach to political reform. The president underlined the power of his
office by regularly sacking state governors in a supposedly federal system.
The electoral system severely handicaps opposition parties, and Mr Salinas's
moves to improve it have been piecemeal. His recipe of moving faster with
economic than with political reform now looks questionable, since pressures
for political change are breeding economic uncertainty and slowing growth
and investment.
Rich potential
It is not clear that the president has fully come to terms with the
transition he set in train. Mr Salinas was right to break with the past, but
the weakening of its highly-centralised executive - an inevitable
consequence of economic reform - has enhanced the need for a strong and
legitimate institutional structure. The problem is that this is precisely
what the country lacks.
There are exceptions. The newly-constituted central bank - autonomous except
with respect to exchange rate policy - is a durable strength. The North
American Free Trade Agreement also brings rich potential and some certainty
about the future rules of the game. But the legal system and the judiciary
remain arbitrary and inefficient, the police corrupt. Mexico's people are
denied the rule of law, its businesses hindered by their inability to
enforce contracts.
Recent events thus emphatically do not call for a reversal of Mexico's
reform programme. Rather, a new government and a new presidential candidate
should look for ways to advance it. In the meantime, some fiscal relaxation
 -to provide targeted help to ease social pressures - may well be justified,
though the government will be aware that an excessively lax policy would
prompt capital flight and an economic crisis.
Crisis avoidable
Even with Mexico's dependence on foreign capital to cover a current account
deficit of over Dollars 20bn, a financial crisis is eminently avoidable.
Some Dollars 29bn at last count, Mexico's reserves are high compared to its
monetary base; the country also has financial and political support from the
US.
Similarly, while a period of political uncertainty is inevitable, it need
not run out of control. The probable replacements for Mr Colosio as
presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) all
represent continuity to some degree - though each has his drawbacks.
Finance minister Pedro Aspe is harmed by his association with Mexico's
current recession. Ernesto Zedillo, like Mr Salinas a former budget
minister, is politically inexperienced. Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy
to the troubled southern state of Chiapas, has ruled himself out of the
race.
Whoever stands for the PRI, it is unlikely that the left-wing opposition led
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will benefit greatly from the uncertainty.
In spite of yesterday's tragedy, the PRI remains the clear favourite to win
the August election. Mr Salinas's contribution to the modernisation of
Mexico has been considerable. His final task as president is to ensure that
progress towards a more pluralistic political system, which means ending the
PRI's monopoly of power, is maintained.

FT  25 MAR 94 / A fillip for its fortunes: The challenges facing Credit
Lyonnais after yesterday's rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most chairmen would adopt a sombre tone when announcing their company's
worst-ever results. Yet Mr Jean Peyrelevade yesterday seemed remarkably
cheerful when he announced that Credit Lyonnais made a net loss of FFr6.9bn
(Pounds 800m) in 1993, the biggest in its history.
The reason for his cheer was that, immediately after seeing the results, Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, signed a rescue package to
recapitalise the bank and clean up its balance sheet.
The critical question for Credit Lyonnais is whether the rescue, which
includes a FFr4.9bn capital injection and the transfer for five years of
FFr40bn of non-performing loans to a new company with the state guaranteeing
FFr18.4bn, will be enough to stabilise the bank after years of uncertainty.
The government is hoping that Mr Peyrelevade will bring the restructured
Credit Lyonnais back into the black, with the aim of eventual privatisation.
The crux of Credit Lyonnais' problems is the aggressive lending and
international expansion strategy of Mr Peyrelevade's predecessor, Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer, who chaired the bank from 1988 until last autumn. The
group acquired a network of European retail banks but was left heavily
exposed to the economic recession.
Credit Lyonnais has been forced to write off many of Mr Haberer's loans
because of the steep increase in French business failures and the fall in
property prices. Both these problems were aggravated by its exposure to a
series of corporate setbacks: from Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property
group that collapsed owing it Dollars 350m; to MGM, the ailing Hollywood
film studio that it owns and into which it has ploughed about Dollars 1.5bn.
When Mr Peyrelevade, previously chairman of the Union des Assurances de
Paris (UAP) insurance group, was brought in by the government last November,
Credit Lyonnais had just reported a net loss of FFr1.05bn for the first half
of 1993 and its capital ratio had slipped close to the
internationally-agreed minimum of 8 per cent. He realised the bank was in
danger of breaching its capital ratio requirements and asked the government
for support.
The government, afraid that Credit Lyonnais might collapse, agreed, even
though it was already under fire from the European Commission over a
FFr2.5bn aid package for Bull, the computer company. It pressed ahead with
the rescue despite complaints from other French banks about state support
for a competitor.
Banking analysts appear satisfied that the details of yesterday's package -
combined with the plan for another capital injection later this year and Mr
Peyrelevade's decision to make hefty provisions of FFr21.7bn against the
remaining bad debts in Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet - will stabilise the
bank's finances in the short term. 'Peyrelevade has devoted his first few
months to the financial rescue,' says Mr Stephane Arrouays, who follows the
French banking sector at BZW Securities. 'Now he's got to tackle its
strategic problems.'
These include rationalising the group's FFr55bn portfolio of industrial
investments to enable management to concentrate on the core banking
business. Mr Peyrelevade has drafted in Mr Dominique Bazy, his number two at
UAP, to handle the disposals. Mr Bazy intends to sell FFr20bn of assets over
the next two years and will orchestrate the sale of MGM.
Proceeds from these disposals will help repair Credit Lyonnais' balance
sheet and protect it in case it has to make substantial provisions in the
future. Further writedowns on its commercial banking business are expected
this year as the French economy is still fragile and the rate of business
failures is high.
Observers are also concerned about the bank's exposure on old loans to
Sasea, the collapsed Swiss holding company that is now the subject of an
acrimonious court case, and to Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French
politician embroiled in legal suits over fraud and bribery allegations.
'If you'd asked me last year whether Credit Lyonnais was going to take any
more big hits, I'd have said 'no',' says Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking
analyst at Merrill Lynch, the securities house. 'But it's disappointed us so
often that now I'm not so sure. All we can hope is that, if the economy
picks up, the cracks won't show.'
The timing of the recovery will also determine the progress of Mr
Peyrelevade's efforts, in the wake of yesterday's financial rescue, to
improve the performance of Credit Lyonnais' domestic banking network. A
serious problem for France's banks during the recession has been the
weakness of the credit market. The amount of credit advanced fell by 4.5 per
cent last year, according to the French Banking Association.
'There's no prospect of a real recovery in credit demand or of provisions
returning to normal levels until 1995,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, who monitors
the banking sector at securities house Lehman Brothers. 'That means margins
will remain under pressure - unless it cuts costs.'
In theory Credit Lyonnais has sig-nificant scope for cost-cutting. Operating
costs absorbed 75 per cent of its net banking income in the first half of
1993: significantly higher than Banque Nationale de Paris's 68 per cent or
Societe Generale's 67 per cent.
Mr Peyrelevade yesterday unveiled a cost cutting plan which will involve
reducing Credit Lyonnais' 38,449-strong French workforce by 10 per cent over
the next three years - although he may face opposition from the banking
unions. Past attempts by French banks, including Credit Lyonnais, to make
more modest cuts triggered a wave of strikes across the industry.
Mr Peyrelevade faces an equally difficult task in restructuring the group's
European interests. Mr Haberer bought banks in Spain, Italy, the Benelux and
Germany with the aim of building the first pan-European retail banking
network to offer a cross-border service to corporate customers and a
continental payment system for private clients.
The hitch is that, so far, Credit Lyonnais' management has been so
distracted by its financial problems that it has had no time to fulfil Mr
Haberer's original ambition of moulding the acquisitions into an integrated
network. Moreover, as it is the first bank to have attempted to create such
a network, no one really knows whether the grand design will work.
Some observers argue that the European banking market is too fragmented for
a cross-border network to operate efficiently and that Credit Lyonnais would
be better off pouring its resources into France, the one area where it has
enough critical mass to be a market leader. Others believe that banking,
like other industries, will become more international. Mr Arrouays of BZW is
convinced that, if Mr Peyrelevade can transform the European acquisitions
into an homogenous network, it could become 'a real strength' over the long
term as economic conditions improve.
But in the short term, like others, he is resigned to the prospect of
another, albeit smaller, loss for Credit Lyonnais in 1994, with a return to
profit pencilled in for 1995. As soon as the group is in the black the
French government is expected to activate its plans to sell it off to the
private sector.
'Is Credit Lyonnais sellable? Of course it is,' says Merrill Lynch's Mr
Serafimovski. 'It's a bigger bank than BNP (which was privatised last
autumn) and it's riskier. But it's also more exciting. All Credit Lyonnais
needs is to give us some hard facts to prove that it will return to profit.
It might even stop being the bank we all love to hate.'

Heard the one about the fish which drowned?
It happened the other day at Grimsby's National Fishing Heritage Centre when
a 75-year-old lobster, called Claws, fell out with the Codfather, the
museum's prize cod.
Although the cod lost half its tail, the official autopsy showed that the
cod turned up its fins because it had been drowned by Claws.
The council-owned fish tank, visited by over 160,000 people a year, intends
to keep the Codfather's replacement in a separate tank from Claws in a bid
to maintain a durable cod peace . . .

Tut tut. Geography's obviously not the strong suit of the tweed set.
CGA Services, a Glasgow-registered company that owns Country, the magazine
of the Country Gentlemen's Association, has caught its leg in its stirrup.
Rural pursuits may be its strong point but figures obviously are not.
Although its accounts for the year to April 1993 were due by the end of
February, Companies House in Edinburgh is still waiting.
So what is CGA - on whose board sit, for some reason, Sunday Times editor
Andrew Neil as well as his old Glasgow chum Gerald Malone, a deputy chairman
of the Conservative party - thinking of?
Malone's office had a ready explanation. The company's accountants
apparently sent the figures to Companies House in Cardiff rather than its
equivalent north of the border.

Brian Laudrup, the Danish national soccer star, probably had a wonderful
future with Italian club, AC Milan.
Note the past tense; in his first season with the club, Laudrup seems more
intent on scoring points against Milan's chairman and owner - Silvio
Berlusconi, rising force of Forza Italia, the Italian political party aiming
to attract middle-class voters in Sunday's election.
The Danish striker says Berlusconi wrongly mixes sport with politics: 'In
other countries the presidents of football clubs are elected. Here in Italy
they are more or less dictators. They do exactly what they want and take
decisions over the heads of their trainers and managers.'
But let's not be too beastly to Berlusconi, aka sua emittenza, or his
transmittance. Based on Laudrup's description, the media tycoon doesn't
sound any worse than many chairmen of British premier league sides.

False alarm. Earlier speculation that Birmingham, the biggest authority in
England, might make a bit of history by appointing a woman as chief
executive was wide of the mark. At the end of the day it has done the
orthodox thing. Michael Lyons, now chief executive of Nottinghamshire, will
be its next chief executive.
He knows his way around already. One resting place on his path of upward
mobility was none other than the Birmingham City Council. He was a Labour
member, but before Labour won control in 1984. The background knowledge
could help when the going gets tough, as it no doubt will.

Robin Young, head of the local government directorate in the environment
department, has made a miraculous escape from the shambles surrounding the
reorganisation of local government in England.
He's been a keen supporter of the move towards smaller unitary authorities
ever since he headed Michael Heseltine's 1991 rethink on local government.
This spawned the Local Government Review which, under Sir John Banham, has
threatened to abolish much-loved counties such as Somerset and North
Yorkshire. Local business interests are up in arms while county and district
councils are locked in a debilitating battle for survival. Tory backbenchers
want the whole farrago called off.
Despite this, Young has been promoted to become Mr London, the capital's
first regional director. What sort of organisation promotes the key manager
in the middle of radical changes that have run into choppy water?

FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Kopper's cop-out?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the mighty Deutsche Bank first invited bank analysts for a debriefing
after its results a couple of years ago, the Anglo-Saxon scribblers marked
the event with a barrage of tricky questions. Their more biddable German
colleagues merely proposed a vote of thanks.
Deutsche executives readily admit they do not fully comprehend what
international investors expect of them in terms of information disclosure.
Hence great excitement at the promise, months ago, that this year's briefing
would be handled by Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's boss, and not an investor
relations flunky. Might Kopper lift the veil just a little bit on those
impenetrable accounts?
Imagine the let-down when faxes arrived explaining that 'unforeseen
circumstances' would prevent Kopper from turning up. 'As far as I can
ascertain, that consists of a board discussion and a credit meeting,'
scoffed one crest-fallen analyst. Clearly the Germans still think one buys
Deutsche Bank shares because they are there.

<TEXT>
Perhaps the most striking evidence of Mr Jean Peyrelevade's determination to
give Credit Lyonnais a fresh start is his decision to bring in Mr Pascal
Lamy, who has been chief of staff to Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, for the past nine years.
A cryptic communique, issued yesterday in Paris and Brussels, merely said Mr
Lamy would 'join the management' of the bank. But it seems likely that the
47-year-old Eurocrat may end up number two to Mr Peyrelevade, although Mr
Lamy's precise relation to the bank's two general directors may be of less
import. The Credit Lyonnais president is said to want to run the bank more
collegially and to get away from the monarchical style for which his
predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, and indeed many French bosses are often
criticised.
Bringing a man with no commercial banking experience into an institution
that self-evidently needs just that, may seem odd. Yet Mr Lamy is an old
hand in multinational institutions, and Credit Lyonnais - thanks indeed to
Mr Haberer's over-ambitious expansion of recent years - has become one. The
bank may not operate in all 12 European Union countries. But it has more
than double the Commission's 15,000 staff, and is now the most
trans-European of banks.
At all events, Mr Peyrelevade had no hesitation in starting to headhunt Mr
Lamy last October, when he took over Credit Lyonnais. The two men were
socialist comrades-in-arms in the early 1980s. Mr Lamy moved in 1983 from
being Mr Delors' chief aide in the finance ministry to succeed Mr
Peyrelevade as deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy.
As such, they were architects of the nationalisations that Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur is now busy undoing. But, evolving outside the hot house of
French socialist politicking, both now see themselves - and are evidently
seen by Mr Balladur, who has the last word on top jobs in state-owned bodies
like Credit Lyonnais - as non-ideological managers.
Acknowledging his inexperience, Mr Lamy said yesterday: 'I will have to take
six to eight months to learn the banking business.' Though he becomes a
banker on May 1, his last Euro-job will be as Mr Delors' 'sherpa', preparing
for the Group of Seven summit in July, 'because this is something I've done
for 10 years'. More to the point, however, he says he has steered, and will
steer, well clear of any Commission consideration of yesterday's state aid
plan for Credit Lyonnais. 'I won't be involved with this in Brussels, or in
Paris, from near or from far.'
If confirmation were needed that Mr Delors, whose mandate ends this December
and whose successor will be named this June, has no more big Euro-projects
in mind, Mr Lamy's departure is it. For if Mr Delors has been Europe's
'ideas man', Mr Lamy has been its 'action man' - not in routine running of
the Brussels bureaucracy, but in getting all the special projects through:
the treaty revisions of 1986 and 1992, the single market white paper, the
Euro-dimension of Germany's reunification, monetary union, and most recently
the Delors white paper on growth and jobs.
He freely owns up to his Brussels reputation as Mr Delors' 'hatchet man' or
'Exocet' (a French missile used to effect by Argentina against UK ships in
1982). 'But those who know me know this is not a trait of my character, but
has been a consequence of my function,' he says. The moody Mr Delors has
never liked to take tough personnel decisions himself. From May 1, Mr Lamy
will have a boss who is less squeamish than his old one.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Pru plays hardball
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive of Britain's Prudential Corporation,
has never made any secret of his disagreements with Mr Andrew Large, the
head of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Yet his decision to shun
the new Personal Investment Authority (PIA) and to request direct regulation
for the Prudential's sales and marketing activities by the SIB is a snub on
a gigantic scale. It comes with the full backing of the Prudential's board.
It had been Mr Large's intention to run down the direct regulatory function
of the SIB and to hand over the task to the PIA. He has also indicated
clearly that an approach from the Pru or anyone else for direct regulation
would not be welcome. Mr Newmarch's challenge is thus intentionally
confrontational. It is also exceptionally blunt, since yesterday's press
release from the Prudential concludes that 'direct regulation by the SIB
will give us an enhanced opportunity to influence our regulatory
environment'. In short, this is a hostile act of regulatory arbitrage, one
of whose objects is to capture the regulator.
In one sense, it is all posturing. There is nothing to stop the SIB
borrowing the PIA's rule book and delegating most of its regulatory
functions to the subordinate body. Only the SIB's disciplinary procedures
cannot be passed down. Nor, after such a public challenge, can Mr Large be
expected to do other than ensure that the SIB is no regulatory pushover for
the Pru. If he does give the task of monitoring Britain's biggest life
company to the subordinate body, the SIB will still be legally obliged to
operate a double check.
Majority support
That said, the PIA, whose genesis has been troubled from the outset, cannot
operate without overwhelming majority support from the retail financial
services industry. If others follow the Pru in preferring to exercise their
statutory right to register with the SIB, Mr Large's plans for improved
investor protection through a single retail watchdog will be scuppered. The
wider question is whether the abrasive manner in which the Pru has put its
case will damage its plea for a different, statutorily based approach to
regulation.
If it does, it would be a pity, for the Pru has been on the side of common
sense through much of the debate. It broke ranks with the Association of
British Insurers by supporting the Office of Fair Trading's arguments for
greater disclosure. And the theoretical case for statutory regulation, which
the Pru claims to want, has arguably been strengthened by the carping that
has accompanied the attempt to launch the PIA. There has to be a more
effective way of resolving conflicts between the different industry
interests.
Public confidence
Yet the regulatory debate cannot be divorced from its context. Public
confidence in the life companies and banks has been severely shaken by the
personal pensions fiasco. It is in both the public interest and the interest
of the insurers that urgent action is taken to restore order to the
industry's sales activities. This cannot wait for legislation, not least
because ministers are clearly wary of the political pitfalls in taking on
responsibility for monitoring those who are busy mis-selling endowment
policies and personal pensions.
The short-term priorities must therefore be to make the best of the PIA and
to ensure that the new disclosure regime which becomes compulsory next year
provides information in a form that allows the consumer to make worthwhile
choices. If the industry is forced to compete on the basis of price and
quality, instead of the means of distribution, much of its act will be
forcibly cleaned up as consumers penalise the inefficient producers.
In the longer run full statutory support for the system is probably
desirable and may well be inescapable. The Prudential could play a more
constructive role by articulating precisely what form it should take,
instead of doing battle with the SIB. This might also have the merit of
helping dispel widespread suspicions about its motivation in calling for a
statutory approach. Clearly there can be no return to the ineffectual
monitoring exercised by the Department of Trade and Industry of old. Let us
hear the Pru's more detailed alternative.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Devil is in the dealmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rule is well-known. It never changes. Make a deal with the forces of
darkness and you pay with your soul. Mr John Major entered into such an
agreement last September. In a celebrated article in The Economist, he
sealed a bargain with the nationalists and little Englanders who have since
held sway in his Conservative coalition.
Its import was clear. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty, which he
had forced through parliament by risking his government's life on a single
no-confidence vote, was an experience not to be repeated. Britain would
remain within the European Union, but would seek to remould it as a Gaullist
congeries of nation states. In return the prime minister would be granted a
respite from internecine strife. The arrangement must have sounded harmless
at the time. After all, the EU, like the EC before it, always has been a
permanent conference of independent governments, perpetually negotiating
with one another. In essence, it still is.
The language of Mr Major's carefully-constructed concordat was ostensibly
designed to unite the Tories. Drafts were shown to influential individuals,
left and right, Eurosceptic and Europhobe. 'I want to see the community
become a wide union,' he wrote, 'embracing the whole of democratic Europe,
in a single market and with common security arrangements firmly linked to
Nato.' That sounded noble enough, but there was a pay-off. The community he
wanted would cease to 'nibble at national freedoms'. There would be no
further encroachments on British sovereignty. Maastricht, it was implied,
was the last treaty he would ask his party to swallow.
It seemed like a fair bargain at the time. In retrospect, it was lethal.
Three years after he had presented himself as the prime minister who would
put Britain at the heart of Europe, Mr Major had placed his government in
thrall to activists who will not rest until the European Union is remade in
the image of the soon-to-be-defunct European Free Trade Association. That is
why an argument over whether Britain shall be able to block future business
in the council of ministers by mustering 23 votes or 27 has become a
touchstone of his intentions. It is little wonder that on Tuesday, when his
impotence was revealed, the prime minister stood up in the house of commons
and snarled like a cornered mouse.
The leader of the opposition, said Mr Major, consulting his notes, was the
man who liked to say yes - 'monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels'. This
chauvinists' cliche was intended to constitute an attack on a socialist
Europe. It came out as an assault on the institutions of the European Union.
The prime minister was on better form yesterday. He spoke reasonably, and
managed to focus on socialism. Who knows how he will play, or to which
audience, next week? Nothing about this affair has proceeded smoothly. The
foreign secretary, searching anxiously for allies in the cabinet, has looked
increasingly unhappy as he speaks the language of diplomacy while Mr Major,
constantly nudged and jostled by his new-found Euro-sceptic allies, has
closed off one option after another.
Changing prime ministers would not help. No politician of stature, on either
side of the House, has come out fighting for a European perspective. The
Liberal Democrats have gone quiet. Labour has enjoyed witnessing the
government's discomfiture, but it has offered nothing, not a syllable, in
the way of letting us know what it would do in the same situation. Two
aspirants for Mr Major's job, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke,
have compromised their known pro-European principles by humming
Eurosceptical tunes.
That eternal weathervane, Mr David Howell, has written learned articles
defending the existing size of the blocking minority. The Conservative
chairman of the House of Commons select committee on foreign affairs argues
that what is at stake is 'yet more integrationist acceleration'. Unless the
rules are changed, he correctly points out, groups of countries with up to
40 per cent of the union's population could be outvoted. Yes, but the best
time to change the rules is at the next inter-governmental conference, due
in 1996.
Against that stands Mr Major's argument that it is his job to protect
British interests. Quite so. To 'stand up for Britain' is not in itself
anti-European. The prime minister repeated yesterday that the government
strongly favours enlargement of the EU. Agreed. Where his case falls down is
in the evident motivation behind his stance. It is unmistakably political,
designed to save the Conservative party by appealing to patriotism. The ploy
will be tested at this week-end's conference of party workers, and again in
the series of by-elections, local contests and Euro-polls due between now
and June. Those of us who recall Mr Major's successful soapbox defence of
the United Kingdom against Scottish separatism in April 1992 would be
prudent to suspend judgment on the domestic political effect of this week's
events.
It has to be said, however, that the omens are discouraging.
Middle-of-the-road backbench Tory MPs who would normally not allow the
number of blocking votes in the EU to enter their heads have been expressing
support for the Eurosceptic position this week. Their single desire is a
unified party, under whichever wing can keep the peace. Their concern is for
their own seats at the next general election. Some of them are very nervous
indeed. Tales abound of constituency parties that have run out of money,
selection committees that cannot be bothered to field candidates in the
local elections, usually well-attended annual meetings that have been
abandoned for lack of an audience, and simple disillusion and demoralisation
of the rank and file.
These clouds might be at least temporarily dispelled if there is a ' British
triumph' on the voting mechanism. What is required is a stitch-up that, at
least in appearance, maintains the 23-vote blocking minority on issues, such
as social legislation, that Britain considers important. Such an
understanding might be negotiated by Mr Douglas Hurd when he meets his
fellow foreign ministers in Ioannina, in western Greece, this weekend, or at
another venue later on. That would give the prime minister and the
Conservative government a breathing space, with no guarantees as to its
duration.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Threat that arises from complexity of
new electricity meters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOB LILLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles' article on future electricity metering (Technology:
'Counting the cost', March 18) perpetuates the popular misconception that
new electricity meters bring benefits to the end customer.
That this is not so has already been demonstrated in the new 100kW market
where, despite the installation of sophisticated electronic meters and
communication channels, tariffs have been simplified. The mass of data
generated by the new meters is ignored when charging the customer and is
only required to calculate what the supplier should pay the generator.
To replace existing reliable meters with high technology complex devices,
purely to satisfy the accounting systems of the wholesale market, cannot be
the way forward for the smaller industrial and domestic customer. The
additional cost will in fact kill the competitive market and effectively
maintain the present monopoly situation cloaked in pseudo competition. Who
would benefit from this? Possibly those arguing for the complex solution.
The proposals being suggested are equivalent to Kelloggs charging
Sainsburys, not on the number of cases of cereal supplied to the warehouse,
but on a count of the number of cornflakes consumed at the breakfast table.

related in Peter Marsh's article, 'Short Lautro test that 'a monkey could
pass'' (March 24), are virtually things of the past. This is just the sort
of practice which Lautro has put enormous resources into stopping.
In April 1993 Lautro was the first 'retail' self-regulating organisations to
put into force a new and demanding training scheme, beating the others by
nearly a year.
In June 1991 we had considerably tightened up recruiting procedures and the
result today is that firms now have to take particular care to recruit only
suitable sales staff and to train them thoroughly. One result of these
measures is that the total number of sales people employed by the firms we
regulate has dropped from 200,000 in 1990 to 105,000 today, and is still
falling at a rate of about 2,500 per month.
The new training requirements demand a minimum of 6-8 weeks training for new
recruits and require a recognised test of knowledge (Financial Planning
Certificate Part 1) and a tough and objective assessment of the skills
required to give sound financial advice by trained and assessed supervisors.
By April 1993 Lautro had vetted the plans of all firms intending to recruit
sales people. Since then no salesperson should have been appointed without
satisfactorily completing a Lautro-accredited training course, and all
existing sales people were required to be assessed against the new standards
by January 1994.
The penalties for failing to meet these requirements are that sales people
trained or assessed under unsatisfactory schemes must be suspended from
business until they have satisfactorily completed an accredited training
course.
For nearly a year now Lautro has been carrying out detailed inspections of
the schemes which its member firms have put in place following approval of
their plans. So far we have completed 53 inspections. Of these, few escaped
some minor criticism and changes necessary to comply with the high standards
we have set.
Three firms have been required to retrain and reassess some sales people as
a result of defects; and three firms have had their accreditation withdrawn
and have been required to suspend all those trained under their schemes and
to submit new proposals for an acceptable scheme.
Until satisfactory proposals have been put into effect these firms will be
unable to appoint any more sales people, and until those trained and
assessed under the defective scheme have been through a Lautro-approved
process they will have been suspended too.
The assertions made about the standards in 1991 being those laid down by
Lautro are totally misleading. As explained, our scheme became effective in
1993. The sort of experience recounted by Ms Hurley, Ms Trimmer, Mr Butler
and Mr Evans was precisely that which led us to initiate work on a radical
shake up in the industry's selection and training practices back in 1990 and
it should not surprise your readers to know that not one of the Lautro
regulated firms mentioned in the article has escaped our attention.
All of them have had to undertake expensive corrective measures to deal with
sub-standard practices of one sort or another and one of them was recently
publicly reprimanded and fined.
You and your readers will no doubt be comforted to know that there is rapid
change under way and the experiences of employees and customers of the
industry of even a year ago are probably anachronistic.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Prospects in the pipeline - Nursultan
Nazarbayev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kazakhs like to point out, with a combination of pride and servility, that
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, their president, wears suits without pockets. Mr
Nazarbayev has no need for pockets: when he wants to smoke, an aide scurries
forward with a cigarette and a lighter; when it rains, another produces an
umbrella; and if he sneezes, a third is ready to produce a handkerchief. The
president, with a complete lack of self-consciousness, has a tendency to
begin sentences with the phrase 'I always tell my Kazakhs . . .'
The strong hand with which Mr Nazarbayev rules Kazakhstan - a country the
size of western Europe stretched between Russia and China - disturbs many
western political observers. He sees politically authoritarian and
economically free-market south-east Asia, rather than western Europe, as a
model for development. Western investors, weary of the anarchy in Russia's
economic and political life, do not object. They are delighted to have found
a despot with whom they can do business. Kazakhstan has already finalised an
oil and a gas deal with two consortia of western multinationals. Russia,
which has far greater oil and gas production, has been much less successful
in attracting western investment.
This contrast gives Mr Nazarbayev the opportunity to observe that 'whereas
Kazakhstan is a unitary state, in Russia all political power has collapsed,
so perhaps it is harder to do business there'.
He believes that 'based on our oil and gas reserves, we can say that in the
21st century Kazakhstan will be the world's main hydrocarbon producer'. The
businessmen patiently awaiting an audience in the plush lobby of the Hyde
Park Hotel during his visit to London this week might not go so far, but
they tend to agree that Kazakhstan is a good commercial prospect.
While Mr Nazarbayev dreams of his country becoming a central Asian Saudi
Arabia - with a South Korea-style government - he knows Kazakhstan must
first overcome formidable hurdles. Chief among them, as for all the former
Soviet republics, is the development of a workable relationship with Russia.
Kazakhstan is bound to its northern neighbour by ties of blood and miles of
pipeline. The blood runs in the veins of the ethnic Russians, who make up
more than 35 per cent of Kazakhstan's population. Aware of the potential
threat from this Russian population, Mr Nazarbayev is careful on questions
of language and culture: both Russian and Kazakh are the official languages
of the republic and both Russian and Kazakh holidays are officially
celebrated.
Despite this sensitivity, unrest among the Russians in Kazakhstan is
growing, and is finding encouragement from some quarters in Russia. Russian
nationalists - ranging from Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader
born in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian
author - believe the north-eastern corner of Kazakhstan, where Russians form
a majority, should be incorporated into the motherland. Some local Russians
agree. Mr Zhirinovsky's land claims so riled the normally diplomatic Mr
Nazarbayev that he des-cribed him as 'a little Hitler'.
Economic bonds with Russia pose a more immediate problem for Mr Nazarbayev.
Soviet centralisation means Kazakhstan has no oil refineries, and all its
pipelines lead into Russia rather than to the western markets Mr Nazarbayev
is wooing. Over the winter, this infrastructure created the paradox of
oil-rich Kazakhstan shivering in an energy crisis.
As a member of Mr Nazarbayev's delegation bitterly put it: 'We walked over
billions of barrels of oil and gas, but we nearly froze to death.'
The shortage was created by the failure of Siberian refineries to stick to
an agreement to return refined oil to Kazakhstan. Through control of the
pipelines, Russia is also demanding an equity share in the two big ventures
Kazakhstan is undertaking to exploit its oil and gas fields.
'There are certainly some political overtones here,' said Mr Nazarbayev.
'These are our growing pains. We are all just beginning to learn to treat
one another as fully independent states.'
These overtones, and Kazakhstan's realisation that Russia has the economic
muscle to drive a hard bargain, have provoked an important shift in Mr
Nazarbayev's relationship with the Kremlin.
In contrast with the leaders of more stridently independent nations, such as
Ukraine or the Baltic states, Mr Nazarbayev wanted to preserve the
connections between the former Soviet republics when the Union disintegrated
in 1991. But his dream of a partnership between equals has been displaced by
the reality of Russia's increasingly overt efforts to dominate its
neighbours; so the Kazakh leader has begun taking a different tack.
The best example is the rouble zone. Last year, Mr Nazarbayev fiercely
objected to being forced to drop the rouble by Moscow reformers, who argued
the impoverished central Asian republics were dragging Russia into
hyperinflation. Having been forced into the cold and survived, Mr Nazarbayev
is now scornful of proposals by Moscow's new leadership to recreate the
rouble zone.
'Having a common currency now that each republic has its own economy, its
own budget, its own central bank and its own legislature is just wishful
thinking,' Mr Nazarbayev said. 'What is happening now is that each state is
finding its own niche.'
For Kazakhstan, this entails breaking its dependence on Russia's oil and gas
infrastructure. Mr Nazarbayev said he would reject the Russian bid for
equity in Kazakhstan's oil and gas fields. But so long as Russia controls
the pipelines and the refineries, his words may prove empty.
That is why he spoke publicly this week about a hitherto secret project  -
Kazakhstan's plan to build a pipeline from Karachaganak, its largest gas
field in the north, direct to the west via Turkey. 'The pipeline through
Turkey is a long-term project but it is definitely one to which we will give
the highest priority,' Mr Nazarbayev said.
The dilemma he and his Kazakhs face is that, bright though their prospects
may be, today they must rely on Russia. It will be years before Kazakhstan
reaps the benefits of developing its oilfields and building pipelines direct
to the west. In the meantime, Mr Nazarbayev, the unchallenged ruler of his
own land, will have to bend in his dealings with Russia.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Framework for London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J LETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It serves neither the London boroughs' nor businesses' purpose to have
central London planned on the basis of a 35-year-old statistical convention,
the Central Statistical Area, as your report, 'London role as world city
threatened' (March 17), appears to suggest. It also does the boroughs ill
justice to claim that 'there is no agreement between them on what
constitutes the Central Activities Zone'.
In the London Planning Advisory Committee's new Strategic Planning Advice
for London, all 33 London boroughs have unanimously agreed a body of
policies for the capital as a whole. This includes a much more sophisticated
and sensitive structure for central London than the old Central Statistical
Area. It incorporates a Central Activities Zone and the Isle of Dogs Special
Business Zone to accommodate the needs of metropolitan level activities,
including offices. Where appropriate it also outlines the Wider Central Area
to sustain the surrounding vital, but more vulnerable land uses which lend
London so much character. In its Office Review Panel, it also proposes a
forum for those involved in office development to ensure office supply and
demand do not again get so badly out of kilter.
The boroughs strongly advise government to support these proposals in its
Strategic Planning Guidance for London. The capital must have the strategic
planning framework it needs to enhance its role as a world city. John Lett,

FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Economics essential part of education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs S COPPERWAITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse made several valid points in his discussion about the
state of the education system in Britain and America ('Let's think boldly
about education', March 21).
He pointed out the absurdity of the fact that, under current educational
guidelines, 'school children are required to study natural sciences but not
economics, which . . . is far more relevant for daily life'.
I totally agree, but how can we in Britain expect such a radical rethink of
priorities when our secretary of state for education is someone who has
publicly stated that religious knowledge should be compulsory for all
secondary school students? The word 'economics' never passed his lips,
probably because it never even crossed his mind.
Unfortunately, the people with the power to update and improve our education
system are still stuck in the 19th century. This is also demonstrated in the
thinking behind the vocational courses being proposed by Sir Ron Dearing,
the UK government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests. According to
your article 'Business offered role in schools' (March 21), 'the aim is to
encourage children who are less interested in academic subjects to gain
skills and stay in full-time education'.
In fact, if these courses are well thought out, they will attract a lot of
interest from a broad range of students and not just those who are 'less
interested in academic subjects'.
Most young people want to learn the skills they need to be employable. These
courses should at least provide some direction for them. At the moment they
are groping in the dark.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Whisked through the Jewel House - The Historic Royal
Palaces' mission to explain may be driven by profit but it does meet a
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Crown Jewels have been locked away in the Tower of London for over 600
years. Not the same jewels, of course: Oliver Cromwell melted down the
medieval regalia in 1649, with just one 12th century Coronation spoon
escaping the flames.
But from Charles II onwards, there has been a steady accumulation of crowns
and plate, of orbs and sceptres and rings and swords. The jewels on display
today record the triumph of the British Imperial adventure. What was lost of
medieval craftsmanship has been made good by the tribute, and loot, of
Empire.
For decades the Crown Jewels have been the pride and despair of the Tower.
They are its principal attraction and few of the 2.25m visitors a year have
given them a miss, even though it has meant queueing in the exposed wastes
of the Tower courtyards. Every few years the jewels have been moved, but
never with any lasting satisfaction. From today, however, they have a
splendid new home, built at a cost of Pounds 10m, which should see out our
generation, and more.
From one perspective the new Jewel House marks the second, and most
important, stage in the long term marketing strategy of that new commercial
enterprise, the Historic Royal Palaces; from another it is an impressive,
and most welcome, shrine for what could be regarded as the soul of the
nation made manifest in the most costly, rare, and abiding of earthly
treasures.
The millions have been spent unobtrusively, mainly on security. You enter
the stern doorway of the Waterloo Block, a 19th century barracks.
Immediately you realise you are in the grip of a system, a carefully
programmed 25 minute experience as you edge along the procession towards the
climax of the jewels. There are diversions on the way, most notably three
giant screens showing scenes from the Queen's Coronation. They are
surprisingly moving, especially as you realise that, despite the furore at
the time about an 'intrusive' televised Coronation, the actual moment of
crowning remains a mystery, the Archbishop's robes forming a protective
veil.
Historic Royal Palaces, an organisation created by the government to take
over responsibility for the upkeep of Britain's finest ancient buildings, is
in the business of painless education, and its justification for the new
Jewel House is to explain the purpose of the regalia, the ritual of
Coronation. So other rooms show film of the objects in use before they
finally come into view; first the maces, trumpets and swords, which would
head the traditional procession, then the anointing vessels and finally the
Crown Jewels themselves.
At peak times a moving pavement will be switched on, which allows an
over-brisk assessment, although there is nothing to stop you repeating the
ride, or examining the jewels from a raised gallery.
They are reassuringly awesome. Even those most sceptical about 'jewel fever'
and the lure of gold and precious stones would find it hard to be
indifferent to the largest diamond in the world, set atop the sceptre. Even
the most supercilious will speculate on the variety of the crowns - the tiny
crown of Mary of Modena; the miniscule diamond crown of Queen Victoria; the
large crown of the Queen Mother, which contains the Koh-i-Nor diamond, a
token of bad luck when worn by men, but harmless to women.
Then there is silver gilt plate by the van load, the Imperial Crown of India
and various curiosities before you reach the inevitable journey's end: the
shop. It is all rather breathless and claustrophobic, and anyone wanting to
make the most of the experience should repeat the journey. To keep the flow
moving, the jewels are not lavishly explained: for example there is no
attempt to point out the Koh-i-Nor, and unless you grab a Yeomen Warder, or
mug up well before hand, you are certain to topple out with questions
unanswered.
David Beeton, who runs Historic Royal Palaces, expects the new Jewel House
to attract an extra 250,000 visitors. The figure is bound to be higher,
despite an admission charge for the Tower raised from today to Pounds 7.95,
which includes access to everything.
With the Jewel House behind him, Beeton is turning his attention to the Big
One, the White Tower, the original Keep of London. He is using Pounds 20m
from the profits he has already harvested, mainly from the spruced up
Hampton Court, to sweeten the move of the Royal Amouries out of the Tower
and into a new museum in Leeds. He will then turn his attention to making
the White Tower customer friendly. He will want to hold on to some of its
greatest treasures, such as Henry VIII's jousting armour, but the wide open
spaces of the Tower offer wonderful opportunities for populist exploitation.
Some historical and cultural purists are horrified. They accept that Beeton
has done a good job with the jewels but they have taken against his first
enterprise at the Tower, the creation a year ago of a 'Medieval Palace' in
the 13th century buildings. They object to the replica furniture, to the
presence of attendants, medievally dressed, who attempt to explain life in
the 1270s.
But Beeton argues that no furniture of the period has survived and the
attendants are qualified historians. For the vast majority of the public,
the presence of a throne, of an adjacent oratory, of tables and fireplaces,
however conjectural, are preferable to the empty rooms and lifeless stones
of the recent past. The Tower has been knocked about for centuries and
hardly anything remains untouched by 18th and 19th century improvers. Few
visitors can imagine, unaided, the court life of Edward I.
Historic Royal Palaces' mission to explain might be in pursuit of profit but
it meets a genuine demand. The Tower of London has always been a place of
diversion, at least since it stopped being the last protective bolt hole for
the monarch in the 15th century. It was where Londoners came to marvel at
the King's weird animals, to gaze at his jewels, to consult the national
archives, to gaze at the planets from the first royal telescope, to drink in
the pubs that littered the Tower until the 19th century and, on high days,
to watch the executions.
Today's public may be more restrained - it is also predominantly foreign and
ill-informed - but there is no reason why it should not gain some enjoyment
from the hefty admission charge.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Interpreting Ashton's works - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued life of a ballet in repertory - the reasons why it should
still appeal to audiences; why it should still be worth watching on the most
rigorous critical terms; why it should not be referred to the nearest
Trading Standards office - has to do with a precious balance between style
and spontaneity. Casts must feel at ease with the intentions of the
choreography (however remote in time) and with their own powers to interpret
them.
Because Frederick Ashton's creations lie at the heart of the Royal Ballet's
identity, and because he was notoriously not interested in second or third
(or 33rd) casts, his works are particularly subject to performance by rote,
and all that implies of 'This is what Sir Fred wanted, and this is the way
you must dance it'. There has resulted a paralysis in Ashtonian
interpretation, doctrinally rigid - the letter killing, the spirit absent.
So Cinderella's Ugly Sisters, still played as debased copies of Ashton's and
Helpmann's originals, are now a serious deterrent to watching the piece. So,
a revival of Symphonic Variations in Birmingham looked as if its cast wore
strait-jackets rather than Fedorovich's tunics, and were terrified to be
themselves. So, on Wednesday night, A Month in the Country and The Dream as
part of a triple bill, were, respectively, how and how not to dance Ashton.
The Dream lacked any lightness or clarity and, especially, that sexual
pungency which must make the last pas de deux so real an image of Titania
and Oberon's love. The Puck was leaden; the quartet of lovers were as
time-worn as their predictable antics; the midsummer magic was autumnal, the
wit doughy. William Trevitt was an Oberon of promise, and deserved a better
setting; so did Luke Heydon as a gleefully simple Bottom. It is time for The
Dream to be reconsidered; the lustre has gone.
Though I had little sympathy for some of the subsidiary casting in A Month
in the Country - performances showed the spontaneity of a 'speak your
weight' machine - the ballet was admirably Ashton's. That it was so I
attribute to developments in both Sylvie Guillem's and Bruce Sansom's
interpretations. Mlle Guillem now looks at ease as Natalya. The caprices of
a bored woman trapped in her summer dacha; the last flare of romantic
feeling as she yields to Belyayev; the sense of affection, of guilt and of
ungovernable jealousy that mark her relationship with Vera, were sensitively
shown, and the dance gleamed.
Mr Sansom, who has seemed too perennially boyish for Belyayev, has gained in
emotional weight and technical authority. The role is beautifully danced -
line, dynamics impeccable - and sure in its sensitivity to Vera's calf-love
and its boldness when confronted with Natalya's passion.
The other pleasure of the evening was Sarah Wildor's debut as Vera. The
dancing, as we have come to expect from this gifted young artist, was lovely
in its bright, true accents, its sweetness of outline. It was essentially
Ashtonian. Her reading of the character - a first infatuation that tells of
troubling depths - was ideal. The ballet was alive.
The bill was completed by David Bintley's recent Tombeaux. It offers
excellent costumes for the women (Jasper Conran's black and amethyst tutus
are a joy) and men in black long-johns that make them look like gymnasts in
a frenzy of mourning.
The dance chatters vivaciously and keeps a mixed bag of Royal Ballet girls
on the hop. Viviana Durante appears as an elegant creature in devore velvet
and makes a great deal of the duets that are the best things in the piece;
Bruce Sansom whips about the stage, expending quantities of classic style on
some arduous evolutions. It is too garrulous for my taste - party chat as
art.
The programme is repeated tomorrow, matinee and evening.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Maxwell Davies and the RPO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The desire to be seen to support new music has prompted various British
orchestras to offer house room to composers-in-residence. How far this will
work to the composers' advantage is not yet clear, but the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra is showing signs of taking its responsibility
seriously.
As from last season, it has had Peter Maxwell Davies as its Associate
Conductor/Composer. With an eye to the future the orchestra has already
commissioned from him a Sixth Symphony (even though he has not yet finished
his Fifth) and has started to schedule existing works in its concerts.
Usually 20th-century pieces are sprinkled among the popular classics, but on
Wednesday the RPO was more ambitious and presented an entire concert of
Maxwell Davies.
Later this year he will be 60, which could be the occasion to look back over
his changing interests. From being a composer impelled to write by the
creative urge within, he has matured into one whose music seems guided as
much by external factors, such as the specific requirements of commissions.
In Wednesday's programme there were two main works, one early, one late.
Although the Second Fantasia on John Taverner's 'In nomine' is built on a
Tudor foundation, it is a wholly 20th-century piece of musical architecture
with its angular themes, its complex structure, its abstract form of
expression. The orchestra is large, but used sparingly in the Mahlerian
manner. At 40 minutes the work tests an audience's concentration, for as the
composer remarked, it demands much of players and listeners alike. The RPO
sounded tentative in it.
The Strathclyde Concerto No 4 for clarinet (1990) is one of ten in an
ongoing project. Instigated by Strathclyde Regional Council, it shows us a
different Maxwell Davies, working in a relatively approachable neo-classical
style. The Clarinet Concerto is a very polished example of concerto writing.
It has plenty of virtuoso passages for the soloist and makes good use of
traditional features such as the cadenza, but is always music of substance,
not empty note-spinning. Dimitri Ashkenazy caught its sensitive, sombre mood
nicely.
To end Maxwell Davies conducted An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, a Boston
Pops commission. The vigorous Highland flings, a tipsy violin solo, raucous
brass guests and bagpipes at dawn, all make this a vivid showpiece, which
the RPO might consider using more widely. Responsibility and fun can
usefully be combined there.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Glyn and 'It' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nonsensical, faulty in construction and ungrammatical is the sniffy verdict
of Chambers Biographical Dictionary on the writing of Elinor Glyn. Despite
these ideal qualifications for journalism, she poured her talents into
novels and, briefly in the 1920s, writing and directing films.
Ken Hoare's new play focuses on her meeting with Clara Bow, whom Glyn
famously dubbed 'the 'It' girl' - 'it' and 'oomph' being a more reticent
age's identification of sex-appeal. Glyn and 'It' rings imaginary
wisecracking variations on the theme of patrician Englishness meeting
American crudeness and liking it. It is principally a vehicle for Penelope
Keith's Elinor Glyn.
As the curtain rises, she is revealed reclining on the inevitable
tiger-skin. Tim Goodchild's fantasy set combines Syrie Maugham's all-white
decor with a dash of Kiplingesque exoticism. Fantasy is the operative word:
Ken Hoare's previous work includes material for the comic Stanley Baxter,
and award-winning sitcoms. His first stage work emerges as a cross between
Kaufman and Hart's Hollywood satire Once in a Lifetime and a putative Carry
On Keystone, with more emphasis on the passing gag than dramatic
construction.
The undeveloped plot hinges on Clara Bow's flight from unwelcome publicity
after a spurned boyfriend shoots himself. The young man's father is a
hellfire evangelist ready to denounce the whore of Babylon unless bought
off. Meanwhile the British author and the American sexpot collaborate on a
film-script, a relationship that ripens into mutual respect and affection,
almost sabotaged by Madam Glyn's stuffy English butler.
This might fill a bright weekly half-hour slot in the summer schedules.
Taken in one insubstantial helping, the writing betrays its sitcom pedigree.
Some lines somewhat laboriously hit the target, as 'Sin in Hollywood is the
equivalent of education in England: it's there for the few who want it.'
Some fall thuddingly short as in the exchange, 'Couldn't I interest you with
a little cinnamon toast?' 'You couldn't interest me with the dance of the
seven veils.'
More importantly, the author vacillates in his portrayal of Glyn,
alternating between the gushingly precious, lost in self-love, and the
shrewdly warm-hearted worldly-wise. Miss Keith confines herself to the
upper-class cooing and whooping that she has amusingly deployed for 20-odd
years, prunes and prisms all over the stage; but, as with riding a bicycle,
when she starts to think about how she does it, uncertainty results. In Act
2, the accent is strained and fractured, for a terrible moment evoking the
awesome sound of genteel Australian.
In the supporting cast of Richard Cottrell's production, Michael Cochrane
struggles with a stereotype butler, and Samantha Spyro effectively turns
Clara Bow into a chirpy transatlantic Barbara Windsor.
At Richmond Theatre until tomorrow; then on tour.

BBC1 is claiming that Tomorrow's World will undertake 'the biggest
experiment in the world' (7.30). As part of British Science Week viewers
will be asked to participate via telephone in deciding whether people tell
lies more convincingly on camera than on radio or in print. Is there any
conceivable value in this beyond a ratings-winning gimmick? The programme
makers seem chiefly preoccupied with providing sufficient telephone lines.
Perhaps it was just that Friday night feeling, but last week's opening
episode in ITV's new comedy, Time After Time, had me rolling around the old
green sofa in mirth. There is nothing 'alternative' or even very original
here. Car thief Kenny has come out of jail determined to go straight, but
his criminal family and friends either refuse to believe him or, like his
mother, feel deeply ashamed at this rejection of ancient family traditions
(8.30).

FT  25 MAR 94 / Management: Dissent in the measurement ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Drucker believes the next big wave in management, after process
re-engineering, will be measurement. For once the great prophet seems to be
behind the times. Evidence that the boom has already arrived is everywhere:
in the fashion for 'benchmarking' and other total-quality measures that have
been growing for almost a decade; in the more recent take-off of
activity-based costing (ABC); in the search for balanced score cards of
physical as well as financial measures; and in the growing popularity of
performance measurement - the translation of business objectives into
detailed measures of departments, teams and individuals.
The twin reasons for all this activity are self-evident. First,
organisations of all kinds are under enormous pressure to improve
performance and that of their constituent parts: businesses, processes,
departments, teams and individuals. Second, the falling cost of information
technology allows a range of measurements to be made relatively cheaply.
This all creates a rich hunting ground for accountants and other
consultants. But is it altogether healthy for their client organisations?
What should organisations measure? How often, and in how much detail? Is
Harvard's Robert Kaplan, the great evangelist for ABC and balanced score
cards, right that 'what you measure is what you get'?
Both sides of the argument have been put persuasively in the past few weeks.
Peter Chadwick, a continuous improvement consultancy operating in Britain,
France and Germany, published a study of 300 companies in those countries
which concluded that 75 per cent have management systems that do not monitor
and control productivity accurately. Only six out of 10 companies set
performance targets for all or most of their departments, with a much lower
rate (40 per cent) in France than in Britain and Germany (75 per cent).
While 80 per cent of companies claimed to monitor customer satisfaction,
barely 20 per cent made this information available below middle management.
Moreover, the quality performance measures used by most respondents focused
too late in the cycle: on customer complaints and returns, rather than on
measures within the workplace, such as 'first-time yield' and product or
service lead times. These would avoid such problems arising in the first
place.
The consultancy also complained that only 20 per cent of companies measured
performance using 'short-interval (hourly) controls, which in many cases
provide the frequency required to measure performance targets effectively'.
The consultancy concluded that: 'If it matters, measure it.'
A similar line of argument was expressed last month by one of Britain's most
experienced senior personnel managers, Mike Haffenden, who has just left
Hewlett-Packard.
Speaking at a conference on change management, Haffenden said organisations
should measure regularly the performance of all their key processes, from
on-time delivery to change management itself. His only evident scepticism
towards measurement - what HP and other American companies call 'metrics' -
was in the appraisal of individuals' performance, where he claimed never to
have seen a job evaluation or performance appraisal scheme that was really
worth the effort.
A much stronger dissenting voice was heard at the same conference from a
surprising quarter: David Pascall, head of British Petroleum's 'culture
change' review team in 1989-90 and until a year ago chairman of the National
Curriculum Council, the predecessor body for the authority that is now
responsible for testing schoolchildren in England and Wales. He is now
finance director of part of MAI, a financial, media and information
conglomerate.
Organisations should be wary of joining the 'if it moves, measure it'
bandwagon, Pascall warned. If, during a change process, people feel their
behaviour is being measured at every opportunity, he said, 'they'll feel
inhibited. You shouldn't evaluate every aspect of every team's performance
in every process'. Instead, he advised organisations to follow BP's lead in
removing all sorts of checks and balances, and then 'seeing if people
deliver'.
As chairman of the NCC, Pascall complained that the UK government, in its
enthusiasm for schoolroom measures of all kinds, had made them too
complicated. It was unnecessary to test every child in every subject in the
same way at the same stage, he argued. His advocacy has helped simplify the
methods, frequency and intensity with which schoolchildren will be tested
from now on.
A similar drive is needed in the business world if it is to avoid drowning
in a sea of quantitative and qualitative measurements. This point was made
eloquently last week by, of all people, a partner from a big accounting
firm.
Speaking at a Royal Society of Arts conference on 'Tomorrow's Company' - a
campaign which advocates, among other things, the introduction of much
broader business measures - Peter Ward of Coopers &amp; Lybrand warned against
making the already complex subject of corporate measurement even more
complicated by 'seeking spurious accuracy through too many measures'.
What is needed, he suggested, is a much broader but more flexible range of
indicators to measure the corporate equivalent of body temperature and blood
pressure.
Ward did not confront the thorny question of whether and how to amend the
old accountancy maxim that all relevant measures should be compressed on to
a single sheet of A4 paper. As in schools, every effort must be made to
avoid measuring the performance of every limb and artery so often that the
body hardly has the time or motivation to function.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Management: Imagine all the people - Mercury's strategic
rethink has become a rallying point for its 10,500 employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications used to be about plain old telephones - providing enough
of them, making sure they worked, and installing the latest network gadgets
to upgrade the connections. Only one organisation did the job in the UK:
British Telecommunications - the Post Office as was.
Little has changed, surprising as it may seem given all the current hype.
Most people still use the telephone line to speak to someone, not to indulge
in multimedia wizardry. And after 10 years of supposed competition, the
overwhelming majority of people in the UK still subscribe to BT for the
service.
So what has the competition been up to? A decade ago Mercury, BT's main
rival, set out to be 'BT Mark II'. It built a national network from scratch;
it boasts a powerful brand name, courtesy of Harry Enfield; and it has had
considerable success creaming off business from BT in the City of London.
Beyond the City, however, its impact has been patchy. Mercury has only
780,000 residential customers to match BT's 20m. And its ability to continue
guaranteeing percentage price savings over BT is bound to come into question
as BT's costs and prices tumble.
Time for a strategy rethink, perhaps? Mercury itself thinks so, but Mike
Harris, the company's youthful chief executive, is going about it in a
highly unconventional way. His rethink is engaging all 10,500 Mercury
employees in a giant reorientation exercise called 'Imagine 1997'.
The idea is simple: Mercury needs to banish the BT Mark II spectre, create a
new vision of where it wants to be in three years time, and get there. The
key to the exercise is that it should be everyone's vision, not just Mike
Harris's. As Peter Roche, head of the independent San Francisco-based
consultancy masterminding 'Imagine', puts it: 'Everyone needs to be able to
create the vision for themselves if it is to succeed.'
'The' vision, note - not 'their vision'. No one pretends that Mercury can
afford 10,500 different visions, or that 'the' vision would have sprung like
a genie from their collective imaginations. Harris and his executive team
had the vision last year; 'Imagine 1997' is to make everyone else think it
was their idea too. The French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau talked,
chillingly, of 'forcing people to be free'; 'Imagine' is a more benign
version of freedom forcing.
Roche has plenty more slick phrases to describe 'Imagine'. Mercury needs a
new 'strategic intent' to replace BT Mark II; now that it has got one, it is
in a 'moment of discontinuity' requiring 'continuous change'; that means
'working backwards from the future', engaging employees in a 'network of
conversations', of which 'Imagine seminars' are the most important.
The status quo is not an option: 'If they work more, longer, harder, better
at what they are doing now, they won't realise their objectives.'
None of which is particularly new: W. Edwards Deming's celebrated '14 points
for Management' long ago paraded the proposition 'that everyone in a company
must be put to work to accomplish a firm's transformation'.
Whatever Mercury's employees think of all that, they find the 'Imagine'
seminars rewarding. Senior staff attend a three-day 'Imagine 1997' seminar,
the rest a one-day seminar. The purpose of the seminars is partly to
'imagine' the Mercury of the future, partly to present its leaders as more
approachable and open to suggestions than employees had previously imagined.
This last aspect appeals particularly strongly. The average age of the
company's employees is only 33: Harris is 45, looks younger, and has the
perfect bedside manner. He has thrown vast amounts of his own time into the
process: about a fifth of his diary has been blocked out for 'Imagine'
activities over the past year, much of it leading seminars. Every six weeks
he calls together his most senior 150 managers to review progress.
Harris's attitude is a refreshing change for an industry mostly led by
lifelong engineers or telecoms bureaucrats reared in the monopolistic
culture. He made his name setting up First Direct, the telephone bank, and
views telecoms like any other consumer industry. 'I can't see a single
difference between marketing a bank and marketing a telecoms company,' he
says.
'This is an extraordinarily lively place anyway,' he is quick to add.
'Unlike banks, which have traditions going back a hundred years, we are
still young and flexible.'
But what does Harris imagine will set Mercury apart from BT by 1997?
Distilled, the new vision amounts to a series of slogans: 'taking a
leadership position in the industry as it emerges in 1997'; 'multimedia',
'open networks', 'intelligent services' - 'differentiation on services not
just price'.
As Mercury put it to the House of Commons trade and industry committee
earlier this week: 'Our strategy is to lead the UK development of the
multimedia industry.'
Since BT mouths identical slogans and objectives, 'Imagine' is hardly an
escape from BT Mark II. Harris insists, however, that the process has
generated a fierce determination to be free of BT's shackles, one result of
which is an ambitious project to build radio local networks for fixed
phones. If they work at the required quality - a big 'if' - Mercury will be
able to deliver its calls by-passing BT entirely.
BT Mark II or not, it does not undercut the value of 'Imagine' as a tool for
employee motivation. For remember Roche's definition of power: the velocity
with which you realise your intentions.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Property: All Property Return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Returns improved in all commercial property sectors in February, pushing the
All Property Return up by more than half a point to 2.6 per cent, according
to the Investment Property Databank, a research group, writes Vanessa
Houlder.
Capital growth increased to 1.9 per cent and was notable in the industrial
sector where the rate of growth nearly doubled to 2.3 per cent. Yields
shortened in all sectors bringing the All Property initial yield to 8.2 per
cent and the equivalent yield to 8.7 per cent.
The rate of cumulative net investment in the IPD Index Funds in the month
rose to its highest recorded level of nearly Pounds 100m. Over the past five
months, more than Pounds 400m has been invested in the funds, providing what
IPD describes as 'hard evidence of the most dramatic shift in strategy on
record'.
Retail rental growth stabilised in February, turning positive for the first
time since September 1991. The All Property rental growth rate was unchanged
from the previous month at -0.3 per cent, as office rental growth slowed to
 0.7 per cent from -0.6 per cent in January.
The All Property growth rate over 12 months to February was -6.8 per cent,
against -7.4 per cent for the year to January. Industrial property performed
best in February with a return of 3.1 per cent. Retail property fell to
second place with a total return of 2.5 per cent, followed by offices with
2.3 per cent. Retail property recorded a total return of 22.3 per cent for
the year to February, followed by industrials with a 20.6 per cent and
offices with a 20.3 per cent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Property: Developers risk dabbling - A look at reasons for
the recent increase in speculative development activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of speculative developers to the property market is possibly the
most remarkable factor in the turnaround in sentiment towards property over
the past year.
Their emergence, albeit in small numbers, is happening at a faster pace than
seemed possible a year ago, when the market was preoccupied by falling
rents, a glut of surplus properties and a dearth of development finance.
But how robust are the prospects for this development cycle? Will it be
enfeebled by weak tenant demand and the reluctance of the banks to lend to
developers? Or is there a possibility that the upturn in development
activity will be sufficiently marked to depress the recovery in rental
values on which it is founded?
The foundations for recovery are beginning to fall into place. Sites are
readily available, often with planning permission. Construction costs are
low, financing costs have fallen and funds are available from a small but
growing number of property companies and investment institutions.
And although tenant demand is still patchy, rents are in many cases
stabilising.
It is no wonder that developers are dusting off the planning permissions
that they shelved during the downturn. There is a strong incentive to be the
first into the market - limited competition on the completion of property.
'We are going to be there with the first wave of development and then let
others fight it out,' says Mr Michael Slade of Helical Bar, a property
company which has a Pounds 100m programme of speculative developments in
Cardiff, Theale, Edinburgh, Leeds, Guildford and Cambridge.
Helical Bar is not alone. Argent, a property company, is starting a
speculative office scheme in June at Brindley Place in Birmingham, which is
a 17-acre site with consent for more than 1m sq ft of office, retail and
leisure space.
In central London, Great Portland Estates has started work on a 100,000 sq
ft office scheme in Great Portland Street. British Land has started work on
180,000 sq ft in the City, and AMP and Arcona are refurbishing in Pall Mall.
In the City, Lord Palumbo has teamed up with Dieter Bock to develop Number
One, Poultry, situated by the Bank of England.
In the retail sector, the development of retail warehouses is proceeding at
a cracking pace. Demand is strong for warehouses and because they are
traditionally pre-let to tenants the supply of available space is
restricted. About 4m sq ft of floorspace is currently under construction.
In the shopping centre market, Prudential, the insurance company, and JT
Baylis, a Bristol developer, are due to begin work later this year on the
650,000 sq ft regional shopping centre at Cribbs Causeway, near Bristol.
Imry Group plans to begin work on the early phases of its Esplanade shopping
centre in Southampton later this year.
Admittedly, these are the exceptions, rather than the rule. And the increase
in development activity is taking place from an extremely low base.
In the office market, for example, completions in 1993 totalled 4.2m sq ft,
less than half of the 9.1m sq ft completed in 1992.
According to Hillier Parker, shopping centre development has dipped to its
lowest level since 1965. The amount of floorspace which is at present under
construction fell from 19.32m sq ft to 1.89m sq ft between March 1990 and
December 1993.
Caution about the strength of economic recovery is holding back many
would-be developers unless they can secure a letting from a tenant before
construction begins.
Mr Stuart Robinson of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, says: 'There is
still a question mark over tenant demand in many areas. Rents have not got
to the point where people are confident about development.'
The difficulty of raising bank finance also accounts for developers putting
projects on hold. Almost all the banks involved in financing the large
upturn in construction activities in the late 1980s are now absent from the
market. 'It is still almost impossible to fund a speculative transaction
with a bank,' says Mr Slade.
That said, other sources of funds have increasingly become available. Large
property companies are flush with funds after a spate of rights issues.
The institutions, which have increased their allocations to the property
sector, have found it difficult to secure sufficiently well built properties
which meet their specific needs.
Most institutions prefer to limit their risk by funding pre-let
developments. But there are about 20 institutions prepared to discuss the
funding of speculative developments. In such cases, however, the risk of
construction cost overruns and guaranteeing the rent would be typically left
to the developer.
The question remains whether developers are right to risk embarking on
development while tenant demand is so low, economic prospects are uncertain
and there still exists a surplus of available buildings.
The case for starting on development before tenant demand is evident is
based on the length of the gestation period for building projects, that is
planning and design to constructing, fitting out, completion and occupation,
which typically takes three years. 'You have to be there in advance of
tenant demand,' says Mr Slade.
At present, development activity is sufficiently low to limit the degree of
oversupply building up again. But if the market continues to heat up, there
is some concern that too many buildings may come on stream.
'There is a danger that institutions which are anxious to get funds into the
property market will create overcapacity and develop rather sooner than we
would like,' says Mr David Hunter of Scottish Amicable.
The institutions have reason to be cautious: they have made mistakes before.
At the end of the 1970s, they financed a surge in construction which came on
stream as the economy plunged into recession, setting back real rental
growth for another five years.

   By ANDREW FISHER

<TEXT>
To enthusiasts of the latest technology, it is an exciting portent. To those
dismayed by the prospect of homes swamped by myriad television programmes,
it is a nightmare.
Either way, information superhighways promise dramatic changes in work and
leisure habits. Using fibre amplifiers containing erbium (a rare earth),
laboratory demonstrations have shown that as many as 400 TV channels from
one studio could be transmitted to 40m subscribers in a 500km radius.
Now, a consortium involving the UK's Southampton University, whose
Optoelectronics Research Centre invented the erbium fibre amplifier, has
been set up to develop 'loss-less splitters' on optical chips intended to
make such huge distribution networks much more commercially attractive by
reducing the need for transmission power.
A loss-less splitter takes an incoming signal from an optical fibre and
divides it between multiple output fibres, but maintains signal strength by
boosting the power with an optical amplifier. The consortium, funded by the
European Union's RACE programme (research and development of advanced
communications in Europe) aims to produce optical amplifiers not in optical
fibres but using specially cut glass slices in which optical circuits are
embedded, rather like silicon chips for electronics.
Optical glass slices measure a few centimetres and contain optical waveguide
circuits (finer than human hair) and components instead of transistors. They
are hard to construct but are likely to play an essential part in the new
information infrastructures that a number of countries are planning.
Other members of the consortium are Corning France, AT&amp;T Network Systems
Netherlands, and the R&amp;D centre of the German postal and telecommunications
network.

FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Sir Michael Angus to chair Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread and president of the CBI, is to
take over as chairman of retailing and pharmaceuticals group Boots from
July, in what analysts see as a highly significant appointment. There was
speculation yesterday that he was being appointed to take some tough
decisions at Boots - especially regarding the future of its pharmaceuticals
business.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive since 1987 and architect of the acquisition
of Ward White and reorganisation of Boots group into separate business
units, is being given the additional, and new, role, of deputy chairman. The
announcement prompted speculation that he is being groomed eventually to
succeed Sir Michael (right) as chairman.
Sir Michael, 63, is appointed a non-executive director with immediate effect
and will replace present chairman Sir Christopher Benson after the annual
meeting on July 24. Sir Christopher, chairman of Sun Alliance and Costain as
well as The Housing Corporation and The Funding Agency for Schools, has been
chairman since 1990 but has taken a low profile during the past year. He was
criticised for his handling of the group's annual meeting last year, which
was disrupted by animal rights protesters.
The more pugnacious Sir Michael, described by a former colleague as a
'tough, blunt businessman', spent much of his career with Unilever, after
service with the RAF and a degree at Bristol University.
After a spell as chairman and chief executive of Unilever US, during which
he restructured the US business, he was group chairman from 1986 to 1992. He
was credited with waking up a sleepy company, shedding some businesses and
refocusing the group on its core activities.
He has performed a similar task at Whitbread since 1992. He has also served
as CBI president since 1992, forming an effective partnership with
director-general Howard Davies.
In addition to his capacity for taking tough decisions, Sir Michael's
political influence and international experience are seen as assets to
Boots, particularly as it seeks to expand its over-the-counter drugs
business, Boots Healthcare International, overseas.
'The appointment of Sir Michael is quite a coup for us,' admits Boots. 'He
is highly-regarded and wields considerable influence.'

Watson &amp; Philip, the Scottish-based retail and wholesale food group, has
appointed a new chairman, James Watson, who replaces the late Ian
Macpherson.
Watson &amp; Philip's chief executive, David Bremner, says that he prefers to
describe Watson's role as part-time rather than non-executive, 'as he will
be spending 50-ish days a year with the company, far more than one would
expect from a non-executive chairman. Watson will be much more than a
figurehead, which a non-executive title might imply.'
Watson remains chairman of NFC; he is also chairman of the Institute of
Management. Bremner says that Watson has no family ties with the business -
the shared name 'is purely coincidental'.

The latest fitness machine to hit Europe from the US is Walkfit, a
non-motorised treadmill with a built-in upper body exerciser.
It has been developed by NordicTrack, the Chaska, Minneapolis-based company
famous for its indoor skiing machines. NordicTrack claims that Walkfit burns
up 70 per cent more calories than a motorised treadmill because the user
provides all the required energy. The Walkfit incorporates two free-moving
bars to be grasped while walking or running, so exercising the upper body.

A microscopic parasitic worm known as the nematode has been plaguing crops
all over the world. But a Central American tree is providing a new way to
fight it.
Nematodes attack many crops. In some cases they can be combated with
existing synthetic solutions. However, these are too toxic for plantation
crops, such as bananas.
The new treatment, DMDP, has been developed by the Royal Botanical Gardens
at Kew and the Scottish Crop Research institute, from the seeds and leaves
of a Costa Rican tree. It is potentially far less toxic than synthetic
treatments.
DMDP is being further developed by Inbio, a Costa Rican conservation
organisation, based in Heredia, which is using aerial photographs from Nasa
to identify donor trees.

The human ear is at the centre of the latest system designed to combat
credit card fraud, writes Anna Kochan.
The shape, size and contours of the ear are as individual as the
fingerprint, says Rouen-based inventor Patrick Macron. The personal identity
system he has developed is based on a smart card (which stores data about
the shape of the ear on a built-in chip) and a telephone with a miniature
video camera, sensors and electronics built into the earpiece.
Macron envisages cash dispensers of the future being equipped with these
telephones. Customers will put their smart card into the dispenser while
holding the telephone to their ear. The dispenser will compare the telephone
'image' to the details stored on the card, and customers will be cleared to
proceed - or not - within about four seconds.

The government's first regional director for London is to be Robin Young,
the civil servant who has headed the Local Government directorate in the
Department of the Environment since 1992.
Young, 45, will spearhead the government's attempts to improve the
administration of London in the absence of an elected body for the capital.
From April 11, he will head the new single London office which brings
together the regional offices of the departments of Trade &amp; Industry,
Transport, Employment and Environment.
Like the other nine regional directors, Young will be responsible for
funnelling funds from these departments to the London region. He will also
control London's share of the single regional budget, a pot of Pounds 1.4bn
provided by the four departments which local authorities, Training and
Enterprise Councils and other local partnerships will be invited to bid for.
The London directorship will be at grade 2 (deputy secretary) level, in
recognition of the importance of the post in implementing the Conservatives'
election pledge to improve the co-ordination of government policy in London.
Young joined the civil service in 1973 after education at Fettes College,
Edinburgh, and University College, Oxford.
He served as principal private secretary to three Environment secretaries
between 1985 and 1988. In 1988, he was promoted to grade 3 (under secretary)
with responsibility for policy on private sector housing and housing
associations. He headed the environmental policy directorate 1989-91 and was
responsible for preparing Chris Patten's white paper This Common
Inheritance.
He can be expected to provide forthright leadership for the new London
Office: ministers have not always been happy with the high profile he has
taken at the DoE.

<TEXT>
Devising a railway timetable is the art of slotting trains into routes with
minutes to spare. Railtrack, the company which takes over responsibility for
British Rail timetabling on April 1, appears to have been honing its skills
in the field of board appointments.
With less than two weeks to go before Railtrack goes 'live', the company has
finally announced that it has found a finance director. Norman Broadhurst,
at present deputy chief executive and finance director of shipbuilding and
engineering group VSEL, has been appointed.
Broadhurst, 52, (below) will join Railtrack full-time on July 1. He has
already started reading himself into his new job but is required at VSEL for
some time yet to complete their annual accounts.
After spending part of his early career with accountants Price Waterhouse,
Broadhurst devoted the next 13 years to Platt Saco Lowell, a manufacturer of
textile machinery and part of the ill-fated Stone Platt Industries.
He subsequently moved to China Light and Power, a Hong Kong public utility,
and then, in 1986 became financial director of United Engineering Steels. In
1990 he went to VSEL which had been privatised from British Shipbuilders
four years earlier. Broadhurst says that the common feature of his two most
recent jobs was that they involved newly formed companies attempting to
establish themselves in their respective markets: 'I am used to getting in
at the grass roots,' he says.
Railtrack, which will take over BR track, signalling and stations valued at
Pounds 6.5bn, will provide an opportunity to put those skills to the test.
Melvin Pointer is moving from NFC to become group treasurer of Railtrack,
and at VSEL, Rob Holden, currently group financial controller, will become
acting finance director when Broadhurst moves.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Technology: A spy looks down - A look at a satellite
designed to watch for signs of nations assembling nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As international arms control negotiators continue a frustrating diplomatic
struggle with North Korea over access to facilities that they suspect may be
part of a secret nuclear weapons programme, US intelligence agencies are
focusing on a military satellite orbiting far above the Korean peninsula.
The satellite is keeping tabs on a 5MW nuclear reactor near the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang. As long as the satellite continues to detect heat from
the reactor, US officials can be relatively confident that North Korea is
not in the process of building a bomb: it would need to shut down the
reactor before it could extract waste fuel and process it to make plutonium
for a nuclear weapon.
But if the satellite detects any significant cooling - the first sign of a
shutdown - all bets are off. Korea could have a working weapon within
months, and the time for diplomacy will have passed.
If a major US research programme quietly launched over the past two years is
successful, this satellite may be joined by many others keeping similar
vigils - an entirely new generation of remote-sensing orbiters, all watching
for signs of some nation trying to assemble a nuclear arsenal.
Scientists in the programmes say such satellites will never totally replace
ground inspections and traditional intelligence for spotting nuclear outlaws
in the making. But the lessons of the 1991 face-off with Iraq are still
fresh in the minds of non-proliferation specialists: Iraq kept international
monitors at bay for months, and when the inspectors did get in they found
Iraq's nuclear programme was far more advanced than they had suspected.
The appeal of satellite monitoring is that it provide a means of detecting
the signs of nuclear proliferation without the diplomatic brinkmanship and
face-offs that plague traditional inspections.
At US government laboratories in New Mexico and Livermore, California,
researchers who were once designing Star Wars satellites to shoot down
nuclear-tipped enemy missiles are now working to see that these nuclear
warheads are never built at all. Their new project is a space shield of a
different sort: a nuclear proliferation-sensing network of surveillance
satellites.
The early warning technologies they will carry go far beyond the cameras and
simple sensors of most current remote-sensing orbiters. In one part of the
programme, which is expected to cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) a year by
1995, researchers are developing multi-spectral sensors that could spot
anything from chemical residue released during plutonium reprocessing to the
distinctive heat signature of a nuclear reactor in a weapons material
production cycle - even before the nuclear material is removed.
Meanwhile, other researchers are looking at the possibility of detecting
even more subtle warning signs, such as the electromagnetic signals emitted
by isotope-separating centrifuges and the characteristic vegetation damage
near tanks storing waste from weapons production.
The details of which signatures the researchers are focusing on and how they
will achieve the needed sensitivity are secret. 'The real concern is that if
you show your hand, there may be counter-measures that make your job
harder,' says Robert Scarlett, who manages the proliferation detection
programme at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico.
First in operation will be a technology that has its roots in sensors
carried aboard secret satellites used since the 1970s to spot nuclear tests.
In 1995, the US Department of Energy plans to launch a satellite known as
Forte, for Fast On-board Recording of Transients Experiment. The satellite
is designed to use on-board electronics to distinguish between the
electromagnetic signature of lightning and that of a nuclear explosion.
Lightning has been the source of false alarms in the past, says Max Koontz,
the department's programme manager.
A year later, the US plans to launch the first of a new generation of
proliferation-sensing satellites that may be able to spot nuclear signs even
earlier. The Dollars 70m Multi-Spectral Thermal Imager should be able to
detect heat fluctuations from reactor cooling towers and waste water, even
through clouds.
In an initial test, researchers on the ground will directly measure heat
output at the Savannah River weapons production facility in Tennessee, which
has several nuclear reactors that can produce weapons materials; at the same
time, the satellite will measure the same thermal emissions from space.
Comparing the 'ground truth' with the space readings will allow the
researchers to gauge the sensitivity of space detection and calibrate the
sensors.
Later, the Los Alamos group hopes to design and fly other multi-spectral
sensors which will attempt to use techniques similar to those of their
brethren in environmental remote sensing to detect vegetation changes around
nuclear processing plants. Uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing
yield large amounts of chemical waste, including organic compounds, acids
and fluorine.
Laboratory scientists say satellites could spot characteristic 'kill zones'
around waste holding tanks, where chemicals associated with nuclear
processing have contaminated the soil or ground water and killed vegetation.
Other teams are hoping to use laser beams to probe gaseous emissions from
suspected bomb factories, looking for unique reflections and absorptions
that might indicate the presence of tell-tale weapons production
by-products.
Even the optimists in the programme expect that it will be more than a
decade before any of the new proliferation-sensing technologies are actually
in use. 'The further we get into this, the harder we realise it is,' says
David Dye, leader of the Lawrence Livermore laboratory's intelligence and
national security technologies programme.
But with half a dozen nations threatening to join the nuclear fraternity,
there are plenty of reasons to find better ways to spot the early signs of
proliferation. No one expects satellites entirely to replace ground-based
sensing and actual inspections. But while North Korea continues to play
cat-and-mouse over on-site inspections, Washington policymakers are finding
the prospect of space detection - in spite of its technical complexity -
hard to resist.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Export order books strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK manufacturers' export order books are close to their best level for
almost four years, but low total orders point to weakening domestic demand,
the Confederation of British Industry says in its March survey of industrial
trends today.
But manufacturers expect output to maintain a firmly upward trend over the
next four months and inflationary pressures to remain subdued. The survey
says export order books have improved over the last month. With 22 per cent
of manufacturers saying that export order books are above normal and 28 per
cent describing them as below normal, the negative balance of 6 per cent is
close to the best recorded since June 1990.
Total order books are described as above normal by 17 per cent of companies
and below normal by 30 per cent, a negative balance of 13 per cent, a slight
deterioration since last month - suggesting that domestic demand for UK
manufactured goods may be slackening ahead of April's tax increases.
But the CBI says the trend has improved markedly since March last year, when
there was a negative balance of 27 per cent. Together with February's
balance, overall demand is at its best level since December 1989.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Builders' imports 'rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imports of building materials are starting to rise as construction output
increases, a survey of more than 100 material producers says today.
The Council of Building Material Producers' survey echoes government
concerns over Britain's building material trade deficit which ministers say
remains too high in spite of a sharp decline in construction output in the
recession.
The council says that more than a third of building material producers
questioned said imports accounted for more than 10 per cent of domestic
market sales.
This compared with 28 per cent of companies in September and 20 per cent in
February 1993, making it the third consecutive survey to report an increase
in import penetration, the council says. It was accompanied by a slow thaw
in the UK construction market with 87 per cent of companies expecting to
increase output during this year.
Exports, which had increased during the domestic recession, are being
maintained but are no longer rising because of a downturn in continental
European markets. By comparison UK construction activity is forecast to rise
by up to 2 per cent this year.
At the end of last year a task force of construction customers, contractors
and producers was established by the industry in a bid to reduce the annual
trade deficit. This move was supported by the Department of the Environment.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Trade deficit grows wider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is sliding further into deficit with the rest of the world as
overseas earnings from services and financial transactions prove
insufficient to plug the gap in merchandise trade, official figures showed
yesterday.
Fourth quarter balance of payments figures showed that the deficit on the
current account widened to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.6bn from Pounds
1.8bn in the third quarter.
Within this, the visible trade deficit increased to Pounds 3.8bn from Pounds
3bn while the surplus on invisibles - services, investment income and
government transfers - shrank to Pounds 1.2bn from a revised Pounds 1.3bn.
The figures mean that the balance of payments deficit for the whole of last
year was Pounds 10.7bn compared with Pounds 10bn in 1992. Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, forecast a deficit of Pounds 9.5bn in the November Budget.
The invisible trade surplus for 1993 was Pounds 2.75bn.
The news came as criticism of the government's official trade figures showed
no signs of abating. Economists at UBS, the Swiss bank, said substantial
under-recording of European Union imports - as a result of the switch to a
VAT-based system for gathering intra-EU trade data - and an overstatement of
the invisibles surplus pointed to a much larger current-account deficit for
last year.
The British Clothing Industry Association, a trade body, said EU figures on
clothing and knitwear trade were so unreliable that it was refusing to show
them to its members.
The Central Statistical Office is conducting an investigation into the new
system, introduced at the beginning of last year. It said yesterday that it
did not accept what UBS said.
The latest figures showed that, within the invisibles balance, the surplus
on services fell to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 1.5bn in the fourth quarter.
Only financial and related services recorded a fourth-quarter surplus,
within the category of services.
There were also higher net interest payments abroad by UK banks. These were
Pounds 1.4bn compared with Pounds 1.2bn in the third quarter.
Research by UBS suggests that Britain's balance of payments deficit could be
twice as big as the official figures suggest.
Its researchers believe the true deficit on visible goods last year was
around Pounds 18bn rather than the official figure of Pounds 13.4bn.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Wage cost inflation subdued at 0.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of growth of productivity slowed in the fourth quarter of last year
and the rise in unit wage costs remained subdued, the Department of
Employment said yesterday.
Productivity in the whole of the economy increased by 2.2 per cent in the
final three months of 1993 compared with a year earlier, down from 3 per
cent in the third quarter.
Unit wage costs rose 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with a year
earlier - unchanged from the previous quarter.
Mr Darren Winder, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'It is quite
normal for productivity to be slowing two years into the recovery. We are
not going to see a second productivity miracle economy, although growth in
manufacturing output will boost productivity.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'The economy is
experiencing a potent cyclical boost to productivity as employment bottoms
out and output rises.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Growth figure for last year revised down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's economy grew more slowly than was previously thought last year  -
but yesterday's raft of economic statistics revealed some encouraging
underlying trends.
Companies are building up stock levels and consumers are reducing savings.
Both factors should help the UK recovery to continue this year.
The Central Statistical Office says gross domestic product at constant
prices grew by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year compared with
its earlier estimate of 0.8 per cent. Overall, the UK economy grew by 1.9
per cent between 1992 and 1993, down from the previous estimate of 2 per
cent. If oil and gas are excluded, 1993 GDP was 1.6 per cent higher than in
1992.
The main reasons for the downward revision were a weaker trade position and
construction activity. The trade effect knocked 1.3 per cent off GDP in the
fourth quarter.
CSO figures show that consumers continued to spend, in spite of little
growth in incomes. During the fourth quarter, real personal disposable
income grew by just 0.1 per cent, but consumers' expenditure increased by
1.1 per cent.
The difference was absorbed by a fall in savings. The savings ratio -
calculated by dividing personal savings by total personal disposable income
 -fell to 10.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, from a revised 11 per
cent in the third quarter.
If April's tax rises are not to derail the UK recovery, consumers are going
to have to spend more and save less. Economists are therefore looking for
the savings ratio to fall this year.
Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said the figures showed
that consumers' incomes are already under pressure, even ahead of the tax
increases, and this may limit the ability of the savings ratio to fall
further.
But Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said all the factors that
drive the savings ratio are pointing in the right direction: interest rates
and inflation are low and unemployment is falling.
The increase in stocks and work in progress in the fourth quarter was
revised up to Pounds 968m from an earlier estimate of Pounds 597m.
Stockbuilding contributed a 0.9 per cent increase to GDP in the fourth
quarter.
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'We are at a position where
the level of stocks is broadly in line with the trend of output. There is no
massive buffer of stocks available to absorb demand and therefore future
growth in demand will translate into growth in output.'
A further encouraging sign is that UK companies are starting to invest. A
23.7 per cent rise in gross trading profits in 1993 and a Pounds 2.97bn
financial surplus - the first since 1987 - encouraged the corporate sector
to invest in plant and machinery. Gross domestic fixed capital formation
grew by 2.5 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1993, the
largest quarterly increase since the first quarter of 1989.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Euston main line upgrade studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 500m modernisation of British Rail's west coast main line moved a
stage closer yesterday with the announcement of the award of a Pounds 3m to
Pounds 4m feasibility study to a consortium of four companies.
Railtrack, which will run BR's track and signalling, said the seven-year
project to upgrade the 480-mile link between London and Glasgow would set
the pattern for the private-sector management and financing of large
contracts. It would also be an important test of Railtrack's ability to
manage a project of this scale.
The nine-month study will be carried out by West Coast Main Line
Development, comprising Brown and Root, a project management company; Sir
Alexander Gibbs, a civil engineering consultancy; Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, an
international consultancy; and Babcock and Brown, a specialist in transport
finance.
The consortium will consider how to improve the track, power supply and
signalling and how to raise private finance in a way which is acceptable to
the Treasury. It will also prepare tender documents to select a contracting
consortium in 1995.
The west coast line was the first BR main line to be electrified in the mid
1960s.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Court removes European threat to national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potential threat to the planned National Lottery was lifted yesterday by
the European Court of Justice.
The court decided that the government's ban on the advertising and sale of
tickets in the UK for large-scale foreign lotteries was legal. The decision
has implications for state lotteries throughout the European Union.
The Office of the National Lottery is currently studying eight applications
for licences to run the lottery in the UK. The national lottery is due to
start late this year or early next.
Had the European Court forced a lifting of the ban, it could have caused
confusion in the market, with operators from other EU countries including
Ireland being free to sell tickets in the UK with the prospects of millions
of pounds in prizes.
The case arose in 1990 when British Customs &amp; Excise officers seized lottery
tickets sent to the UK by Mr Jorg Schindler, a sales agent for the German
state-supervised Suddeuttschen Klassenlotterie.
Mr Schindler claimed that the seizure contravened the Treaty of Rome on the
free movement of goods throughout the EU.
The UK, backed by at least eight other EU members, argued that lotteries
intended to raise money for good causes were issues for individual national
social policy.
The European Court ruled that EU laws did not preclude legislation such as
that introduced by Britain 'in view of the concerns of social policy and of
the prevention of fraud which justify it'.
British lottery law, until it was amended by the National Lottery Act last
year, had been designed 'to ensure that lotteries could not be operated for
personal and commercial profit but solely for charitable, sporting or
cultural purposes'.
The court said the British government could justify restrictions on freedom
to provide services in such a context.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Major looks to Germany for EU deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government is looking to Germany to forge a face-saving compromise in
the dispute over voting rights which risks delaying the entry of four new
countries into the European Union next year.
After Mr John Major dropped hints of flexibility in the UK negotiating
position yesterday, senior British officials expressed hope that Germany
might be able to coax EU partners into reciprocal movement at this weekend's
meeting of European foreign ministers in Greece.
Germany has opposed UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules allowing
two large member states and one small country to block decisions in the
Council of Ministers.
The UK, however, appears to be gambling that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire
to bring Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the EU may encourage new
flexibility.
Even if the deadlock is not broken in Greece, one wellplaced UK official
said it might be possible to reach a deal before Easter.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said after a meeting with Mr Alain
Juppe, his French counterpart, that any deal must not come at the price of
weakened decision-making in an expanded EU.
Hopes of a compromise revolve around a trade-off in which the UK and Spain
concede that the 'blocking minority' must rise from 23 to 27 votes to take
account of the four new members. In return they would win a legally binding
protocol giving countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes an automatic
right to delay decisions.
Mr Major's 'bottom line' was described by senior Whitehall insiders as an
agreement which in no way eroded the ability of minorities to block
contentious legislation on employment and social issues.
Legal experts in Brussels dismissed the notion of putting a legal ring-fence
around social legislation, or creating a two-tier voting system to deal with
such contentious issues.
Mr Major told the Commons that an agreement would be possible 'within a
matter of days' if other European governments had the political will to
reach a settlement.
David Gardner in Brussels adds: Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European
affairs minister, who will be chairing this weekend's meeting in Greece,
last night described the British stance as 'the blackmail of a tiny
minority'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Contractors' penalty warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parliamentary ombudsman has warned contractors providing government
services to the public that they must be prepared to offer cash compensation
if they are found guilty of maladministration.
Mr William Reid said in his annual report that he intended to treat
contractors in the same way as civil servants in investigating complaints on
the provision of public services.
Compensation for maladministration can often be extended beyond the people
who make the complaint, the ombudsman notes.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods paid out some Pounds
600,000 to hundreds of farmers after the ombudsman upheld complaints over
the slaughter of poultry after the salmonella-in-eggs affair, and the Driver
and Vehicle Licensing Agency made ex gratia payments to more than 200 lorry
drivers wrongly deprived of licences.
Contractors should keep adequate records to provide 'appropriate audit
trails' in investigating complaints.
The ombudsman said 1993 had been his busiest year for investigating
complaints since 1981. He completed 208 investigations, up from 190 the year
before. The number of complaints about maladministration by government
departments referred to the ombudsman by MPs was 986, the highest since
1980. However, the increase over 1992 of 4.3 per cent represented an easing
of the rate of increase which had reached 18 per cent in the previous year.
