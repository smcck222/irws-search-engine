FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK debate on corporate disclosure is producing some welcome results. Not
only does the proliferation of Christmas trading statements from retailers
suggest the days are gone when the first analyst to reach the finance
director got the bargain. Yesterday also brought an announcement from Thorn
EMI that it is to start making quarterly trading statements. These will
include a basic profit and loss account, probably with some divisional and
geographic breakdown, though there will be no balance sheet.
For the moment this seems a sensible compromise between the approach of
those put off by the effort of disclosing full quarterly results and those
anxious for more public disclosure. The case for more frequent statements
has grown since LIG was censored by the stock exchange for warning investors
selectively about a profits shortfall last year. Expectations are less
likely to slip out of line with reality if companies are regularly in touch
with the market.
Thorn's approach certainly makes more sense than that of Inchcape which
plans to hold collective analysts meetings ahead of its closed period, but
only to discuss information already in the public domain. Inchcape does not
expect to disclose any thing which would require a public statement. Thorn
also intends to put figures on the table. The company's management
accounting system means they can be assembled with minimal trouble.
This underlines the need for companies to make more meaningful information
available even if the tighter climate prevents them from disclosing it
selectively. Thorn may need to develop its approach further, though. It only
creates confusion about closed periods if information, basically available
now to management, is not disclosed till the third week in February.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this week Granada appeared to be strolling through its bid with LWT.
But following LWT's strong profits showing, it now appears to have a real
fight on its hands. LWT's latest broadside included the customarily
extravagant bid rhetoric - but it hardly smacked of a company going through
the motions before capitulating. Moreover, LWT's shareholders will be
reluctant to sell a management that has delivered more than a six-fold
increase in their shares since 1989. A bigger premium may well be needed to
seduce them.
Granada would surely sweeten its terms if that secured a recommendation from
LWT's board. But LWT has stressed its case so passionately that only a very
much higher offer might suffice. That, though, would have dangers for
Granada. An overly-generous bid would damage perceptions of Granada's
earnings prospects, lessening the appeal of its shares which are the bid's
chief currency.
However, if Granada won a hostile bid with no increase, or only a token
improvement, it may irretrievably antagonise LWT's board. LWT's millionaire
managers would have few financial qualms about quitting, threatening a
disruptive hand-over period. Besides, much of LWT's appeal lies in its
creative skills.
LWT still has worries of its own. Its arguments for independence will be
discredited if it encourages a frustrating deal with any other party. Thomas
Cook helped scupper Airtours' hostile bid for Owners Abroad by launching a
rival tender offer. But Owners' subsequent traumas hardly represent a happy
precedent for LWT.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Back to basics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When both the Sun and The Economist pillory a Conservative administration on
the same day, the markets might be expected to tremble slightly. Yet the UK
government's travails seem to have left investors completely unruffled.
Equities rallied strongly at the end of the week as, significantly, UK
institutional buying overcame overseas selling. Long gilt yields are barely
above recent lows, and are only 1.1 percentage points above base rates,
while sterling threatens to rise above its old ERM floor.
In part that may be because the next election is still, in all probability,
a long way off. Even a leadership challenge seems unlikely before the
autumn. That leaves the market free to concentrate on the improving economic
outlook and prospects for the imminent corporate reporting season. Early
indications suggest that there may be some pleasant surprises, which is
consistent with statistics showing corporate sales rising and unit labour
costs falling. That trend may well be continued this year, generating
earnings increases higher than many analysts currently predict, and dragging
equities back from their current vertiginous rating.
The shift in focus from interest rate cuts to earnings increases is needed
if the market is to maintain momentum. In the short run the robust recovery
means that further rate cuts are unlikely. Only a downward lurch in
confidence as the spring tax increases loom is likely to sway a chancellor
keen to demonstrate sound money instincts to sceptics in his own party.
Gilts thus have little to look forward to, and equities are left standing on
their own merits.

FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets move back to
record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
The US stock market bounced back from three losing sessions yesterday as
share prices, buoyed by heavy programme trading, moved back into record
territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.77 at 3,867.20,
past its previous record close of 3,865.51, set on Monday. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 2.40 at 474.87, while the
Amex composite finished up 0.82 at 480.88, and the Nasdaq composite 4.49
closed higher at 792.31, also a new record high. Trading volume on the NYSE
was 305m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,238 to 857.
Three days of modest declines on profit-taking have done nothing to dampen
investors' enthusiasm for equities. The market bounced back strongly
yesterday from the losses of earlier in the week, and within 90 minutes of
the opening the Dow was back above Monday's record close.
Market sentiment was aided by good economic news in the form of a 0.7 per
cent increase in December industrial output, which was bigger than analysts
had expected. The production figures, coming on the heels of good news on
inflation and retail sales, bolstered optimism about the outlook for the
economy in 1994, and prompted fresh buying of equities.
Banks remained in demand in anticipation of a strong fourth quarter from the
industry. Citicorp rose another Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 , JP Morgan
climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 , BankAmerica firmed Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 48 7/8 and Chase Manhattan put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 35 7/8 .
Kaufman &amp; Broad fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 21 1/2 in early trading after the
home construction company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.
The stock later recovered, however, and it finished down only Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 23 5/8 .
Among Dow stocks that were higher in the wake of buy pro grammes were Walt
Disney, up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 , General Electric, up Dollars 1
5/8 at Dollars 106 7/8 and American Express, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 32.
On the Nasdaq market, Ask Group fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 10 1/8 after the
computer company announced job cuts and reported a fiscal second-quarter
loss.
Canada
Toronto stocks posted a small gain in active trading yesterday to close at
another record high. The TSE composite index added 9.24 points, or 0.21 per
cent, to 4,489.14. Volume was 86.7m shares compared with Thursday's 84.7m.

FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Nordic exchanges have a hard act to
follow - Prospects for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nordic stock exchanges had an exceptionally good year last year - so
much so that the performance will be virtually impossible to repeat in 1994.
Finland, Sweden and Norway were western Europe's top performing bourses in
local currency terms, and, even the region's worst performer, Denmark,
managed a near 40 per cent gain. Finland, with a 91 per cent rise in the HEX
index to 1,582, came out of best of all. Norway had its best year since
1983, after its main index spurted 65 per cent to 613, and the Swedish
Affarsvarlden index rose 54 per cent.
The region-wide rally was supported by many common factors. Interest rates
fell to levels not seen for at least a decade and clear signs of economic
recovery emerged. Many of the big export-orientated companies, which are
particularly dominant on the Swedish and Finnish bourses, started to show
the benefits of corporate restructuring. And earnings were helped by a surge
in exports, which has accompanied the weakening of the Finnish and Swedish
currencies. Lastly, it was apparent that the worst of the region's banking
crisis was over.
The scale of buying was accentuated by the downturn that had preceded it.
One reflection of the pent-up state of demand was a massive growth in
turnover. Average daily volumes in Stockholm surged to SKr1.4bn (Dollars
171m) and SKr1.7bn respectively in November and December from SKr820m and
SKr670m in 1992, while in Finland average turnover was FM186.6m (Dollars
14.82m) a day, more than four-times the previous year's figure.
Volumes and price rises were helped by a surge in foreign buying. Foreigners
were primarily attracted by the valuation argument, but in the case of
Sweden and Finland momentum was assisted by the relaxation of restrictions
on foreign share ownership.
In Sweden foreigners were net buyers of SKr29.0bn worth of shares in the 11
months to November, compared with SKr11.3bn in the same 1992 period. In
Denmark foreigners bought a net DKr6bn (Dollars 890m) of equities during
1993, compared with just DKr0.3bn a year earlier.
There should be little surprise that best-performing sector across the
region was banks, as 1993 was the year that the Nordic financial crisis
abated. Banks that at the start of the year looked set to collapse without
government support were by the year-end standing strongly again on their own
two feet. The Swedish banking index led the way with a 250 per cent increase
in 1993, followed by the Finnish index - up 138.5 per cent - and the
Norwegian index, which climbed 135 per cent.
Shipping company shares in Norway and Denmark also had a good year, even
though the state of the tanker market was hardly encouraging. The Oslo
shipping index advanced 82 per cent, while shipping stocks climbed 57 per
cent in Denmark.
This year has begun well, with a new weight of money piling into the Nordic
markets during the opening days of the new year. This is partly traditional,
partly a reflection of special factors, such as the change to corporate
taxation rules in Sweden. It is clear that domestic money is supporting the
continuing rally to a greater extent than in the recent past.
But can the upturn be sustained? Most commentators believe the mood of
optimism is likely to hold for at least the first half of the year, as
Nordic countries bring down their interest rates further in response to the
downward trend throughout Europe. The Bank of Finland yesterday decided to
cut its base rate to 5.25 per cent from 5.5 per cent from February 1 amid
growing optimism that the country would achieve positive economic growth for
the first time since 1990 this year.
'It's difficult to see any of the Nordic markets declining in 1994,' says Mr
Klas Andersson, Scandinavian equity analyst with Goldman Sachs in London,
'However, the pace will slow down, because most of the interest rate cuts
have already occurred, particularly on the long side.' Goldman Sachs expects
all four markets to outperform the European average.
There are plenty of uncertainties, particularly how the German economy
performs and the likely impact of a strengthening recovery in the US. If US
interest rates go up, some of the money invested in foreign markets is
almost certainly going to be pulled back. Any significant share disposals by
foreign investors will have a much greater impact now that foreign ownership
levels are higher.
Prospects for the Norwegian market will, as ever, hinge on the development
of the oil price, while market participants in Finland will be keeping a
nervous eye on political developments in Russia.
In fact, political factors will be a significant influence on all the
Nordics in 1994. Elections will take place in Sweden and Denmark in the
second half of the year, and Sweden, Finland and Norway are likely to hold
referenda this year on their bid to join the European Union. The markets may
well be upset if the generally negative sentiment towards membership becomes
a firm No at the polls.

FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei adds 2.1% on
overseas buyer support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices jumped as foreign buying encouraged purchases by domestic
individuals and short covering in the futures market, and the Nikkei index
rose 2.1 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 396.44 to 18,973.70, up 4.7 per cent on the week.
The Topix index of all first-section stocks shot up 22.15 to 1,525.62 and,
in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.09 to 1,261.27.
The Nikkei index fell to a low of 18,473.55 during the first few minutes of
trading on profit-taking by domestic investors. However, overseas investors
supported share prices in the afternoon, prompting buying by other
participants, peaking at 19,043.80, rising above the 19,000 level for the
first time in two months.
The settlement for January Nikkei options did not have a significant effect
on share prices. The market's strength caused corporate investors to delay
its profit taking.
Volume was 450m shares against 422m. Winners led losers by 828 to 219, with
133 issues unchanged.
Hopes of deregulation helped gas utilities: Tokyo Gas, the most active issue
of the day, rose Y30 to Y550 while Osaka Gas gained Y26 to Y520.
Anritsu, an electronic equipment maker, plunged Y121 to Y989 on reports of
the company's alleged illegal exports of missile related equipment to North
Korea.
Foreign buying supported Fanuc, which rose Y70 to Y4,050. Other
high-technical shares were also stronger with Sony up Y20 to Y5,900 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial up Y20 to Y1,580.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 203.45 to 20,787.11 in volume of 36m shares.
The index rose for the 12th consecutive day on buying of fibre and
pharmaceutical stocks. Roundup
Pacific Rim markets ended their week-long roller-coaster ride with sharp
rebounds, although the rises were not enough to overcome losses suffered in
the volatile trade of the previous three sessions.
KUALA LUMPUR surged after reassuring comments from the prime minister that
the 14.7 per cent plunge of the previous three days was only a temporary
phenomenon. The composite index rose 104.97 to 1,134.14.
Institutional and retail investors swamped back into the market from the
outset after as they judged that recent falls had left the market once again
looking attractively priced.
HONG KONG picked up after its losing streak as local and overseas investors
resumed buying, and the Hang Seng index added 597.74 to 10.774.25. However,
turnover fell to a provisional HKDollars 8.86bn from Thursday's HKDollars
9.25bn.
The improved tone was attributed to the failure of tighter mortgage lending
to materialise, in spite of widespread rumours, and optimism about the
outcome of Sino-US trade talks over the weekend.
Property and banking issues, which were hit hard during the recent sell-off,
led the market back up. HSBC Holdings topped the active list and surged
HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 107 and its Hang Seng Bank unit climbed HKDollars 3
to HKDollars 71.50. SINGAPORE saw bargain-hunting pushed prices higher
across the board and the Straits Times Industrials index closed 108.00 ahead
at 2,302.86.
The rebound was attributed to the 'overkill' of previous days and reassuring
comments from the Malaysian prime minister on the outlook for Malaysian
companies.
TAIWAN fell further as both the financial and shipping sectors saw heavy
selling. The weighted index lost 107.63 at 5,743.77, up from a day's low of
5,649. Turnover eased to TDollars 86.8bn from Thursday's TDollars 104.5bn.
BANGKOK showed a strong rise following Wednesday's 3 per cent fall but
turnover remaned thin at Bt16.4bn reflecting investor caution. The SET index
put on 78.64 to 1,516.67. Textile shares led the risers, with the sector
advancing some 7 per cent.
SEOUL reacted negatively to news that the government planned to introduce
measures aimed at putting a brake on the market's recent advance. Included
was a requirement for intitutions to deposit 20 per cent of the total cost
when placing buy orders. The composite index fell 19.63 to 879.03.
AUSTRALIA rose above the 2,200 level on strong performances among blue
chips, with All Ordinaries index rising by 28.9 to 2,206.4. Turnover was
ADollars 821m. Media stocks were in the forefront of investors' minds, the
index adding 4.1 per cent and News Corp gaining 51 cents to ADollars 9.76.
BOMBAY closed slightly higher after lower prices triggered renewed buying.
The BSE 30-share index closed up 10.15 at 3,938.74.

FT  15 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Uneven end to the week's
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The week ended unevenly, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT continued to fall back as investors remained nervous following
concern over Metallgesellschaft and Siemens. The DAX index lost 22.84 to
2,141.82, for a loss of 3.2 per cent over the week. Turnover was DM13bn. In
the post bourse the Ibis indicated index gained to 2,151.
Metallgesellschaft was requoted after its suspension on Thursday with the
shares finishing at DM214.00. The company is expected to make a statement on
progress over its rescue plan today.
Siemens fell a further DM4.50 to DM721.50 as selling continued after its
disappointing earnings forecasts during the week.
Thyssen closed off DM1.50 at DM254.50 with some reports suggesting that it
was to announce further job cuts this year. The company has previously said
that it will lose 12,000 jobs by the end of September 1994.
AMSTERDAM pulled itself forward helped by a stronger dollar, leaving the AEX
index up 4.97 at 420.62, but slightly lower on the week's trading.
Philips strengthened by some 3 per cent, the shares gaining Fl 1.40 to Fl
43.60, on overnight news that it would be a supplier to an interactive
television network operated by Bell of the US.
VNU dipped Fl 1.80 to Fl 177.20 after announcing that it planned to issue 3m
new shares in the first quarter of 1994.
Ahold added Fl 2.10 to Fl 50.50 helped by news that it was to purchase 11
stores that it had been renting in the Czech Republic.
PARIS managed to recoup some of the week's losses as the CAC-40 index added
10.06 to 2,262.25. Over the week the market has slipped by nearly 2 per
cent. Michelin came back into favour among some buyers, the stock ending
FFr6.70 up at FFr240.00, as the tyre group said that it was increasing the
price of its products in the US by 3 per cent.
ZURICH picked up after an uncertain start to bounce higher after the
consolidation of the previous four sessions. The SMI index added 40.7 or 1.4
per cent to 2,990.9, but this was 1.7 per cent down on the week. The day's
more positive trend was helped by the firmer dollar and strength in London
and Wall Street. Winterthur bearers rose SFr14 or 1.7 per cent to SFr820, as
it said it would announce an expansion of the group on Monday.
Registered shares in SMH, the watchmaker, rose SFr15 to SFr950 after recent
weakness in the wake of comments by chief executive, Mr Nicolas Hayek that
1993 sales were slightly higher than in 1992 and profits would rise
slightly. Analysts said SMH's statement was within expectations and
confirmed their recent downward revision of forecasts.
MILAN finished steady after a session dominated by technical trading on the
last day of the monthly account. The Comit index edged 1.33 lower to 602.86
as the market still awaited news from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the
date of the general election. The market had risen 1 per cent over the week.
Montedison slid L36.60 to L909 in huge volume of 129m shares as the company
allowed investors who subscribed to the first tranch of its rights issue to
trade the new ordinary shares, instead of waiting until Monday as had
originally been intended.
Mr William Cowan of James Capel, who upgraded the stock to a buy, commented
that the problems that had surrounded the group looked at last as if they
had found a solution, adding: 'We have become more confident that Montedison
will be in a position to return to profitability earlier than the market had
been expecting.'
BCI fell L84 to L4,776 after IRI, the holding company announced details of
its privatisation, to run from February 28 to March 4.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by active interest in Volvo, which saw the B shares put
on SKr30 to SKr627, a new record, after report's that France may end the
relationship between the Swedish group and Renault.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 20.7 or 1.4 per cent to 1,508.2 as
turnover improved to SKr3.2bn from SKr2.6bn.
ATHENS continued its bull run, posting a second three-year high in as many
days and a record for turnover. The general index finished up 17.17 or 1.6
per cent at 1,105.73.

FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading textile group Coats Viyella was one of the strongest performers in
the FT-SE 100 index yesterday as Smith New Court reiterated a buy
recommendation on the company. The shares rose 9 1/2 to 273 1/2 p. Analyst
Mr Mark Puleikis said the shares had been dragged down by recent downgrades
on Courtaulds Textiles, William Baird and Dawson International. But while
those three companies had recovered Coats had been left behind.
'On our profit forecast of Pounds 192m for this year the shares had fallen
to a market rating after being at a 30 per cent premium,' said Mr Puleikis.
Courtaulds Textiles eased 5 to 519p, Dawson firmed a penny to 148p and
William Baird was flat at 262p.
Smaller companies attracted keen interest with activity helped by an upbeat
investment seminar at Kleinwort Benson.
The Kleinwort team was especially bullish on the television stocks, which
made good progress yesterday. Other stocks to respond included Bostrum, 12
higher at 202p, Microgen, which moved up 6 to 151p and Ricardo and Sidlaw,
which rose 2 apiece to 192p and 328p.
TSB's preliminary figures continued to trigger support for other high street
banks ahead of their results season, which gets under way in February. Abbey
National was a big beneficiary of straight buying and big switching that saw
Lloyds heavily sold, and the shares spurted a further 13 to a peak 520p.
Lloyds closed 4 off at 523p. The Hong Kong market's strong rally left HSBC
28 up at 911p. Standard Chartered put on 14 to 1168p with dealers expecting
a significant profits upgrade from a top broker next week.
Building stocks continued to attract big buying interest as recent strong
sales figures released by the Builders Merchants Federation triggered
numerous profits upgrades.
RMC shares were further stimulated by improved hopes for lower German
interest rates and climbed 17 to a record 1027p. Rugby was a lone weak
performer in the sector, the shares slipping 4 to 319p after Kleinwort
Benson took the stock off its buy list. Forte was up 13p to 283 on further
consideration of the possible Ciga bid. Eurocamp rose 22p to 285 after good
results.
Leisure group Granada fell 11 to 551p on concern that its bid for television
group LWT might prove tougher than expected. There is speculation that LWT
is talking to an unnamed North American company, which might take around 30
per cent of LWT in an effort to block Granada's hostile offer. LWT shares
closed 6 higher at 667p.
Advertiser WPP International and newspaper Mirror Group received
encouragement from SG Warburg, which once again selected the two companies
as their picks in the sector in its outlook for the year.
Warburg's media specialist, Ms Lorna Tilbian, said recovery in advertising
spending, strong cash flows resulting in higher dividends and the growth of
multi media would ensure the sector remained attractive. She said that WPP
and Mirror offered above average growth prospects. WPP rose 3 to 107p while
Mirror gained 1 1/2 to 187 1/2 p.
Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott improved 10 to 256p making a rise of
nearly 25 per cent over the week. The company has acquired control over its
joint venture with Amsterdam based group GGK.
Further consideration of the deal by Reuters Holdings to acquire the
loss-making Quotron equity dealing business in the US sent Reuters shares up
49 to 1902p, a record high.
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham attracted heavy buying on the back
of Thursday's official launch of the company's new shingles treatment and
the shares jumped 17 to 424p. Meanwhile, Wellcome shares, which had suffered
from the competitive threat posed by the new drug, appeared to have hit
bottom and good two-way business pulled the stock back up 5 to 655p on hefty
volume of 8.9m.
Engineering group Clayton raced 33 ahead to 103p, after it said it was in
talks that could lead to a bid.
British Aerospace was among a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks that bucked the
market trend with Credit Lyonnais urging investors to sell the stock. The
shares retreated 9 to 424p, after analysts at the broker said 'there are
fears of negative surprises at next month's results'. There were whispers
that long time bull of the stock Henderson Crosthwaite had been among the
day's main sellers.
Nervousness about 1994 prospects brought a few surprises among stores.
Encouraging Christmas figures from Argos, up 18 per cent on last year, were
not enough to lift its share price, which held at 379p. Dixons, down 3 to
228p, and WH Smith, down 7 to 504p, suffered from the announcement of a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the video games
industry.
Speculative buying of Lucas Industries saw the shares put on 4 to 209p.
Total volume of 3.9m, included a block of 1m done at 210p.

FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Power stocks weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Power generation stocks were among the market's worst performers with
utilities specialists saying that all the utilities sectors, which attract
support because of their high yields and quality of earnings, may suffer in
the absence of any UK interest rate reductions in the short term.
The generators were the worst affected, with UBS, the Swiss-owned
stockbroking firm, said to have been an aggressive seller. There were also
suggestions that PowerGen and National Power could be about to sell some
power stations, to try to head off a referal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Just before Christmas, Offer, the electricity watchdog, said the English
generators could avoid an MMC referral if they came up with an acceptable
pricing regime and sold some of their power stations.
The Scottish generators were heavily sold, Scottish Power sliding 13, or 2.9
per cent, to 441p, on heavy turnover of 5.2m shares. Hydro dipped 11, or 2.5
per cent to 436p. National Power fell 11, or 2.3 per cent, to 467p and
PowerGen 9 to 535p.

FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: UK funds catch the marketmakers by
surprise - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK fund managers took hold of the London stock market yesterday and,
with the US sellers content to back away, share prices bounced ahead
strongly. The FT-SE 100 Share Index gained 40.6 to close at 3,400.6, while
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on 33.6 for a new closing peak of 3,915.7.
Although several reasons were advanced for the sudden recovery in share
prices as the two week trading account closed, traders admitted that 'it
caught us all on the hop'. Trading volume was very heavy, both in stock
index futures and equities.
The strong gains in Far Eastern markets overnight, a slight easing in
sterling, and favourable comments on interest rate prospects from the
president of the Bundesbank, all helped UK equities. With trading houses
still struggling to find stock in spite of the market downturn earlier in
the week, prices were squeezed higher when the buyers appeared.
Wall Street, having given ground overnight, started the new session in good
form, adding 22 Dow points as London closed down for the day.
The clinching factor for marketmakers was the sudden withdrawal of the US
sellers who had been very active in stock index futures on Thursday. This
left the market open to the UK institutions, which have become wary lest
overseas buyers repeat the spree that drove London to record levels in the
first few sessions of this month. US pension funds, increasing their
holdings of non-US stocks, played a important role in driving the UK market
ahead at the end of last year, and shares have been hit hard this week by US
profit-taking.
The presence of the domestic institutions put the spotlight on some of the
smaller UK stocks that tend to be overlooked by the overseas funds. Activity
in these smaller stocks lifted the non-Footsie share of the day's business
to around 66 per cent. Total Seaq business just topped the 1bn share mark,
compared with 899m on Thursday when retail value was again high at Pounds
1.94bn.
After its substantial recovery yesterday, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of
only 17.8 points over the two-week equity account. But the index has lost
45.4 points this week as the record performances in the new year have been
challenged by US selling of the London market.
The strength of equities contrasted with British government bonds, which
tumbled sharply yesterday as the sector braced itself for the auction of
gilts that the Bank of England said yesterday would be held on January 26
and would comprise conventional gilts maturing from 2008 to 2012.
Short dated gilts shed  5/32 yesterday as base rate hopes remained on the
back burner, while longer dates fell by up to half a point. Index-linked,
however, edged forward.
The recovery in share prices yesterday reflected the generally very
favourable tone of investment comment on the London market from both
domestic and international securities houses.
Nervousness has focused around perceptions that base rate cuts might be
withheld and also that equity valuations are too high.
But BZW, the London based investment bank, commented that 'the key evidence
(of a market peak) is still missing'. It believes that debt and unemployment
levels in the UK are still too high to allow any significant tightening of
monetary policy in the absence of clear inflationary pressures.

FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze as UK institutions turned aggressive buyers of the London market
sent futures contracts sharply forward and brought heavy dealing in the
traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
After an erratic week of exaggerated swings, buyers were seen for the March
futures contract on the FT-SE 100 from the outset as it opened at 3,382.
Dealers said US houses that had been prominent sellers in the last two
sessions had remained on the sidelines as UK institutions moved in.
March lost some momentum mid-session, as traders used the earlier advance to
arbitrage between the cash and the futures markets. However, a good premium
to cash was maintained throughout the day. It closed at 3,425, just ahead of
its fair value premium to cash of 13 points, on volume of 16,688 lots.
Turnover in the traded options jumped to a hefty 56,696 lots with heavy
trading in the FT-SE 100 option bring closing volume of 22,493.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar capped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The politically sensitive relationship between the dollar and yen was
highlighted yesterday after Mr Robert Rubin, assistant to the US president
for economic policy, denied that the US government had any firm policy on
the dollar against the yen, write Gillian Tett and Philip Gawith.
Elsewhere in Europe, however, trading was fairly quiet as sterling
consolidated some of the past week's gains and the dollar slid back from
earlier highs in spite of more strong US economic data.
Mr Rubin's comment revived the market's interest in the dollar-yen, after a
week dominated by the dollar's rally against the D-Mark.
In morning trading the dollar drifted down against the yen on the back of
growing pessimism about prospects for US-Japanese trade talks where the US
hopes to get a commitment from Japan to act to curb the size of its trade
surplus. However, Mr Rubin's comments prompted a brief rally against the
yen, moving the dollar up from the Y110.80 level it had slid to in the early
afternoon to above Y111.50. The dollar finally closed at Y111.215 in London,
down almost Y1 from the previous day's close of Y112.165.
Analysts felt that the behaviour of the dollar yesterday showed it had run
out of steam.
Despite stronger-than-expected US industrial production data, the dollar
also softened slightly against the D-Mark, briefly dipping down to touch the
1993 high of DM1.7480, which it dramatically breached on Thursday. It later
recovered to end at DM1.7505 against DM1.752 the previous day.
Dealers said one reason for the fall may have been concerns that the the
wave of optimism on Thursday, following the release of bullish economic
data, had led them to price too rapid a US recovery into the dollar.
Although US December industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent, and
capacity use climbed to 83.5 per cent, both above market expectations, the
rise in output was lower than November's increase and not as dramatic as the
rise in retail sales on Thursday.
A second factor was that many traders were taking profits before the
weekend, scaling back positions ahead of America's Monday holiday.
A further factor was uncertainty about the the Bundesbank's stance towards
the dollar's rise. Rumours continued to circulate yesterday that the
Bundesbank had been in discussion with the US Federal Reserve about stalling
the dollar's advance. Although most dealers believe the Bundesbank is merely
trying to slow the rise, rather than reverse it, the rumours were sufficient
to cap the dollar.
Sterling also remained range bound yesterday, trading around the DM2.6120
levels, some three pfennigs higher than its position at the start of the
week. It closed at DM2.6118, slightly down on the previous day's DM2.6209.
Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.4921, slightly down from Dollars
1.496 the previous day.
The lira fluctuated narrowly against the D-Mark yesterday on expectations
that Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italian president, will set an election date
this weekend, possibly ending the political instability that has plagued the
country over the past two years. Although it staged a late rally, it closed
in London somewhat weaker against the D-Mark at L975.5 compared with a
previous close of L971. The Bank of England yesterday forecast a shortage of
Pounds 1.75bn in its UK money market operations, later revised down to
Pounds 1.3bn. It removed all of this in late morning trading.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Alcan cuts add fuel to
metals rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan of Canada restoked the boiler of a general London Metal Exchange rally
that was showing signs of running out steam when it announced late on
Thursday that it was making immediate cuts amounting to 156,000 tonnes in a
full year in its aluminium production.
The news came at an opportune moment, just a few days before the
commencement of a second round of multilateral talks on curing the
international aluminium market's growing oversupply problem. At these talks,
beginning in Brussels on Tuesday, representatives from Australia, Canada,
the European Union Norway, the US and Russia - widely blamed for the present
glut - are expected to agree terms for output cuts of up to 2m tonnes a
year.
With the LME already closed, the initial reaction to the Alcan news in
inter-office trading was somewhat muted. But yesterday saw a sharp rally
that took the LME three months price to a five-month high of Dollars 1,208 a
tonne at one point.
At the close it stood at Dollars 1,205.75 a tonne, up Dollars 38 on the day
and Dollars 56.25 on the week.
Other LME base metals contracts joined in the fun. Three months copper,
which had already been showing a Dollars 33.25 rise on the week, added
another Dollars 46 to close at Dollars 1,826.50 a tonne, while three months
nickel extended its weekly gain from Dollars 410 to Dollars 470 at Dollars
5,757.50 a tonne. The lead lead price closed at Dollars 508.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 12 on the day and Dollars 35 on the week, and zinc added Dollars 23
to its earlier Dollars 21.50 rise. Tin closed at Dollars 5,022.50 a tonne,
up Dollars 265 on the week, after gaining Dollars 162.50 yesterday.
'After a few days of consolidation the markets look to have firmly
established uptrends and are attracting technical buying from (investors
following) charts and (investment) funds,' one dealer told the Reuter news
agency.
The earlier gains had brought a dubious response from some analysts, who
said speculators were ignoring the poor fundamental outlook for base metals.
Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group,
pointed out that nickel had been the 'star performer' with a 50 per cent
rise from its October low, although the metal's prospects had been
deteriorating.
'Metals are cheap compared with the stock and bond market,' he pointed out,
'and a little money can move prices quite a long way.'
At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa market began by continuing last
week's fall, which had been influenced by growing expectations of a big
devaluation of the CFA franc, the currency of former French African colonies
including the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. But, as is so
often the case, the actual event, which came on Wednesday, brought a
reversal in the price trend.
Having dipped to Pounds 885 a tonne on that day the LCE's May futures
position rallied to end the week Pounds 23 up on balance at Pounds 929 a
tonne.
In the absence of fresh fundamental news dealers attributed the rally, which
peaked yesterday at Pounds 948 a tonne, to a 'positive' technical picture.
And the uptrend had been fuelled by covering against earlier 'short' sales
prompted, they told Reuter, by the appearance of one or two large buyers in
the market.
Analysts said yesterday's announcement by the Ivory Coast of an increase in
prices paid to farmers following the devaluation was unlikely to lead to
substantially higher shipments in the near future.

The pepper market gradually became more active over the past few days and
prices tended firmer in general, reports Man Producten. Muntok white pepper
reached a price of about USDollars 2,900 a tonne, cif, for January/March
shipment, while new crop positions (Agust shipment onwards) were quoted at
about Dollars 2,700 a tonne. The market was very thin and volatile. Black
pepper prices recovered as well. Some origins, like Brazil, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Indonesia have hardly offered any pepper lately. Only India,
with the new but reduced crop around the corner, could be obtained on a
daily basis at a level of about Dollars 1,550 a tonne, cif.

FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: The victim of a data revolution
 -Citicorp got left behind after buying Quotron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Walter Wriston, the legendary head of Citicorp until the mid-1980s, had
grand plans in the information services business. 'Information about money
is almost as important as money itself,' he once said. 'The information
business could easily rival any of our banking businesses as a profit
generator in the 1990s.'
It was one of those sweeping, visionary statements of which Citibank bosses
are so fond. Mr John Reed, Mr Wriston's chosen successor and the current
chairman, is also given to such weighty ponderings. And it was Mr Reed who,
acting on Mr Wriston's precept, pushed through the bank's bold Dollars 680m
acquisition of Quotron, a supplier of screen-based financial information, in
1986.
The extent of the gap between Citicorp's ambitions and the realities of the
information services business finally became clear this week, as the US's
biggest bank announced it was selling Quotron's stock-price information
business to Reuters (it will keep Quotron's foreign exchange business). The
bank had written down its investment in the information company by Dollars
400m in October 1991, and is thought to have been looking to dispose of it
ever since. Now, it is taking a further Dollars 179m charge and has agreed
to pay Reuters money if Quotron's weakened market position deteriorates much
further.
Quotron's problems spring from its failure to adapt to a market which has
changed quickly in recent years. When acquired by Citicorp, it was the
market leader in the US equity market, with some 80,000 of its screens in
use. The market for screen services was growing fast and price competition
among information providers had yet to bite.
Things look very different now. For a start, the market (estimated at around
150,000-200,000 screens in the US) has stopped growing. The provision of
share-price quotations (the basic 'quote vendor' service on which Quotron's
business is based) is a low-value service for which prices have been
falling: prices supplied by the New York Stock Exchange are available for
onward transmission to any information provider, making this a 'commodity
product'.
At the same time, Citicorp admits to a lack of investment in Quotron's
products until recently, when it revamped its service for the small brokers
and institutional investors who comprise the low-value end of the
share-price information market.
Quotron's competitors, led by Automated Data Processing, have been more
ambitious, adding additional services to their basic quote service and
developing interactive screens. Also, many users now prefer to take
share-price quotes in the form of an electronic feed, which they can then
access on PCs.
The decline in Quotron's market share indicates that it has been left
behind. Citicorp puts the number of Quotron screens still in use at 'more
than 40,000'. Big national broking firms such as Dean Witter and Kidder
Peabody have dropped its service, though Paine Webber remains a customer.
The company has been left to concentrate on the low-value end of the market,
where users pay little - typically Dollars 100 a month or less - or a basic
quote and news service. The difference between the Quotron service and that
provided by rivals like ADP and Reuters is like 'the difference between a
Hyundai and a Mercedes Benz', says Mr Michael Ellmann, an analyst at
Wertheim Schroder. Quotron's problems have also sprung from the uncertainty
about its future over the past two years.
The question now is whether Reuters can make any money out of the business.
It is reported to have touted the idea of a screen service for the low end
of the US equity market at the beginning of the decade, only to pull back
when it concluded there was not enough money to be made.
Things may have changed since then. For a start, the technology has moved
on. It may be possible for Reuters to find other ways to deliver the Quotron
service, at a profit. The UK company may also believe it can sell its
Instinet share trading service, which has become a highly profitable
operation, to Quotron's users. Much will depend on how much Reuters has to
invest to develop Quotron and strengthen its market position.
Based on its current customer base, the Quotron acquisition will make
Reuters one of the two biggest providers of screen-based information to the
equity markets alongside ADP, with around 40 per cent of the market between
them.
It will also reinforce the UK company's attempts to move beyond the foreign
exchange market, where it is a dominant force, and extend its leadership
into other financial markets.

FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: German metals group to present
final rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft will continue its fight for survival this morning when it
presents details of revised refinancing proposals to bank creditors owed
DM5bn (Dollars 2.86bn). Its plan will be presented at a hastily-convened
meeting in a Frankfurt hotel.
The stricken mining, metals and industrial group warned banks yesterday that
today's package represented its last chance to avoid formal insolvency
proceedings.
Although Metallgesellschaft itself did not tell banks about revisions to the
original DM3.4bn rescue package, it emerged that Norddeutsche Landesbank,
the public sector bank which condemned the package earlier this week, had
won significant concessions.
NordLB, a house bank to the state of Lower Saxony, said the seven state
sector banks owed a total of DM1bn by Metallgesellschaft agreed to the
proposals as a result of the changes.
It was not clear yesterday whether the modifications would be enough to win
over French banks, which declared opposition to the refinancing terms. Their
resistance forced a deputation from Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank,
Germany's two largest banks and big shareholders in the metals group, to fly
to Paris for negotiations on Thursday.
The French banks, led by Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, objected to
the details of the original proposals, and to what they said was a lack of
information about Metallgesellschaft's current financial position and
prospects.
The negotiations broke off without any agreement on Thursday night, and the
German delegation flew back to Frankfurt. Talks continued by telephone
yesterday.
The original refinancing proposals envisaged a DM1.4bn rights issue, the
conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock, and DM700m
in new credit lines.
NordLB said yesterday the proposals had been modified on a number of counts.
These are:
The refinancing need not be unilaterally agreed by all 120 creditor banks -
a big change from the group's original stance that all had to agree. This
leaves scope for some creditors not to take part in the proposals as long as
the total sum of money is provided by the others.
The amount of fresh money to be lent is likely to be halved to DM350m,
implying that Deutsche and Dresdner have backed down from their original
position that they would not lend any more money to the stricken
conglomerate after extending DM1.5bn emergency facilities last month.
The terms of the DM1.3bn conversion of debt to junior convertible stock are
to be improved.
Metallgesellschaft's shares, readmitted to trading on the Frankfurt stock
exchange yesterday after being suspended on Thursday, dropped sharply to
DM214, down DM12 from Wednesday night's close.

FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: VNU moves into US magazine
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publisher, yesterday unveiled a Dollars 220m deal in the US
that will give it control over two 'bibles' of the West Coast entertainment
industry, the daily newspaper Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine.
The Dutch publisher, best-known until now as the largest producer of
consumer magazines in the Netherlands and Belgium, will also take over 17
other US trade magazines covering music, media and entertainment. The titles
include Adweek, Music &amp; Media, and Backstage.
The magazines are all published by BPI Communications, which VNU has agreed
to buy from Boston Ventures, the New York Times and BPI's management. The
BPI deal will also give VNU several business information databases that will
tie in well with its existing US database activities.
VNU, which generated only 9 per cent of its turnover in the US in 1992,
against 67 per cent in its home market, said the acquisition would give it a
broader base from which to pursue further growth in the US.
The Dutch company, which is already active in trade magazine publishing in
Europe, said: 'The publications are all trade magazines, an area in which we
have a lot of experience. However, the subject matter is new for us.'
Its existing trade titles in Europe cover fields such as electronics,
computers and engineering.
VNU said it would pay for BPI, and raise money for future expansion, by
issuing 3m new shares during the first quarter, probably in March. The
shares, equivalent to 20 per cent of VNU's existing capital base and worth
around Fl 530m (Dollars 270m) at yesterday's price, will be placed by a
banking consortium led by ABN-Amro and Goldman Sachs.
The company said it expected 1994 per-share profit to show a further
increase even after the capital expansion.

FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: Murdoch faces fresh HK legal
challenge

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The troubles for Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV network deepened yesterday when
Wharf Cable announced the start of legal proceedings to free it from an
obligation to air Star TV's channels in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong-based cable-TV station said it regretted that seven months of
negotiations had failed to produce an agreement with Star.
The company's statement is more bad news for Star, which earlier this month
suffered a setback in Taiwan, its most profitable market, when its
advertising distributor severed its relationship with the broadcaster.
Mr Murdoch is expected in Hong Kong next month to oversee personally a
reorganisation of the company, for which his News Corporation paid USDollars
525m last July for a 63 per cent interest.
Wharf Cable launched an eight-channel service at the end of October, five
months after it had been awarded an exclusive licence by the Hong Kong
government. It plans to invest HKDollars 5bn (USDollars 648m) in a cable
system capable of delivering 20 channels.
In June last year it began talks with Star about carrying seven Star TV
satellite-based channels. It is unclear why the two companies have not been
able to agree terms, although industry executives suggest that differences
in business style may partly explain the impasse.
Wharf said it intended to source alternative channels to bring the full
programming line up to 20 channels. The loss of seven channels represented a
substantial opportunity cost to the company, it said.
Raymond Snoddy adds: An independent survey in 13 countries out of the 53
covered by the Star TV satellite footprint shows that the five-channel
service in now seen in 42m homes.
The survey, conducted in September and November by Frank Small and
Associates, shows that the number of homes receiving Star channels has
nearly tripled since the last survey in January 1993.
In China, where the research was conducted in association with the Chinese
authorities, an estimated 30m homes can receive Star. This represents 22 per
cent of all television homes in the areas surveyed.
In India Star penetration has more than doubled to 7m.
Meanwhile, News Corporation has rejected reports by analysts that Star could
lose between USDollars 60m and USDollars 80m.

Wal-Mart, the biggest retailer in the US, is to spread its discount store
empire into Canada. It is buying 120 of Woolworth Canada's 142 Woolco
superstores for an undisclosed sum, and turning them into Wal-Mart outlets.
The deal marks a significant expansion for Wal-Mart. Although the company
has more than 2,000 stores operating under the Wal-Mart name, and 360
membership warehouses operating under the Sam's Club name, the Canadian move
will be its first venture outside the US, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
Canadian retailing stocks fell sharply as investors responded nervously to
the threat of increased competition. Shares in Hudson's Bay, the country's
biggest retailer, fell CDollars 4 1/8 to CDollars 35 3/4 .
Woolworth Canada's US parent said the Woolco stores were being sold in line
with its strategy of switching away from general merchandising to
concentrate on higher-growth specialty retailing outlets such as Foot Locker
and Northern Reflections.
In October the group announced a restructuring involving the closure of 970
stores in the US and Canada. Yesterday it emphasised it was not pulling out
of Canada.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fitzpatrick for market via reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the UK's largest cable television duct layers, JP Fitzpatrick (Cable
TV), is coming to the market through a Pounds 8.75m cash and paper reverse
takeover by Baillie Gifford Technology, the shell investment trust whose
shares were suspended at 31p late last month pending an announcement.
BGT, which appointed City dealmakers Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Stephen Hargrave
to its board in November, plans to acquire the specialist cable ducting
group and its sister company, JP Fitzpatrick Construction.
Mr Johnson said yesterday: 'The acquisitions will provide BGT with the
opportunity to enter the fast expanding cable television market. It provides
the company and its shareholders with a dynamic new business in a growing
market.'
The purchase price will be satisfied through the issue of 39.4m shares to
the vendors, Pounds 4.7m of loan notes and Pounds 110,000 of cash which will
be funded from the proceeds of a placing and rights issue.
BGT plans to raise a total of Pounds 7.6m after expenses through a placing
by Greig Middleton of 48m new ordinary shares at 10p each and a 3-for-2
rights issue of 33.3m shares at the same price. The rights issue is
underwritten by Hill Samuel.
The balance of the new funds raised will provide working capital for the
enlarged group which will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 14m
at the rights issue price and which plans to change its name to Utility
Cable.

Eurocamp, the tour operator specialising in self-drive camping holidays,
suffered a one-third fall to Pounds 6.25m in pre-tax profits for the year to
October, as bookings fell and market share was lost.
The result was in line with a warning at the interim stage that profits

However, a more optimistic statement on the current year's outlook, with
bookings up in all markets, and the maintenance of the final 6.3p dividend,
to give an unchanged total of 9.75p, pushed the shares up 22p to 285p.
Eurocamp estimated that the market for inclusive summer holidays from the UK
to France - the biggest part of its operation - fell 10 per cent in 1993,
with its business hit harder than some competitors.
Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said the group had reappraised product and
marketing strategies in the light of changes in the trading environment and
competitive pressures. Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said margins
should recover in 1994 but not to 1992 levels.
The group has adjusted 1994 brochure prices to tackle last year's poor
bookings in the June and early July period. Lower prices in these weeks have
been partly offset by higher prices in late July and August, although
average prices are lower than in the 1993 brochures.
Mr Atkinson said the group was expecting some recovery in occupancy rates -
from last summer's 96 nights out of a possible 115 to about 100 nights - and
it aimed to reduce marketing and administration costs while holding costs
incurred overseas.
Sales in the year fell 7.5 per cent to Pounds 56.7m, and operating profits
dropped 32 per cent to Pounds 6.54m (Pounds 9.63m). Interest payable was
Pounds 584,000 (Pounds 606,000), while investment income amounted to Pounds
296,000 against Pounds 381,000. Earnings per share dropped from 24.2p to
16.2p.
Capital expenditure was cut, with the amount on fixed assets down from
Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 6.28m, sufficient to maintain assets but with no
expansion. At the year-end the group had net cash of Pounds 2.1m, compared
with net debt of Pounds 124,000.
COMMENT
After the disappointments of last year, of which only a part can be blamed
on the market, Eurocamp has to regain credibility in the City. Incorrect
pricing appeared to be the management's greatest mistake in the 1993
brochure, which has been addressed this year. It is early days to say
whether sufficient adjustment has been made although early bookings are
encouraging. More will be known by the annual meeting in March. Making a
firm forecast is thus a bit dangerous yet, though a range of Pounds 7.5m to
Pounds 8.5m seems plausible. That suggests a p/e in the 13 to 14.5 range. A
maintained dividend would give an above average yield. After the shares' run
yesterday more evidence of the new strategy's success is needed to push them
much higher.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cellular Telecom to get quote in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellular Telecom, the UK mobile communications company, is to be quoted in
the US following the reverse takeover of a Canadian company once known for
its claims to have produced an anti-Aids product.
Health Care Products, which was recently delisted from the Toronto stock
exchange and currently trades on Nasdaq, is to pay Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) in
shares for a 52.17 per cent stake in Cellular Telecom Ltd, the trading
subsidiary of Cellular Telecom Holdings.
The UK company will have the option to sell the remaining 47.83 per cent for
a further Dollars 2.7m in shares.
Cellular Telecom is an airtime services provider for the Vodafone and
Cellnet networks and is 19 per cent owned by the offshore family interests
of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur.
Mr Smith is best known for his links with a number of quoted natural
resource companies, two of which are under investigation by the Serious
Fraud Office.
Negotiations for the deal were conducted on behalf of the UK company by Mr
Robert Pollock, a former director of Cellular Telecom. Mr Pollock, a
discharged bankrupt, resigned from the board of Cellular Telecom in June
following controversy over the collapse of Alpine Double Glazing, where he
was chairman.
Health Care was delisted from the Toronto stock exchange after failing to
meet requirements for reverse takeovers. Under TSE rules, companies seeking
'backdoor listings' are required to issue a detailed information circular on
their business, and to obtain shareholders' approval for the transaction.
Most companies comply with these conditions rather than lose their listing.
But Health Care was keen to push through the Cellular Telecom deal as
quickly as possible, leaving insufficient time to issue the circular with
information on both companies or call a shareholders' meeting.
The deal was accompanied by two private placements to raise about CDollars
1.4m (Pounds 700,000) ' half of which was taken up by Oeri Finance of Basle
' for investment in Cellular Telecom.
Assuming the second placement is completed and the option to sell the
remaining stake called upon, Cellular Telecom's vendors will control about
52 per cent of the enlarged quoted company. Health Care will change its name
to Cellular Telecom &amp; Technologies.
Health Care provoked controversy about three years ago when the Ontario
Securities Commission forced it to withdraw profits forecasts following a
significant difference between statements in the 1988 listing prospectus and
the actual profits achieved in that year.
Mr Frank Strong, chairman, blamed bad publicity for failure to meet profit
projections. Health Care was best known at the time for Wipe Out, a
disinfectant which claimed to kill viruses on contact. Advertisements in US
tip sheets stated that Wipe Out could 'stop the spread of the deadly Aids
virus'. The US environmental Agency recently ordered the withdrawal of Wipe
Out.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Investors to vote on Beverley debt
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Beverley Group, the engineering concern previously known as
Petrocon, will decide on Monday whether to sell a number of businesses and
properties to a vehicle controlled by its directors in a series of complex
deals which the company said was designed to reduce debt.
Investors will also be asked to approve the sale of Gall Thomson Marine,
Beverley's most profitable subsidiary, to Villiers, the USM-quoted
engineering company, for up to Pounds 4m.
In a prospectus sent to shareholders, dated December 31, Beverley proposes
to sell two wholly owned subsidiaries, Beverley Group (Almondsbury) Ltd
(BGAL) and ESL, for Pounds 1 each to Woodlands Grange Engineering, the
executive directors' privately owned company.
Beverley's three independent directors, advised by stockbroker Henry Cooke
Corporate Finance, recommend the transactions to shareholders as 'vital to
the group's future'.
However, some shareholders are believed to be unhappy with the property and
business disposals to Woodland Grange.
For example, the agreement leaves one of the subsidiaries being sold, BGAL,
with Pounds 237,000 in cash. The directors say this is equivalent to the
amount which Beverley would have paid in redundancies if it closed the
business. However, these employees will not be made redundant when ownership
is transferred.
The transactions also include the sale of ESL, a surveying subsidiary.
Beverley is writing off inter-company debt of Pounds 821,000 and repaying a
Pounds 359,000 bank overdraft. The circular says fully audited accounts for
all the businesses in ESL are not available after 1991.
Once they are part of Woodlands Grange, BGAL's employees will still be able
to provide management and administrative services to Beverley Group. Mr
Colin Robinson, chairman, said this allowed Beverley to retain access to its
acquisition team, when the time was ripe for expansion. Under the agreement,
fees for such services cannot exceed Pounds 70,000 this year, unless one
non-executive director approves an increase. Mr Robinson said Beverley had
decided not to close ESL because this would have entailed significant costs
for the company.
Woodlands Grange is also buying three properties from Beverley for a total
of Pounds 997,000, some Pounds 650,000 less than book value.
Shareholder concern is focused on the valuations of the properties,
including the head office at Woodlands Grange, Bristol, which is being sold
to the directors' private company for Pounds 612,000. The property is held
in Beverley's books at Pounds 1.1m.
Beverley will continue to occupy at least 50 per cent of the property for an
annual rent payable to Woodlands Grange Engineering of Pounds 51,000. The
circular says the lease contains an option allowing Beverley to occupy
further space in the building.
Another property, in Great Yarmouth, is being sold to Woodland Grange for
Pounds 185,000. This property yields net income of Pounds 48,000 a year.
Mr Robinson said that 'in order for the group to have adequate working
capital for its present requirements, it is necessary that the disposals are
approved by shareholders'.
Mr Robinson, who has previously worked for Gerald Ronson's Heron and Robert
Maxwell at Hollis Industries, took a stake in Petrocon in 1991 intending to
expand the group through acquisition.
The first purchase was Beverley, the vehicle for the private interests of Mr
Robinson, his wife, Eleanor, Mr Christopher Colbeck and Mr Michael Bridge.
Petrocon then changed its name to Beverley. Mr Colbeck, Mrs Robinson and Mr
Bridge are now directors of the quoted company.
Mr Robinson said recession and the discovery of 'significant problems' in
Petrocon had forced the board to abandon its expansion strategy.
The group also incurred substantial costs last year in its abortive and
highly controversial Pounds 35m bid for James Wilkes, the rival engineering
company.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hewitt shares drop 18p after profits
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning yesterday from Hewitt Group that profits for 1993 would be below
market expectations prompted an 18p fall in the share price to 185p.
Directors said the maker of industrial ceramics and refractories had
incurred a 'small profit' before tax for the year, including an exceptional
gain of some Pounds 280,000 from the sale of a quoted investment.
Two factors were blamed for the setback - pre-tax profits for 1992 amounted
to Pounds 832,000.
Second half sales at the German operation were below expectations due to a
delay in a contractor completing an essential capital investment project;
and year on year sales of storage heater blocks were lower, reflecting a
lack of new property development.
Although a 'significant uplift' in demand for blocks, particularly by German
customers, had been experienced in the last two months of 1993, it had come
too late to compensate for lower activity during the second and third
quarters.
Year-end gearing was about 80 per cent with a third of net borrowings short
term. At midway, gearing stood at 64 per cent. It was expected to fall in
the second half.
The directors said the outlook for 1994 was 'encouraging, with strong order
books'.
It was their intention to maintain the final dividend at 1.75p for a 3.25p
(3p) total.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wray raises Carlisle interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nigel Wray, executive chairman of Burford Holdings, the property group,
is set to become non-executive chairman of Carlisle Group after he increases
his interest in the property services company.
The move accompanied a warning that 1993 pre-tax losses were expected to
rise from Pounds 947,000 to Pounds 2.85m.
Under a planned cash raising Mr Wray, and companies and trusts in which he
has an interest, will acquire between 39.82 per cent and 54.76 per cent of
Carlisle. The requirement to make a full offer has been waived by the
Takeover Panel.
Mr Wray, who at present has a 10.2 per cent holding, is subscribing for
27.3m shares at 11p to raise a net Pounds 2.71m. He will replace as chairman
Mr Jonathan Harris, who will become deputy chairman and chief executive.
The company is also seeking to raise up to Pounds 3.04m through a rights
issue of 27.7m shares at 11p on a 1-for-1 basis. The offer is not
underwritten but undertakings have been received to take up 32.95 per cent.
The shares rose 3p to close at 36 1/2 p.
The new shares will have a nominal value of 10p. It is proposed to split the
existing 25p shares into one 10p and one 15p deferred.
The total proceeds will be used to buy the head leasehold interest in
Carlisle's London headquarters for Pounds 2.35m from Mr Jonathan Harris and
his brother Richard. The balance will go for working capital.
The company said that the money was needed to ensure it reached the critical
mass required to progress as a listed company.
Losses are expected to rise because of an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.75m
relating to the closure of its Hirshfields offshoot during the year allowing
the company to concentrate on its Pepper Angliss &amp; Yarwood operation.
As part of the planned changes Mr Jonathan Harris and Mr Clifford Toye,
director responsible for property services, will take pay cuts in exchange
for an issue of warrants.
It is also proposed to offset the deficit on the profit and loss account by
cancelling the deferred shares, cancelling the capital redemption reserve
and reduction of the share premium account.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Medeva US rehabilitation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Food and Drug Administration has rehabilitated a US subsidiary of
Medeva, the UK drugs company, seven months after it issued a warning that a
plant in California did not meet production standards.
Last June, the FDA followed up its warning by asking US government agencies
not to renew contracts with MD Pharmaceutical, whose plant near Los Angeles
had been criticised.
Medeva said that the FDA, 'had determined that (MD) may once again be
considered as a supplier of drug products to agencies of the US government.'
Mr Bernard Taylor, Medeva's chairman, said that the total cost to the
company of meeting the FDA's criticisms had been about Pounds 1m. There
would be further annual costs of 'less than Pounds 1m' in maintaining the
new practices at the plant.
No contracts had been lost during the last seven months, said Mr Taylor,
because the first renewal dates were not until March.
Sales of the drug made at MD's plant - an amphetamine called methylphenidate
 -were worth Pounds 23m in 1992.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Objections to Robb's job at Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional investors in Wellcome have voiced their objections to the
appointment yesterday of Mr John Robb as both chairman and chief executive
of the drugs company.
Mr Robb conceded that 'of the 10 or so institutional investors consulted
over the decision . . . one voiced serious object-ions.'
But another institutional shareholder pointed to part of the company's
annual report last year which affirmed its commitment to the principle of
splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive between two people.
'It seems unfortunate that (the Wellcome board) combed the length and
breadth of Britain and have not been able to find a suitable candidate', he
said.
The company's choice for chairman, Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman of
Christies International, the auctioneer, and former chairman of Guinness,
the drinks group, was yesterday appointed deputy chairman.
'He allowed it to be known that he would not accept the post of chairman',
said Mr Clive Thompson, a non-executive director of Wellcome and chief
executive of Rentokil, the services group.
Mr Robb, who has been acting chairman of Wellcome since the summer, defended
his appointment against criticisms that it was contrary to the
recommendations of the 1992 Cadbury report on corporate governance, which
also recommended that the roles be split.
'There is too much emphasis on splitting the roles rather than getting the
right people at the top.'
Mr Thompson backed Mr Robb saying that 'the chemistry of the board members
is more important than the structure of the board'.

Pearson, the UK media group which owns the Financial Times, yesterday

Camco International, the Houston-based oil services company.
Last month Pearson raised Pounds 200m from the flotation on the New York
Stock Exchange of 55 per cent of Camco, then a wholly owned subsidiary. The
underwriters had a 30-day option to buy a further 8.25 per cent of Camco on
the same terms as for the initial offering.
Yesterday the options were exercised on 900,000 shares. Pearson now holds a

Jones Stroud (Holdings), the Nottingham-based textile and electrical
accessories group, blamed 'deteriorating conditions' in its European markets
for an 11 per cent contraction in interim profits.
Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said the downturn - from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds
2.92m - in the six months to end-September, reflected lower exports and
difficulties in recouping increased raw material costs following sterling's
devaluation.
Turnover improved to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 34.2m). Mr Jones said that action
had been taken to reduce costs and improve productivity but 'beneficial
effects will not become apparent until the next financial year'.
Earnings per share dipped to 11.4p (12.32p) but the interim dividend goes up
0.2p to 3.5p.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gander launches Pounds 2.7m rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gander Holdings, which switched its main area of operations from gold
exploration to property when recently it acquired Timeoften, a London
residential property developer, has launched a 1-for-2 rights issue at 6p
per share to raise Pounds 2.7m.
The company said that the proceeds, along with additional banking
facilities, would enable Gander to exploit the growing opportunities in the
housing market, especially in Chelsea and Kensington, where it has
identified shortages of studio accommodation and apartments.
Mr Oliver Vaughan, chief executive, added that Gander intended to seek a
full listing, once it had the necessary trading record. Currently its shares
are traded under Rule 535(2).

NatWest Bancorp, the US retail banking subsidiary of National Westminster
Bank, reported a rise in net profits from Dollars 155.2m to Dollars 298.1m
(Pounds 201.4m) for the year ended December 31.
Mr John Tugwell, chairman and chief executive, attributed the rise to the
bank's ability 'to control the growth in operating expenses and to improve
productivity.' Fourth-quarter income was also 92 per cent ahead, from
Dollars 50m to Dollars 96.1m.
The results included previously unrecorded Federal tax benefits of Dollars
29m for the quarter and Dollars 70m for the full year.
The bank said that the year had benefited from 'a considerable improvement
in asset quality and the continued growth and diversification of core
products.'

Christmas trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argos yesterday became the latest retailer to report strong trading in the
crucial Christmas period, with sales up 18 per cent, writes Neil Buckley.
With new space accounting for 5 percentage points of the increase, and
inflation for about 1 point, Mr Bob Stewart, finance director, said the
like-for-like increase for the five weeks to Christmas was about 12 per
cent.
The catalogue retailer's strong performance helped like-for-like growth in
the second half of 1993 rise to 8 per cent, against 5.9 per cent in the
first six months.
Total sales growth for the year was 10 per cent - above market estimates.
Analysts upgraded their profits forecasts for the year from Pounds
79m-Pounds 80m to about Pounds 82m.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: GKN prepares for Pounds 12m sale of Indian
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is preparing to
sell for Pounds 11.9m its 46.7 per cent stake in Guest Keen Williams, the
Indian engineering and fastenings company.
Its agreement to sell the holding for cash to a group of international
investors will still leave GKN with a substantial presence in India through
other manufacturing ventures in the automotive sector.
Along with China, India is widely seen by the world's motor industry as one
of the biggest potential car and truck growth markets over the coming
decades.
Guest Keen Williams has a more generalised business in stampings, presswork
and fastenings and, like many other businesses GKN has disposed of
previously, is no longer seen as relevant to the group's core activities.
The buyers are a group of investors represented by Mr YF Lombard, managing
partner of Bearbull Zurich, and Mr BD Bangur of Graphite India. Completion
of the deal is subject to formal approval by the Reserve Bank of India.
'The sale is part of a planned divestment programme of non-strategic
interests,' said Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman.
It will continue to service the Indian automotive sector through Invel
Transmissions (constant velocity joints), XLO-GWB Cardan Shafts (propeller
shafts and universal joints) and Mahindra Sintered Products (bearings and
bushes).

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: War of words continues over LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle of statement and counter statement between London Weekend
Television and Granada continued yesterday as the London ITV company
attacked Granada for its 'vague and woolly' documents.
In a letter to shareholders Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, asked a
series of questions ranging from inquiries about the rate of decline of
Granada's rental business to whether advertising sales house contracts would
have to be unscrambled if the hostile Granada bid succeeded.
Granada instantly replied with answers to LWT's 'facile' questions. They
included the information that last year operating profits from the rental
business rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 105m and a promise to reorganise the
two sales houses involved, The Time Exchange and Laser, 'when its bid
succeeds'.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, denounced the 'smokescreen'
put up by its rival and said the deal was still the best bet for the future
of LWT.
Meanwhile, a decision by the Takeover Panel means that the war of words can
go on until the Office of Fair Trading decides whether or not to refer the
bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI to report quarterly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI, the London-based leisure and electronics group, is to publish its
trading results on a quarterly basis in line with new guidelines from the
Stock Exchange.
The Exchange has published a consultative document on insider dealing which
urges companies to make quarterly statements in order to keep all investors
more regularly informed of its trading position.
More frequent reporting would mean that less information is held closely
within a company or by its advisers, thus reducing the opportunity to trade
on inside information.
But the Exchange's consultative committee, which included representatives of
the 100 Committee of Finance Directors and several shareholders' groups,
stopped short of calling for full quarterly trading statements such as those
issued regularly in the US. Large UK companies whose shares are traded in
the US already provide quarterly statements, and several leading UK
shareholders have called for more regular public statements from companies
in order to limit the risk of insider dealing.
Mr Simon Duffy, group finance director at Thorn, said the company would have
begun producing quarterly reports regardless of the Exchange's
recommendations. About 18 months ago, the company instituted a new financial
reporting system for internal management accounting.
'We found we could produce quarterly reports with zero incremental costs.'
Thorn said the system it has developed is commercially available to others
and the company is in discussions with 'a number of other people' about
selling its system to them.
Mr Duffy added that Thorn has no view about whether companies should be
required to publish quarterly trading statements. 'There are some businesses
where it is appropriate, others where it is not so useful,' he said.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Son of BES' will only work if it is
affordable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R M GRAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chancellor's proposals for a successor to the Business Expansion
Scheme (dubbed 'son of BES'), the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the
extension of capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs re-investing in
unquoted trading companies is to be welcomed, provided the next reading of
the Finance Bill does not throw unwelcome and unnecessary hurdles in the
way.
One of the problems for entrepreneurs seeking investors, and for their
accountants and other investment advisers, is the prohibitive cost of
producing investment memoranda to comply with complex legislation on
prospectuses or investment advertisements. While I understand that the
principal aim of the Companies Acts and Financial Services Act legislation
is to protect investors, financial advisers may be hesitant or even totally
reluctant to send business propositions to potential investors, 'business
angels', for fear of falling foul of the law.
Let us hope that the deregulation measures announced by the chancellor to
cut red tape will widen the category of investors exempt from the Financial
Services Act and prescribe the minimum contents for a simple investment
proposal which entrepreneurs and advisers could prepare without being caught
out by current legislation.
It would be a lost opportunity if a number of 'business angels' emerged
ready to invest their profits from Stock Exchange securities and were
prevented from receiving investment propositions from unquoted companies or
their advisers because of over-zealous legislation.
I regard it as important that smaller companies should be able to raise
equity capital without incurring undue expense in complying with rules
established to protect the public at large.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY LISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging' (January 12), calling on those
who see a positive future for self-regulation in the retail financial
services industry to state their views, will find support among building
societies. The Building Societies Association has been consistent in its
support for the Personal Investment Authority concept and the principles
described in the letter ('SIB warning for investment body', January 13) from
Securities and Investments Board chairman Andrew Large. The promised change
in standards and the predominance of public interest representatives on the
board have been regarded as particularly important.
To abandon the PIA now, after 18 months of planning, would lead to years of
uncertainty as parliament debated and enacted legislation and civil servants
faced the task of implementation. Consumers, and the financial services
industry, deserve better than this.
The PIA is chaired by a former chairman of the Association of British
Insurers and chief executive of one of the country's largest insurance
companies. It will incorporate nine representatives of the industry (far
more than would be members of any statutory board) and draw on a range of
expertise from other sectors of the economy. Building societies believe the
PIA offers an excellent chance of providing the necessary reassurance to
customers that the industry truly has their best interests at heart, while
also ensuring that the industry view is heard.
A range of significant issues in relation to the PIA remain to be resolved.
It is important that all in the industry work together to overcome these
difficulties.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Haggling over the price of peace: The significance of
tomorrow's US-Syria summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Syria's state media could hardly have raised expectations much higher for
tomorrow's summit in Switzerland between President Bill Clinton and
President Hafez al-Assad. It is, trumpeted The Syria Times, 'one of the most
important meetings of Geneva's history, and perhaps the history of the
Middle East'.
In the melee of Damascus's ancient Hamadiya souq, or market, the view is
more circumspect, however. Traders in its grid of alleys have found buyers
for its silver and silk over centuries among Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,
Romans and Turks. They are not persuaded that tomorrow heralds the immediate
prospect of bus loads of Israeli shoppers. 'The meeting will help the
atmosphere,' says Samad, a young shop owner. 'Peace is important to us, of
course, but difficult. We need time.'
The true significance of tomorrow's meeting, for Syria, lies somewhere
between the media hype and the caution of the souq. For Mr Assad, a cautious
and wily strategist whose main preoccupation has long been maintaining his
iron grip on Syria, it lies in the symbolism of the event itself - and that
is the main reason for the media fanfare. A summit with the leader of the
world's sole superpower confirms for Mr Assad his centrality to the Middle
East peace process and his regional leadership. As one state newspaper said:
'A giant will meet with a giant.'
It is only Mr Assad's fourth meeting with a US president in 23 years of
rule, the last being with Mr George Bush in Geneva in 1990. Then, Syria
sealed its participation in the anti-Iraq Gulf war coalition and the two
leaders exchanged the initial promises which made the present Middle East
peace process possible. Mr Assad will want to hear Mr Clinton repeat those
promises which brought him to the negotiating table in 1991: that the US is
committed to a 'just and comprehensive' regional peace, which for Syria
entails a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied since
1967; and that the US will guarantee any bilateral agreement with the Jewish
state.
Just as important for Mr Assad - and many in Damascus maintain it is more
vital - is his hope that the summit can deliver a substantial improvement in
Syrian-US relations. 'He wants more than the Golan back; he wants a new
relationship with the US,' says one observer, 'and he wants this as badly as
anything.' Here lie Syria's real expectations of the summit.
According to many diplomats, the real 'breakthrough' on the peace front
arguably took place in Damascus last December when Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, was able to announce Syria's willingness to resume full
peace talks with Israel in Washington. Mr Assad had previously insisted
there could be no such resumption without an explicit Israeli commitment to
a full withdrawal from the Golan. But Mr Christopher's shuttle between
Jerusalem and Damascus, and private undertakings to Mr Assad, are believed
to have persuaded the Syrian leader that such a deal was feasible in
principle. 'Mr Assad's decision to return to the talks shows he has made the
strategic decision to make peace,' says a European diplomat in Damascus.
Details of such a deal - a 'full' Israeli withdrawal in return for a 'full'
peace between Syria and the Jewish state - remain to be worked out. This
would be the meat of talks in Washington, which could resume within weeks of
a successful summit. At such talks, Mr Assad would place a high premium on
direct US engagement, since Syria believes that only US pressure and
involvement can exact the right terms for peace from Israel and hold the
Israelis to them. Mr Assad has always profoundly distrusted Israel's desire
to divide its Arab neighbours and negotiate deals with them one by one. It
is a distrust Syrian officials say was vindicated by the secret deal in Oslo
between Israel and the Palestinians, which they consider deeply flawed.
But Mr Assad also wants a 'full' peace with Washington, which since 1976 has
maintained Syria on its list of state sponsors of terrorism.
In addition to Syrian membership of the anti-Iraq Gulf war alliance,
Damascus's help in freeing western hostages from Lebanon was part of a shift
towards the west. Increasingly, according to western diplomats, the Syrian
president has come to appreciate the security of his regime and his
country's prosperity depend on rapprochement with the west, notably the US.
The reasons are manifold. They include the loss of the Soviet Union as his
chief strategic ally and the failure of the communist model, whose
political, military and economic centralisation Syria has long imitated.
But economic pressures have also grown. Although Syria has enjoyed a burst
of post-Gulf war prosperity, this is founded on a one-off bonanza from
limited oil discoveries, cash rewards from the Gulf states for Syria's
participation in the campaign against Iraq and some good recent harvests.
Its economic problems are set to worsen. Syrian unemployment stands at 20
per cent and is rising; there are serious infrastructural inadequacies,
particularly in power generation; and it has an unmanageable 3.8 per cent
birth rate, one of the highest in the developing world. On Syria's present,
isolated course, as one western diplomat puts it, 'Assad knows he will be
faced with a half-educated population, no jobs, no prospects for the middle
class and, perhaps, people starting to say 'Islam is the solution'.'
The Syrian leader has clearly concluded that none of these problems can be
properly tackled unless his country can win access to western capital and
aid, and he sees warmer ties with the US as critical to this process. But
Syrian links with terrorist leaders such as Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal, and
its backing for Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Lebanese faction - the reason it
was included on the US's list of terrorist states in 1976 - remain big
obstacles to an improvement in relations.
While it stays on that list, Syria is ineligible for US credits or aid and
is prohibited from importing US products, including computers, aircraft,
aircraft spares and related technology. Perhaps as important as any
restriction, however, is the symbolism of pariah status entailed by
inclusion on the list.
US officials have made it plain Syria will not be lifted from the list
tommorrow, or at all, while it supports Hezbollah and harbours men such as
Jibril and other Palestinian 'rejectionists'. Yet nobody in Damascus expects
Mr Assad to relinquish the 'portfolio of options', as one diplomat puts it,
which such groups offer Syria as part of its bargaining position with Israel
 -not, that is, until a peace deal is sealed.
A 'full' peace between the US and Syria is, thus, likely to prove impossible
until Mr Assad has sealed the same with Israel. For Mr Assad, says one
European diplomat, 'the main obstacle on the road to normalisation of
relations with Washington is Israel'.
This is not to suggest that Mr Assad will agree to peace with Israel at any
price. His price, return of the Golan and an 'honourable' settlement with
Israel's other neighbours, has remained immutable. But his appearance with
Mr Clinton in Geneva tomorrow suggests Mr Assad believes a deal is
obtainable.
If and when this proves so, the souq will be ready. 'It is the same for us,'
says Samad the merchant. 'There is no liking here for the Jews, but we can
sell to anyone.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Rush to place their bets: Gambling is a fast-growing
industry in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the US gone gambling crazy? You bet. Never have punters had so many
opportunities to be parted from their money. With casinos and other forms of
gaming proliferating throughout the US, the nation appears to be in the grip
of a gambling frenzy.
Last month the world's biggest casino opened in Las Vegas. Part of the
Dollars 1bn MGM Grand resort, it features 165 gaming tables and 3,500 slot
machines in a gaming area bigger than the playing field at Yankee Stadium.
The MGM Grand is just the latest of three mega-casinos to open in Las Vegas.
Its arrival came a few weeks after the opening of the Dollars 450m Treasure
Island, a themed hotel and casino featuring hourly mock battles between
pirates and the British navy on two 90ft frigates. A few days before that
came the opening of the Dollars 390m Luxor hotel and casino, a vast
pyramid-shaped structure on an Egyptian theme in which guests are carried
from reception to the elevators on an indoor river Nile.
But more significantly, gambling has started to spread across the country. A
quirk in the law has allowed Indian tribes to set up casinos on their
reservations: at the last count 65 had been established in 17 states. More
than 20 riverboat casinos have started operating in Mississippi and
Illinois, and neighbouring states have authorised many more. State lotteries
have legitimised the gambling habit in 37 states. Only Utah and Hawaii are
gambling-free.
As the opportunities for gambling have increased, so have the stakes. The
total amount gambled on slot machines, gaming tables, lotteries and racing
grew by 8.4 per cent to a staggering Dollars 330bn in 1992. True, the
punters won a lot of that back: but the Dollars 30bn they lost was more than
the nation's total spending on cinema tickets, books, records and spectator
sports combined.
Ten years ago, the US gambling industry was barely a third its present size.
The only states allowing casinos were Nevada and New Jersey, where punters
placed bets totalling Dollars 100bn a year. Elsewhere, about Dollars 15bn a
year was wagered on horse and greyhound racing, and another Dollars 4bn was
spent on a handful of state lotteries.
One factor spurring the industry's sudden growth has been the spread of the
lottery. State governments needing to raise revenues have found it hard to
resist the idea of using lotteries to avoid the alternative of higher taxes.
In doing so they have not only widened public acceptability of gambling, but
compromised their ability to argue against it in other forms.
Simultaneously, the gambling industry has been at pains to clean up its act.
Once predominantly a male activity associated with smoke-filled rooms, green
eye shades and organised crime, it has broadened its appeal by combining the
gambling experience with dining, cabaret, shopping or tourism.
Lotteries apart, gambling's most remarkable advance in geographical terms
has been the appearance of large numbers of casinos on the Indian
reservations - a phenomenon arising from the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of
1988, which allowed Indians to offer games of chance if the same games were
legal elsewhere in the state.
Soon after the act took effect, it had unforeseen consequences when the
state of Connecticut interpreted it as including games of chance used in
charity fund-raising, which embraced just about everything. The state's
poverty-stricken Mashantucket Pequot tribe took the law at its word and
found financial backing for the construction of the Foxwoods casino on its
reservation in Ledyard, south-east Connecticut.
With the nearest competition several hours' drive away in Atlantic City,
Foxwoods flourished - as did its many imitators. Now, gambling in Indian
reservation casinos is big business: the value of bets taken at the tables
and slot machines shot up from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 15bn in 1992, and
continues to grow fast.
Meanwhile, the geographical spread of gambling has taken another direction.
In 1988 Iowa decided gambling could encourage tourism, and passed a law
allowing riverboat casinos to operate. The attraction of this device was
that riverboats could be justified as a re-creation of America's
19th-century paddleboats, while keeping them in the water separated them
from the rest of the community, and made them easier to control.
The casinos proved a success. Soon neighbouring states started authorising
riverboat casinos too. The amount of money handled rose from Dollars 1.1bn
in 1991 to Dollars 7.3bn in 1992, and licence applications pending or
granted are expected to take the number of riverboat casinos to more than 60
by 1995.
As casinos have spread from the traditional gambling centres of Las Vegas
and Atlantic City to Indian reservations and riverboats, the rest of the US
has started asking why it should not join in the spree. Many big cities are
considering the possibility of legitimising casino gambling in one form or
another: Philadelphia has already authorised its first riverboat casino; the
mayor of Washington DC has suggested that the revenues from casino gambling
could provide a remedy for the city's financial problems; and the mayor of
Chicago has proposed a Dollars 2bn gambling and entertainment complex for
the city centre.
Technology is also playing its part in encouraging the gambling habit. Many
punters feel more comfortable playing a machine than playing a human being:
for one thing, they feel a machine is less likely to cheat. Advances in
technology have offered a proliferation of increasingly sophisticated
electronic gaming devices, such as video poker machines.
Looking to the future, technology could further extend the market by
offering gambling opportunities through the electronic super-highways now
beginning to evolve - in other words, allowing people to gamble in their
homes by taking part in interactive casino games using cable channels and
their television screens.
But can gambling really go on growing at its present rate? It depends. Some
gambling markets already seem to be at, or near, maturity. For example, the
amount of money staked on bingo, racing and the older-established lotteries
has hardly changed in the past few years. But if the legitimisation of
casino gambling continues, the growth in that sector may have only just
begun.
Mr Eugene Martin Christiansen of Christiansen/Cummings Associates, a New
York consultancy specialising in leisure industries, points out that the
growth in casino gambling is unusual because it is driven by pent-up
consumer demand.
Clearly, the growth is not limitless. At some point, supply and demand will
come into balance. This is already happening at Las Vegas - hence the
development of new hotel/theme park/casino complexes like the MGM Grand,
Treasure Island and the Luxor, which are aimed at drawing in customers by
providing them and their families with ever more entertaining sideshows to
the casino itself. Many of those customers will come from other Las Vegas
casinos, not from newly created markets.
Even so, statistical evidence suggests people will on average spend about 1
per cent of personal income on gambling, given the opportunity. In 1992, the
amount spent on gambling across the US represented just 0.65 per cent of
personal income. Seen in those terms, the industry's growth has a long way
to go.
The one thing that could stop it, of course, is an outbreak of moral
indignation over gambling's spread, leading to the reimposition of legal
constraints. As yet, in spite of objections in some states to the spread of
video poker machines because some people are playing them compulsively,
there is little evidence to suggest such a backlash is likely.
Perhaps gambling has entered the mainstream entertainment industry for good.
But as Mr Christiansen notes, the history of US society is permeated with
violent swings between liberalism and conservatism in attitudes to supposed
vices: the US is, after all, the land that once prohibited alcohol. The
gambling industry's comfort lies in the ultimate failure of that notorious
attempt by the US to come between its citizens and their pleasure.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Yen for a better life: Former Japanese salarymen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loyal to his superiors, eager to work long hours and willing to sacrifice
family and friends to the company's cause, the Japanese salaryman has been
the driving force behind the country's postwar rise to become an economic
superpower.
But as the Japanese economy goes through a severe recession, and the
government prepares another stimulus package - due to be unveiled next week
 -the salaryman's unquestioning dedication to his employer is waning.
In May, Mr Kunitake Fujita, 51, left IBM Japan, where he had worked loyally
for 28 years, to take up a career as a social welfare worker, helping
disabled people earn a living.
Each day, the former IBM personnel manager commutes 80 minutes from his home
in central Tokyo to the plain, two-storey Aoba Work Centre, a private
organisation that aims to provide disabled people with skills training and
an income. The centre is next to a fermented bean factory - a world away
from his days in the high-technology, glass-and-concrete headquarters of IBM
Japan.
But his new job fulfils him in a way that life at IBM never did. 'I believe
my work at IBM contributed to social good but only in an indirect way. Here,
I feel every day that I am contributing to society and that gives me a
purpose in life.'
Until Mr Fujita decided to leave IBM, he had not thought about what he
wanted to do with the rest of his life. What changed all that was a
four-week holiday, which was a reward from IBM for his long service.
Mr Fujita had never had so much free time, and found the experience
disturbing. 'I found that I did not know what to do and that I was
completely cut off from society. It is frightening to see yourself doing
nothing, frittering the time away.'
This gave him his first glimpse of what life would be like after retirement
for someone who had depended so much on company life for his own personal
fulfilment. Nine months later, he was one of 1,600 employees who signed up
for the IBM's early retirement programme, which he had helped to draw up as
the company tried to cut costs.
Similar motives led Mr Shingo Shibayama to leave his job in the legal
department of Mitsui and Co, a trading company, to become a teacher at the
age of 57. Like Mr Fujita, Mr Shibayama was a dedicated company man with
more than 30 years' service. He had thrived in his job as a legal
specialist, travelling to different parts of the world. 'The trading house
is like a theatre as big as the grand Kabuki theatre and I was very happy to
go on stage there.'
But he says Mitsui employees who are not offered an executive position by
the age of 57 must choose between moving to a subsidiary, or becoming an
adviser known as a madogiwazoku (or someone who sits by the window with
little work to do).
Neither fate appealed to Mr Shibayama. If he went to a subsidiary, he would
have had to retire at 63. 'I am a work-aholic,' Mr Shibayama says. 'My
generation has lived for work alone. I cannot imagine myself not working. I
have hobbies, but I can't stand being at home. After so many years of
company life, home has become a place where I just eat and sleep.'
So when the offer of the post of professor came from Nisho Gakusha, a
private university in Chiba prefecture, just outside Tokyo, Mr Shibayama
decided to take it. He would then have the chance of working until about 70.
A determination to carry on working for as long as possible also led Mr
Tetsushi Saitoh, 55, to give up his job as an executive at Marubeni, a
trading house.
Now Mr Saitoh gets up at 2.30 every morning to work the early shift at a
convenience store he runs with his son in Shzuoka, two hours on the train
from Tokyo. He worries about how well the products on the shelves are
selling, about whether he is able to satisfy customers' needs.
Like Mr Fujita and Mr Shibayama, he was able to take advantage of a
retirement programme of a kind run by many blue-chip Japanese companies to
encourage employees to start new careers. Generous terms often mean they can
maintain income levels relatively easily.
Although it is a far cry from the high-flying lifestyle of employees at
Japan's large trading houses, Mr Saitoh takes pride in his store and in the
decision he made. 'I decided to do this myself. That is completely different
from having to do something because the boss tells you to.'
The best thing about running a convenience store, he says, is that there is
no retirement. Like others who have made the transition from big companies,
his salaryman's instinctive loyalty and stamina are undiminished.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mother does not want to be a burden
on her daughter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs SHIRLEY FIRTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr L J S Evans's letter (January 12) posed the question 'What does
mother think?' regarding views expressed by my daughter. Well, mother does
not want to live with daughter either, especially when I become old, infirm,
incontinent, and so on.
I quite understand my daughter's sentiment and her very practical wish to
provide for elderly members of her family. I, too, would welcome a policy to
which I could contribute, along with my children if they so wished, while I
am still financially able to do so. What parent wants to burden offspring
with the added responsibility of becoming carers, especially when they have
families, careers and lives to lead.
As our health service appears to be falling into rapid decline, and decent
residential homes for the elderly become increasingly expensive and
therefore elitist, let's hope some other institutions - friendly societies
or others - start to look at the problem.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition not working in
cross-Channel fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K D SHILLETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's report ('Tunnel prompts Stena to simplify ferry
fares', January 5) on the 'simplification' of Stena Line cross-Channel fares
appears to indicate another huge rise in some tariffs, particularly for a
car with driver only or even with single passenger. For these travellers the
increase, particularly during the summer months, will represent a much
greater rise than the 'couple of per cent' vaguely indicated by the
operators.
This is typical of the arrogant and rapacious attitude of the ferry
companies towards travellers since announcement of the construction of the
Channel tunnel.
One is persuaded that they have deliberately raised their almost identical
fares way beyond inflation almost every year, confident that the eventual
Chunnel tariffs could not compete with them if necessary cash flow to
service mounting debt was to be raised.
They have now set a comfortable 'floor' for the tunnel while castly
increasing their own profit potential. There is a smell of collusion about
this cost-push manoeuvre which involves not only the ferry operators but the
tunnel management as well.
Dr Stefan Szymanski of Imperial College has written a paper, already
referred to in your newspaper, that clearly indicates progressive and
unwarrantable raising of ferry tariffs since the announcement of the
tunnel's construction. It is to be hoped that the Office of Fair Trading and
the EU competition office are closely monitoring this pocket-picking of the
public.
Cross-Channel ferry tariffs have been set far above any comparative journey
in Europe for as long as I can remember. Why should the advent of an
additional alternative send up passenger costs even further? That is not
competition or the working of a 'market'.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Country gent in exchange of fire: Is the new chairman of the
London Stock Exchange the right man for the job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Kemp-Welch, the joint senior partner of Cazenove and Company whose
appointment as chairman of the London Stock Exchange was confirmed this
week, combines the patrician charm and driving ambition common to many
partners in his stockbroking firm.
He can appear a self-effacing countryman, whose main interests are walking
near his Perthshire home and shooting gamebirds.
But as joint senior partner since 1980 of London's most conservative and
discreet stockbroker, he has shown business acumen. While rival brokers have
expanded recklessly and experienced volatile swings in profits, Cazenove has
developed more gradually.
Its partners are proud of the fact that, as far as they know, the firm has
never made a loss in any quarter in its 170-year history. In the past two
years it has earned more than ever before, they say - though figures have
never been published to show the firm's performance.
The recent fortunes of the Stock Exchange have been less blessed. Most
damaging was the cancellation last March of the Taurus project to modernise
the antiquated system for settling and registering share transactions. This
prompted the resignation of Mr Peter Rawlins as the exchange's chief
executive.
New and powerful competitive challenges to the exchange have also emerged.
Continental bourses, such as in Paris, are taking active steps to regain the
cross-border trade in shares - involving investors from their own countries
 -that they have lost to London. Attempts are also being made by Tradepoint
and other financial services companies to establish systems for buying and
selling UK shares in direct competition with the exchange's own system,
called Seaq.
Meanwhile, the exchange has been slow to agree a plan to establish a market
for shares in young companies. This market would replace the Unlisted
Securities Market, which the exchange has decided to close in 1996 because
it has lost its distinctive identity.
So the appointment of Mr Kemp-Welch comes at a delicate moment in the
exchange's 220 year history. The choice of the 57-year-old Cazenove man
represents a serious desire by the exchange and its members to modernise the
institution, but it also marks a recognition that some of its traditions
must be preserved: it was his ability to preserve parts of Cazenove's
culture while adapting the firm to unprecedented changes in market practices
that has given Mr Kemp-Welch the best track record as a business manager of
any recent exchange chairman. Cazenove was, for example, the only leading
firm to retain a partnership structure at the time of the 'Big Bang'
deregulation of the London financial market in 1986.
'I can't think of anyone better to do the job,' commented Peter
Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett, one of Cazenove's rivals, whose
father was Mr Kemp-Welch's predecessor at Cazenove. 'But I was quite
surprised he took it.'
This surprise stems from a longstanding reluctance on the part of successful
brokers to become intimately involved in the management of the exchange
because it was regarded as dull and boring. The chairman of a rival
securities firm said: 'There used to be a widely held view that the market
was pretty robust, that it would look after itself and we could just
concentrate on making money. But we have all woken up to the fact that the
success of each firm depends to a considerable extent on the efficiency of
systems operated by the exchange.'
For instance, the system for settling transactions and recording share
ownership has been in need of replacement for a decade. So the collapse of
the Taurus project fully to computerise the operations has been a painful
lesson. It cost the exchange and its members hundreds of millions of pounds,
and showed individual firms that complacency about the exchange could be
dangerous.
Another reminder of the need to be involved in the exchange's affairs came
in November, when the ageing Seaq system for displaying share price
information to members broke down for four hours when a computer component
failed.
The current chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who stands down on July 14, has
been criticised by some City firms for such failures. He is regarded as
having been slow to react to warning signs that development of the
settlement system was running into trouble, and should perhaps have started
work earlier on a new trading system. The chairman of a leading securities
firm said: 'Poor old Andrew relied far too much on Peter Rawlins to look
after the nitty-gritty.'
Sir Andrew did, however, oversee the abolition of the cumbersome Stock
Exchange council, comprising 32 representatives of member firms, and
replaced it with a 16-member board, made up of the heads of top broking
firms, a handful of exchange executives and influential representatives of
banks and fund management groups which use the exchange's services.
Superfluous jobs have been eliminated, as have a raft of committees and
sub-committees. 'Some of the credit for that must also go to Peter Rawlins,'
said Mr Kemp-Welch.
The new chairman is hesitant to go into too much detail about how he sees
the future of the exchange. 'I am six months away from taking up the post so
my view must be broad brush,' he said.
Another reason for not making too many pronouncements is that he has not as
yet discussed the division of responsibilities with the new chief executive,
Mr Michael Lawrence, who has been poached from the Prudential Corporation,
the big insurer.
'The chairman's main role must be to make sure the board is functioning
properly, that it is getting the information to allow it to make the right
decisions,' Mr Kemp-Welch said, who believes the exchange has only three
core functions:
Organising and regulating trading in the UK's central securities market;
Consolidating and improving the exchange's position in trading international
securities;
Acting as the listing authority for companies whose shares are traded on the
exchange. This means that it is supposed to vet the auditing procedures and
governance of those companies, though it has often been attacked for being
reluctant to take tough action against offenders.
On the other hand, Mr Kemp-Welch believes certain elements of the exchange's
regulatory functions should be transferred to another authority, probably a
strengthened Securities and Investments Board. These would include
monitoring share transactions for signs of illegal insider dealing - the
current system has been singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting suspected
insider dealers.
He was also noncommittal on whether to fight for a prominent role in
managing or owning the new share settlement system, called Crest, which has
been developed at the Bank of England's initiative since the collapse of
Taurus. 'I am very cautious on commenting for political reasons,' he said.
'The exchange may have a role.' This view is contrary to that of many
investors and securities firms.
The highest priority, he said, is to head off the threat from Tradepoint and
rival trading systems. As one former investment banker said, the exchange
will 'live or die on what its customers feel about it'.
If that is the key to success, then Mr Kemp-Welch could be viewed as
suitable for the job, because Cazenove has been successful in generating
goodwill among its clients (the companies which it advises on takeovers and
for which it sells securities, and the investment institutions buying these
shares). Many outsiders tend to see it as cliquey and nepotistic, however.
After 13 years at the helm, Mr Kemp-Welch and his fellow senior partner Mr
Anthony Forbes announced last April that they would stand down the following
April. Under them, Cazenove has consolidated its position as the leading
broker to UK companies. It has 222 quoted UK companies as clients, far more
than any rival, a large proportion of which are part of the FT-SE 100 index
of leading companies' shares.
Cazenove was able to rely on its closest customers among investment
institutions when it needed to raise money to preserve its independence at
the time of Big Bang. A handful lent the broker Pounds 32m of capital in the
form of subordinated loan stock. The interest on the stock is linked to the
firm's profitability. However, the levels of profits are not disclosed,
merely whether the year has been good or bad. Since it is normally a good
year - in 1992 the institutions received the maximum interest rate of
between 20 and 25 per cent - they have not exerted pressure for greater
financial transparency.
At the exchange, however, Mr Kemp-Welch will have to be far more open. The
chairman typically has to be a figurehead for the securities industry and
the City of London, making speeches and lobbying the government. Mr Andrew
Tuckey, chairman of Barings' merchant bank, said: 'That's the side he will
find most unfamiliar.'
Mr Kemp-Welch's character is marked by stubbornness: junior partners at
Cazenove note that he can be rather dictatorial. At the age of six, he lost
an eye. But Mr Kemp-Welch said the handicap gave him an incentive to prove
himself at his public school, Winchester, and may have been what has fuelled
his drive to succeed: 'The only time I missed it (the eye) was when playing
racquets. However I still played.' Friends say he is a remarkable shot.
He comes from a wealthy family - whose fortune stems from ownership, during
the 19th century of the Schweppes' patented process for putting fizz into
soft drinks - and his father was the second most powerful partner at
Cazenove after Antony Hornby in the immediate aftermath of the second world
war.
Though all Cazenove partners have the right to introduce one son or daughter
into the firm, Mr Kemp-Welch's father would not bring him on board until he
had proved he could survive elsewhere. So in 1954, at the age of 18, he
became a messenger at Hoare &amp; Co, working for the most aggressive
stockbroker of the time, Kit Hoare. He joined Cazenove in 1959.
More than 30 years later, Cazenove remains a uniquely English institution.
Its senior partners are educated at just two schools, Eton and Winchester,
and came from a handful of families. While securities markets have become
more international, it has opened foreign offices only gradually. It has no
offices at all in continental Europe.
Though this means that Cazenove has avoided the overheads carried by more
expansionist firms, such as S G Warburg, it has also meant it is tarnished
by a 'Little England' image. Rivals say in the long term its prospects are
limited by its concentration on domestic business.
In that sense, the choice of Mr Kemp-Welch as Stock Exchange chairman is a
risk. The future prosperity of the exchange and its members depend to an
significant extent on its ability to serve continental investors - and the
Cazenove charm will be far less relevant when it comes to meeting this
challenge than an ability to understand their needs.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Watchdogs are required
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been another week that the Conservative government would rather
forget.
It began with a wave of scandal breaking around the government's supporters
in Parliament. This ebbed somewhat with the announcement of the death of
Lady Caithness, wife of the junior transport minister whose marriage was
said to be in difficulty. But confusion has continued over exactly what the
prime minister meant with his back to basics campaign. Even if he did not
mean it to apply to ministers' behaviour, Conservative party members seem to
think that it should. Mr Major has looked indecisive in his unwillingness to
enforce the new morality on his own ministers.
The week ended with accusations of gerrymandering in the London Borough of
Westminster. This flagship of Conservative local government was feted
throughout the 1980s for its slick management and entrepreneurialism.
According to the district auditor, it was also using public money for
electoral advantage. Council flats were sold and homeless families ejected
from marginal wards to keep the borough Conservative.
More bad weeks are likely to follow. Taxpayers will feel the impact of hefty
tax increases announced in the last two Budgets at the start of the new
financial year in April. Local authority elections in May will provide an
early opportunity for the voters in London and other urban areas to register
dissatisfaction. And Conservative expectations for the European elections in
June are already being talked down.
On Monday, Mr Major must appear in front of the Scott inquiry, which is
investigating the scandal over the sale of arms to Iraq. The public
interrogation of the prime minister by such a tribunal is unprecedented in
recent British history. It is also likely to prove an uncomfortable
experience - as a succession of serving and former cabinet ministers have
already found.
Best way
Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, voiced the concern of senior
officials this week when he accused Lord Justice Scott of acting as
'detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge'. Yet the inquiry's procedures
are the best way to uncover the truth in a reasonable time to the
satisfaction of the public. When the inquiry's report appears later in the
year, it must be able to explain how three businessmen came to be prosecuted
for selling arms to Iraq when they had done it with the encouragement of a
government department.
There is, of course, nothing new in duplicity, deceit or corruption in
government. It is arguable that the democratic process is based on a
potentially corrupt bargain between voters and politicians. The latter bid
for the former's support by promising higher incomes, lower taxes or more
'free' services. The voters award the prize to the politicians who makes the
best and most plausible offer. Those who fail to deliver, however, can
expect to be found out and penalised in future elections.
Dividing line
And it will always be tempting for politicians to use the power of
government to improve their chances of holding on to it. Herbert Morrison,
the Labour leader of the old London county council, bragged that he would
'build the Conservatives out of London' by building council homes for
Labour-voting tenants. Many Conservatives believed that selling council
homes to their tenants would convert them into Tory voters. But while the
dividing line between legitimate housing policy and gerrymandering can be a
fine one, it can be drawn. If a council builds homes or sells them off with
the objective of changing the voting patterns of marginal wards, that line
has been crossed.
The dangers that power will be abused increase when there are long periods
of single-party rule. Parties which face no real challenge at the ballot box
increasingly discount the legislative niceties. Policy changes over arms
sales which could be embarrassing internationally are slipped through
without bothering to tell Parliament. Ministers avoid telling lies - but
they do not feel obliged to tell the whole truth either. They appoint their
own supporters to key posts in quangos or to plum jobs in local government.
Their officials forget their duty to serve the public good and become
enmeshed in party politics.
The checks and balances need to be cultivated and strengthened in one-party
states, whether at local or national level. Much more information needs to
be provided about decisions, for example, so that secrecy does not conceal
corruption. An appointments commission should oversee the thousands of
appointments to the growing numbers of quangos. Protecting the independence
of public servants from undue political pressures may require new measures,
including an independent appeals procedure if they feel pressured to act
improperly.
Above all, close scrutiny of the executive is required. The district auditor
has proved his worth. The Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and
the various ombudsmen can all help in preserving standards. The press, too,
has a role to play.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Men in the News: Gladiators in a war of words - Berlusconi,
Agnelli and De Benedetti / Italy's media magnates are spoiling for an
election fight along new political battle lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<TEXT>
By walking uninvited into an editorial meeting last week, Silvio Berlusconi,
the media magnate, broke one of the unwritten rules of Italian journalism:
newspaper proprietors can call the shots, but should never be seen doing so.
Berlusconi's blunder prompted the resignation of the octogenarian Indro
Montanelli, one of Italy's most respected journalists, who has edited
Milan's Il Giornale since he founded it in 1974. Berlusconi sold control of
the paper, in which he retains a minority stake, to his younger brother
Paolo after a law limiting media ownership came into effect in 1992.
For Montanelli, Berlusconi's appearance was 'a colossal gaffe', which made a
mockery of the law. 'By implicitly linking new investments in the
loss-making paper to a change in its style, he was virtually inviting the
editor to resign,' said one Il Giornale journalist.
Berlusconi's behaviour has thrown into relief the flimsy laws governing
ownership of Italy's press in the face of the powerful business interests
which dominate the media.
Owning a newspaper is not just a symbol of joining the ultra-rich in Italy.
It is also the most important way in which industrialists try to influence
public opinion and to exert pressure in the political arena. As a general
election looms, swaying the debate has become a priority for Berlusconi,
Gianni Agnelli and Carlo De Benedetti - the country's wealthiest men - who
control three of the four top-selling newspapers. Together, they also
exercise enormous clout over coverage in Il Sole 24 Ore, the leading
business daily, which is owned by the Confindustria employers' federation
they dominate.
Agnelli, the patriarch of Italian business, owns more papers than the other
two men combined. Through Fiat, the country's biggest private company, in
which his family is the largest shareholder, he dominates La Stampa, the
respected Turin paper. Separately, Fiat is the dominant shareholder in the
Gemina holding company, which controls Corriere della Sera, the prestigious
Milan paper. Corriere is locked in a gruelling circulation war, amid falling
advertising revenues, with Rome's La Repubblica for the title of Italy's
best-selling daily. La Repubblica, along with L'Espresso, the number two
newsmagazine, is controlled by De Benedetti through L'Editoriale L'Espesso.
Berlusconi's newspaper interests have been limited by the media ownership
laws which ended a free-for-all, restricting cross-holdings of newspaper and
television companies. However, he retains control of three of Italy's most
popular television channels, and Panorama, the number one news magazine.
Last week's appearance at Il Giornale showed he remains the paper's dominant
commercial influence, in spite of the formal transfer of power to his
brother.
While the media interests of Agnelli, De Benedetti and Berlusconi symbolise
material success, they also act as protective shields against potential
rivals, who can be deflated or ignored in newspapers or on television.
Antonio Pilati, who runs a media research institute funded by the
Turin-based charitable Rosselli foundation, says business considerations are
paramount. 'Ownership of papers by non-media groups is very much an Italian
phenomenon,' he says. 'Its roots lie in the structure of our economy, in
which the state plays a much bigger role than in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Because so many important decisions affecting entrepreneurs rest in the
hands of politicians, being able to influence public opinion has become an
important business tool.'
It is only since the late 1980s, however, that the media has been used by
its proprietors so blatantly. For instance, growing financial pressures on
Fiat, which has seen its share of the domestic car market fall sharply,
coincided with a much less critical line on the company at La Stampa.
The biggest change, however, has come in the De Benedetti and Berlusconi
camps, where media interests have become more partisan as the business
rivalry between the two has grown. The battle started in 1990 over control
of Mondadori, Italy's biggest publishing group, which they finally split
between them. Since then, weekly news magazines have been the main vehicles
for the men's vitriol.
Berlusconi's Panorama carries extensive coverage of De Benedetti's legal
difficulties in the long-running Banco Ambrosiano affair, in which he is
appealing against a six-year prison sentence. Recently, it revelled in De
Benedetti's discomfiture at the hands of Rome magistrates probing political
corruption.
The corruption scandal has also given De Benedetti's L'Espresso a
springboard from which to attack Berlusconi. The magazine regularly attempts
to link Berlusconi to the now discredited Socialist party in Milan. Of late,
it has focused on the complex ownership structure and finances of
Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company amid reports that its debts are
higher than stated.
But defending business interests is rapidly taking a backseat to political
attack and counter-attack for Italy's media magnates. As traditional party
allegiances collapse amid the unfolding scandals, Agnelli, De Benedetti and
Berlusconi are anxious to ensure their political ideas and influence have as
wide an impact as possible.
Berlusconi's recent decision to enter politics has been the catalyst for a
reassessment of the role of media ownership by leading commentators and has
raised doubts about the pluralism of the press.
Berlusconi is trying to regroup the tattered centre of Italian politics,
devasted by the effect of the corruption investigations on the once dominant
Christian Democrat party. He also aims to halt the rise of the Democratic
Party of the Left, the former communists, who are expected to do well at the
forthcoming election.
While nobody in public life has questioned Berlusconi's right to express
opinions, his manipulation of media interests for self-promotion has caused
a furore. The first blast came when two of the three Fininvest channels
interrupted regular broadcasting recently to carry a 90-minute press
conference Berlusconi held with foreign journalists.
Berlusconi's political ambitions have since developed from an apparent whim
into a clear-cut strategy. 'I think he has fallen prey to a rapture which
will cause him a lot of trouble,' said Montanelli after he quit. 'When he
gets a few of his men into parliament, which he will, they will be jeered
every time they get up to speak. They won't be able to escape the idea that
they are doing their boss's bidding.'
On Thursday, Mario Segni, the popular leader of Italy's referendum movement,
joined the fray. He said Berlusconi had no place in politics because he
controlled three national television channels. 'I hope Berlusconi does not
involve himself directly in politics. The entry into politics by someone who
controls such powerful means poses grave problems. He wants to unite the
liberals and democrats, but risks fracturing them instead.'
Fedele Confalonieri, a senior Fininvest executive and one of Berlusconi's
closest advisers, rejects charges that his boss is using his media interests
to bolster a political career. Potential conflicts of interest will be
eliminated, because Berlusconi will relinquish his media boardroom positions
when he is elected, argues Confalonieri.
'Berlusconi is a publisher who gives his editors the maximum liberty,' he
adds. For Confalonieri, the embarrassing public sniping which has emerged
among Fininvest journalists this week indicates the scope for free thinking
among the group's employees.
Critics of the concentration of media ownership are unimpressed by such
arguments. Berlusconi's intervention at Il Giornale showed his influence had
not been curtailed by legal changes. As for freedom of expression, many
journalists suspect Berlusconi prefers to exert power through proxies. This
week, Emilio Fede, a senior journlist who is close to Berlusconi, threatened
disciplinary action against Fininvest journalists who participated in a
televised debate on a rival channel criticising the group.
Berlusconi's political emergence has highlighted long-standing limits on
pluralism in the press. Riccardo Franco Levi, former editor of
L'Indipendente, a paper that tried unsuccessfully to break the grip of a few
big media owners, is sceptical about the chances of a swift change.
'As long as Italian capitalism remains dominated by a handful of large
companies, standing above thousands of minnows, then ownership of the press
is likely to remain the same,' he says. 'After all, for good or for bad, our
newspapers are just a mirror of our society.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Power workers accept merit pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity's 6,000 employees have agreed a 2.5 per cent pay rise in
return for performance assessments of their work in the company's first wage
settlement since the abolition of industry-wide bargaining last year.
'After many years of having to implement nationally agreed pay arrangements,
Eastern Electricity has now secured a pioneering deal,' said Mr Stephen
Connock, personnel director, yesterday.
Under the agreement the company is introducing performance pay for its 1,400
professional and supervisory staff who are in unions. This will end union
participation in pay bargaining for them.
The rest of the workforce will continue for the time being to have their
wages negotiated collectively, but their work will be assessed. Eventually
the company aims to negotiate full performance pay for its entire workforce.
British Coal yesterday warned that more closures among the remaining 22
operating pits were inevitable. But Mr Andrew Horsler, commercial director,
said that the programme of restructuring was nearing its end.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Caterpillar offers staff de-recognition deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caterpillar (UK), the subsid-iary of the world's largest manufacturer of
earth moving and construction equipment, is asking white-collar staff to
give up collective bargaining and accept de-recognition of their unions in
return for lump-sum payments of Pounds 500 plus a 2 per cent pay rise.
Officials of the unions concerned - the MSF technical union and the Apex
white-collar section of the GMB general union - fear that if Caterpillar
succeeds with its non-union strategy, other engineering companies will
follow its example.
'We are worried this could have a bandwagon effect,' said one union
official. Caterpillar is a member of the Engineering Employers Federation,
which the unions say has advised the company.
Senior technical staff members of MSF at the company's Desford
digging-machinery plant outside Leicester agreed this week to accept the
company's proposal by a majority of 80 per cent to 20 per cent in a secret
workplace ballot.
Caterpillar intends to give workers individual contracts of employment and
to introduce an incentive compensation plan relating future pay to
individual performance, with the possibility of wage increases of up to 14
per cent.
A staff council is to be established, without negotiating rights, together
with a company legal protection plan to provide staff with legal advice.
Staff will also receive in-house medical check-ups. Apex is to ballot
Caterpillar clerical staff on the deal next week, and MSF will ballot the
rest of the technical grades. Both recommend rejection.
The company's 600 manual workers - members of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union - are expected to receive a similar offer from Caterpillar
when their one-year agreement ends in November.
The company said yesterday that it had put the proposals to its clerical and
technical staff on January 7 and given them two weeks to consider them.
'Since any decision made by employees will be entirely voluntary, it would
be inappropriate for the company to comment on it publicly at this time,'
Caterpillar added.
Caterpillar said the proposal was part of a strategy to expand employee
involvement.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Welsh windfarm venture rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of growing opposi-tion to windfarms in Wales has come with the
rejection of an application to erect 20 turbines on a hill overlooking the
historic town of Kidwelly on the south-west coast.
Councillors at Llanelli, the planning authority, voted unanimously to refuse
the application by Westwind Generators of Penarth, South Glamorgan. More
than 400 people signed a petition against the farm, which was also opposed
by Dyfed County Council.
The 500kW turbines would have been 40m high to the hub, with 40m diameter
blades. Llanelli council said they would be 'seriously detrimental' to the
landscape and create a noise nuisance. Cadw, the organisation responsible
for Welsh historic monuments, said the farm would be an 'alien backdrop' to
11th-century Kidwelly Castle.
Dyfed County Council is also opposing an application by the company to erect
20 turbines at nearby Ferryside.
Carmarthen District Council is due to rule on that application on Tuesday
with a recommendation by its officers to refuse it.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Passenger transport executives, which provide subsidised rail services in
Britain's main conurbations outside London, are to receive grants from the
government to offset extra costs caused by rail privatisation.
The grants will cover increased charges for track use and for operating
rolling stock likely to be imposed when the railways are restructured after
April 1. The Department of Transport said yesterday that the grants would
continue indefinitely.
The cost of the subsidy is not known. It depends on the charges levied on
the train operators by Railtrack, the state-owned company which will manage
British Rail's infrastructure from April 1, and these have not yet been set.
At present BR provides rail services for the PTEs which cover the
Strathclyde conurbation around Glasgow and the Manchester, Newcastle upon
Tyne, West Yorkshire and Birmingham areas. The local authorities controlling
the PTEs determine fares and subsidise the services out of their revenues.
From April 1 services in Strathclyde will be provided by ScotRail operating
as a shadow franchise. Within a year the franchise will be offered to
private-sector operators.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a Scottish Office minister, has told
Strathclyde region, which controls the area's PTE, that the Scottish Office
will cover fully the extra costs it may incur in 1994-95 'as a result of
restructuring the railway and introducing new track and rolling-stock
charging regimes'.
The English PTEs will receive the subsidy direct from the Department of
Transport in the first year, and thereafter from the Department of the
Environment through its revenue support grants.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Pressure on Patten eases as two unions lift boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, eased yesterday when
two teachers' unions told members to lift their boycott of national
curriculum tests in England and Wales.
The decisions by the ATL and the NASUWT mean that this year's tests are
virtually certain to take place. They would also isolate the NUT, the
largest teaching union.
Last year all three unions boycotted the tests. This forced the government
to abandon its planned school league tables based on test results, and to
order a review of the curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority. This year's tests have been halved in
length, Sir Ron says.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, predicted that the union would
continue its boycott after it had finished consulting its members this
month. He said: 'The decisions of the ATL and the NASUWT will break the
unity established last year. That is unfortunate. It will create confusion
among teachers and parents.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'The executive decided
to lift the boycott in recognition of the enormous amount of progress that
has been made.'
Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, said: 'Original concern with the
national curriculum tests, later expressed in the ballot of ATL members, was
centred upon excessive workload. It is absolutely clear that the tests are
now to be shorter and easier to administer.'
The ATL and the NASUWT are recommending that the boycott of teachers'
assessment of pupils connected to the curriculum should continue where this
is 'excessive'. This centres around the 'tick-lists' of statements of
attainment which teachers must compile, amounting to about 20,000 reports
per school year for a typical teacher.
But Sir Ron swiftly indicated that he did not believe that this would be a
serious point of contention. He said he urged teachers to 'burn their
ticklists' and avoid assessments which were plainly unnecessary, although he
made it clear that teachers should still carry out enough assessment to
report to parents.
The Department for Education welcomed the decisions.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Simpler credit licensing sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is proposing to simplify the consumer credit licensing system
as part of its drive to cut the burden of red tape on business.
The Office of Fair Trading issued a consultation document yesterday which
canvasses the idea of extending the system of group consumer credit licences
to trade associations, professional bodies and non-commercial organisations
to reduce the need for traders to apply for individual licences.
A consumer credit licence is required to carry on one or more activities of
consumer credit, consumer hire, credit brokerage, debt adjusting, debt
counselling, debt collecting and credit reference agency.
At present there are some 350,000 consumer credit licences in existence.
Only 16 are group licences. Each must be renewed every five years, placing a
considerable burden on traders and administrators. Last year the OFT issued
almost 19,000 new licences and 4,718 renewals.
Extending the group licence to trade associations and other non-commercial
organisations would allow members of such groups to be covered by one
licence. Responsibility for regulating members and ensuring they were fit to
offer consumer credit would pass to the association or group.
Mr John Mills, OFT director of consumer affairs, said it was looking at ways
of encouraging more self-regulation while maintaining high levels of
consumer protection.
He said the OFT's policy until now had been to confine group licences to a
few professional bodies and advisory organisations. But there might be other
organisations such as trade associations which would also be able to take on
the obligations of a group licensee.
The Law Society is the largest current group licence holder, covering 58,586
solicitors in England and Wales. Other group licences are held by bodies
which represent solicitors, accountants and chartered surveyors throughout
the UK.
Such licences do not authorise any of those covered by them to canvass
debtor, creditor, supplier or regulated consumer hire agreements off trade
premises - anyone wishing to do so needs a standard licence specifically
authorising that activity.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Anger over 'the all-round con'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Warwick and Brindley estate is sandwiched between the Westway motorway
and the Harrow Road in a poor backwater of Westminster.
Some of its residents provide graphic accounts to illustrate the council's
determination to sell off its housing during the 1980s. Tenants in the six
tower blocks who yielded to council pressure to buy their properties
bitterly regret their decisions.
They say any savings from ownership are cancelled out by service and other
charges which they pay and tenants do not. More importantly, because only a
few properties were sold-off, there is no market and they cannot sell their
flats.
Only 85 of the 600 flats were sold before the designated sales policy came
to an end in that estate in 1988.
Since then the council has been moving in homeless families from
bed-and-breakfast accommodation and others who cannot afford to pay rent.
Mrs Winifred Donald, a retired London Transport worker, says: 'In the
mid-1980s whenever a property became vacant, they put a steel door on to
prevent squatters. The council told us the properties would be sold.
'We have lived here since the beginning 30 years ago. We bought in 1987
because it was so cheap. We paid Pounds 17,000 which was about 30 per cent
of its value, although there was an indemnity which we paid off over five
years.
'But now they have moved all these income-support people in. I've nothing
against them, mind, but we will never sell the place now. I voted
Conservative last time - I am certainly not going to vote Conservative next
time.'
Mrs Donald wanted to sell the property for Pounds 50,000 and move near to
her son in Reading. She says: 'We have had no interest, and they've loaded
charges on to us. We have been conned.'
Mr Robert Fox, 72 , a retired brewery worker has also been soured by the
experience.
'They (the council) kept punching away at us to buy. They said it would be
cheaper than renting and that they wanted to sell the whole block,' he says.
'We bought because I've got two boys and I thought it would give them a bit
of security. I bought it for Pounds 15,000 with a Pounds 10,000 indemnity.
Even with the indemnity this was only 40 per cent of its face value. I
bought it out of savings.
'But now they are putting all these charges on us. We have to pay Pounds
4.50 for gates and a concierge they want to put in. They want thousands from
us for repairs to the outside of the building. They are not asking the
tenants, most of them can't pay anyway.
'I could not sell the place even if I wanted to although it is supposed to
be worth Pounds 60,000. If anything happened to me or my wife my sons could
not pay the charges and the place would be repossessed. It's been one
all-round con.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Building societies lobby for PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle in the life insurance industry over the future of the regulatory
system is intensifying, with supporters of self-regulation through the
planned Personal Investment Authority becoming more vocal.
Following a meeting of the Building Societies Association council this week,
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chairman, has written to the Financial Times to express
the sector's backing for the PIA as currently envisaged.
'Building societies believe that the PIA offers an excellent chance of
providing the necessary reassurance to customers that the industry truly has
their best interests at heart, while at the same time ensuring that the
industry view is heard,' he says in a letter published today.
His intervention follows a statement this week from Standard Life, one of
the UK's largest life insurance companies. It is withdrawing support from
the PIA on the basis that with only nine industry practitioners on its
19-strong board, it does not amount to self-regulation.
Standard Life's move, and its call for statutory regulation instead, has
highlighted the divide among life insurance companies over the issue.
Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar Assurance and of Eagle Star
Holdings, believes the industry has put so much effort into self-regulation
that it must continue to show that it can make that system work.
To win support across the industry, he proposes that the PIA sets up a
supervisory board, with a majority of public interest members, to oversee an
executive committee made up of practitioners.
Scottish life companies have already become openly divided, with Scottish
Amicable backing Standard Life, but Scottish Widows and Scottish Provident
supporting the PIA.
Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, is also about to
declare its support for the PIA.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Accountants seek liability limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest accountancy firms have begun putting pressure on clients
to agree to limits on the firms' liability when providing professional
services.
Several of the biggest eight firms have started to introduce into contracts
for work a maximum multiple of the fee they will pay compensation if a
client seeks redress.
They have suggested the limits in higher-risk areas such as due diligence
investigations and valuations in corporate finance deals, and when
conducting internal audit work for companies.
The initiative was triggered by Arthur Andersen as part of the firm's
leading role in efforts to reform company legislation which forbids
accountants from limiting their liability on audit work. The firms have
attempted to steer clear of breaching any contracts legislation.
Mr Chris Nunn, a senior technical partner with the firm, confirmed yesterday
that the idea had been running over several months among several accountancy
firms. He said its launch reflected the desire to develop a consistent
approach across all accountancy services in line with lobbying efforts to
allow auditors to limit liability.
'We have had a sensible discussion between the firms,' he said. 'We want to
compete on quality and value for money, not on who is prepared to underwrite
the biggest risk.'
He said the multiple agreed was generally between five and 10 times the fee,
and sometimes with far simpler agreements for reimbursement if the client
was dissatisfied.
Mr Nunn said that most clients had been receptive to the idea of limiting
liability. He said firms would be reluctant to work for those who were not,
since they were seeking guarantees rather than professional advice.
In spite of many high-profile audit negligence actions - such as surrounding
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International - many writs against
firms relate to their activities in areas other than audit work. These
include acquisition advisory and tax work.
KPMG Peat Marwick has in the past few weeks submitted two tender proposals
to companies to run their internal auditing, with liability limited in one
case to twice and one to about five times the fee.
Mr Jerry Acher, head of accounting and auditing, said his firm was
considering proposals to limit liability in other specialisms during the
year, such as investigations and public-sector consulting.
'Litigation is blunting the effectiveness of the audit process,' he said.
'This will enable us to provide the proper service without having to watch
over our shoulders. I would be prepared to take a small discount on our fees
as part of the cost of practice protection.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Banks expect rise in rate of job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks expect to shed jobs at an increasing rate in the first quarter of the
year, says a quarterly survey carried out by the Confederation of British
Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm.
The survey's release follows announcements of 7,200 extra redundancies this
week by Barclays and National Westminster Bank. It found that job reductions
in financial services as a whole were expected to be slower than in the
final quarter of last year.
Income from fees, commissions and trading rose in the fourth quarter of last
year at the fastest rate recorded since the survey started in 1989.
The survey found activity in financial services had risen markedly in the
past three months, with profitability increasing in all sectors. The volume
of business was expected to rise more strongly in this quarter.
Confidence among financial services companies rose for the fifth successive
quarter but securities traders were less optimistic than in September.
Mr Angus Hislop, a Coopers partner, said financial services companies were
keen to cut costs and staff, even with an upturn in business.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Labour councillors attack Brent over housing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday sought to intensify pressure on the Conservatives by
alleging that the London borough of Brent, Conservative-controlled since
1991, had used similar housing policies to neighbouring Westminster city
council.
The charges were denied by Mr Irwin Van Colle, chairman of Brent's housing
committee. He said: 'The amount of gerrymandering the Labour authorities
have done is quite staggering, but they can always turn around and say they
have a duty to house the homeless.'
Brent has introduced a 'portable right to buy' scheme in which tenants who
do not want to buy in their own area are allowed to buy in an area which is
'more desirable'. Flats are kept empty while buyers are sought.
Mr Cyril Shaw, Labour's housing spokesman on the council, said that about
200 properties were left empty at any one time.
Housing associations, whose tenants are thought likely to vote Labour, are
not being given permission to build in the more affluent north of the
borough, which has a Tory MP, Sir Rhodes Boyson.
The bulk of the most attractive sites for new housing association homes are
in the north, say housing experts. Yet investment is being concentrated in
the south of the borough, which is Labour-dominated and represented in
parliament by the Labour MPs Mr Ken Livingstone and Mr Paul Boateng.
Conservatives refused planning permission for a scheme by Paddington
Churches Housing Association to build 10 new flats in Sudbury, which is in
Gladstone, the most marginal ward in the borough.
Mr Van Colle said: 'We have been deluged as an administration with
complaints from owner-occupiers who've suddenly found that the new
development that was supposedly going to be private-sector homes suddenly
becomes social housing with homeless families in the midst of their area.
'We perceive it as a perfectly reasonable thing to represent the views of
owner-occupiers who have just as many rights as homeless families.'
He said the council's policy was to return housing associations to their
'original purpose' of rehabilitating houses.
A motion by Labour councillors for the next council meeting says: 'In the
light of the revelations of gerrymandering by Westminster, we censure this
administration for following precisely the same type of immoral policies,
which have resulted in houses staying empty for over a year, and properties
required by the community being sold.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Lloyd's refuses to renegotiate offer to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday refused to reopen negotiations over its Pounds
900m settlement offer, amid increasing indications that a majority of Names
 -the individuals who have traditionally supported the insurance market -
will vote down the deal next month.
Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive of the insurance market, said
Lloyd's had considered a possible suspension of the offer to allow talks to
take place, but had rejected the idea because such a move could 'give rise
to wrong expectations'.
He added: 'People would infer that we can increase the offer when we can't.
There isn't going to be another offer. We aren't going to devote any more
time to it. 'Names have got to understand that this is it.'
Two of the biggest groups of loss-making Names - Gooda Walker and Feltrim -
are expected to reject the deal when they meet next week.
Some 3,000 Gooda Walker Names are likely to vote to pursue legal claims for
Pounds 580m through the courts when they meet on Monday.
The committee of the Feltrim Names Association, which in a letter to its
members earlier this week called for fresh talks with Lloyd's, has also
recommended against acceptance of the offer. Both groups would receive less
than 40p in the pound from the offer.
Names must decide on the deal by February 14. Success depends on at least 70
per cent of Names, by value of the offer, voting in favour.
Mr Middleton conceded that the deal was imperfect but said it offered
certainty to loss-making Names.
He said errors and omissions insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against
legal awards for negligence, would not increase their contribution -
understood to be about Pounds 400m - to the settlement package.
The offer document states that between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1.085bn of
eroors and omissions cover is available to meet claims of Pounds 2.8bn by
Names covered by the deal.
Mr Middleton said not all this cover would be triggered by successful legal
action. If Names rejected the offer it would be unlikely that Lloyd's could
revive the deal, he predicted.
'My concern is that a number of Names will reject the offer and regret it,'
he said.
Mr Middleton sought to play down the impact of rejection on Lloyd's business
prospects. These are now viewed as more positive after increases in
insurance rates and a much stronger inflow of capital into the market.
'If they think they'll do better in the courts that's fine by me,' he said.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Tories divided over Westminster effect on May elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Britain's local council elections just four months away, allegations of
gerrymandering by Westminster city councillors could not have come at a
worse time for the Tory party.
But in the face of newspaper headlines about how the Conservative-held
council sold homes for votes, Tory MPs remain divided over how much damage
the allegations would do to the party in May's polls.
The most pessimistic assessment came from an MP who, until this week's
events, had thought that the Conservatives would fare very badly in May's
elections. 'It now appears that we will be utterly wiped out,' he said,
recalling that the Conservatives control only one metropolitan council
outside London.
His fear was that, like the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, the accusation of
gerrymandering would hang over the Tories until it was resolved in the
courts. 'This kind of activity involves moving so-called socially inadequate
people out of your borough and into another,' he claimed. 'When people
realise what these allegations are about they will be utterly disgusted.'
No Tory MP questioned the seriousness of the accusations against Dame
Shirley Porter, the former Westminster council chairman, and her colleagues.
But several had grounds for thinking that the political damage could be
contained.
One backbencher said Mr John Magill, the district auditor in Westminster,
had acted unwisely when criticising councillors this week. The MP echoed
remarks by Lord Hailsham, the former lord chancellor, that 'grave charges
ought not to be made unless the person accused has the right to rebut'. He
added: 'There needs to be a big debate about the whole process by which
district auditors investigate these matters.'
In a robust radio interview, Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party
chairman, put the point more bluntly. 'What we know is that an accountant
has made certain allegations about politics,' he said. 'What we also know is
that Westminster council has been an excellent council.'
Other MPs believed that Tory campaigners would have plenty of ammunition
with which to highlight potentially illegal practices by councillors in
Labour-held boroughs.
One MP recalled a district auditor's report last May claiming that Lambeth
council in London was owed Pounds 173m in unpaid rent, poll tax and debts.
'By not collecting rent, Lambeth ensures that Labour voters stay in the
borough,' he said. 'I just don't see how that is worse than what might have
happened in Westminster.'
He recalled that Mr Herbert Morrison, a prominent member of the post-war
Labour government, had threatened to 'build the Conservatives' out of London
by constructing council houses. Dame Shirley had simply done the opposite,
he said.
'Since the war, Labour and Tory governments have had housing policies which
resulted in advantageous voting swings in key constituencies,' he said.
But he was realistic, too, about the political consequences of this week's
scandals on the local elections, which will help to determine whether Mr
John Major survives the year as prime minister.
'A great deal of mud has been flying around,' he said, 'and it's mud that
will probably stick.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Phillips says he is 'appalled' at district auditor's report
findings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Phillips, the former managing director of Westminster city council,
said yesterday that he was 'appalled' at the findings of the district
auditor's report and denied he was involved in a cover-up, Peter Marsh
writes.
Mr Phillips said he 'did not knowingly do anything improper or illegal' when
working for the council.
He said that allegations that he had shredded documents relevant to the
district auditor's inquiry were 'complete and utter rubbish'.
He added that during his four years as managing director until 1991 he had
routinely disposed of documents using a shredding machine in full view of
many other council officials outside his office.
None of these documents were related to the inquiry by Mr John Magill, the
district auditor.
'If I had disposed of incriminating documents in this way, a lot of people
would have seen me,' he said.
Mr Phillips, a former civil servant at the Department of the Environment,
left Westminster city council to become a director of NB Selection, a London
recruitment company.
He will be studying the full version of the report over the next few weeks
and will send his views to Mr Magill.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Adams fails to lift ban as Ulster talks continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
yesterday failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping him out of
mainland Britain.
The move came as the London and Dublin governments signalled their
determination to press ahead with talks on the province's future
irrespective of whether the republican movement agrees to embrace the
UK-Irish peace initiative.
Mr Adams said the decision to retain his ban was 'a gratuitous reaffirmation
of John Major's arrogant refusal to engage meaningfully and positively' in
the peace process.
Republican leaders have still not given a definitive response to last
month's Downing Street declaration. The British government now believes that
the odds are stacked heavily against an early end to IRA violence.
Downing Street said yesterday that talks - co-ordinated by Mr Michael
Ancram, Northern Ireland minister - had continued this week with a meeting
with the Ulster Unionists. Mr Ancram is to meet representatives of the
mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party later this month.
A 40-minute meeting at Downing Street between Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, yesterday failed to bridge
differences between them over whether London should respond to Sinn Fein's
demands for clarification of last month's joint declara-tion.
But Mr Hume left the 'very constructive' meeting in a relatively upbeat
mood. He was 'very, very encouraged' by the fact that Ulster remained at the
top of Mr Major's agenda.
Appealing for patience, Mr Hume said he still thought peace was very
possible. He added: 'I do not have a gloomy prospect.'
Downing Street said it welcomed Mr Hume's strong support for the joint
declaration. Mr Major was keeping in close contact with leaders of the other
constitutional parties.
Mr Hume confirmed that his contacts with Mr Adams to discuss possible
progress on the peace process would continue.

FT  15 JAN 94 / GM loses fight over production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, must continue making cars in Finland until
the end of 1996 at the plant of its former partner Valmet, the majority
Finnish state-owned engineering group.
The two companies have been locked in legal conflict since 1992 following GM
Europe's decision to transfer production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe
from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at
Russelsheim, near Frankfurt from December 1992. GM moved the Finnish
assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the Russelsheim plant
and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland.
Valmet responded with a series of legal actions, which ended yesterday when
GM was forced to accept a settlement, after it became clear that it was
about to lose its case before an international tribunal in Paris. GM said
that under the terms of the settlement all other outstanding legal disputes
between the two groups had been dropped.
The US carmaker has been forced to place 45 per cent of its planned
production of the Calibra at the Finnish plant starting in the second
quarter of this year and running to the end of 1996, when its original
agreement with Valmet was due to expire.
It must also pay compensation to Valmet for the 15 months from the end of
1992, during which output in Finland has been curtailed with the loss to
Valmet of around 10,000 cars. The size of the damages was not disclosed.
GM was forced by a German court order last year to resume small volume
production in the second half of 1993 pending the outcome of the
arbitration. The US carmaker said that it expected total Calibra output to
reach about 27,000 this year, of which about 1,000 a month would be produced
in Finland.
Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM
needed extra capacity in west Europe with record demand for new cars.
Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said that
the company would incur a cost penalty of DM4,000 - DM5,000 per car for the
Calibras produced in Finland.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Ignorance underpins soaring Malay stocks: Private investors
have piled into shares, with unpredictable results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Florrie Chong and her brother Sammy run a unisex hairdressing salon in Kuala
Lumpur. Florrie and a team of girls cut the hair. Sammy, who is blind, is
much sought after for his head massages.
None of the idle chit chat of film stars, football matches or sex scandals
at Florrie's. All the talk is about the stock market.
'I told Sammy to sell his shares when they reached MDollars 10 (Pounds 2.50)
but he won't listen,' says Florrie. He bought at MDollars 2.50 - he thinks
they might go still higher.'
Stock market fever has gripped Malaysia over much of the last year. In
common with most stock markets in Asia, the Kuala Lumpur bourse has been
flying high.
The Kuala Lumpur index rose 98 per cent in 1993. Market capitalisation
nearly trebled to MDollars 600bn. Most spectacularly of all, daily turnover
has increased from MDollars 200m 12 months ago to between MDollars 3bn and
MDollars 4bn now.
Michael Greenall, an investment analyst with Barings Securities in Kuala
Lumpur, says: 'What makes this market interesting is that it's not been the
fund managers and institutions that have been driving shares up. It's the
shopkeepers, housewives, even the civil servants. They are the ones who jam
the broking houses. They are the ones who are shouting trading orders down
their mobile phones.'
In most markets the so-called retail sector accounts for a relatively small
amount of share transactions. But in Kuala Lumpur the institutions have been
elbowed out by individual buyers, who account for an estimated 70 per cent
of share dealings.
'For years people have been parking their money in safe havens overseas,'
says the head of a local securities house. 'Now they are bringing it back.
That's a good thing. But it's going into highly speculative stocks.
Ignorance is mixing with greed. It's a lethal combination.'
Greed was certainly evident at a recent car crash outside Kuala Lumpur in
which four people were killed.
A macabre feature at the site of such accidents is people noting down the
numbers of crashed vehicles - for betting in the lottery. But in this
accident one of the cars involved had been delivering share scrip.
Passers-by were seen bundling the stolen scrip into their cars and driving
away.
Stock market gurus struggle to find rational explanations for the stock
market euphoria. Malaysia's economy continues to perform well -
outstandingly in comparison with the sluggish western countries. For the
sixth year in succession, Malaysia's gross domestic product increased by
more than 8 per cent in 1993.
But more cautious market observers say Malaysia's economic fundamentals have
not changed much in the last nine months. In fact, with a sharp drop in
foreign investment and renewed inflationary pressures, things are not
looking quite as rosy as they once were.
However, stock market punters give short shrift to fundamentals. Like many
countries in Asia, politics and business in Malaysia are closely linked. To
most stock market traders, the political connections of a company are far
more important than price earnings ratios or balance sheets.
While foreign institutions have been investing in blue chips, locals have
preferred the smaller, more volatile shares listed on the market's second
board, the index of which went up by more than 150 per cent last year.
Union Paper Holdings is a small second board company involved in
manufacturing toilet paper and joss sticks. In the middle of last year
rumours went round that Union Paper was about to be taken over by a
co-operative linked to the United Malays National Organisation (Umno),
Malaysia's dominant political party.
Union Paper's shares went into orbit, rising from MDollars 1.73 to MDollars
23. In the event, there was no Umno takeover. Share dealing scandals
involving a number of Kuala Lumpur's prominent business people erupted over
the affair. Many shareholders got badly burned as the shares dropped back to
earth.
The government has been in two minds about the stockmarket fever. At first
it was giving share traders an Ivan Boesky style pat on the back. The
soaring stockmarket, said the government, was yet one more indication of
Malaysia's economic success.
But as the stockmarket reached undreamt of heights in the first week of this
year it grew concerned. With so many individuals involved in the market, the
social and political consequences of a sharp fall in prices could be severe.
As a result, Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister, said things had
reached a dangerous stage and the time had come for a big correction.
'Almost everybody is getting into the market,' said Mr Daim. 'Everybody is
busy on the phone. Nobody seems to be working. Everyone talks about shares.
This will affect productivity and low productivity will affect our economy.'
Mr Daim is no ordinary politician. He is a close confidant of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. He is treasurer of the Umno party. Most
importantly, he is one of Malaysia's richest men who has been behind many of
the country's biggest corporate restructurings - and an avid market player.
Mr Daim said he had already 'cashed out'.
Mr Daim's words had the desired effect. In the following three days the
market went down by 14 per cent. Then it seems the government became alarmed
that the fall was a little too steep. Mr Daim was again on the front pages
of yesterday's papers, saying that the market would bounce back again.
Sure enough it did, rising 10 per cent yesterday.
Once again, the market was the only topic of conversation down at Florrie
Chong's hair salon. And Sammy still hasn't sold his shares.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Japan police in export raid: Machinery sales to N Korea may
have breached Cocom rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japanese police have raided the offices of several companies suspected of
having exported a device to North Korea that could be used to guide
ballistic missiles, in breach of Cocom rules banning strategic exports to
communist countries.
A police spokesman said the probe involved machinery manufacturers and
trading houses but declined to name them.
According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the companies are suspected of
exporting spectrum analysers to North Korea which might have been used to
test the country's ballistic missiles launches.
Under Cocom rules, exports to communist countries of equipment that might be
used for military purposes, are strictly regulated.
The offices raided by the police include that of a Yokohama-based trading
company which specialises in trade with China, North Korea and Vietnam.
It is suspected that the trading houses under investigation acquired a
number of spectrum analysers which they exported to North Korea, possibly
through a third country, five years ago.
While the manufacturer of the spectrum analysers is also being investigated,
it is possible that staff did not know where the equipment was bound as
sales are commonly made through trading companies, police said.
The possibilty that spectrum analysers, commonly used to measure the
spectrum of radar or telecommunications equipment, had been exported to
North Korea from Japan, emerged after North Korea successfully launched its
intermediate range ballistic missile, the Rodong 1, in the Sea of Japan last
May.
The missile is thought to be capable of reaching any point in western Japan
in less than 10 minutes.
There are some suspicions that the equipment exported from Japan several
years ago may have been used in the test of the Rodong 1.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, Minister of International Trade and Industry said that
the ministry would co-operate with the police but also conduct its own
investigation into the matter.

Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected this weekend to announce
the dissolution of parliament and a date for early general elections.
The most likely dates are March 20 or March 27; but some reports said
President Scalfaro might let polling day slip into early April after
requests from his Christian Democrat party which is upset by the early
dissolution.
The dissolution has been brought about by the discrediting of the main
parties because of corruption scandals.
On Thursday Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the 73-year-old former governor of the
Bank of Italy, resigned. He said he had accomplished his expressed aim of
introducing an austerity budget for 1994 and supervising electoral reform.

<TEXT>
Venezuelan president, Mr Ramon Velasquez, was meeting yesterday with the
country's monetary authorities in an effort to save Banco Latino, the
country's second largest commercial bank, which closed its doors after
suffering serious financial problems.
National Guardsmen were posted outside Banco Latino's headquarters in
Caracas yesterday and the bank, with branches nationwide, was closed. There
was no indication when it might re-open.
The government is viewed by financial experts as trying to avoid direct
intervention, which could prove expensive, and has urged other banks to
provide assistance to Banco Latino.
Its board said it had suffered 'a criminal rumour campaign' over the past
three months that caused the loss of over Dollars 500m in deposits.
The Venezuelan banking system was calm yesterday but prices of Venezuelan
government bonds in the international markets fell as much as 4 per cent
before recovering slightly.
The Minister of Finance, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, said that the authorities
had to determine whether Banco Latino's problem was 'illiquidity or
insolvency'.
Banco Latino, which over the past year offered among the country's highest
interest rates on deposits, began suffering from a severe liquidity crunch
last month, and received large sums in rediscounts and advances from the
Central Bank. Despite this, on Thursday, the bank could not meet its
obligations in the national cheque clearing system.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Nissan dealer to sell Ford vehicles in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A leading dealer linked to Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, has
agreed to sell cars made by Ford in Japan in a move that could help ease
trade friction with the US.
Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales, one of Nissan's leading dealers based in central
Tokyo, said it reached agreement with Ford on Wednesday to sell the US
company's cars in Japan starting this spring.
Details on which models are to be sold and how many have yet to be decided,
but the dealer hopes to sell Ford's Taurus, Explorer and the new Mustang
cars at stores independently of those selling Nissan cars, the company said.
Ford's cars are already sold through 300 Mazda dealers in Japan.
The decision by Nissan to give the go-ahead to a deal between one of its
main dealers and a foreign competitor, sends a clear signal to other
Japanese car dealers that carmakers are increasingly prepared to relax their
grip on the choice of cars their dealers sell.
Nissan, which owns 25 per cent of Tokyo Nissan Sales, said the deal was an
issue between Tokyo Nissan Sales and Ford and that it had merely made the
introduction.
However, the close links between Japanese carmakers and dealers have, in
practice, prevented most dealers from selling cars other than those allotted
to them by the manufacturers. This has led to an admission by the country's
Fair Trade Commission that dealers are tightly bound to carmakers and has
prompted US charges that Japan's car market is closed.
The agreement follows a deal last year between Toyota and GM, the largest of
the US big three carmakers, for Toyota to sell 20,000 GM cars through its
dealerships in Japan starting in 1996.
It comes as US-Japan tensions have been rising in recent weeks over a lack
of progress in a series of bilateral trade talks aimed at increasing foreign
penetration of Japan's markets. Disagreements on how to tackle the huge US
trade deficit with Japan in car parts have been particularly difficult to
bridge.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Seoul takes action to cool raging bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices on the Seoul bourse fell sharply yesterday as the South Korean
government proposed measures to dampen what it feared as destabilising
speculation in the stock market.
Although the 28 per cent rise in the Korean share index last year was modest
compared to other booming Asian markets, government officials have expressed
concern in recent weeks that the stock market was becoming overheated.
Measures announced by the government yesterday include requiring
institutional investors to make a 20 per cent deposit on stock purchases and
discourage banks and other financial institutions, which operate under state
supervision, from buying shares.
It will also lift a ban on selling short on stock, which will enable
investors to borrow shares from brokerage houses and sell them. The ban was
introduced four years ago in an effort to revive the then-ailing bourse.
The government is also demanding that the country's three big investment
trust companies sell stocks to pay back loans from the central bank.
If the measures fail to cool the market, more companies will be allowed to
go public and issue new shares to soak up liquidity.
News of the measures, which will go into effect on Monday, sent the Korean
general share index down by 19 points to 879, slightly above the year-end
closing figure of 866.
'It's disappointing news after the government has tried to build up the
market during the last four years,' said Mr Peter Thorn, chief
representative for WI Carr in Seoul.
Many international institutional investors have predicted that Korea would
be one of the leading global bourse performers in 1994 since its shares are
still considered undervalued.
Some analysts believe that the measures are being taken to slow down
sizeable capital inflows from foreign investors, which the government
regards as potentially destabilising since it would increase the money
supply and led to higher inflation.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Plenty of demand for good Old Masters: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The works of art that filled the Park Avenue apartment of the late Peter Jay
Sharp, the real estate developer who owned the Carlyle Hotel in New York,
were sold by Sotheby's in New York on Thursday for Dollars 19.3m. The
auction was almost 95 per cent sold by value and 68 of the 77 lots offered
found buyers.
The top price was the Dollars 2.3m paid for two imaginary views of Venice by
Canaletto, but a greater surprise was the Dollars 2.2m which secured a
virtuoso painting of a boy drinking from a glass by the 16th century Italian
artist Annibale Carracci. It was a record for Carracci, and the price more
than doubled the pre-sale estimate.
Among the other artist records achieved were the Dollars 1.65m for 'The
Presentation in the Temple', a record for a sketch by Rubens; Dollars 1.54m
for a portrait of a young man with a recorder by the early 16th century
Italian artist Giovanni Savoldo; and the Dollars 1.15m for a portrait of a
young man holding a book by Savoldo's contemporary, the Flemish artist Jan
Gossaert, called Mabuse.
All the paintings were of high quality but they had only recently been
acquired by Sharp and works which reappear quickly for sale rarely do so
well. There is obviously a pent-up demand for good Old Master paintings.
Among the furniture the top price was the Dollars 739,500 paid for a set of
three Louis XVI cabinets made around 1780 by Adam Weisweiler. They had sold
at Sotheby's in 1985, presumably to Mr Sharp, for Dollars 264,000.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Fugitive helps unravel scandal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision of Mr Mauro Giallombardo, former personal secretary to Mr
Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to surrender to Milan
magistrates is expected to help them establish how much of the corrupt
funding of political parties was syphoned off by individuals.
Mr Giallombardo, a fugitive for nearly a year, helped set up two finance
groups in Luxembourg, Merchant Italia and Merchant Europa, and until last
year had links with Luxembourg International Bank.
During the trial in Milan of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant close
to the Socialist Party who acted for the Ferruzzi family, evidence has
emerged of regular use of accounts at the latter bank for funds collected
from individual businessmen and companies.
The magistrates, with the co-operation of the Luxembourg authorities, have
begun to trace these funds.

Venezuelan president Ramon Velasquez was meeting the country's monetary

National Guardsmen were posted outside Banco Latino's headquarters in

There was no indication as to when it might re-open.
The government is seen by financial experts as trying to avoid direct

The Venezuelan financial system was relatively calm yesterday. However, the
price of Venezuelan government bonds in the international markets fell as

The minister of finance, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, said that the authorities

Banco Latino, which over the past year has offered among the country's

severe liquidity crunch last month, and received large sums in rediscounts
and advances from the Central Bank. The situation was not stabilised,
however, and on January 12 the bank could not meet its obligations in the
national cheque clearing system.
While the true causes of Banco Latino's problems are not yet clear, this
troubled financial institution and some other domestic banks have been hit
hard by a recession that began last year and that affected their loan
portfolios. Ironically, a new banking law stipulating stricter government
supervision and control of banks, plus more stringent capital requirements,
went into effect on January 1.
At a meeting in the Central Bank on Thursday, representatives of Banco
Latino reportedly agreed to raise capital by Dollars 18.6m and seek to
strengthen the board by adding new domestic and foreign investors.

Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the scion of one of Japan's great industrial dynasties,
has been asked to take over the Keidanren, the leading business federation
and lobby group, from the end of May.
Mr Toyoda, 68, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, and currently
vice chairman of the Keidanren, said yesterday he had been informally
approached by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, the Keidanren's leader who is to
retire. Mr Toyoda, on a business trip to Britain, will decide on his return.
The change at the top of the federation comes as it is rethinking its
political links as a result of the new Japanese government's campaign to
weaken the so-called iron triangle of business, bureaucracy and politics
that used to run Japan behind the scenes.
Until recently, the front runner for the job was Mr Akio Morita, the
chairman of Sony, but he withdrew after a brain haemorrhage last month.
His outspoken style, electronics background and position as head of a
company founded after the second world war would have made a big change from
the Keidanren tradition of choosing diplomatic leaders from older
engineering industries.
Mr Toyoda, appears on the surface to represent a continuation of the
Keidanren's traditional distinguished style. But Mr Hiraiwa feels he would
rejuvenate the organisation, said officials.
Mr Toyoda is the son of the founder of Toyota Motor and the grandson of the
man who founded Toyota Automatic Loom Works in 1926, the car group's
predecessor.
Known as a strong management leader, Mr Toyoda has spent almost all his
professional life in the family firm, taking a break only to write a thesis
on fuel injection.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Citibank tries to woo Muscovites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Citibank, braving uncertainty about the rights of western banks in Russia,
yesterday became the first to open a subsidiary in Moscow, writes Leyla
Boulton.
The new bank was inaugurated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, in
Moscow for the US-Russian summit, and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, Russian
central bank chairman. Mr Gerashchenko last year gave licences to a dozen
western banks but their terms were curtailed by a presidential decree issued
to woo Russian bankers ahead of last month's parliamentary poll.
The decree said banks which received full banking licences but were more
than 50 per cent western-owned could not serve Russian residents until
January 1996.
This in theory restricted them to offshore banking functions.
President Boris Yeltsin later back-tracked on the decree - designed to meet
banks' demands for protection from foreign competition - by telling the
European Union terms would be softened for their banks.
But nothing similar has been said to the Americans, or to third countries
such as Turkey, whose Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi has agreed to cut its
shareholding in a joint venture with Russia's Toko Bank to 50 from 51 per
cent in order to evade restrictions imposed by the decree

FT  15 JAN 94 / EU bank 'must adopt policies of Bundesbank'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, gave notice yesterday he would
fight hard for the adoption of German monetary policies by the future
European central bank.
Medium-term money supply targets, mainstay of the Bundesbank's policy, were
the best way to ensure price stability, he told a banking audience in
Oldenburg, north-west Germany.
Such measures allowed inflationary pressures to be spotted early and helped
avoid the mistakes which were part and parcel of a stop-go policy.
Minimum reserve requirements for commercial banks were 'indispensable' to
slow down money creation, he said. The finance sector should also contribute
to stability by encouraging the dominance of longer-term lending rates.
The European Monetary Institute (EMI), forerunner of the proposed European
central bank, had a lot of work ahead of it, Mr Tietmeyer said. The
Bundesbank would campaign heavily for the adoption of the German central
bank's policies.
Speaking within days of the institute's first formal meeting in Frankfurt,
he reiterated his scepticism on the timing of the introduction of a common
currency.
Mr Tietmeyer, who has in the past effectively written off 1997 as a starting
date, said
that if there was 'a serious clash between the political deadline and
economic necessity,' then monetary union would have to wait.
He also rejected suggestions that the EMI should establish an EU-wide money
supply target in the run-up to monetary union.
That would lead to grey areas between the responsibilities of the institute
and individual central banks.
Mr Tietmeyer supported his case for a German-style European central bank
with a catalogue of successes, which he attributed to the Bundesbank's
'dogged' adherence to its policy.
'Inflation is slowing, inflationary expectations have been broken, long-term
interest rates have been at unusually low levels for some time . . . and the
external value of the D-Mark has stayed stable,' he said.
In the light of results, the Bundesbank had no reason to listen to the
'siren voices singing the old song of forced interest rate cuts.'
It would keep checking the data to see if it had room to move: 'Naturally we
do not want to keep our rates at present levels for longer than necessary.'

A sharp rise in fresh food prices last month pushed Spain's year-on-year
headline inflation rate at the end of 1993 up to 4.9 per cent, 0.4 per cent
above the government's target, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The increase
could undermine government efforts to enforce wage moderation this year.
Fresh food prices jumped 1.5 per cent against a rise of 0.5 per cent in
December 1992. Rises in other components of the price index were below those
of 1992 when annual headline inflation was 5.3 per cent.

Mr Ivan Rybkin, a true believer who remained in the Communist Party well
after it became fashionable to leave, was yesterday elected speaker of
Russia's lower chamber of parliament, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
A party apparatchik who joined the Agrarian Party just before last month's
elections, Mr Rybkin was the agreed candidate of pro-Communists and
ultra-nationalists who dominate the newly-elected State Duma. Despite a
solid boycott by Russia's Choice and other pro-reformist parties, his
victory was a consequence of the unity of the more numerous conservatives.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, head of the small Party of Russian Unity and Accord,
said Mr Rybkin was a capable organiser but his independence was limited by
the fact he owed his election to the support of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democratic party.
Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia have been told to return fire and shoot
to kill if there are any attempts to seize their military installations, a
Russian military statement said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The north-western command of Russian forces issued the order following
temporary detention of two Russian generals by Latvian civil defence units
and the blockading of military installations in Latvia on January 10.

FT  15 JAN 94 / German government and parliament to move to Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government and parliament will both move from Bonn to Berlin
between 1998 and 2000, leaders of the country's principal political parties
agreed at cross-party talks yesterday, writes Quentin Peel.
Total cost of the move, agreed in principle in 1991 in spite of strong
opposition in parliament and little popular support, is supposed to be kept
to DM20bn, (Pounds 7.8bn) including DM2.8bn in compensation payments for
Bonn.
Yesterday's agreement at a summit meeting of party leaders, including the
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the mayors of Bonn and Berlin,
is intended to remove lingering uncertainty about the timetable, given the
current pressures on the national budget.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the SPD, said he doubted the feasibility
of moving all the main government ministries to Berlin within two years.
He suggested the process should begin sooner, and that it should also
include reforms to amalgamate or streamline government ministries.
Precise details of the move, which will involve shifting some government
jobs back from Berlin to Bonn in compensation, have yet to be set out in a
parliamentary law. Eight government ministries will remain entirely based in
Bonn, but all ministers' offices will go to Berlin.
The city of Bonn, supported by many politicians in west Germany, has been
fighting a staunch rearguard action to delay the process.

FT  15 JAN 94 / French press squeezed by falling sales and advertising: Two
tabloids are launched. But this does not hide high costs and declining
revenues elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris news-seller glanced at the colourful front pages of InfoMatin and
Aujourd'hui, the new French tabloids. 'It's been a good week,' he said. 'My
customers have bought these new papers as well as their usual ones. But it
won't go on forever.'
So far, both InfoMatin, the morning paper launched on Monday by Le Monde,
and Aujourd'hui, which came out 10 days ago as the national version of Le
Parisien, the popular Paris tabloid, say their sales are above target. But
they are braced for a tough time once the novelty wears off.
The French newspaper industry is in crisis. The recession has caused a sharp
fall in advertising revenue and accelerated the long term sales decline of
national dailies, such as Le Monde and Le Figaro.
The industry is so secretive that it is difficult to assess the impact of
these problems. All the big titles are in private hands. The enigmatic Mr
Robert Hersant owns Le Figaro, the sensationalist France-Soir and a big
group of regional papers. Le Monde is controlled by a closed group of
shareholders, as is Liberation, the liberal-left daily. Le Parisien belongs
to the Armaury family.
But there are signs of strain. The Expansion group last year sold La Tribune
and L'Agefi, its financial dailies, to LVMH, the luxury goods company.
Expansion itself was this month rescued by CEP, an investment consortium. Le
Jour, a new daily launched last year, has closed. Some Hersant titles are
said to be up for sale including the loss-making France-Soir.
The worst problem is advertising. The recession has had a devastating effect
on classified advertising for recruitment and property. 'I know of papers
that have lost 80 per cent of their classified advertising in the past two
years,' says Mr Patrick Jousseaume, media analyst at Ferri, the Paris
stockbroker.
Display advertising has also declined as mainstream advertisers have trimmed
budgets. This problem has been aggravated by the impact of reform in the
advertising industry implemented by the old socialist government. The reform
was intended to erode the power of specialist media buying groups or
agencies. But by transferring responsibility for media buying from the
advertisers themselves, it has had the effect of concentrating spending on
fewer media: generally spending more on television and less on press.
National newspapers have borne the brunt of the decline. Industry estimates
suggest that their advertising revenue has fallen by 27 per cent in the past
two years and is set to fall by 10 per cent in 1994. The comparable figures
for the regional press are 14 per cent and 6 per cent.
The nationals' plight is due partly to the advertising reform and partly to
their dwindling sales. France's three biggest selling papers are regionals:
Ouest France with a 770,000 circulation, Le Progres in Lyon with 450,000 and
Le Parisien with 395,000. Le Figaro, the leading national, has seen its
sales fall from 432,000 to below 380,000 in the past five years. Le Parisien
has just ended its third year of growth.
One reason for the nationals' decline is increased competition from
television since the government's deregulation drive in the 1980s, which
shook up the old state-controlled system by launching new channels. 'People
still buy local papers because they provide news that isn't available on
television,' says Mr Pierre Flabbee, media analyst at Paribas. 'But they've
definitely cut down on the nationals.'
The newspapers have found it difficult to fight back. They are burdened by
high costs due to the power of the trade unions which has left them prey to
strikes and with relatively high staffing levels. As a result French
newspapers tend to be expensive. Le Monde costs FFr7 (80 pence). Even
downmarket France-Soir sells for FFr5. InfoMatin and Aujourd'hui have
tactically adopted lower prices of FFr3 and FFr3.50 respectively.
But there is little the new launches can do to counter the rigidity of the
distribution system, a monopoly controlled by Les Nouvelles Messageries de
la Presse Parisienne. The system is not only expensive but inflexible
thereby impeding the nationals' attempts to boost sales outside Paris.
Liberation still depends on the Paris region for half its sales.
These long term problems will impede the industry's efforts to overcome the
short term pressures of recession. Analysts do not expect the advertising
market to recover until next year.
In the meantime the casualties seem set to continue. The only consolation is
that there seems to be no shortage of potential rescuers as LVMH's recent
acquisitions illustrate.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Clinton tunes into Europe

   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It really does not make too much difference if it is Peoria or Prague,
Malibu or Moscow, Bill Clinton, never an easy man to pin down, is developing
a certain consistency of behaviour.
For starters, he will play the saxophone wherever he goes. He did so at a
bar in Prague on Tuesday, in Boris Yeltsin's dacha on Thursday in the middle
of a meal appropriately featuring lip of moose and undoubtedly would have
performed at Kiev airport on Wednesday had the Ukrainian army jazz ensemble
been rustled up in time to accompany him.
He no longer needs to pack his own horn on Air Force One. He was presented
with a new one in Brussels (the saxophone was invented by a Belgian, Adolphe
Sachs) and a signed one by Vaclav Havel, the Czech president once better
known for making music with words.
The Russian saxophone industry is underdeveloped but Mr Yeltsin managed to
come up with a small porcelain figurine featuring Mr Clinton carrying his
beloved instrument.
Jazz, of course, is the great American indigenous art form, along with the
movies, which Ronald Reagan, about as good an actor as Mr Clinton is a sax
player, deployed to some effect. At least Summertime, a favourite in the
Clinton repertoire and an antidote to snowy Moscow, is more uplifting than
Bedtime for Bonzo, if less funny.
Next, this president cannot resist crowds, especially if they are to be
found in restaurants and food shops, preferably those he remembers
frequenting as a student travelling in Europe 25 years ago.
Raised since, like most US politicians, on the rubber chicken circuit, he
was irresistibly and understandably drawn to bread and sausage
establishments in Moscow, no longer having to jump queues to get in and
paying, like all good Russians are now supposed to, in roubles.
He is also an unstoppable talker. This may happen quasi-informally, as this
week he strolled in the Grande Place in Brussels, along the Charles Bridge
in Prague and in and around Red Square here, or in his favourite forum, the
televised 'town meeting,' such as took place yesterday afternoon at the
Ostankino studios and at the Kmart store in Prague.
Eclectic though he may be, however, his message is also getting consistent.
A constant throughout his week in Europe has been the virtues of continental
integration; in the Czech Republic and Russia the emphasis has been more on
the virtues of democracy and market-oriented economic reform.
His legendary empathy seems to be applied equally to the high and low. The
Russians may be liking Boris Yeltsin less and less but Mr Clinton and the
Russian president appear to get on famously, hugging and clutching each
other and cracking jokes, presumably about defence conversion. Stern western
Europeans, like Jacques Delors and Manfred Worner, have been charmed out of
their socks, Helmut Kohl was compared to a sumo wrestler and he delicately
avoided any discussion of basic issues, even retrospective ones, with John
Major.
In other respects, it has not been an easy week for Mr Clinton. He is
reportedly still grieving for his mother, who died last week, and must have
had part of his mind on the Whitewater developments back home in Washington.
This has been a particular frustration for the 200 strong and progressively
exhausted travelling White House press corps as it debated whether or not to
press him on Whitewater.
The denouement finally came in Kiev when a network TV reporter broke the ice
and asked the question. For the first, and only, time this week, Bill
Clinton was not amused.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Optimistic Rexrodt expects 1% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday confirmed an
official forecast of 1.0 to 1.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product
this year, showing considerably more optimism than independent analysts.
He insisted the prediction, based on a significant recovery of exports,
steady growth of 6 to 8 per cent in east Germany, low interest rates and
moderate wage settlements, was 'not optimistic, but serious and realistic'.
Speaking in advance of next week's publication of the German government's
annual economic report, Mr Rexrodt also spelt out plans for measures to
deregulate the labour market, promote investment by small and medium-sized
enterprises, and accelerate privatisation.
The economics ministry forecast is significantly higher than that of the
government's independent economic advisers - the so-called five wise men -
who predict zero growth.
The federation of German banks said yesterday that recovery would only be
very gradual because of the low levels of capacity utilisation, low level of
industrial orders, and modest outlook for consumer spending.
Mr Rexrodt said the government forecast assumed a recovery of between 0.5
and 1.0 per cent in west Germany, and between 6 and 8 per cent in the east.
He agreed that caution was still justified, because disposable incomes would
be squeezed by higher pension and social security deductions, and by an
increase in oil taxes.
Among measures to promote competition and deregulate the German economy, he
promised an amendment to energy legislation giving third parties increased
access to the country's gas and electricity grids.
The government forecast still expects an increase of 450,000 in
unemployment, to reach more than 3.9m during the year. Mr Rexrodt said
radical thinking was needed to make labour markets more flexible. He called
for more low-wage employment, and a relaxation of tax and social security
rules governing employment of cleaners and other household staff.
Thyssen Stahl, the steelmaking arm of the Thyssen group, yesterday announced
a further 1,250 job cuts this year after the continuing 'catastrophic'
pattern of earnings in the industry in the last quarter of 1993.
The latest redundancies come on top of 12,000 job losses already announced
by Germany's largest steelmaker, and will affect primarily all the company's
long product plants.
Thyssen said it could not make redundancy payments, and asked the state
government of North Rhine-Westphalia to provide funding.
Separately, Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, announced
short-time working in its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern and Eisenach
during the first quarter of 1994, saying it did not expect 'any significant
recovery' in the car market this year.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Yeltsin ushers out cold war with N-accord

<TEXT>
We have put the last full stop to the last chapter of the cold war,' said
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday, on signing the agreement between Russia,
Ukraine and the US on the transfer of Ukraine's nuclear weapons to Russia.
Is it the last full stop?
It promises to be so. But, as officials from all sides privately admitted
yesterday, there are uncertainties and dangers ahead before the agreement
becomes a reality.
Worked out over the past year, with intensive negotiations between the three
sides in Washington this month and last, the deal creates a trilateral
relationship in which all sides both give and receive.
First, Ukraine will, over the next 10 months, ship at least 200 warheads -
including those from the the largest, SS24 missiles - to Russia. Russia will
reprocess the highly enriched uranium from these warheads and supply Ukraine
with 100 tonnes of low-enriched uranium for its civilian power stations. The
US will pay Dollars 60m to Russia for this contract - to be recouped from
payments due to Russia under a separate contract for the supply from Russia
to the US of highly enriched uranium.
Under separate agreement, the newly-formed US Enrichment Corporation will
pay Dollars 11.9bn over 20 years to the Soviet Union for 500 metric tonnes
of HEU over the next 20 years.
In constructing the deal, US officials were careful to put the deliveries of
the SS24 warheads at the front - since these are weapons which the Ukrainian
nationalists would most like to retain and which should thus be hastened out
of the country.
Ukraine, with a decision of its parliament last year not to fully ratify the
Start 1 treaty (which would cleanse it of nuclear weapons) until some 13
conditions were met, has taken the largest leap. Mr Leonid Kravhcuk,
Ukrainian president, yesterday said he was justified in signing the
agreement because he had met these conditions and that a new parliament
would agree to that.
Ukraine has received security guarantees from the US ad Russia, which are
essentially those already available to it as a member of the Conference for
Security and Co-operation in Europe and as a signatory to the
Non-Proliferation treaty. These, in sum, come down to guarantees of
assistance in the case of attack - though Mr Kravchuk stressed its best
guarantee was in continued good relations with its neighbours and in
reviving its economy.
Quite how much financial and other compensation it will receive is cloudy.
It is due some Dollars 175m for the dismantling of the tactical nuclear
weapons it has already undertaken, and will have that topped up to Dollars
300m in bilateral assistance. It may receive as much as Dollars 1bn in
further compensation.
The US has privately told the Ukrainians that they will ask the Wold Bank
for Dollars 300m in import adjustment support - even before a credible plan
is on the table. However, once economic reform, long stalled, does come to
the forefront, 'several billion dollars' (according to one senior offical)
will be put up by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Once
this happened, international investment would begin to flow.
Mr Kravchuk also said that a component of the agreement would be a reduction
of the Rbs3,000bn energy debt which his country owes to Russia - though Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, denied it to Interfax News Agency yesterday. Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, is said to have agreed at the
Commonwealth of Independent States summit last year, to supply cut-price oil
and gas to Ukraine.
Beyond these substantive possibilities, there is the more intangible one of
Ukraine setting an example for other nuclear powers - one to which Mr
Kravchuk attached great importance.
Finally, as Mr Kravchuk admitted, the status of Crimea and the ownership of
the Black Sea Fleet remains contentious between the two countries. A
nationalist-minded parliament in Russia and a possibly fearful one in
Ukraine may not see it, as Mr Kravchuk does, as a 'potential bridge of
friendship. The full stop has been put to the agreement on paper: not yet in
practice.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Clinton signs three-way N-missile agreement: Ukraine nuclear
arsenal to go as US and Russia end mutual targeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton wrapped up a successful Moscow visit yesterday by
signing agreements to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and to end the
targeting of US and Russian missiles at each other after May 30.
He also heard President Boris Yeltsin promise active Russian participation
in Nato's new programme of co-operation with the nations of the former
Warsaw Pact.
The US president rewarded Mr Yeltsin's renewed commitment to economic reform
by announcing that he had earmarked an additional Dollars 900m (Pounds
608.1m) in assistance in next year's US budget, to be presented in February.
He said that meant that, with some existing appropriations unspent, Russia
was assured of at least Dollars 1bn in US funds in each of the next two
years.
But the upbeat comments of Mr Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and President Leonid
Kravchuk of Ukraine praising the various substantive achievements of the
past 48 hours could not entirely dispel a sense that not all the commitments
on paper would easily be translated into action.
The Ukrainian agreement, which provides for the dismantling and removal of
the most potent nuclear warheads and missiles over the next 10 months, still
has to be ratified by the parliament in Kiev, a prospect that even US
officials privately rated as a 50-50 chance.
In Kiev last night Mrs Tatyana Yakheyeva, one of the members of the
parliamentary commission on Start 1, said: 'At the very least there will be
a veto on the deal - at the most, Kravchuk faces impeachment.' At the same
time, a row broke out between Mr Anatoly Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign
minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, on whether Ukraine
had been promised relief on its Rbs 1,000bn energy debt to Russia.
Both Mr Clinton and Mr Kravchuk, the latter visibly elated at his presence
on a world stage and looking forward to a Washington visit in March, argued
that the more Ukrainians learned about the treaty, the greater the
likelihood of approval. Benefits include an estimated Dollars 1bn Ukrainian
share of the Dollars 12bn, 20-year agreement also signed yesterday for US
purchases from Russia of highly enriched uranium extracted from missiles.
On Nato, Mr Yeltsin said its Partnership for Peace, which he called 'a very
good formula', should still be seen as only one of the mechanisms for
enhancing European security. He also warned against any Nato attempt to
'dismember us' by admitting eastern European nations 'one by one'.
US officials insisted, however, that Mr Yeltsin's commitment to the
partnership was stronger than they had expected and more than offset his
apparent reservations. Once Russia has formally applied to take part, the
respective military commands will work out co-operation procedures over the
next few months.
A big cloud still hangs over economic reform. Deep political divisions were
further reflected when the lower house of the Russian parliament elected as
Speaker Mr Ivan Rybkin, a former communist who now belongs to the
conservative Agrarian party.
He was returned with support from the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats,
headed by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who, before becoming involved in a fight
with a reformist MP, continued in countless interviews to pour scorn on Mr
Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and even the existence of US financial assistance.
The Russian president's tart rejoinder was that the upper house was 'smarter
and more intellectual'. He maintained that the 60 per cent who voted in
favour of the new Russian constitution was a more reliable indicator of
reform sentiment than the composition of the parliament.
Still, Mr Yeltsin, anxious not to appear too much the supplicant, again
nudged Mr Clinton towards making the Group of Seven industrialised nations a
club of eight by admitting Russia. He said Russia wanted 'full-scale
co-operation' in the transition to a market economy.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Portillo blunts PM's drive for unity on 'back to basics'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's attempts to end the controversy over Mr John Major's 'back
to basics' programme ran into fresh difficulties last night.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, led a concerted cabinet campaign to
restore intellectual coherence to the call for a return to traditional
values.
But his emphasis on a common sense approach across the range of government
policies was followed by a sharp attack from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, on critics of Britain's national traditions and
institutions.
Despite clearance for his speech from Downing Street, Mr Portillo, a leading
cabinet right winger, faced charges from some on the Tory left that he was
flouting Mr Major's authority.
But the prime minister's office rejected as 'malicious fiction' reports last
night that Mr Major had launched an outspoken attack on right-wing members
of the cabinet during private conversations which took place earlier this
week.
Referring to a 'new British disease', Mr Portillo castigated critics of the
monarchy, parliament and the established church. He blamed what he called
the anti-establishment chattering classes for spreading the 'poison of
pessimism' which undermined national self-confidence and respect for British
institutions.
Mr Portillo told an audience of the rightwing Conservative Way Forward Group
that our 'our mission must be to rebuild national self-confidence and
self-belief'. He said: 'We need to assert the value and the quality of the
British way of life and of British institutions.'
Mr Hurd sought to disentangle the central message of 'back to basics' from
the private lives of ministers and Conservative MPs, by insisting that it
represented a 'commonsense' approach to the much wider concerns of the
electorate.
His emphasis on the government's drive to improve standards in schools, to
nurture the economic recovery and to redouble the fight against crime was
echoed in speeches and interviews by several other cabinet ministers.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, also joined Mr Hurd in urging the government's
supporters to 'keep their nerve' during the present storm.
Setting out the line agreed by the cabinet in an effort to rescue the 'back
to basics' programme, the foreign secretary said politicians should not set
themselves up as the arbiters of personal morality.
Nor should the personal failings of some politicians be mistaken for the
fortunes of the government, said Mr Hurd.
Mr Hurd's confident exposition, however, did little to disguise the debate
still raging in the cabinet and in the Conservative party concerning the
extent to which the government should set a moral tone for the nation.
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, and Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, are among those in the cabinet who believe a programme promoting
the difference between right and wrong cannot avoid touching on individual
morality.

FT  15 JAN 94 / MMC to investigate video games makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate whether video games
manufacturers, notably Sega and Nintendo of Japan, are over-charging
consumers and unfairly restricting competition.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of Fair Trading, said yesterday that he
had ordered the probe after an increasing number of consumers had complained
that prices of new games were higher in Britain than in the US.
Retailers had complained about manufacturers' distribution practices, while
software publishers were frustrated by the licensing arrangements for
production of games used on the leading brands of hardware.
The move was welcomed by the Consumers Association, which has repeatedly
criticised manufacturers' prices and marketing practices. Sega and Nintendo
said they would co-operate with the MMC but insisted the market was fully
competitive.
The two companies account for about 90 per cent of the British video games
market, worth more than Pounds 700m last year, three times more than in
1991. Games hardware costs between Pounds 50 and Pounds 300, while games
prices range from Pounds 10 to Pounds 60 for new releases.
Sega said it was surprised by the inquiry, and Nintendo said the UK video
games market was the most competitive in the world. Conditions were
particularly fierce at Christmas, when about 40 per cent of all toys sold
were video games.
There have recently been signs that some prices are softening. Dixons, the
electrical retailer, said last week that it expected lower profits this
year, partly because of a price war in video game consoles launched by the
Woolworths and Comet chains.
However, some independent surveys late last year found that retail prices of
new games were as much as 50 per cent higher in Britain than in the US.
The MMC, which is due to report by the end of October, is expected to focus
on complaints by retailers and independent software publishers, which
produce about half the games sold by Nintendo and Sega.
Some retailers have told the Office of Fair Trading that they have been
compelled to buy exclusively from the two companies and prevented from
obtaining the same items more cheaply from other sources abroad.
Some small retailers, particularly rental outlets, have also claimed that
they are supplied with new games only after they are on sale in bigger
chains.
Independent software publishers have complained that Sega and Nintendo use
licensing arrangements and their policies of manufacturing all the games
used on their machines to restrict the supply of new products to the market.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in US output lifts shares to new highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real
terms in the fourth quarter of last year, a further sign of the accelerating
pace of economic recovery, figures from the Federal Reserve indicated
yesterday.
The news prompted a strong rise in share prices, which reached record highs
in early trading. By midday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.40 at
3,872.83. Bond prices fell on fears that faster growth would bring forward
the timing of an interest rate rise.
As the Clinton administration puts the final touches to this year's budget,
due early next month, senior officials are increasingly confident about the
economic outlook.
In an upbeat address in New York yesterday, Mr Robert Rubin, chairman of the
White House National Economic Council, forecast a robust, sustained
recovery. He said there was 'very little probability of inflation
reigniting' and predicted 3 per cent growth this year.
Mr Rubin said economic conditions would also be favourable in 1995 and 1996
because, by then, the US would be getting a boost from economic recovery in
Japan and Europe.
In an apparent preview of the budget, Mr Rubin also predicted that the US
would make more rapid progress than expected in reducing the federal budget
deficit.
The deficit would fall to 'substantially under 2 per cent of GDP' over five
years, he said. Last year's budget projected a deficit of 3.1 per cent of
GDP in 1998.
The Fed report showed production up 0.7 per cent in December after strong
gains in preceding months. Although led by a surge in car production, output
strength appears broadly based. Nearly every industrial sector registered
gains. Excluding cars, production was up 0.5 per cent last month, the same
rise as in November.
The rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to 83.5 per cent, above its
long-term average of 81.9 per cent but still below the 84.8 registered at
the peak of the 1980s boom.
Preliminary figures suggest that the first quarter got off to a good start.
The University of Michigan's closely-watched consumer sentiment index was
reported to have risen sharply in early January to 95.8 against 88.2 in
December.
The rise is a reassuring sign that consumers are not reducing their spending
after the Christmas period.
Separate data released yesterday showed business inventories up 0.6 per cent
in November. However, they failed to keep pace with the growth in business
sales, which rose by 1.1 per cent.
As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio slipped to 1.44, its lowest level
since 1982, raising the prospect of increased production if consumer demand
continues to rise this year.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Bundesbank chief says EU bank should follow German policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, gave notice yesterday he would
fight hard for the adoption of German monetary policies by the future
European central bank.
Medium-term money supply targets, mainstay of the Bundesbank's policy, were
the best way to ensure price stability, he told a banking audience in
Oldenburg, north-west Germany.
Such measures allowed inflationary pressures to be spotted early and helped
avoid the mistakes which were part and parcel of a stop-go policy.
Minimum reserve requirements for commercial banks were 'indispensable' to
slow down money creation, he said. The finance sector should also contribute
to stability by encouraging the dominance of longer-term lending rates.
The European Monetary Institute (EMI), forerunner of the proposed European
central bank, had a lot of work ahead of it, Mr Tietmeyer said. The
Bundesbank would campaign heavily for the adoption of the German central
bank's policies.
Speaking within days of the institute's first formal meeting in Frankfurt,
he reiterated his scepticism on the timing of the introduction of a common
currency.
Mr Tietmeyer, who has in the past effectively written off 1997 as a starting
date, said that if there was 'a serious clash between the political deadline
and economic necessity,' then monetary union would have to wait. He also
rejected suggestions that the EMI should establish an EU-wide money supply
target in the run-up to monetary union. That would lead to grey areas
between the responsibilities of the institute and individual central banks.
Mr Tietmeyer supported his case for a German-style European central bank
with a catalogue of successes, which he attributed to the Bundesbank's
'dogged' adherence to its policy.
'Inflation is slowing, inflationary expectations have been broken, long-term
interest rates have been at unusually low levels for some time . . . and the
external value of the D-Mark has stayed stable,' he said.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Gorman denounces Pounds 1m homes report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MP Mrs Teresa Gorman last night denounced a newspaper report
that she had made Pounds 1m in transactions from two Westminster council
houses.
The report in today's Daily Mirror claims that she bought the homes, in Lord
North Street, from the council for Pounds 55,000. It says she sold one last
year for Pounds 445,000 and that the other one, in which she lives, is worth
about Pounds 500,000.
Mrs Gorman, MP for Billericay, said the report was 'a sordid attempt' to
make a mountain out of a molehill. 'The situation is that we bought this
house - it was two houses knocked into one - on a 14-year lease in 1975. I
cannot remember what we paid for it.
'A few years later we were offered the freehold of the house, as were the
occupants of all the houses around here.
'We spent a lot of money making it habitable. It was in an awful state. We
bought the freehold and have lived in the house ever since. A year or two
ago, because it was too big for our requirements, we reconverted it back at
considerable expense to two houses, as it had been up to the 1920s.
'Last year we sold No 13 for Pounds 445,000 and I suppose the one we have
lived in for 20 years and still live in is worth about the same. But to
suggest that I have made Pounds 1m out of it is utterly and totally absurd.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Warning of more coal mine closures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday warned that more closures among the remaining 22
operating pits were inevitable.
But Mr Andrew Horsler, commercial director, said that the programme of
restructuring was nearing its end.
Meanwhile a management buy-out team at the Betws pit in south Wales said it
hoped to resume mining this spring after British Coal indicated that it was
the preferred candidate to operate the mine.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Leakey quits after virulent campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Leakey, the renowned conservationist, has resigned his post with
the Kenya Wildlife Service after a virulent two-week campaign against him.
Ministers and politicians have accused Mr Leakey, whose crusade led to a
much acclaimed worldwide ban on the ivory trade in 1989, of racism,
arrogance and irregular management decisions.
If Mr Leakey's resignation is accepted by President Daniel arap Moi, it will
raise severe concerns among international donors who have pledged up to
Dollars 300m for conservation to Kenya. They see Mr Leakey as personally
responsible for successes over the past five years in stamping out poaching
and improving efficiency and profitability of wildlife - the base of Kenya's
tourism industry.
The government has set up an inquiry into Mr Leakey and the KWS but refused
to make public the terms of reference.
In the past, Mr Moi has often quietly backed smear campaigns against
ministers and officials before sacking them.
At the heart of the row is the issue of land allocation in wildlife areas.
Mr Leakey warned that his resignation would have 'far reaching consequences'
and said he had resisted attempts at what he called 'land grabbing' by
politicians. He gave four specific examples, including an attempt by
'certain political figures' to have 10,000 acres carved out of the Tsavo
National Park.
'Has my insistence that the wildlife-protected areas be protected from some
greedy people been the reason for this charge (of arrogance)? I suspect so,'
Mr Leakey said yesterday.
Close associates and friends of Mr Leakey admit that he is abrasive and can
be arrogant. He has built up an independent and powerful fiefdom at KWS and
bruised many political egos and created jealousies.

Corruption and venal personality power politics in Kenya yesterday claimed
Mr Richard Leakey, the international face of wildlife conservation and
anti-poaching efforts in East Africa.
If Mr Leakey's resignation is accepted by President Daniel Arap Moi it will
raise severe doubts among international donors. They have pledged up to
Dollars 300m and see Mr Leakey as personally responsible for successes over
the past five years to stamp out poaching and improve efficiency and
profitability of wildlife - the base of Kenya's tourism industry.
Mr Leakey, whose crusade led to a worldwide ban on the ivory trade,
announced his resignation from the Kenya Wildlife Service after a two week
smear campaign alleging racism, arrogance and irregular management
decisions. The government has set up a probe into Mr Leakey and the KWS
Service but refused to make public the terms of reference.
President Moi, who appointed Mr Leakey five years ago at the height of a
grave elephant poaching and corruption crisis has remained silent. In the
past Mr Moi has often quietly backed smear campaigns against ministers and
officials before sacking them.
At the heart of the row is the issue of land allocation in wildlife areas
made by Mr Leakey.
Mr Leakey, warned that his resignation would have 'far reaching
consequences', and said he had resisted attempts at what he called 'land
grabbing' by politicians. He gave four specific examples including an
attempt by 'certain political figures' to have 10,000 acres carved out of
the Tsavo National Park.
'Has my insistence that the wildlife protected areas be protected from some
greedy people been the reason for this charge (of arrogance)? I suspect so,'
Mr Leakey said. 'There are numerous examples where the national interest
would have been compromised had I given in.'
Close associates and friends of Mr Leakey admit that he is abrasive and can
be arrogant. He has built up an independent and powerful fiefdom at KWS and
bruised many political egos and created jealousies. Backed by the president
and embraced as the darling of international conservation groups, Mr Leakey
felt he was untouchable and often acted without too much consultation.
But many say he almost single-handedly restored international credibility to
the Kenyan wildlife department which was tarnished throughout the 1980s with
corruption, nepotism, political interference, inefficiency and allegations
that leading Kenyan families were involved with poaching of ivory and rhino
horn.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Porter attacks district auditor's findings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dame Shirley Porter, at the centre of this week's row over allegations of
gerrymandering at Westminster city council, last night attacked the judgment
of the Westminster district auditor and vowed to fight her case to the House
of Lords in a bid to clear her name.
Speaking to the Financial Times from Palm Springs, California, where she is
on holiday, Dame Shirley dismissed as 'ludicrous' the suggestion that Pounds
21.25m had been wasted as a result of Conservative-controlled Westminster's
council house sales policy.
Dame Shirley, leader of Westminster council until 1991, said she refuted
'everything' in this week's damning report by Mr John Magill, the district
auditor, who said in provisional findings that Dame Shirley and nine other
people connected with the council might have to repay the money alleged to
have been wasted.
During a 20-minute telephone conversation, Dame Shirley, in confident mood,
said she rejected the methodology on which Mr Magill's report had been
based. She had lined up a 'leading firm' of accountants - which she was not
prepared to name - to counter the suggestions made in the findings from Mr
Magill, who is a leading accountant at Touche Ross.
Asked about suggestions that she had disposed of documents pertinent to the
inquiry, Dame Shirley said: 'I have not disposed of anything at any time.'
She accused Mr Magill of 'making a new law' in his provisional findings.
These were seized upon this week by Labour politicians who claimed they
demonstrated the weakened moral authority of the Conservative government.
Dame Shirley said she had 'complete faith' in the judgment of Mr Jeremy
Sullivan, Queen's Counsel who acts for Westminster council and who had
assured her and other council officers that the authority's housing policies
were legal.

FT  15 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: New pieces in an old game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a Prague newspaper: 'If the west is not to bend the knee before Moscow,
it will have to give the central European countries a clear promise. Not
because those lands face an acute threat but in order to save face and to
show that, five years after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, there is at
last a project for the whole continent.'
Thus the daily, Lidove Noviny, showed its lack of enthusiasm for what the
Americans called 'Partnership for Peace' at the Nato summit this week.
In the same paper, Lech Walesa, the Polish president, attacked the Czechs
for being 'too soft' in their attitude to the formula. The west planned
'PforP' as a bare maximum - the most that could be offered without annoying
Moscow.
This was not enough for the Poles and others in central Europe who want to
join Nato. They think the west is offering them protection in the future,
once it has been demonstrated they don't need it.
The crispest answer to the implicit accusation of hypocrisy came in a German
paper: 'A security system for eastern Europe cannot be constructed without
or against Russia, but only with it.'
Nevertheless, German opinion was divided. The Frankfurter Rundschau said
Partnership for Peace had some advantages - it gave Russian President Boris
Yeltsin the chance to sell the Nato decision as a success, but added that
the future of Russian democracy depended far more on economic success than
anything in the security field.
This view was echoed in Moscow: Pravda said of US President Bill Clinton's
visit: 'The US delegation has in its bag more pieces of advice and political
declarations than economic programmes, or, most importantly, funds for their
realisation.'
In fact the Americans are just plain confused; they went to Moscow in the
belief that Yeltsin was still the one man in the region they could do
business with.
But the arguments within Nato today are the same as those between the wars,
after the collapse of the imperial system in east and central Europe. The
question is this: once a belt of new independent nations has been
constructed down the middle of Europe between Russians and Germans, who is
going to guarantee their security?
The very act of offering a guarantee can lead to trouble. So the British and
French refused to stand up for Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Poles then
rejected Soviet guarantees in 1939 - the country's foreign minister Colonel
Beck was said to have signed away his country between two flicks of his
cigarette. And the British knew that by offering Poland a treaty they were
probably guaranteeing, not Poland, but a second world war.
But things have changed in some respects. Germany is no longer led by a
maniac and most countries of the region welcome a security system in which
Germany plays a leading role. There is also the unrecognised fact that today
Russia has no borders with any country of central Europe, a unique
situation. Instead Ukraine acts as one buffer and Belarus as another.
Everybody forgets Belarus, still known in German as White Russia.
This fact should offer an unusual opportunity. Sixty years ago the successor
states of central Europe were supposed to form a cordon sanitaire against
Bolshevik expansionism. Today, in different circumstances, Ukraine and
Belarus might play the same role. But nobody thinks in those terms, so the
west has demanded that Ukraine get rid of its nuclear arsenal. It might one
day be glad that that country does not make good its promise to do so.
With Russia now removed from central Europe's back yard and Germany run by
peace-loving democrats, why is everybody so worried? The noted Liberal
Democrat, Vladimir Zhirinovsky is obviously one reason but the other is that
nobody seems able to grasp the full dimension of the present situation.
Policy-makers see no role for Belarus or the Baltic states because they have
not assimilated them into their planning framework. Bismarck or Kissinger
would have known what to do - support someone unpleasant or pour men and
weapons into the region.
The situation is like a chess championship played with many new pieces.
Imagine Short and Kasparov have been given extra rooks and pawns, plus some
new pieces with unusual moves, say a 'Serb' (10 squares backwards and then
mates itself). In such circumstances players like me could probably give a
grandmaster a hard time.
That's the trouble with Europe today: far too many pieces on the board,
nobody knows what they can do, where they are or what they are all called.
It makes novices of us all.

FT  14 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) Technology: Japanese elevator girls bow out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 21st January 1994) appended to this article.
For many Japanese, one of the pleasures of shopping in up-market department
stores has been riding the lifts, operated by 'elevator girls' - smartly
dressed in designer uniforms, bowing and smiling while pressing the buttons
to each floor.
Selecting the floors of the automated lifts has long been considered an
important 'service' by both retailer and customer. But due to the consumer
slump and new technology, Japanese shoppers may soon find themselves
pressing their own lift buttons and being greeted instead by a computerised
screen.
Many department store operators are now being forced to restructure their
operations because of the sharp fall in retail spending, especially on
luxury items. The economic downturn has brought about a radical change in
consumer spending patterns, and even the most prestigious operators are
falling into the red.
Fujitec, a leading elevator maker, claims to have the answer for the
department store operators caught between the need to cut costs and
customers who still consider a smile and a warm welcome as an important
attraction.
The company has developed jointly with Sanyo Electric a computerised
information system for department store lifts where a female attendant on
screen smiles and bows, reciting wares to customers. A system for four
elevators costs around Y10m (Pounds 595,200), which Fujitec claims is
cheaper than hiring four elevator girls.
A customer entering the lift will be greeted by a female attendant on a
screen display above the lift door. While the lift is moving, the screen
will display product and shopping information, and when the lift stops,
floor information will flash on to the screen followed by a bowing
attendant.
Fujitec says it has received inquiries from several department stores. The
company says the system can also be used for screening advertisements or
scenery in lifts in ordinary office buildings, providing something for
people to look at.
CORRECTION
In the article on January 14 headed 'Japanese elevator girls bow out', the
sterling equivalent of the Y10m cost of the lift information system was
given wrongly as Pounds 595,200 instead of Pounds 59,520.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney creditor banks plan to hold a special meeting in Paris on
January 26 to discuss their strategy in the negotiations to produce a
financial rescue package for the stricken leisure group.
The banks, which have formed a steering committee to orchestrate the
restructuring led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, have
commissioned an investigative audit of Euro Disney's finances from KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting and consultancy group.
KPMG is expected by the end of today to produce a preliminary report on Euro
Disney, but will present the banks with a full audit at the January 26
meeting. It is also analysing Euro Disney's business plan to assess whether
the banks should demand changes in personnel and strategy.
The 60 international banks that hold Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars
3.47bn) net debt are scheduled to attend the Paris meeting. The banks
include JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays,
National Westminster, Mitsubishi Trust and Bank of Tokyo.
One bank recently sold a FFr130m parcel of Euro Disney debt at 60 per cent
of its original value on the 'second hand' market. Three other creditors are
considering offers to sell their loans, according to New York analysts, but
are at present unwilling to sell for as little as 60 per cent.
Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, have already outlined
proposals for the banks to halve the ailing leisure group's debt through the
combination of a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. Walt Disney has
promised to provide financial support for Euro Disney until March 31, but
will then withdraw if the banks have not agreed terms. Euro Disney would
then go bankrupt.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Macedonia in IMF deal

<TEXT>
Macedonia has reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on
repaying Dollars 85m in overdue loans to the World Bank and launching an
economic reform programme, writes Karen Hope from Skopje.
The arrangement will give the former Yugoslav republic access to an IMF
standby facility of about Dollars 35m this year, and up to Dollars 80m in
World Bank funding for road, railway and telecommunications modernisation.
The Macedonian government estimates that UN sanctions imposed on its main
trading partner, Serbia, have cost the Macedonian economy Dollars 2.5bn. The
country's gross domestic product is projected to fall by 15 per cent this
year, following a 10 per cent drop in 1993.
The structural reform programme, launched this week, aims to cut annual
inflation from 240 per cent in 1993 to 70 per cent this year and trim the
public sector deficit from 13.5 to 6.7 per cent of GDP. The government plans
to increase tax revenues, reform the banking system and privatise almost 200
state companies.
European Union member countries have so far pledged Dollars 20m with the US
contributing another Dollars 5m. The mayor of Tuzla, in Bosnia, yesterday
broadcast a desperate appeal on Sarajevo radio, warning of an imminent
catastrophe because of food shortages, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade.
Mr Selim Beslagic said a 'humanitarian tragedy' was about to take place in
the city, the Bosnian government's biggest stronghold, with food left for
just five days.
His appeal followed a Nato communique on Tuesday which called on Bosnian
Serbs forces to allow the opening of the Tuzla airport or risk punitive air
strikes.
It also coincided with a push by Serb forces on Moslem-held Olovo, south of
Tuzla. The fall of Olovo would completely cut off land access to Tuzla and
expose it to attack.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong orders fail to alter Siemens outlook: Chairman warns
against hasty conclusions as earnings expected to fall by as much as 15 per
cent in current financial year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, has said it expects
earnings to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the current financial
year, in spite of a strong flow of orders in the first quarter.
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, yesterday warned against drawing hasty
conclusions from the 15 per cent rise in demand recorded in the three months
to the end of December. Mr von Pierer based his estimate of lower earnings
on assumptions that financial income of DM2.1bn (Dollars 1.22bn) last year,
compared with about DM1bn in 1991-92, would fall.
'As cautious business people, we cannot assume that capital market
conditions will remain unfailingly favourable,' he said.
Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making computer business would return a
deficit of about DM300m, according to Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance
director.
SNI last year reduced its deficit from more than DM500m to about DM400m. The
company, which shed 5,000 workers last year, would again be particularly
affected by plans for some 10,000 group-wide job cuts in the current year.
According to Mr von Pierer, the computer business still hopes to break even
in 1996. Officials expect semi-conductors, another persistent drain on
profits, to return to the black in 1995.
Mr von Pierer rejected speculation that the departure of Mr Hans-Dieter
Wiedig, chairman of SNI, was premature because of his failure to turn the
business round. Mr Wiedig, who is to hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer,
head of ABB in the US, on October 1, had told him he felt that 10 years in
data processing was enough and that he did not want to renew his contract
when it expired this September.
SNI was doing better than many others in the computer business, Mr von
Pierer claimed. New mid-range products had been well received. Volume sales
of personal computers had doubled, although the business was still suffering
from falling prices.
The company's problems stemmed from the culture clash when Siemens and
Nixdorf were merged in 1990.
Those problems had been compounded in the intervening period by a collapse
in the industry worldwide and by the impact of recession, Mr von Pierer
said.
As reported last November, group pre-tax profit for the last financial year
fell 9 per cent to DM2.9bn and net income increased marginally to DM1.98bn.
According to Mr Baumann, earnings from operating businesses excluding
investment income dropped 8 per cent.
During the first quarter of the new year, foreign orders rose 33 per cent to
DM13.2bn, but only 8 per cent when adjusted to allow for the distorting
effects of booking large Asian contracts and the first-time inclusion of the
Osram Sylvania lighting business in the US.
The domestic order book, which is heavily dependent on public contracts,
fell by 6 per cent to DM8.2bn.
Details of new orders booked for the last financial year, which were
released yesterday, showed clear signs of the recession and of reduced
government spending, particularly in Germany.
Demand for public communications, the group's biggest single business, fell
7 per cent to DM13.4bn after rising by 10 per cent the previous year.
The KWU power generation division booked an increase of only 1 per cent,
while automation equipment slipped  1/8 per cent, demonstrating the effects
of reduced capital investment by industrial customers.
Government figures published earlier this week showed that west German
spending on new plant and equipment fell by almost 15 per cent last year.
However, fast-growing businesses such as private communications and the
group's railway operations, showed increased orders of 15 per cent and 25
per cent respectively.
Mr von Pierer, who described last year's figures as respectable in the light
of the business environment, claimed the group would emerge stronger from
recession. Programmes for increased productivity and for shortened product
cycles had been introduced.
Siemens also planned to hire engineering graduates on a part-time basis.
'Employment restrictions must not be allowed to interrupt the ongoing
process of recruiting highly qualified graduates,' Mr von Pierer said.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Markets in Asia fall as investors take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asia's equity markets suffered a sharp decline in trading yesterday, led by
a 5.9 per cent plunge in Taiwan and a 5 per cent tumble in Hong Kong.
Analysts said the turnround after the recent phenomenal rise in the region
was due to selling by US and Japanese retail investors, with institutional
funds remaining committed.
They also pointed out that while the decline was broadly based, there was no
common theme behind yesterday's falls as markets reacted to domestic news
and developments.
Taiwan's slide, for instance, was largely the result of dashed hopes of
stronger links with mainland China.
Hong Kong's fall marked a third consecutive day of selling. In subsequent
London trading of Hong Kong shares, buyers returned, taking the indicative
market index up by 2 per cent, and some brokers expect the market to bounce
back today.
Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok saw 3 per cent falls, while Singapore and Manila
were both down by more than 2 per cent.
Many of south-east Asia's markets surged last year, with much of the rise in
the final quarter after US and Japanese banks and brokers, notably Morgan
Stanley and Nomura, put out strong recommendations. Manila rose by almost
155 per cent, Hong Kong by over 115 per cent and Kuala Lumpur by 98 per
cent.
Analysts say this left the region vulnerable to investors who wanted to cash
in profits, which was confirmed last week when some previously bullish
strategists downgraded their views on the region's attractions. The result
has been a cumulative 19.3 per cent slide in Kuala Lumpur since the start of
this year, and falls of over 14 per cent in Hong Kong and Bangkok.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Recruitment: Bringing in, raising up, throwing out -
Psychologists' research casts disturbing light on widely used tests of
people's working ability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you willingly stake your livelihood on your performance in tests not
only devised by folk largely ignorant about your job, but of dubious
legality? What prompts me to ask is that, far from being hypothetical, the
question seems more and more likely to confront this column's readers in
hard reality.
The danger is especially great for those of you whose living depends on your
being employed in organisations, which show signs of becoming addicted to
psychologists' measures of human capability. To make things worse, the cause
of the danger is not just that the so-called psychometric devices are in
growing vogue for selecting new recruits and deciding who is to be promoted.
After all, such yardsticks have been used for those purposes for several
decades.
The big difference is that employers are no longer using them solely for
those purposes. For in the days when use of the psychologists' divining rods
was confined to promotion and initial selection, the only people at risk to
them were aspiring job-changers who volunteered themselves to be measured as
candidates. People happy to continue working in the same job were safe from
the shrinks' inventions.
But fewer and fewer settled staff now have the guarantee of safety. no
matter how loyal their service. The reason is that besides relying on tests
and the like to select new blood to bring in or raise up, organisations are
increasingly using them to determine which longer-serving employees to throw
out.
While the reject-earmarking variant has been in occasional operation for 15
years or so, the latest recorded example in Britain at least came just
before Christmas in the London borough of Southwark. Staff of the local
council's 120-strong finance section were given a long and complex test,
apparently on the assurance that there was no 'correct' answer to any
question. As a result, however, 19 of them were told to cease working and
escorted from the office, and 10 have since reputedly been informed that the
council considers them unsuitable for employment.
Wishing to learn what leading psychologists think of such goings-on, I
telephoned Professor Ivan Robertson of the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, who is a world authority on
psychometric testing. It turned out that he hadn't previously heard about
the Southwark incident.
Even so, his opinion of it can be gauged from the fact that I had to make
several attempts before persuading him that such a thing had really
happened. He found it very hard to believe that anyone could misuse a
selection device so badly. Once I finally convinced him, Outrageous] was the
only printable comment on the matter he uttered. But he did add, among other
things, that in his view shrinks of the occupational type, at any rate, have
long and wrongly concentrated their efforts on providing the employers' side
of the issue with yardsticks, at the expense of paying insufficient heed to
their effect on the employees who get measured.
Professor Robertson also endorsed numerous of the criticisms of current
testing which were spelt out by a fellow psychologist - Dr Mark Cook, of the
University College of Swansea's Personnel Selection Research Group - during
last week's annual conference of the occupational section of the British
Psychological Society.
Dr Cook's main target was the way in which the selection devices are
'validated' or, in lay terms, the rules by which shrinks decide whether or
not the tests adequately assess what it takes to succeed in the types of
work for which candidates are being selected. The only properly acceptable
yardstick, he argues, is one that is demonstrably linked directly with
objective criteria of actual achievement in the job at issue. Examples are
value or volume of orders gained in the case of sales people, and numbers
and quality of widgets turned out in the case of certain production workers.
One reason behind his argument is that unless selection tests are valid by
directly objective criteria, those using them may fall foul of Britain's and
other countries' laws prohibiting discrimination by race, sex and so on.
Indeed, such laws often state specifically that, if there is an illegal bias
in any attribute demanded by a selection procedure, the onus is on the
employer to prove that the particular attribute is essential to good
performance in the work concerned.
Unfortunately, Dr Cook's extensive research into methods of validation shows
that only a minority of yardsticks are directly tied to actual job
achievement, for the simple reason that there are relatively few types of
work in which performance can be adequately gauged by objective criteria
alone. Hence most psychometric devices - at least 60 per cent, and possibly
more than three quarters - settle for more subjective criteria such as
ratings of employees' performance by their bosses.
While that may be understandable at a technical level, however, the Swansea
psychologist's studies also show that far from being a reasonable substitute
for objective criteria, bosses' ratings are a very different thing.
Researchers in various parts of the world have found that such ratings are
subject to a wide range of biases that can have little bearing on actual
achievement in a job.
He divides them into four main categories. One includes not only
discrimination on illegal grounds together with 'ageism', but irrelevant
likes and dislikes of particular physical and other individual traits as
well as personal views. A second covers the distorting effects of
politicking. The third group lumps together various aspects of 'impression
management', including the art of buttering up the boss discussed in the
Jobs column last week.
The biggest group is left to the last. Headed 'the undeserved reputation',
it notes 10 ways in which seniors and juniors alike go about getting
themselves seen as good performers while doing little if any productive
work.
Dr Cook tells me that the criterion of bosses' ratings flaws not only a lot
of tests of personality, but also many of those purporting to measure what
was once called 'intelligence' although it is now termed 'cognitive ability'
or the like. In all such cases, the prevalence of subjective biases suggest
the yardsticks cannot be reliable for selecting truly productive staff, and
cast doubt on the measures' legality to boot. He nevertheless stresses that
mere doubt is a long way short of sufficient reason to view them as
unequivocally against the law.
But there was a certain contrasting lack of caution in the words of another
psychologist who contributed to last week's conference. He is Dr Derek North
of Sheffield who criticised further selection yardsticks which are even more
widely used in Britain. Their most popular use is in whittling down initial
applications to shortlists of people deemed worthy of interview.
He certainly pulled few punches in declaring that the evidence shows such
methods are not only of very dubious legality, but a poor predictor of work
performance. Employers using them in the standard way probably ensure two
results. First, rob themselves of 'the opportunity to employ people who will
probably be eminently suitable for the job'. Second, some of the recruits
whom they do take on will be less competent than the people they put off.
Dr North, by the way, works for Britain's official employment service. And
the yardsticks he criticised are formal educational qualifications.

FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters bounces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A much-vaunted deal between Reuters Holdings and Citicorp to acquire the
latter's Quotron equity dealing system in the US was announced yesterday and
saw the Reuters share price bounce 28 to 1853p in a lifeless market.
Most analysts welcomed the deal and Mr Alastair Smellie of US house Lehman
Brothers said Citicorp's statement that it proposed to 'guarantee certain
operating losses' sugg-ested that Citicorp might actually pay Reuters to
take on a business estimated to have lost Dollars 50m in 1993. 'Assuming
completion at the right price, this represents an excellent deal for
Reuters,' added Mr Smellie.
Mr Paul Norris of BZW said: 'This is the last piece in a golden jigsaw of
acquiring domestic equity real time information services and a terrific move
for Reuters. I can see the shares hitting Pounds 20 over the next month.'
The first whisper of the Quotron deal, which is still only agreed in
principle, came just before Christmas and sent the shares up to 1880p.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was hit by a spate of negative stories. The
most bearish was the formal launch by SmithKline Beecham of a new drug in
the UK. Famvir, a treatment for shingles, is a direct competitor to
Wellcome's key product, Zovirax.
Although fears of a price war were dispelled recently when SmithKline priced
Famvir only marginally lower than Zovirax, bearish analysts said the dosage
 -three tablets a day compared with five for Wellcome's product - would
undermine Zovirax sales. SmithKline also claimed its product had clinical
advantages.
There was also news of legal action in the UK against Wellcome, which makes
the anti-Aids treatment AZT, or Retrovir. Finally, revelation that results
of last year's massive French study into AZT are to be published in the
Lancet medical journal shortly renewed worries over the drug's reputation.
Wellcome shares dropped 24 to 650p, while SmithKline Beecham 'A' advanced 6
to 407p. SmithKline further benefited from a recommendation by Kleinwort
Benson to switch from Zeneca, which retreated 17 1/2 to 825p.
Results well ahead of market expectations sent Rank Organisation smartly
forward and added to analysts' optimism that the leisure sector is on course
for recovery.
Rank reported improvements in most of its divisions and was optimistic over
prospects for 1994. Leisure analysts upgraded forecasts, with NatWest on
Pounds 321m and Credit Lyonnais Laing on Pounds 340m, excluding a one-off
Pounds 36m charge for Rank Xerox.
The Rank results follow similar outperformance this week by Stakis, the
hotels group, and solid figures from First Leisure, the ten-pin bowling and
nightclub company.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, who yesterday moved Rank to a 'buy',
said: 'The leisure sector is at last turning. The upturn is unlikely to be
dramatic, but at these levels selected stocks are undemanding.' Rank shares
appreciated 20 to 1001p, First Leisure 19 to 310p and Stakis 3 to 78p.
Drugs group Medeva forged ahead 14 to 156 1/2 p as the US Food and Drug
Administration rehabilitated its US subsidiary, seven months after warning
that it did not meet production standards.
There were several strong movements among food retailing and manufacturing
stocks as investors continued to hunt for bargains. Hillsdown Holdings added
10 at 184p following meetings with analysts on Wednesday. Tate &amp; Lyle moved
forward 17 1/2 to 446 1/2 p after a presentation by a US food manufacturer
boded well for some of the UK group's American operations.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, fell 15 to 813p as a surplus of stock
in the market was compounded by worries over the price of copper.
GKN resisted the impact of a Hoare Govett downgrade, the shares losing only
a penny to 568 1/2 p. The broker trimmed its forecast by Pounds 8m to Pounds
92m.
Trafalgar House eased 3 to 95p after Swiss Bank Corporation said the
ordinary stock was overvalued.

FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TSB strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The banks sector was electrified by much better than expected preliminary
figures from TSB, the first of the UK high street banks to report this year.
TSB shares, which have consistently underperformed the sector and the
market, surged ahead as the profits and dividend news hit the market, ending
15 stronger at 267p, after touching a record 273p.
Turnover of 47m shares almost matched the stock's debut in October 1986 when
50m changed hands. The activity was boosted by a placing of 9.3m shares at
264p, said to have been executed by NatWest Securities. Blocks of TSB shares
were placed at 266p as the market closed.
Dealers said the driving force behind the share price was the 20 per cent
dividend increase, which outstripped the market's best expectations of
around 9.5 per cent. Analysts said the market was now expecting dividend
rises of 10 per cent in subsequent years. Current year forecasts were
hoisted to between Pounds 440m and Pounds 450m, and for 1995 to around
Pounds 550m.
The TSB figures were seen as indicating a sector-wide rerating of banks,
with Abbey National the main beneficiary. Abbey shares leapt to 510p before
closing 21 ahead at 507p on turnover of 11m.
A banks analyst said: 'Abbey responded to good news from its Scottish Mutual
business, the widespread feeling that the recession is over and perceptions
that it is more geared to the recovering housing/mortgage market.' He added
that the market had upgraded its dividend expectations for Abbey following
the TSB figures.

FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous pressure on oils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading oil issues came under growing selling pressure as institutions
fretted about persistent weakness in crude oil prices and the forthcoming
privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group.
Oil specialists said there were ominous signs of US selling in the 'majors'
in recent sessions, partly because of pressure on crude oil prices but, more
importantly, as some of the big US energy funds begin to reshape their
non-US oil portfolios to accommodate Elf's flotation. The French government
intends to sell some 70m Elf shares to raise around Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars
5bn, according to market specialists.
'What is undeniable is that the Elf stock will be priced to go,' said one
oil analyst. He said BP and Shell would be the non-US oil stocks most
vulnerable to US selling. BP lost 3 to 359 1/2 p and Shell 15 to 710p.

FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally following good company
results - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The setback to base rate optimism continued to overhang equities in London
yesterday, but shares rallied from a potentially testing level to close well
above the worst in spite of losses in other European bourses.
London also brushed off a weak opening to the new Wall Street session as
Federal bonds declined following the latest data on US retail sales. 'There
was no question of heavy selling in London,' was the comment from the
dealing room of a leading international house.
At the market opening, UK stocks gained more than 11 points on the Footsie
after an unexpectedly stable performance in New York overnight encouraged
bargain hunters. However, gains were quickly wiped out on signs that US
houses were sellers of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of the UK blue
chips.
The gain on the Footsie was soon turned into a fall which ranged to just
over 15 points. This brought the index to 3,356.9, focusing attention on the
3,350 mark, which has been identified as the nearest defence line.
Consequently, traders were heartened when, with the session still barely
under way, shares began to rally.
The market was helped by good trading figures from TSB bank and from Rank
Organisation, the leisure industry group.
Losses were almost halved, until Wall Street opened lower. By the close of
business in London, the Dow Industrial Average was down by 11 points.
The final reading on the FT-SE Index of 3,360, down 12 points, was regarded
as a good performance in view of the sharp setbacks in Germany and elsewhere
in Europe. Some strategists have warned that the flow of US investment cash
towards European markets may be slackening as global funds take a more
positive view of Japan.
The rally in the blue chip stocks was accompanied by a strong resumption of
support across the market's second line issues. At its closing reading of
3,882.1, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index showed a gain of 17.5.
Non-Footsie business remained high, making up some 60 per cent of the day's
total of 899.1m shares. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 807.6m brought Pounds
1.8bn in retail worth, fully maintaining the market's run of profitable
trading levels.
The profits and dividend news from TSB was warmly received in the stock
market, providing a convincing opening to the final 1993 results season
which is eagerly awaited for signs that economic recovery is showing through
at the bottom line on corporate trading accounts.
The same was true of the trading statement from Rank Organisation, and both
announcements were followed by a crop of favourable sector forecasts from
market analysts.
Today brings the end of a two week trading account in UK equities which has
seen share prices in London and across Europe give back some of the more
exuberant gains chalked up over the Christmas period.
A technical bout of profit-taking was expected in London and traders are not
yet convinced that the postponement of base rate hopes has raised any more
serious threat. Equity analysts are prepared to wait until spring for any
base rate move, and some pointed out yesterday that sterling's strength
against the DM could provide a further reason for trimming UK interest
rates.

FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector remained in the doldrums as traders continued to
reflect on the poor prospects for a reduction in UK interest rates in the
near term, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening level of the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,394 was
again disappointing and put paid to initial hopes of attracting buyers.
Following a mid-morning slide to the day's low of 3,359, dealing in the
contract steadied to trade in a narrow range of 3,360 and 3,375, although
the buyers remained few and far between.
However, the decline in the US bond market following the release of US
consumer and retail prices data put paid to traders' hopes of a modest
recovery in the afternoon. That decline and the subsequent poor performance
on Wall Street hit the UK fixed income markets once again, bringing a big
sell-off in the futures which also helped drag the underlying cash market
lower.
At the close, March stood at 3,370, more or less in line with its fair value
premium to cash of around 13 points. Volume was 17,235 at the official close
and another 2,000 lots were traded in after-hours' trading.
Turnover in the traded options remained healthy at 43,688 contracts,
although down from Wednesday's impressive 49,335 lots. In the index options,
some 14,207 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,958 trades
carried out in the Euro FT-SE option.
Lasmo was the most heavily traded stock option at 2,434 lots and was closely
followed by Abbey National at 2,247 contracts. TSB, Land Securities and
Tesco were the other stock options to be actively traded.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows lower trend for
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices followed bonds lower yesterday, in spite of bullish news on
inflation and retail sales, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.20 down at 3,842.43. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.70 to 472.47, but the American SE composite edged
0.19 higher to 480.06 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.94 to 787.81. NYSE
volume amounted to 277.6m shares.
Stocks declined for the third consecutive session even though the day's
economic news was positive for equities. Government figures showed that
consumer prices rose by only 0.2 per cent and retail sales climbed by 0.8
per cent in December. The inflation figure was in line with expectations,
while the retail sales number was stronger than forecast by Wall Street
analysts.
The data should have buoyed stock market sentiment, but investors chose
instead to focus on the decline in bond prices. Longer-dated government
securities fell because of the retail sales figures, which raised fears that
further down the road strong consumer demand might eventually feed through
into higher inflation.
Additionally, analysts said that investors and traders in New York were
unsettled by overnight declines on foreign equity markets, notably Hong
Kong, Frankfurt and London.
Citicorp was the most actively traded issue, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
40 3/4 , a new 12-month high, in volume of 5.6m shares as the market reacted
positively to news of a restructuring and what should be strong
fourth-quarter earnings.
Another banking stock in demand was JP Morgan, which put on Dollars 3/4 at
Dollars 70 3/8 on news of fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 392m, up from
Dollars 221m a year earlier.
Quaker Oats fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 after the food group warned
the market that it would report a 15 to 20 per cent decline in fiscal
second-quarter earnings.
Also hit by a profits warning was LA Gear, which dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 8 7/8 after the sports shoe retailer predicted a fourth-quarter loss
on continuing operations of about Dollars 15m, and a full-year deficit of
more than double that.
Bear Stearns rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the brokerage house
reported a 110 per cent jump in October-December earnings to Dollars 134.8m,
thanks primarily to sharply higher trading and investment banking revenues.
Canada
Toronto again showed late strength, the TSE 300 index ending at yet another
record high with a rise of 25.2 at 4,479.9. Advances outpaced declines by
443 to 386 after volume of 84.7m shares valued at CDollars 1.1bn. The gold
shares index climbed 1.74 per cent as the Comex bullion price rose on fund
buying. Financial services added 1.51 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sharp correction
continues in the Pacific Rim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wariness over the recent surge in share prices prevailed among investors,
and the Nikkei average lost ground for the first time in seven trading days
on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index shed 216.62, or 1.2 per cent, to 18,577.26. The Topix index of all
first section stocks receded 7.96 to 1,503.47, but in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index edged up 1.03 to 1,241.61.
The Nikkei rose to a day's high of 18,823.38 in the morning and fell to a
low of 18,548.75 just before the close. Arbitrageurs unwound long positions
in late morning trading, and strong selling pressure came from corporate
investors, wanting to prop up profits ahead of the March book closing.
Traders, however, said that the downside was limited due to expectations of
further buying from foreign investors, and investors and dealers were
reluctant to hold short positions.
Many analysts expect fund managers to shift out of south-east Asia and into
Japan. Mr Geoffrey Barker at Baring Securities said that 'on a risk reward
basis, Japan, which massively underperformed last year, is the pick', adding
that although the rewards in investing in Tokyo may not be substantial, the
risk of a market collapse was low compared to other Asian markets.
Volume totalled 430m shares, against 451m. Declines outscored advances by
556 to 472, with 152 issues unchanged.
Foreigners supported Sony, which gained Y100 at Y5,880. However, other
high-technology issues were weaker, with Matsushita Electric Industrial off
Y10 at Y1,560 and Fujitsu falling Y15 to Y871.
Banks were lower on profit-taking by corporate investors. Most corporations
have traditionally held shares of their main creditors as a symbol of
maintaining a long term relationship. However, low dividends and falling
profits have increased the burden for companies in maintaining such
portfolios. Mitsubishi Bank dipped Y10 to Y2,700.
Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone will test run its multimedia
service in Japanese households next year prompted buying in telecom related
stocks. NTT put on Y4,000 at Y814,000, but KDD, the international telecom
company, lost its morning rise and finished Y100 down at Y11,200.
Ishihara Sangyo, the country's largest producer of titanium oxide, added Y24
at Y355 on mounting expectations of a rise in titanium oxide prices.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 81.18 to 20,583.66 in volume of 54.6m
shares. The index posted its eleventh consecutive gain in spite of increased
profit-taking.
Roundup
The region saw a further substantial correction, but analysts commented that
the cause was related to profit-taking and a return to levels seen before
the Christmas rally.
A London-based broker said Hong Kong could well fall below the 10,000 level,
given that the market's traditional correction from high levels was normally
around 30 per cent. Yesterday's selling, he added, came mainly from retail
investors in Japan and the US. However, in London trading yesterday
afternoon, buyers returned and the unofficial index closed an indicative 204
up at 10,380.
HONG KONG fell sharply for the third consecutive day on broad selling
pressure. The Hang Seng index lost 536.22 to 10,176.51 in turnover up to
HKDollars 9.2bn from HKDollars 7.8bn.
Among the major movers during the session, HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 3 to
HKDollars 103, while Bank of East Asia lost HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 55.
Hutchison was also active, dropping HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 31. In the
property sector, Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped HKDollars 5 to HKDollars
61.50, Cheung Kong HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 41.50 and Hongkong Land
HKDollars 1.40 to HKDollars 23.90.
TAIWAN skidded down on news that the government was not, after all, going to
seek direct shipping links with China. The weighted index lost 363.81 to
5,851.40 in turnover up to TDollars 104.5bn from Wednesday's TDollars
88.5bn. Sentiment was also affected, said Mr Kevan Crosthwaite of HG Asia in
London, by further signs that diplomatic ties with the country were being
weakened, in preference to securing stronger links with mainland China.
KUALA LUMPUR remained weak on forced selling and trading restrictions, which
included a ban of buying by some stockbroking firms, with the composite
index closing down 37.05 at 1,029.17. The cheaper levels attracted some
foreign funds in the afternoon but the market remained overwhelmed by
selling pressure.
SINGAPORE took another broad tumble for the third day this week, with the
Straits Times Industrial index dropping 65.45 to 2,194.86.
Analysts expect the impact of several liquidity-tightening measures in
Malaysia to continue to affect investor sentiment in both countries.
Malaysian shares traded over the counter account for much of Singapore's
daily turnover.
MANILA fell for the fifth straight day, with weakness elsewhere in the
region dampening sentiment. The market index shed 76.85 to 2,901.15.
JAKARTA was lower as local investors cashed in their positions, with some
late bargain hunting preventing a sharper correction. The market index fell
13.20 to 572.02.
AUSTRALIA was unsettled by the falls in other regional markets and the All
Ordinaries index fell 18.1 to 2,177.5 in heavy volume of 462.3m shares.
NEW ZEALAND traded in a tight range before the NZSE-40 capital index
finished 11.37 lower at 2,235.97.
SEOUL continued to trade against the trend, ending higher for the third
consecutive session as waves of blue-chip buying overwhelmed selling by the
Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund. The composite stock index rose 12.35
or 1.4 per cent to 898.66.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Metallgesellschaft halt casts
shadow over Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main markets showed weakness yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT again suffered from the combined pressures of Metallgesellschaft
and Siemens as the DAX index slid back another 2 per cent, closing the
official section off 44.52 to 2,164.66.
Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Secutrities in London noted that the equity
market had seen a shaky start to the new year, exacerbated by the fact that
most investors had been confident of a promising beginning given the 46 per
cent gain in the DAX during 1993. So far this year the index has shed 4.5
per cent.
In the post bourse the Ibis closed at 2,142.36.
Turnover was DM13.8bn.
Trading in Metallgesellschaft was suspended pending a announcement from
creditor banks on progress in reaching agreement on the rescue package. Two
of the major shareholders, Deutsche and Dresdner banks, closed off a
respective DM16.50 and DM11.00 at DM835.00 and DM442.50.
Siemens slid DM36.50 at DM726.00 as it expected earnings to fall by some
10-15 per cent this year.
PARIS went a further 1.3 per cent lower, the CAC-40 index down 29.71 or 1.3
per cent at 2,252.19. A day's low of 2,249.17 was recorded as turnover rose
of FFr6.2bn.
Alcatel Alsthom lost FFr14 to FFr778 in heavy trading. In spite of
Wednesday's substantial fall after the company forecast sharply lower 1994
profits and sales James Capel has maintained its buy recommendation. While
admitting that the statement came as a shock the broker's stated that
Alcatel has 'restructured heavily in the face of liberalisation of the
European telecommunications market and is in good shape to respond to the
challenges of increased competiton'.
MILAN was little changed after a day of suspense on the political front. The
Comit index dipped 1.20 to 609.19, as investors awaited news of the date of
the general election, which would remove a major uncertainty from the market
and is widely expected to prove positive for equities.
Montedison picked up L22.90 to L954.30 in volume of 80.7m shares. The recent
hugh volume of trading in the share has prompted specualtion about changes
in the shareholder structure.
ZURICH continued the consolidation that has sent the market down by a
cumulative 3.1 per cent over the last four sessions.
The SMI index shed 49.1 or 1.6 per cent to 2,949.9 as weakness in other
European markets and Wall Streets easier opening also weighed on the mood.
Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, picked up SFr20 to SFr935 after recent
losses.
ISTANBUL hit its sixth consecutive record in spite of a bout of
profit-taking. The composite index ended up 1,616.6 at a provisional
28,883.61, for a cumulative 27.7 per cent rise over the six sessions.
The buying spree has been fuelled by expectations that new tax-exempt
share-based funds will be launched.
WARSAW surged to an all-time high, the WIG index rising 560 or 4.1 per cent
to 14,115.5. Record turnover of 2,700bn zlotys was viewed as an indication
that further demand is likely to keep prices surging throughout next week.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: India remains on its winning streak -
Budget hopes are fuelling Bombay's rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian shares continued their winning streak yesterday, fuelled by foreign
and domestic investors' hopes that next month's budget will give a fresh
impetus to economic growth and to the government's liberalisation programme.
The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of 30 leading shares rose 24.80 to
3,928.59, in the latest upsurge in the market's strongest rally since the
1992 Bombay securities market scandal. The BSE has now advanced almost 50
per cent since the start of November.
The rally has been triggered by foreign fund managers, who have been
permitted to invest in the Indian market for the first time in many years as
part of the economic reform programme. The surge in foreign buying dispelled
the sense of caution that gripped Indian investors in the wake of the 1992
scandal, which ended the previous big rally.
Investors were temporarily knocked out of their stride last month by a
regulatory dispute, which closed the market for two weeks, and by the
political uncertainty caused by the threatened resignation of Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, who offered to quit after he was criticised by
a parliamentary report into the scandal but was later persuaded to stay.
The effects of these disruptions have proved short-lived. Mr Singh has
emerged from the political turmoil with his reputation enhanced by the
support he received from politicians and businessmen alike.
The regulatory dispute - a row over forward trading between stockbrokers and
the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets' watchdog - has yet
to be resolved. But fund managers say they are not unduly concerned by the
argument, as long as it does not lead to another market closure.
The market closed in December when stockbrokers went on strike in protest at
an order from the securities board to liquidate all positions in the forward
market, an order given to stop the market over-heating. The strike ended
after it became clear that the securities board would not relent.
Nor are investors attaching much importance to a separate argument at the
Bombay Stock Exchange which led to the resignation on Monday of Mr GD Desai,
the exchange's president. Mr Desai clashed with exchange board members about
the scope of his powers. His term was due to end in March.
Businessmen in Bombay expect the market to remain strong until the budget,
though they do not rule out temporary corrections. Mr Ajit Dayal, a director
of the Indian affiliate of Jardine Fleming, the investment bank, forecast
the BSE's index would soon cross 4,000. 'Foreign money is piling into the
market,' he said.
Mr Dayal estimated that foreign institutions invested about Dollars 1bn in
the Indian market last year and bought a further Dollars 1.6bn in issues
made by Indian companies overseas. He predicted the combined figure could
reach Dollars 4bn in 1994.
However, more cautious stockbrokers warned that the Finance Ministry is
monitoring the rally closely to avoid any repeat of the 1992 scandal when
funds were illegally siphoned out of the banking system and into equities.
One danger this time is that companies taking advantage of the buoyant
market to raise funds will be tempted to invest the proceeds in the stock
market, possibly breaking securities regulations which restrict such
operations.
The flow of foreign direct investment has also increased sharply. The
Industry Ministry estimates that foreign companies last year invested
Rs16bn, up from Rs6.75bn in 1992. Investments for which approvals were
sought, but which have not necessarily been put into effect yet, increased
to Rs89bn from Rs38.9bn.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar surges against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar climbed sharply against the D-Mark yesterday on the back of
better than expected US retail figures and fresh gloom about the state of
the German economy, writes Gillian Tett.
In spite of Bundesbank intervention, the American currency broke through its
1993 high of DM1.7480, ending at DM1.752 in London, up nearly two pfennigs
from the DM1.732 levels that had been registered in overnight trading in
Tokyo. The dollar's strength also dragged sterling up to a new 16-month high
against the D-Mark, which weakened across Europe yesterday.
The dollar's rise against the D-Mark started early in European trading,
following the news of more German job losses. Coupled with retail figures,
which indicated that West German retail sales in November had fallen by 2.5
per cent, the data fuelled the market's increasingly negative sentiment
towards the D-Mark.
However, it was the publication of the US retail sales figures and consumer
price index which triggered the most dramatic jump.
Although the 0.2 per cent rise in the December US CPI was broadly in line
with expectations, the 0.8 per cent rise in December US retail sales was
better than market forecasts of 0.3 per cent. This was the ninth consecutive
monthly rise in retail sales, and contributed to an annual retail sales
growth of 6.2 per cent, the largest for four years.
Shortly before the publication of the figures at 1.30pm, the Bundesbank was
rumoured to have intervened to hold the dollar down on the European markets,
which had been fairly steady during the morning, trading around DM1.7370.
However, the release of the figures prompted the dollar into an immediate 1
1/2 -pfennig rise against the D-Mark, taking it briefly above DM1.7510. An
attempted intervention by the Bundesbank at the DM1.7440 level, to the tune
of 'several hundred million dollars', according to Mr Michael Feeny of
Sumitomo Bank, failed to hold the currency for more than a few minutes.
Shortly afterwards the Bundesbank was rumoured to have intervened again,
through German banks. But although this briefly held the currency below
DM1.7500, it later rose above a second technical barrier of DM1.752, where
it finally closed in London. In volatile afternoon trading in New York it
fluctuated around this level before ending at DM1.7513.
How far the dollar could defend these sharp gains was a matter of some
dispute.
As Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, pointed out, the dollar's
trajectory was partly powered by the fact that scepticism about its ability
to break the DM1.7480 barrier had left the market quite short in dollars up
to this level. But once this barrier was breached, the market had to buy.
As a result, many dealers believe that the US currency could rise further
still. But though optimism about the short term prospects for the US economy
remains strong, opinion is more mixed about longer term outlook.
One key question dogging the markets is whether the Federal Reserve will
tighten US rates soon. With the CPI and producer price figures broadly in
line with market forecasts, many dealers think that the relatively benign
inflationary conditions make early tightening less likely.
For the moment this may not significantly weaken the dollar. But Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, thinks that the market's optimism
could prove to be exaggerated over the longer term.
The immediate issue preoccupying the markets, though, is the degree to which
the Bundesbank is willing to defend the D-Mark. The Bundesbank has not had
any occasion to defend the D-Mark since the dollar last hit the chart point
of DM1.7480 in July 1993. And though yesterday's intervention was carried
out through reserve management, dealers are nevertheless wondering how the
Bundesbank will respond if the dollar pushes much higher.
As Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays Bank points out, a weaker D-Mark is likely to
be 'the last thing the Bundesbank wants', not least because it would make it
harder for the Bundesbank to introduce the interest rate cuts that many
believe will be needed to fight Germany's recession.
The dollar's strong rise pulled sterling up to another new high against the
D-Mark in the 16 months since the ERM crisis of September 1992. The pound
breached the DM2.62 level and finished at DM2.6209, up from the previous
day's close of DM2.6072. At this level it is some five pfennigs higher than
at the beginning of the year. However, it softened against the dollar to
Dollars 1.496 from Dollars 1.5013.
With sterling's rise against the D-Mark now being driven by gloom about
Germany's economy and optimism about UK recovery as well as the dollar's
rise, dealers predict that the pound could rise further.
Meanwhile, the Italian lira firmed after Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the
Italian prime minister, resigned. This is expected to lead to early
elections, and dealers say hopes that Italian political uncertainty might
soon end could boost the lira further. It yesterday finished at L971 against
the D-Mark, compared to Wednesday's close of L974.7.
The Bank of England yesterday predicted a shortage of Pounds 2.15bn in the
London money markets. It provided Pounds 2.116bn help during the course of
the day, through bills at 5 13/32 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers seek flexibility
on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's farmers must be given the flexibility by their own government and
the European Union to seek new outlets for products whose export would
otherwise be constrained by last month's settlement of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Luc Guyau, president of FNSEA, the country's
largest farm union, said yesterday.
Farmers should be left free of bureaucratic red tape to upgrade the quality
of food products that could be exported without subsidy and therefore
without Gatt constraints, Mr Guyau said.
The Paris and Brussels authorities should also encourage increased
industrial use of crops to make 'biocarburant' fuel, as well as rewarding
farmers for environmental works like drainage and dykes, which the current
floods in many parts of France had proved inadequate.
Mr Guyau's first press conference of the new year was marked by his
relatively smooth acquiescence in the Gatt deal on terms that until late
last year the FNSEA had denounced as quite unacceptable.
'We are very conscious that we did not get all we hoped for,' he said,
'particularly in terms of a rebalancing of export restrictions with similar
restrictions on imports, and of dealing with monetary fluctuations of the
dollar and within Europe.
'But we have a feeling of pride about our combat over the seven years (of
the Gatt negotiations),' he added.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: German group to spend Pounds
115m on crop protection programme
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst and Schering, two of Germany's largest pharmaceutical and chemical
companies, which last month merged their plant protection and pest control
activities, yesterday announced an invest programme of more than DM300m
(Pounds 115m) for crop protection research and development.
At the same time Mr Gerhard Prante, chairman of AgrEvo, the new company,
said increasing its market share in North America and Japan, which he
identified as the two growth areas for pesticides and insecticides, would be
one of its main aims.
AgrEvo will have 1,200 employees at four research centres in Europe: Berlin,
Frankfurt, Paris and Cambridge. They will develop two insecticides and 10
herbicides, which could be registered by the end of the decade.
Until their merger, the agrochemical division of Hoechst, primarily focused
on cereal herbicides and insecticides. Last year it recorded a turnover of
DM2.1bn. Schering, which specialised in sugar beet herbicides, cereal, vine
and fruit fungicides, had a turnover of DM1.3bn. Following the merger,
AgrEvo, which will have its headquarters in Berlin, expects to have a
turnover this year of DM3bn and will employ 8,000 people.
The company already holds 15 per cent of the market share in Europe, 5 per
cent in Japan, and 4.4 per cent in North America. But AgrEvo expects little
growth in Europe this year, because of overcapacity and pressure on
agricultural prices. However, it hopes to expand into eastern Europe despite
the limited purchasing power of the region's farming community, which no
longer enjoys the subsidies of the communist era.
But it is the North American and Asian markets that AgrEvo will home in on
with the intention of developing and marketing the Basta herbicide, a
product designed for compatibility of various crops to glufosinate-ammonium,
a compound that destroys pests.
Essentially, the Basta herbicide enables crops, through molecular biological
processes, to withstand, or have immunity from pesticides and insecticides.
Mr Christoph von Szczepanski, head of research at AgrEvo, said the company
expected to obtain licences for spring-sown oil seed in Canada by 1995. He
added that AgrEvo would introduce to Canada maize, oilseed rape and soyabean
species that would be compatible with the Basta herbicide, making the
company one of the first to market biologically engineered products.
'The aim of the Basta herbicide is not only to maximise yields but to give
farmers greater flexibility in the choice of application time,' said Mr von
Szczepanski.

<TEXT>
After uncertain opening prices paid, wool became firmer and closing levels
yesterday were described as the highest of the week. The market indicator at
475 cents managed a gain of 3 cents compared with the close before
Christmas. Currency changes over the past month make wool dearer to buy for
several important using countries but resistance has not been enough to
undermine the market. Business in major consuming countries is still
generally found to be slow and margins are under pressure. Prices for
British wool at a Scottish sale in Bradford levelled out this week after
recent sharp rise, which were due to an attempt to correct an oversold
position by two or three individual firms

FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US crop news boosts maize and
soya prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US maize and soyabean prices jumped yesterday, extending their five-month
rallies on news from the US Department of Agriculture that the
weather-ravaged harvests of 1993 were even smaller that previously
estimated.
The USDA in its final report on last summer's production said US farmers
harvested only 6.3bn bushels (56lb each) of maize, 33 per cent below the
1992 record, and the smallest crop since 1974. After accounting for both
domestic and export demand, the agency said only 802m bushels of maize will
remain in storage in the US before the next harvest.
The uncomfortably low stock levels could drive maize futures prices at the
Chicago Board of Trade as high as Dollars 3.40 a bushel as a means of
rationing supply, and could mean the US would have to import maize to meet
domestic needs, said Mr Bill Biederman, analyst for the market consultants,
Allendale, Inc.
In late trading maize futures prices for May delivery were 4 1/4 cents
higher at Dollars 3.13 1/2 a bushel.
The size of the US's other major feedgrain crop, soyabeans, was also
reduced. Soyabean futures prices jumped in Chicago on news that the harvest
was 1.81bn bushels (60lb each), 17 per cent below 1992 production, and 1 per
cent less than the USDA's November estimate.
The drop in USDA's soyabean production figure was accompanied by a 15m
bushel decline in the agency's estimate of soyabean ending stocks, to 150m
bushels.
Analysts said the low stocks figure could push soyabean prices well over
Dollars 7.50 a bushel, although short supplies of US soyabeans could be
offset by higher production in Brazil and Argentina.

<TEXT>
Latest official figures indicate that Malaysia's tin production last year
was the lowest since statistics were first compiled.
Malaysia's department of mines says only 9,200 tonnes of tin in concentrates
was produced in the first 10 months of 1993, with probable full year
production put at a little over 10,000 tonnes. In 1992 Malaysia produced
14,300 tonnes.
The drop was blamed on low prices. On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market last year
they averaged MDollars 13.08 a kilogram compared with MDollars 15.23 in
1992. This week trading in has been around the MDollars 12.70 mark.
Malaysia's miners say they need prices around MDollars 16 to cover costs. In
the early 1980s, when they were producing over 60,000 tonnes a year, prices
were MDollars 32 to MDollars 34.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'American investors fuelled
gold price rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in investment demand in North America and parts of Europe helped
boost the gold price last year, says the Gold Fields Mineral Services
consultancy group, in its latest interim report today.
A drop in sales by central banks and other governmental organisations and
less hedging and forward sales by gold producers also contributed to the
price rise.
However, jewellery makers, the most important element of demand in the gold
market, substantially reduced their purchases. There was also a drop in the
buying of gold bars for hoarding.
But jewellery fabrication still accounted for more than all the newly-mined
gold last year, according to GFMS estimates. The supply of newly-mined gold
rose only slightly, by 1.7 per cent, from the 1992 level of 2,231 tonnes to
2,269 tonnes.
GFMS, which has the financial backing of two big gold producers - Gold
Fields of South Africa and Newmont Mining, the largest US gold group - says
that the fall in offtake by the jewellery industry, by 6.8 per cent from
2,675 tonnes in 1992 to an estimated 2,493 tonnes last year, was due in part
to price-sensitivity but also to the effects of economic weakness in Japan
and Europe, the austerity drive in China and the plentiful stocks of gold
that had built up in many Middle Eastern and Far Eastern markets.
Bar hoarding, down more than 32 per cent at 195 tonnes, was similarly
affected by higher prices and a range of local economic factors.
During 1993 the increase in investment demand was quite broadly-based,
suggests GFMS, encompassing the re-appearance of significant private demand
in Germany after the removal of value added tax on financial gold at the
start of the year; the investment in gold futures and over-the-counter
positions by US funds; and the return of Swiss portfolio investment to gold.
'Even if the latter has been primarily on a derivative basis, such as the
purchase of gold call warrants, the impact on demand has been substantial.'
Official sector sales increased not only because some central banks took the
opportunity to sell as prices rose in the second half of 1993 but also
because many of the 'call' options written by central banks earlier in the
year expired 'in the money', resulting in a substantial quantity of the
underlying gold being sold. GFMS estimates net official sales last year were
440 tonnes, nearly one quarter below the 582 tonnes in 1992 but still the
second-highest level of annual sales from this sector since 1979.
The rising price and reduced contangos (forward premiums) persuaded many
producers to allow their forward positions to run down in the second half of
1993. GFMS estimates that forward sales contributed 131 tonnes to supply
last year, a 13 per cent fall from the 150 tonnes in 1992. Option hedging,
after contributing 91 tonnes to supply in 1992, contributed nothing last
year.
Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS chief executive, suggested last night that, compared
with the flat trading in 1992 and the market's overheated state in the
second quarter of 1993, the market now appeared to be returning to
normality. He said the market was entering 1994 'in good shape'.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan cut cheers aluminium
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan of Canada last night announced immediate cuts to its world-wide
primary aluminium output totalling 156,000 tonnes. The move came ahead of
meetings in Brussels next week between trade representatives from leading
aluminium-producing countries who are expected to agree terms for production
cuts of up to 2m a year to stem the growing oversupply of the metal.
Analysts welcomed Alcan's initiative. 'This should have a very positive
impact, particularly as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the Brussels'
meetings,' said Mr Stewart Spector who produces the Spector Report on the
aluminium industry.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine Fleming
group, said: 'This is a great opening shot by the North American producers.
It shows that they will not be bluffing at next week's talks. I feel we will
get a resolution in Brussels.'
Alcan's announcement came well after the market had closed but it pushed up
the price of aluminium for delivery on the London Metal Exchange in three
months, which had closed at Dollars 1,166.50 a tonne, to Dollars 1,172 in
very late trading.
The Brussels meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday but which
might go on longer if necessary, will concentrate on how the cuts should be
shared between Russia and the rest of the world. If no agreement is reached,
US producers are likely immediately to make anti-dumping charges against the
Russian industry.
A sudden surge in Russian exports to the rest of the world following a
collapse in domestic demand is widely blamed for the aluminium surplus which
has driven down prices recently to all-time lows.
Taking part in the talks with Russia will be Australia, Canada, the European
Union, Norway, and the US.
Last month in Washington they agreed that annual cuts of between 1.5m and 2m
tonnes were needed to bring the market into balance in addition to the 1m
tonnes closed by western producers last year. Mr Spector estimates that a
2m-tonne cut would bring balance in 6 months, 1m in 18 months.
There is still the possibility that next week's talks might not go smoothly
because the US wants Russia to take 1m tonnes of the cuts whereas the EU
suggests 500,000 tonnes would be a reasonable level.
If agreement can be reached, governments must then attempt to persuade their
domestic producers to share the cuts. Some industry observers suggest that
politicians in Moscow will have difficulty persuading smelter managers in
remote parts of Russia to reduce output.
Also the western governments intend to invite other leading producing
regions such as Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to share the pain if
cuts are agreed.
Monitoring and control of the production-cut scheme, which will last at
least 18 months, is likely to be by the International Primary Aluminium
Institute.
Alcan said the latest cuts were in addition to 102,000 tonnes temporarily
shut in 1991 and 1992 and would take its operating rate down to 85 per cent
of capacity. Cuts would be made through potline closures, non-replacement of
pot linings and amperage reductions. The biggest, of 60,000 tonnes a year,
would be at its plant at Sebree, Kentucky. Others were in the UK, Brazil and
Canada. About 200-300 jobs would be lost.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sell-off triggers sharp
declines in European sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sell-off in the US market triggered sharp declines in European bond
markets, sparking fears that a rise in US short-term rates could trigger a
repatriation of funds invested in European bond markets.
Against this background, the best performers were the more peripheral
European markets, while French and German bond prices fell about  3/8 point.
The Italian bond market rallied strongly yesterday morning, after Prime
Minister Carlo Ciampi's offer to resign prompted hopes of a rapid move
towards dissolving parliament and new elections. But as the news was
discounted, prices were dragged down with other markets in the afternoon.
The 10-year BTP future on Liffe fell back to 117.80, slightly down on the
previous night's close, and substantially off its high yesterday of 118.62.
Danish bonds fell  1/4 point, but continued to outperform the German bond
market, bringing the yield spread against bunds down to new lows, following
comments by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank governor, about bringing
Danish interest rates below those in Germany.
The response to these comments in both the bond and currency markets
suggests that traders are taking a sanguine view of this possibility.
The spread between 10-year Danish and German bonds has tightened from 59
basis points at the end of last year to 36 basis points. 'In the coming
months, talk of short rates potentially falling below Germany should see the
market rallying further towards the 15 basis point level,' said Ms Phyllis
Reed, European bond strategist at BZW.
UK government bonds also took their cue from the other overseas bond
markets, and tumbled in the afternoon to close  3/4 of a point lower on the
day. The market kicked off on a firm note, climbing by as much as a  1/4 of
a point, but was pulled down by the fall in the US Treasury market.
Five-year gilts ended about a quarter point lower while long-dated issues
fell as much as  3/4 of a point and index-linked issues lost over a point.
The market is expecting the Bank of England to announce the preliminary
details of the next gilt auction today , with speculation focusing on a
long-dated auction stock.
Japanese bond prices fell as much as  1/2 a point, with unusually heavy
trading in the European day, as traders became nervous about plans to sell
Japanese government bonds outright to the market. The sales would be used to
finance the government's economic stimulus package.
The market seems worried about oversupply as the Ministry of Finance plans
to issue some Y1,000bn of 10-year bonds in the week starting on January 24.
US Treasury prices fell at both ends of the maturity range yesterday
following a stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 3/16 at 99 3/4 ,
yielding 6.263 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down  5/32 at
100 1/4 , to carry a yield of 4.098 per cent.
Prices eased from the opening in spite of a promising inflation report,
which showed that consumer prices in December rose by only 0.2 per cent, or
by 0.3 per cent excluding the volatile food and energy components. Overall,
consumer prices rose by 2.7 per cent in 1993, the smallest rise since 1986.
These figures were in line with forecasts, and had little impact on
sentiment, but it was an unexpectedly strong 0.8 per cent gain in December
retail sales that sparked the selling. The increase was much bigger than
analysts had forecast, and raised fears that further down the road strong
retail sales will start to push prices higher.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Canada's Dollars 2bn FRN issue meets
solid investor demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada returned to the Eurobond market for the first time since 1987,
tapping investor demand for US dollar floating-rate notes from a rare,
top-rated issuer.
It launched a Dollars 2bn five-year issue of FRNs via CS First Boston,
Goldman Sachs and UBS paying interest at three-month Libor minus 25 basis
points, which ended the day bid at their 99.77 reoffer price.
According to one of the lead managers, the deal met with solid demand in
Europe and the Far East. Although the pricing was slightly tighter than
expected, the deal was oversubscribed and sold out in the course of the day,
a syndicate official said.
'Canada has a certain cachet; the issue offers investors scope for
diversification; and it provides a new, liquid benchmark,' said Mr Len
Harwood, head of syndication at UBS. Besides the usual range of
institutional investors, central banks, which only hold sovereign bonds, and
commercial banks, for which sovereign debt has a zero risk weighting under
BIS rules, were reported to have been keen bidders.
According to an official at Canada's finance department, the issue was
undertaken to diversify the sources of US dollar funding of Canada's foreign
exchange reserves. The proceeds of the issue will be used to pay down a
portion of a Dollars 5bn commercial paper facility in the US, called Canada
Bills, he said. The issue will not increase Canada's overall indebtedness,
he said.
Goldman Sachs cashed in on investors' appetite for dollar FRNs by launching
a Dollars 200m issue of five-year notes for itself. Paying a coupon of
three-month Libor plus 37 1/2 basis points, it also sold out quickly and
ended the day trading at 99.97 bid, above its 99.90 reoffer price, a
syndicate official said.
Market participants expect to see more dollar FRNs in coming weeks. 'We are
seeing more and more people putting funds into the money market - this
generated a lot of tickets for the Canada deal,' said one dealer. Many
investors also seek exposure to the US currency, which they expect to
appreciate as US interest rates edge higher.
Among fixed-rate dollar deals, the Swedish holding company Investor, which
owns Saab-Scania and holds stakes in several Swedish blue-chip companies,
issued Dollars 200m of five-year bonds priced to yield 113 basis points
above the relevant benchmark. The lead manager was CS First Boston.
Despite a rating of Baa2 from Moody's and single-A from Standard &amp; Poor's,
the paper met with strong demand from yield-hungry investors and ended at
99.60 bid, above its 99.46 reoffer price, while the spread narrowed to 110
basis points.
Elsewhere, Abbey National Treasury Services' Pounds 500m foray into the
Eurosterling sector was dogged by a sell-off in the gilt market shortly
after launch. The five-year bonds, via JP Morgan and Samuel Montagu, were
priced to yield 30 basis points over the relevant gilt. The deal closed at
98.95 bid, below the 99.19 reoffer price, although the spread remained
stable around 30 basis points.
While the lead managers reported demand from the European continent, other
traders said the deal would take some time to place given the sheer weight
of recent supply in the sterling sector. However, as one observer pointed
out, the issue enables investors to switch out of the 6 per cent gilt of
August 1999 into a liquid Eurobond with the same maturity at a
30-basis-point yield pick-up.
Another Pounds 100m of perpetual, subordinated bonds for Barings, issued at
a spread of 255 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury due 2017,
ended at 99 5/8 bid, slightly above its 99.598 reoffer price.
Two Eurolira issues, totalling L550bn, were also dogged by market congestion
after some L1,500bn of fresh supply this week.
However, IMI Bank's L300bn five-year bonds via IMI Luxembourg benefited from
some European investors' quest for high yields, offering a yield pick-up of
37 basis points over the five-year swap rate. The IADB's L250bn 10-year
bonds via JP Morgan also met with some European interest, but both issues
are likely to take some time to be placed, officials said.
Moody's has downgraded the Republic of Turkey's debt to speculative grade
from investment grade. It lowered the country's long-term credit rating to
Ba1, from Baa3, citing the deterioration of Turkey's public finances and the
expectation that high fiscal deficits will persist in coming years.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Costa Rica returns after
break of 13 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costa Rica returns to the international bond market next week after an
absence of 13 years.
The state telephone and electricity monopoly ICE has scheduled an issue of
Dollars 50m of three-year Eurobonds through Banco Santander. The bonds,
carrying a semi-annual coupon, are to be issued at a spread of 385 to 410
basis points over US Treasury note rates. They have no explicit state
guarantee.
ICE is the second central American issuer to tap the Eurobond market since
Mexico led the return of Latin American borrowers to the market after the
1980s debt crisis. Last August, the Guatemalan coffee institute Anacafe
brought a Dollars 60m 11 per cent issue with a four-year average life to
market.
ICE - whose assets at the end of September stood at Dollars 2.1bn - will use
the funds to refinance foreign currency debt and for investment. Further
borrowings by ICE are possible in the next 12 months. The other possible
borrower - the government, which hands over power in May following elections
on February 6 - has no current plans to tap the market.
The issue is expected to benefit from current investor appetite for more
exotic issuers carrying generous interest rates. Growth has been strong, and
inflation fell last year below 10 per cent, but public foreign debt remains
high.
The Guatemalan government has begun preliminary discussions over a possible
Eurobond borrowing in its own name this year.

business

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Burns Philps, the diversified Australian food and trading group, is selling
its Tradelink plumbing supplies business to G. E. Crane. The move will turn
the Sydney-based Crane into Australia's largest plumbing supplies
distributor.
The sale is expected to raise between ADollars 50m and ADollars 75m
(USDollars 34.5m to USDollars 51.7m) for Burns Philps, and comes as part of
the group's strategy of divesting 'non-core' assets.
The first payment is likely to be made at the end of January and will total
around ADollars 44.5m, according to Crane. A second deferred payment is due
in September 1996 and will be based on the future performance of Tradelink
and Crane's existing plumbing supplies business, Watson &amp; Crane.
To fund the initial payment, Crane announced a two-for-five rights issue,
involving 7.24m new shares, at a price of ADollars 6.20 a share. This should
raise around ADollars 44.9m.
Crane said yesterday the acquisition would roughly double the size of its
plumbing supplies operation, adding about 70 stores located across
Australia.
Tradelink's sales in the year to end-June were ADollars 187.6m, and profits
before interest and tax were ADollars 4.6m.
Burns, meanwhile, said it would use the money raised from the sale to expand
its hardware division's new warehouse-style 'superstores'.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: India admits further five
foreign broker firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five foreign stockbroking firms have been given permission to deal in Indian
markets on behalf of foreign investors. The move is the the latest in a
series to open India's economy to the rest of the world.
The five approved by the securities and exchange board of India, the
securities watchdog, will join four others who won permission late last
year.
The latest batch are Jardine Fleming, the UK/Hong Kong-owned investment
bank, Citicorp and Lehman Brothers of the US, Crosby Securities from Hong
Kong, and the British-based Baring Securities. The companies which won
approval last year are James Capel and Kleinwort Benson of the UK, Credit
Lyonnais Securities, an arm of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Marlin
Partners of Hong Kong.
The foreign brokers are not permitted to deal on behalf of domestic
investors; nor are they joining the Bombay stock exchange, which so far has
not admitted any foreign members.
About Dollars 900m in foreign portfolio investment has flowed into India
since foreign institutions were permitted to invest just over a year ago.
Their entry has fuelled a surge in equity prices.
However, of 132 investors approved by the securities board, only about 15
are active. The remainder are still establishing and launching funds.
The active foreign investors are mostly using Indian brokers as they allow
foreign brokers time to establish themselves in Bombay.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities resists
creditors' restructure plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Emiko Terazono in Tokyo
Sanyo Securities, a second-tier Japanese securities firm, is seeking an
alternative to a restructuring plan recommended by its three main creditor
banks and Nomura Securities, a leading shareholder, without losing their
support. The banks are Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank.
The four institutions sent officials into Sanyo to help with a comprehensive
restructuring plan last August. However, the brokerage house has resisted
strong recommendations by the banks to implement drastic rationalisation,
and has not been able to win approval from its creditors.
Sanyo - like other members of the industry - is the victim of the three-year
stock market slump after the large capital investments of the late-1980s
asset 'bubble'. It built a large trading room in a warehouse-like building,
investing heavily in computers and other electronic equipment.
Another source of its problems is Sanyo Sogo Capital, a non-bank financial
affiliate burdened by mounting bad loans. Sanyo Sogo is reported to have
lent Y145bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in real estate-linked deals, of which some Y50bn
have turned sour.
According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily business newspaper, the three
banks have extended some Y150bn in loans to Sanyo Sogo, and are also
supplying the cash needed for its daily operations.
'The company is virtually brain-dead,' says Mr David Threadgold, financial
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. He expects the three creditors
eventually to bail out Sanyo and its affiliates by agreeing to cut rates on
the loans.
Sanyo Securities expects a pre-tax loss of Y5.7bn for the year to March this
year, but some analysts predict the figure will could be larger due to
financial problems stemming from Sanyo Sogo.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: A tale of debt and survival on
the high seas - How the Atlantic fishery crisis affected two Canadian groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a tale of two companies which, six years ago, were difficult to tell
apart. However, an unexpected crisis has driven them in almost diametrically
opposite directions, to the point where they now have little in common. One
is brimming with confidence, the other is at the mercy of shareholders and
creditors.
Based in the neighbouring Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland, National Sea Products (Natsea) and Fishery Products
International (FPI) were rooted in the rich fishing grounds off Canada's
east coast.
Each was the product of a sweeping rationalisation of the fragmented east
coast fishery in the early 1980s. Their operations were of a similar size,
with each big enough to rank towards the top of the international fishing
industry. Both were vertically integrated, with operations stretching from
impressive trawler fleets to fish-processing plants along the eastern
seaboard of the US and Canada.
There was, however, one big difference between the two companies: debt.
Natsea had its origins in a succession of private-sector takeovers and
mergers. The cornerstone of its 1984 restructuring was a large issue of
preferred shares to creditors. Even when its fishing business was booming in
the mid-80s, its debt was well over 100 per cent of common equity.
FPI had the benefit of being taken under the wing of the Canadian and
Newfoundland governments in the early 1980s. A privatisation deal, including
a CDollars 177m (USDollars 136.2m) public equity issue, was completed just a
few months before the 1987 stock market crash. Its debt as a percentage of
capital at the end of that year was a mere 7.6 per cent.
'We've always said that fish and debt don't mix,' says Mr Victor Young,
FPI's chief executive. 'We've been obsessed with our balance sheet.'
The companies' uneven debt loads have led to sharply different responses to
the virtual disappearance in the late 1980s of the fish on which they
depended. For FPI, the crisis has created an opportunity to diversify.
Debt-burdened Natsea has had little choice but to pull in its horns.
The sudden depletion of cod and other fish stocks in the north-west Atlantic
has yet to be fully explained. Scientists have blamed, among other things,
changes in water temperature and over-fishing by Canadians and Europeans.
In a bid to revive the fishery, the authorities in Ottawa have slashed
groundfish quotas by 75 per cent over the past five years, including a total
ban on catches of northern cod off Newfoundland.
The impact on the local industry has been devastating. About 35,000
fishermen and plant workers are unemployed. Mr Young estimates that FPI has
lost 94 per cent of its north Atlantic fish resource. Natsea's active
fishing fleet, once 50-strong, has been reduced to four vessels, and even
they can put to sea for only a few months each year.
But thanks to its strong balance sheet, FPI has been able to engineer a
transformation from a north Atlantic fishing company to an international
seafood conglomerate.
It has increasingly turned to trading, processing and food-service
operations. FPI bought less than 2 per cent of its raw material from other
parts of the world in the late 1980s; its plants now rely on cod, pollock
and flatfish from as far afield as Russia, Alaska and Scandinavia for 87 per
cent of supplies.
Its customers include British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and Migros,
Switzerland's leading food retailer.
Revenues have jumped by more than two thirds since 1988, to about CDollars
600m last year. It has made two large acquisitions and is hunting for more.
One acquisition has given the company a toehold in the shrimp business, to
the point where shrimp - most of it bought in the east Asia and sold in the
US - now makes up almost a third of its business.
Natsea's story is a less happy one. Its sales last year were about 40 per
cent below those of 1988. As part of efforts to repair the balance sheet, it
has sold its extensive international operations, which stretched from
Portugal to Australia. Its remaining businesses are centred on the North
American retail market, where its brands remain well-entrenched.
By shrinking, Natsea hopes to rebuild its business from a solid base. 'Our
approach has been to focus on our strengths,' says Mr Henry Demone, Natsea's
president.
FPI's expansion has also given it extra flexibility to deal with remaining
problems at home. One processing plant has been switched from cod to turning
out high-margin shrimp products. The company is negotiating to contribute
some idle trawlers to an international fishing venture, which will help
secure its raw material supplies.
Natsea's gaze, however, remains fixed mostly on its balance sheet. A
considerable write-down will soon be required to take account of the
diminished value of more than a dozen idle vessels and six vacant processing
plants.
Mr Demone's consolation is that, having lost 95 per cent of its Atlantic
fishing quota, Natsea's plight 'obviously can't get much worse'. He is
confident the remaining businesses will be able to support present debt of
between CDollars 80m and CDollars 90m. However, repairing the balance sheet
is likely to require several more years of patience from shareholders and
bankers.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Production setbacks hit Randgold
mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A drop in tonnage milled and declining grades underlined the marginality of
the four gold producers in the Rand-gold and Exploration stable in the
quarter ended in December. The mines incurred a combined after-tax loss of
R17.29m (Dollars 5.1m) against a R6.18m after-tax profit last time.
Only the group's Harmony Gold Mining Company remained in the black. However,
even here a fall in gold output coupled with higher costs and a slightly
lower gold price shaved after-tax profit to R8.97m from R16.94m.
Randgold's mines remained hamstrung by lack of flexibility in working
practices, and in long-standing forward sales contracts which have locked
the operations into gold prices often significantly below spot.
The mines received an average gold price of R37,366 a kg, up from R36,586 in
the September quarter, but well below the current rand gold price of close
to R42,200 a kg.
Mr John Turner, chief executive, said: 'Overall results are disappointing.'
He said the sensitivity of the mines to small changes in underground
production, gold output or working costs was often forgotten 'in the
euphoria of higher gold prices'.
The overall amount of ore milled fell to 2.23m tonnes from 2.41m tonnes,
with gold output sliding to 8,941kg from 9,662kg. Average working costs
jumped to R42,425 a kg against R38,668 a kg.
The main culprit was East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM), which was slow to
benefit from a switch to a continuous work schedule. Mr Turner, however,
said improvements were expected.
ERPM would return to profitability in the year as working costs were
controlled, and as it reaped the benefits of the December R550m rights issue
which cleared crippling debts of more than R520m. The mine showed an
increased after-tax loss of R16.87m, compared with R9.39m, and failed to
make a working profit.
Durban Roodepoort Deep suffered a loss in output and productivity due to a
lingering 10 per cent absentee rate among its 4,400 workforce. This followed
violent clashes among mine-workers in mid-1993. Its after-tax loss doubled
to R6.83m from R3.88m.
Mr Turner said a study of the mine's viability would be completed in the
current quarter. Closure of underground operations remained 'one of the
alternatives'.
Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining turned an after-tax profit of R2.42m into a loss
of R2.56m. Underground grade slipped to 6.2 grams from 6.7 grams a ton. The
company is battling to keep its head above water until benefits of a tribute
mining agreement with Anglo American's neighbouring Western Deep Levels mine
are felt in mid-year.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Investment banking division
helps lift Bear Stearns 110%

<TEXT>
Bear Stearns, the New York securities house, yesterday announced a 110 per
cent jump in its second fiscal quarter profits to Dollars 134.8m, or Dollars
1.05 a share.
Revenues during the period totalled Dollars 752.1m, up sharply from Dollars
454.7m a year earlier.
The record performance from Bear Stearns, which is the first securities
house to report its profits for the December quarter, suggests the long boom
in earnings on Wall Street is far from over, in spite of the recent upturn
in US interest rates.
Since 1990, declining US interest rates, strong demand from investors for
stocks and bonds, and heavy activity in corporate underwriting and other
investment banking and financial advisory businesses have kept securities
industry profits on a steady upward path.
Bear Stearns said yesterday its record-breaking second quarter was a
reflection of strength in all its main business lines.
Investment banking revenues posted the biggest growth, jumping 180 per cent
from a year ago to Dollars 176.9m as more companies sought the firm's
underwriting and mergers and acquisitions advisory services.
Revenues from principal transactions, which climbed 58 per cent to Dollars
363.4m, remained Bear Stearns' prime source of income, as would be expected
at a firm with a long reputation as an aggressive trading house.
Earnings from brokerage, clearing and private client services rose 23 per
cent to Dollars 129.5m, while interest and dividends brought in Dollars
326.5m.
The firm's total non-interest expenses increased by 51 per cent to Dollars
520.2m, primarily because of a big jump in employee compensation and
benefits, which are tied to business performance.
Investors responded positively to Bear Stearns' earnings report, pushing up
the share price by Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Schwab posts 16% profit rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Schwab, the San Francisco-based discount brokerage house, yesterday
announced a 16 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars
29m, or 48 cents a share.
The strong final quarter took the firm's full 1993 earnings to a record
Dollars 118m, up from Dollars 81m the year before. Schwab also announced
that it was raising its quarterly cash dividend from 5 cents to 7 cents a
share.
Revenues totalled Dollars 258m for the final quarter and Dollars 965m for
the year, increases of 33 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
Schwab said its record-breaking year was due to a big increase in customer
assets, which jumped by Dollars 30.2bn over the 12 months to Dollars 95.8bn.
Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, said he was confident the firm would have
strong 1994, and set a target for customer assets to rise by another Dollars
30bn by the end of the year.
He warned, however, that because the first quarter of 1993 had been
exceptionally prosperous, Schwab would have difficulty matching that
performance in the first quarter of this year.
The firm's share price fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 29 5/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Quaker Oats warns of sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Quaker Oats, the Chicago-based cereal, pet food and sports drinks
company, lost Dollars 3 5/8 to close at Dollars 65 3/4 yesterday as the
company warned that it would report a slump in second-quarter earnings next
week.
It said net income per share could be 15 to 20 per cent below the previous
year's 77 cents a share because of weakness in the European economy, the
impact of financing costs in Brazil, and lower gains from hedging against
shifts in European currency exchange rates.
Quaker said it remained confident that its full-year target of a 7 per cent
increase in real earnings was attainable because of growth in its US
businesses and productivity improvements worldwide.
Mr William Smithburg, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our key US
businesses are performing well in terms of strong volume growth, margin
improvement and maintaining market share.'
Last October Quaker Oats surprised the market with a stronger-than-expected
performance for its first quarter, ending in September. Net income of
Dollars 91.4m, against a loss of Dollars 55.3m a year earlier.
Much of the growth was attributed to strong sales of Gatorade, the sports
drink that is now Quaker's biggest-selling product, and to better sales of
cereals and grain-based snacks in the US.

<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was to
close four plants, scale down six more, and shed 1,800 jobs in North America
as part of the restructuring plan it announced last July.
The plants to close (and the products they make) are in Baltimore, Maryland
(dishwashing liquid and glycerin); Pointe Claire, Quebec (health and beauty
products); Quincy, Massachusetts (soap bars and fatty acids); and San
Francisco (Folgers coffee).
The company will stop making domestic cleaning products at its plant in
Sacramento, California; its Hamilton, Ontario, plant will stop making health
and beauty products and fabric softeners; and the manufacture of
incontinence products will transfer from its plant in Modesto, California.
Product lines will also move out of plants in Iowa City, Kansas City, and
Greensboro, North Carolina, but without any compulsory job losses.
P&amp;G said business remained healthy and production in the categories affected
was expanding at other sites, but the total number of plants had to be
reduced if the company was to remain competitive.
Last July P&amp;G announced that 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs world-wide would be
shed over the next three or four years as part of a drive to improve
efficiency.
The cuts announced yesterday - the first to be detailed under the July plan
 -represent about half those that will fall in North America.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Citicorp advance surprises
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp surprised the stock market with fourth-quarter earnings ahead of
expectations, even after one-off charges of Dollars 297m which included
restructuring costs and a write-down in the value of its Quotron subsidiary.
Although the US's largest bank will not unveil full details of its 1993
figures until next Tuesday, it chose yesterday to pre-announce that net
income for the fourth quarter would be 'about Dollars 575m,' or Dollars 1.06
a share, giving it record earnings for the year as a whole of Dollars 2.2bn,
or Dollars 4.11.
The news drove Citicorp's share price up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 .
The bank gave no further break-down of the results, though it detailed
several one-off items.
These included pre-tax charges of Dollars 425m to cover restructuring and
Dollars 179m to reflect a write-down in the value of Quotron, its
information services business, part of which is being sold to Reuters.
These costs were partly offset by gains of Dollars 107m from the sale of
Brazilian past-due interest bonds and Dollars 200m of deferred tax benefits.
Without the one-off items, earnings per share for the last quarter would
have reached around Dollars 1.25, estimated Ms Diane Glossman, a senior
analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Citicorp's earnings rebound in previous quarters had been fuelled by a rapid
improvement in credit quality, which had reduced its bad-debt costs.
The latest jump led to expectations that Citicorp would next week report a
stronger than expected improvement in revenues, with retail banking in the
US and around the world driving the growth.
Mr John Reed, chairman, said the results were 'broad-based, proving the
value of Citicorp's unique global franchise'. He said the bank was
continuing to invest in high-growth businesses, particularly in the
developing world, and that
the restructuring charges would pay for themselves by 1995.

<TEXT>
Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, reported strong sales
and earnings growth for the fourth quarter.
Sales for the quarter increased almost 35 per cent to Dollars Dollars 4.9bn
from Dollars 3.7bn in the same period last year. Net income jumped by 88 per
cent to Dollars 340m from Dollars 181m. Earnings per share rose to Dollars
1.15, the high end of Wall Street expectations, from 64 cents.
The news boosted Motorola's shares which surged in after-hours trading, from
Dollars 95 1/2 at the official close to Dollars 98 1/4 .
For the year, Motorola's revenues were Dollars 17bn, up from Dollars 13.3bn
in 1992. Net income more than doubled to just over Dollars 1bn or Dollars
3.55 a share from Dollars 453m or Dollars 1.66.
Motorola said semiconductor sales rose 28 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn.
Operating profit in the semiconductor segment rose to Dollars 801m from
Dollars 464m. General systems products sales were up 43 per cent at Dollars
5.2bn, with operating profits of Dollars 718m, up from Dollars 420m in 1992.
Motorola's communications products segment had sales of Dollars 4.83bn in
1993, a 24 per cent increase, producing operating profits for that segment
of Dollars 354m, up from Dollars 192m.
The company's government and systems technology products segment lifted
sales 32 per cent to Dollars 858m. But operating losses also rose to Dollars
17m in 1993, compared with an operating loss of Dollars 7m in 1992.
Commenting on the outlook for the year ahead, Mr Gary Tooker, chief
executive and vice chairman, said the company saw 'solid growth potential in
developing markets such as China' and expected the broader Asia-Pacific
region to continue to be the dominant area of growth for the company. 'We
believe that steady, sustainable growth can continue in North America,' Mr
Tooker said. 'Likewise, when economies begin to recover in Europe and Japan,
we expect to see our customers investing in tools for greater productivity.'

equity

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHL Systemhouse, a fast-expanding international computer services group,
says it is improving profitability and hopes to raise at least CDollars 50m
(USDollars 38m) in new equity.
Net profit was CDollars 4.7m, or 9 cents a share, for the first quarter
ended November 30, up from CDollars 300,000, or 1 cent, a year earlier.
Operating revenues advanced 54 per cent to CDollars 135m, with strong growth
continuing in outsourcing business. The order backlog was CDollars 1.5bn at
November 30.
SHL operates in north America, Europe and Asia, and recently acquired a
minority stake in a Korean outsourcing firm.
The group, which is carrying heavy long-term debt, reported a loss after
restructuring charges for the year ended August 31 and shuffled senior
management.
A large US shareholder and Canadian institutions have criticised SHL's
proposed executive stock option plan, the issue of two new preferred stock
classes and a USDollars 20m loan convertible into SHL common. The investors
argue that these moves would result in excessive dilution for existing
stockholders and that management was already well paid.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Final quarter puts seal on
strong year at JP Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. Morgan confounded Wall Street sceptics with record trading income
during the final quarter of 1993, setting the seal on a strong year for the
US bank.
Income from trading in financial markets reached Dollars 606m, compared with
a previous record of Dollars 520m in the second quarter of last year, as
Morgan profited from trading in the emerging country debt markets.
Many had projected that the previous record, set during a time of
instability in European currency and interest rate markets, would be hard to
match.
The trading performance helped push net income in the last three months of
the year to Dollars 392m, or Dollars 1.92 a share, and for the year as a
whole to Dollars 1.72bn, or Dollars 8.48.
Both figures were at the high end of analysts' expectations.
Morgan reported post-tax profits of Dollars 221m, or Dollars 1.10 a share,
for the comparable 1992 quarter, and Dollars 1.13bn, or Dollars 5.66, for
whole of 1992.
Two factors held net income for the period below the third-quarter level in
1993, when it had reached Dollars 468m, or Dollars 2.30.
The bank took a Dollars 120m pre-tax charge to cover property and relocation
costs. Also, revenue described by the bank broadly as 'other non-interest
income' was Dollars 129m lower due to the boost given to the previous period
from a big investment gain.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, singled out risk management and emerging
markets as two businesses which had seen 'notable increases' in demand.
For the year as a whole, trading revenues reached Dollars 2.01bn, up from
Dollars 959m the year before, when Morgan took losses from trading
mortgage-backed securities.
Corporate finance revenue rose to Dollars 532m from Dollars 439m,
credit-related fees to Dollars 224m from Dollars 214m, investment management
fees to Dollars 464m from Dollars 377m, operational service fees to Dollars
491m from Dollars 409m and other non-interest revenues to Dollars 406m from
Dollars 164m. By contrast, net gains from investment securities fell to
Dollars 323m from Dollars 388m.
Net interest revenues rose Dollars 64m to Dollars 1.77bn, and it took no
provisions for credit losses during the year, compared with a Dollars 55m
charge in 1992.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hasbro expects record quarter
but closes plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy maker, expects to report record fourth-quarter
revenues and earnings next month.
It also announced that it planned to close its manufacturing plant in Ter
Apel, in the Netherlands, this year with the loss of 162 jobs.
The Netherlands plant, which specialises in making games and puzzles, is one
of three Hasbro plants in Europe.
The others - in Waterford, Ireland, and Valencia, Spain - are larger, and
make toys as well as games and puzzles.
Hasbro said it had decided, after an analysis of its European manufacturing
capacity, that its needs could be more efficiently met by closing the
Netherlands plant and transferring production to the larger factories.
The plant closure will result in a Dollars 15m charge to pre-tax profits in
the fourth quarter.
Hasbro said that after-tax earnings before non-recurring charges would have
been more than 15 per cent higher in the quarter than a year earlier.

L. A. Gear, the US sports shoe maker which last quarter reported its first
profit in three years, yesterday said it expected to return to the red in
the fourth quarter with after-tax losses of Dollars 14m to Dollars 16m on
continuing operations.
The company said strong sales of children's shoes had helped cut losses from
Dollars 79.6m to between Dollars 39.2m and Dollars 41.2m for the year to
last Novem-ber.
But it warned that the industry was suffering from high inventory levels
which would probably cut gross margins.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paramount board backs Dollars
9.7bn bid from QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount Communications has recommended that shareholders
reject a controversial Dollars 9.2bn offer for the entertainment company
made last Friday by cable company Viacom and accept a rival Dollars 9.7bn
offer from QVC Network.
The decision, announced on Wednesday night, does not settle the five-month
takeover battle, since shareholders may accept either bid and Viacom could
still make a higher offer by February 1, the date set for final bids.
However, the board's re- endorsement of QVC's offer maintains the
psychological advantage the television home shopping business has enjoyed.
That was when the Paramount board, which had supported a friendly merger
with cable company Viacom, switched sides under pressure from the courts and
said QVC's offer gave shareholders better value.
After Wednesday's board meeting, Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman, did
not address claims by QVC that Viacom's new offer violated the bidding
rules.
However, he said any future bids would continue to be 'rigorously reviewed
with regard to their compliance with the bidding procedures.'
Last Friday night, shortly before QVC's tender offer was due to close,
Viacom announced a new bid which increased from Dollars 85 a share to
Dollars 105 a share the cash it is offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's
stock, but sharply cut the value of the securities it is offering in a
'second step merger' for the remaining 49 per cent.
Simultaneously, it announced an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video
rental group Blockbuster Entertainment, which is providing Dollars 1.25bn to
finance the higher cash offer.
The new Viacom bid offers Dollars 13 a share more cash than QVC, but the
total value of its offer is some Dollars 5 a share less than the QVC bid.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels recovers with 22%
increase

<TEXT>
Hilton Hotels, the US lodging and gaming group, bounced back from a
third-quarter profits decline to report a 22 per cent increase in net income
to Dollars 32.3m for its fourth quarter yesterday.
The company attributed the increase to strength in its gaming operations and
improvement in its main hotel markets. It also benefited from a tax credit
that caused its tax charge to fall by Dollars 1.9m to Dollars 11.1m.
Operating profits for the quarter rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 59m. Within
the total, gaming profits rose from Dollars 35.2m to Dollars 36.6m while
hotel profits were slightly down at Dollars 29.6m from Dollars 29.7m. But
Hilton said the hotel division would have increased operating profits by 42
per cent had it not taken a Dollars 12.5m reserve for a loan to a managed
property.
In the gaming division, strong performances had come from properties in Reno
and Laughlin, Nevada, and the Flamingo Hilton, Las Vegas.
Net income per share rose from 55 cents to 67 cents. For the year as a
whole, net income was slightly down at Dollars 102.7m from Dollars 103.9m
before accounting changes, or Dollars 2.14 a share against Dollars 2.17.
After accounting changes, net income was Dollars 106.1m, or Dollars 2.21.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Murdoch in temporary move to
Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation, plans to move
temporarily to Hong Kong next month to oversee a reorganisation of Star TV,
his troubled Asian satellite television company.
Since Mr Murdoch's USDollars 525m purchase of 63.6 per cent of the
broadcaster six months ago, Star has encountered difficulties in three of
its main markets - Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.
Industry experts say Star is running at an annual loss of between USDollars
60m and USDollars 80m. It is not known how long Mr Murdoch plans to live in
the colony but a house has been acquired for his use.
Mr Murdoch prefers his acquisitions to be close at hand. He moved from
Australia to the UK in the late 1960s after he bought the News of the World
and settled in the US in the 1980s after a string of media acquisitions.
Mr Gary Davey, Star's third chief executive in six months, was appointed
eight days ago. He has said a priority will be to improve relations with
Wharf Cable - which is meant to transmit Star's TV programmes in Hong Kong -
and China.
Wharf began its cable TV operation in Hong Kong at the end of October last
year. As part of its exclusive cable licence, it is required to carry Star.
However, the two companies have not been able to agree terms and the
government may have to be called in to broker a deal.
In China, officials are intensely suspicious of western media companies. An
article by Mr Murdoch in The Times last September, where he wrote of the
threat posed by satellite television to totalitarian regimes, caused concern
in Beijing.
China has since said unlicensed satellite dishes will be banned and is
pushing ahead with cable networks in major cities. Cable TV, because it is a
terrestrial system, is easier to control than an unregulated
extra-terrestrial broadcaster.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: GTE to reduce staff by 17,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GTE, the largest local telecommunications company in the US, yesterday
announced pre-tax fourth quarter charges of Dollars 1.8bn, mainly to cover a
restructuring of its telephone operations and the loss of 17,000 jobs over
the next three years.
It is the latest of several large programmes to cut jobs and improve
efficiency announced recently by America's local telecommunications
companies, which face growing competition from new rivals to their
traditional monopolies.
GTE, which serves a patchwork of markets across the US, said yesterday's
redesign - the result of a management technique known as process engineering
 -would give annual cost savings of Dollars 1bn.
It would also 'revolutionise' customer service in its telephone operations,
which was a critical part of its strategy to compete in the fast changing
telecommunication industry.
The charges will cut fourth quarter net income by Dollars 1.2bn or Dollars
1.22 a share. The company said that, excluding the charges, 1993 earnings
were expected to be in line with analysts' expectations.
Some Dollars 1.3bn of the pre-tax charges stem from the re-engineering
initiative. They include Dollars 680m to upgrade customer service and
administrative systems and software; Dollars 410m for employee separation
costs; and Dollars 160m for consolidating facilities.
Advanced computer systems mean the group can cut its customer service
centres from 171 to 11; revenue collection centres from five to one; and
regional centres monitoring its national network will drop from 19 to one.
The remainder of the Dollars 1.8bn charge consists of Dollars 350m for the
write-down of assets of Spacenet, its satellite communications business,
which is being combined with a business serving the US Government; and some
Dollars 200m in miscellaneous charges.
The job cuts represent 23 per cent of the 73,000 staff of the group's
domestic telephone business and 13 per cent of its total labour force.
GTE has spent the last few years selling off peripheral businesses to
concentrate on local telecommunications, but questions remain about its
strategy for the emerging world of inter-active multi-media communications.
It is one of the few large local telephone companies not to have announced a
significant alliance with a cable television company, although it was one of
the first companies to conduct trials of customer demand for inter-active
home entertainment.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Soros may join Forte in Ciga bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, is discussing a possible joint bid
with Mr George Soros, the international financier, for the Italian-based
Ciga hotel chain.
The group has joined forces with Quantum Fund, Mr Soros's investment
vehicle, to make a revised offer to Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank that
has overseen the restructuring of the highly indebted Italian company.
Mr Richard Power, communications director at Forte, said the UK hotel group
wanted to alter its initial agreement with Mediobanca to acquire Ciga.
Under its original offer, it would have paid Pounds 33m in cash and inserted
some luxury hotels worth Pounds 125m (Dollars 185m) into an Italian
operating company, in which it would have had a majority interest.
Ciga's debt would have been transferred to separate property holding
company. The agreement would have given Forte control of 35 Ciga hotels in
Italy, Austria, France, the Netherlands and Spain.
However, Forte is thought to have been forced to look for a partner with
substantial investment interests following demands from Ciga creditors that
a bid package should include some property assets.
'We hope the Quantum Fund will be our partner. It has been represented at
our recent discussions with Mediobanca,' said Mr Power.
The rescue package for Ciga, controlled by a financial holding company owned
by the Aga Khan, was put together after Mediobanca began restructuring the
group's L1,000bn (Dollars 590m) net debts last year.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chazot to lead Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Georges-Christian Chazot, a French industrialist, was yesterday confirmed
as the new group chief executive of Eurotunnel ahead of the launch of its
cross-channel rail services, which will start in the spring.
Mr Chazot, who will be responsible for the day to day running of the group,
will take his position on Monday. 'He will be in charge of turning the
company into a profitable organisation over the next few years,' said a
spokesman for Eurotunnel.
The appointment means that Sir Alastair Morton, who had been acting as chief
executive, will revert to his role as co-chairman alongside Mr Andre Benard.
Both, however, are expected gradually to reduce their roles in the running
of the company.
Eurotunnel said Sir Alastair was 'looking forward to no longer working 150
per cent on the project and just doing a normal full-time job.' He would
still be involved in raising Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in fresh capital to
complete the financing of the project; in settling outstanding claims with
British Rail and SNCF; and in preparing for the official opening of the
tunnel on May 6.
In November Sir Alastair was appointed chairman of the British government's
private finance working group, charged with finding ways of involving
private money in public projects. He is expected to spend one day a week on
this task.
Mr Benard said that Mr Chazot had been selected because of his international
experience and technical and commercial background. 'He had the profile we
were looking for and he has a very international experience.'
Most of Mr Chazot's experience comes from industry. An engineering graduate,
he has spent most of his career at Alcatel, the French-based
telecommunications group, and Schlumberger, the electrical engineering
group.
He also has experience of the services sector, his most recent position
being the head of French operations for Adia, the Swiss temporary employment
group.

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Poland launches 'beauty contest'
for TV licence - Public hearings this weekend may decide the future of
Polish commercial television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future shape of Polish commercial television may depend on the outcome
of unprecedented public hearings which begin in Warsaw tomorrow. The
hearings, chaired by Mr Marek Markiewicz, head of the nine-man Television
and Radio Council, the regulatory body, will decide which of 10 competing
foreign and national media groups should be awarded the first Polish
commercial television licence.
The stakes are high. Major international media companies, including
Bertelsmann of Germany, the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion
(CLT), and Time-Warner of the US, are in the ring.
CLT is linked to Reuters while Time-Warner is harnessed with CNN and Capital
Cities-ABC. Sofirad, a French government-linked company, is running together
with CEDC Media Enterprises, controlled by Mr Mark Palmer, the former US
Ambassador to Budapest. The French pay-TV company, Canal Plus, has put in a
separate bid.
Meanwhile, Top Canal, a local pirate broadcaster, has enlisted the services
of Kinnevik International, the Swedish media group, while Italian interest
is represented by Mr Nicola Grauso. Mr Grauso, a broadcast and print media
owner from Sardinia, obtains some of his programming and advertising from Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group.
The hearings have been designed to give maximum transparency in view of the
potentially lucrative nature of the licence and its political sensitivity.
The proposed new channel will carry news and current affairs programmes as
well as entertainment and sport. It will, therefore, bring an end to
complete political control over the most influential opinion-forming medium
in Poland.
With over 38m inhabitants, Poland is the largest of the post-communist
states of central Europe and the first to emerge from the recession which
followed shock therapy economic reforms. Over 50 per cent of the economy is
now in private hands and 4.5 per cent economic growth is expected for 1994,
after a 4 per cent rise in GNP last year.
Whether the new licence will prove to be 'a licence to print money', as in
the early days of UK commercial TV, however, remains unclear. Last year, the
total advertising spend on Polish TV is estimated by advertising industry
sources at around Dollars 130m.
Industry estimates put the initial investment required to get the proposed
new channel off the ground and running at between Dollars 60m and Dollars
100m. Clauses in the law require that around 50 per cent of broadcast output
is produced locally, so raising costs, while foreign shareholdings in the
competing groups have been limited by law to 33 per cent.
This means that all the international players have had to find local
partners, whose financial resources are in most cases limited.
Another drawback for the successful bidder is that initially the new
'national' channel will reach less than half the potential audience. The
military say they can only free the frequencies needed for nationwide
coverage if they are given funds from the cash-strapped budget to modernise
air traffic control equipment.
Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister, has said this could take up to
three years. Such a delay means that the new channel will face losses of
revenue to local and regional TV stations, which are also applying for
licences and whose applications are to be decided at a later date.
The problem with frequencies could possibly be resolved sooner if President
Lech Walesa, who is responsible for defence, was better disposed towards the
broadcasting council.
However, the council has already infuriated the President by appointing Mr
Wieslaw Walendziak, an independent-minded, 31-year old journalist to head
state-owned TV.
The decision led Mr Walesa publicly to call for the resignation of Mr
Markiewicz, as well as two colleagues nominated by him last year. The three
refused to resign and the row has since died down, but it showed how
precarious the council's position is.
Mr Markiewicz, the council's chairman, is a soft-spoken, 42-year old lawyer
from Lodz who represented the Solidarity trade union in the last parliament.
He tends to pick his words with the thoughtful attention of a man who knows
he is in a political minefield.
The council was originally appointed last year by the president and the
former Parliament. Its members were chosen from the 29 parties represented
in the old parliament, which reflected all strands of political opinion in
the country.
Despite their differing political origins, the council members have
developed an esprit de corps. But they no longer reflect the political
realities of the recently elected current parliament. The September
elections eliminated most of the smaller parties and parliament is now
dominated by a centre-left coalition with its roots in the communist past.
In March, the council will present its first annual report to parliament.
Should this be rejected, its members will have to resign. As the council is
charged not only with granting licences but also monitoring broadcasting
activity, the implications for media freedom and the future of the proposed
commercial channel are serious.
So far, the government has been careful not to back President Walesa in his
attempts to get Mr Markiewicz replaced. However, as Mr Leszek Miller, the
labour minister who is attuned to feeling on the left wing of the ruling
Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), says: 'President Walesa has put the thought
that Markiewicz and his colleagues might be replaced into people's minds, so
who knows?'

FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault to examine Volvo links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, has asked Mr Louis
Schweitzer, chairman of Renault, the state-owned motor vehicle group, to
examine the future of its industrial and legal links with Volvo after a
meeting of the Swedish company's board next week.
But officials at the French industry ministry rejected French press reports
that Mr Longuet would dismantle the legal agreements and cross-shareholdings
established between the groups in 1990.
The agreements, which include Volvo's 20 per cent stake in Renault SA and an
8 per cent holding by the French group in Volvo AB, remain in force despite
the collapse of the planned merger last December.
French officials say the shareholdings and existing industrial agreements do
not necessarily obstruct the government's plans to privatise Renault. Mr
Longuet said on Wednesday that privatisation would take place this year,
following the sale of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Union des Assurances
de Paris.
The prospect of a review of the existing agreements, however, contributed to
a sharp rise in Volvo's shares. In early afternoon trading, Volvo's B shares
had gained more than 2.5 per cent to stand at SKr600.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Securicor up despite flat tone at Cellnet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securicor, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a 33
per cent increase in annual profits despite a flat performance by Cellnet,
its 40 per cent-owned mobile phone network.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 rose from a restated Pounds
47.3m to Pounds 63m. On continuing operations, however, the improvement was
more modest with profits ahead 15 per cent at Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 55.2m).
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the group had reduced its reliance on
Cellnet, which has fuelled the results in recent years, while the group's
other divisions had improved sharply.
Profits from continuing managed business operations - security, parcels,
communications, insurance and business services - rose 85 per cent to Pounds
17.1m (Pounds 9.3m).
Yet Cellnet, in which BT has a 60 per cent holding, still accounted for more
than 70 per cent of total profits with a pre-tax contribution of Pounds
46.3m (Pounds 45.9m).
Mr Bob Warner, Cellnet's managing director, said the network had been held
back only by the launch costs of its Lifetime service and substantial
marketing expenses.
Group turnover increased 9.2 per cent from Pounds 583.8m to Pounds 637.3m,
while Security Services - the 50.75 per cent-owned subsidiary where most of
the group's operating companies are held - reported turnover of Pounds
616.4m (Pounds 562.9m).
Profits at the subsidiary increased by 41 per cent from a restated Pounds
30.7m to Pounds 43.3m.
Among Securicor's managed businesses, the security division showed the
sharpest improvement as the benefits of a two year rationalisation programme
pushed pre-tax profits up to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 5.6m).
Although the parcels division was hit by overcapacity, it gained market
share from rival companies and reported profits of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds
4.6m).
The communications division, excluding Cellnet, continued to lose money. But
an increase in the number of subscribers for Securicor Cellular Services,
the retailing company, helped cut losses to Pounds 4.5m, compared with
Pounds 6.6m last time.
In spite of the improvement, Mr Wiggs warned that further rationalisation
would be necessary to improve margins.
Restated group earnings per share rose from 20p to 30.2p, while earnings at
Security Services increased to 26.6p (14.9p).
A final group dividend of 2.229p is proposed to make a total of 2.961p, an
increase of 13 per cent. A similar increase is proposed at Security
Services, a final of 4.151p making a total of 5.684p.
COMMENT
Although Securicor has enjoyed improved contributions from its managed
businesses, Cellnet is expected to reassert its dominance this year. Indeed,
speculation that BT may consider a bid for Securicor's stake has enhanced
the price of its A shares, up 6p to 916p yesterday. Buoyant Christmas sales
and about 400,000 new subscribers has further boosted Cellnet's performance,
and its contribution to Securicor could grow by at least Pounds 10m. That
expectation has pushed forecast profits up to Pounds 78m on a multiple of
24.5, which makes the shares an attractive if expensive option.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Non-core but rising profits are appealing -
The continuing role of a restructured Hill Samuel within TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB Group's chief executive, yesterday tried once again to
clarify his bank's attitude to Hill Samuel, the merchant banking arm which
it was widely expected to discard.
'We never actually said that it was for sale, and now we have said clearly
that it is not for sale,' he said.
The statement was true, but incomplete. TSB circulated an information
memorandum to possible buyers of Hill Samuel last year, and Sir Nicholas
Goodison, TSB's chairman, hinted at a possible sale when he said it would
hold on to Hill Samuel unless it received 'an offer we could not resist'.
However, no such offer was received. This meant that Mr Ellwood yesterday
faced the task of explaining why TSB now apparently intends to retain a
merchant bank and investment management operation despite its oft-repeated
strategy of concentrating on its core retail banking and insurance
businesses.
The obvious reason might be that it is simply making the best of not having
received a high enough offer. Selling Hill Samuel certainly appeared to be
the reason for TSB's decision last year to isolate in a separate
administration unit the bad debts built up through poor corporate lending.
This allowed Hill Samuel, which operates in financial services as well as
merchant banking and investment management, to register a Pounds 96m profit
last year despite a Pounds 142m loss being recorded for the loan
administration unit, which now holds Pounds 1.48bn of loans written down to
a net Pounds 629m.
There appears to be little synergy between TSB's retail and merchant banking
businesses. Large banks such as Barclays and National Westminster have tried
to raise income by using large corporate lending as a lever to sell clients
services such as equities underwriting and foreign exchange dealing.
But TSB has few corporate customers to tempt with Hill Samuel's expertise.
The merchant bank's main use seems to be as a good investment if it can
raise its return on equity from about 10 per cent last year to the group
hurdle of 15 per cent post-tax.
Seen in this light, Hill Samuel could become attractive. Mr Hugh Freedberg,
who was brought in to reshape the business in 1990, says 80 per cent of the
restructuring has now occurred. Among the effects are the closure of 11 Hill
Samuel branches and a cut in staff last year from 1,600 to 1,100.
As significantly, Hill Samuel cut its loan portfolio by Pounds 400m during
the year to Pounds 2.1bn. This reduced capital employed in the business to
about Pounds 400m.
Mr Freedberg predicts that the figures will fall this year to a sustainable
level of between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 1.7bn of loans, and Pounds 350m
capital employed.
Mr Freedberg has built up funds under management in the investment
management arm from Pounds 20bn to Pounds 26bn, raising profits from Pounds
4m to Pounds 18m last year. However, the financial services business saw
profits fall by Pounds 4m to Pounds 13m as customers switched out of life
products.
The main reforms have come in the merchant bank, where the reduced emphasis
on corporate lending has been replaced by efforts to build up its corporate
advisory and structured finance activities. The bank now has eight
businesses, including aerospace and shipping finance arms.
Mr Freedberg cites as an example of Hill Samuel's best type of deal as its
corporate advisory role to the government over the Channel tunnel. He says
that the bank bid successfully for this mandate by combining its expertise
in three areas: corporate finance, project finance and banking.
He accepts that Hill Samuel does not gain much corporate business from its
parent. He argues, however, that Hill Samuel benefits from TSB's very strong
capital, which makes it easier to underwrite securities, and offer long-term
swaps which require capital backing.
The fact that TSB has such strong capital - its tier one ratio of core
capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 8.7 per cent last year, against 7.2
per cent - also means that it has no pressing need to sell Hill Samuel.
Whatever the logic of keeping it, it will not be forced to sell.
The longer-term question may be whether TSB is tempted to invest in
expanding Hill Samuel's range of businesses as well as strengthening those
it has. The obvious choice would be to replace the broking and capital
markets operations which it lost in 1989 with the sale of Wood Mackenzie.
Mr Freedberg says that such talk is premature. 'We need to get a few runs on
the board before we think about things like that.'
For the moment, Hill Samuel's staff may want to enjoy the luxury of not
being the object of speculation over when they will be sold.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark draws benefit from
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first benefits from acquisitions made in 1993 lifted interim pre-tax
profits of Matthew Clark, the drinks producer and wholesaler, by 42 per cent
from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 3.43m.
Four months' trading from Freetraders, the drinks wholesaler, and one week
from Grants of St James's, the wine business, accounted for Pounds 24m of
total turnover of Pounds 47.6m (Pounds 26.1m) and contributed Pounds 1.16m
to operating profits of Pounds 3.57m (Pounds 2.45m).
Continuing operations had shown only slight growth during the six months to
end-October, said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. 'Once again the build up
to the Christmas trade was slower than we would prefer but we recorded a
strong spurt in sales in December itself, although margins remained under
acute pressure in the branded drinks division'.
Freetraders' performance had been 'most encouraging,' he said. In its year
to end-September, it had achieved organic growth of 18.9 per cent in sales
and 25.6 per cent in operating profits. But the group's total wholesaling
business still represented only 1 per cent of the pubs, hotels and
restaurants market.
Integration of the Grants business was proceeding to plan and would produce
significant cost savings, Mr Aikens said. Redundancy notices were issued
yesterday to 225 of the 540-strong workforce and a production unit at
Worksop has been closed.
Sales of Strathmore spring water - an earlier acquisition in the buying
spree that has quadrupled the size of the group in the last three years -
increased 20 per cent by volume in a market which grew overall by 10 per
cent. Further investment is being made in marketing support to widen
distribution.
Overall British wine volumes were marginally lower but the group's main
brands maintained their position in a market in which commodity products
made large inroads into the own label business.
Earnings were 16p (15.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 7.25p
(6.75p).

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kelt surges ahead and dividend in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contributions from acquired interests in Colombia and west Africa enabled
Kelt Energy, the independent oil and gas production and exploration company,
to hoist pre-tax profits from Pounds 629,000 to Pounds 3.24m in the six
months to September 30.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 18.2m, against Pounds 8.9m. Earnings
per share advanced from 0.4p to 1.8p.
Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said Kelt's prospects and position were
sufficiently strong for it to return to the dividend list after an absence
of several years. He said the board would recommend a dividend as soon as
practicable.
Daily net production in September 1993 increased to about 11,800 barrels of
oil equivalent per day, against 5,430 in March 1993.
Proven/probable reserves grew 68 per cent from 47.8m boe in March 1993 to
80.2m boe in September.
The most significant change for the company in the period had come through
its purchase of an interest in producing fields in Colombia. The interim
results reflected three months' contribution from these interests. The
fields, located in the prolific Llanos Basin, had added net production of
some 5,000 boepd.
Mr Perrodo said profitability in existing operations had been largely
sustained in spite of lower oil and contract gas prices in the period. Kelt
had continued to emphasise strict cost control and limit borrowing.
Kelt's financial year end is reverting to December 31 in order to bring the
company back into line with common practice within the upstream oil and gas
industry. The next annual report will therefore cover the nine month period
to December 31 1993.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: PWS increases to Pounds 2.4m despite
interest setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PWS Holdings, the insurance and reinsurance broking group, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m for the year to September 30 on
sales up 6 per cent from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 15.3m.
The figures for 1992 have been restated under the FRS 3 accounting standard.
This means that the pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 1.2m has been depressed
by a charge of Pounds 1.02m related to closure of a subsidiary. Under the
previous accounting treatment this was carried as an extraordinary provision
of Pounds 683,000.
In the 12 months under review, lower interest rates led to a further fall in
investment income, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.7m. The combined shortfall
over the last two years amounts to Pounds 2.3m.
PWS International, which specialises in the reinsurance of large individual
risks emanating from outside North America and accounts for 71 per cent of
group sales, increased its brokerage by 15 per cent to Pounds 10.9m.
The final dividend is again 2.5p, making an unchanged total of 4p for the
year, on earnings per share of 6.8p (4.4p).

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Neotronics affected by European recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Neotronics Technology, the Hertfordshire-based specialist gas and water
analysis equipment manufacturer, staged a modest recovery in its second
half, but still reported a 23 per cent contraction in annual profits.
Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said trading remained difficult following
recession in many of the group's main markets, especially Europe.
Turnover for the 12 months to end-September improved to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds
19.3m), but after a deficit of some Pounds 550,000 emanating from the
group's currency hedging policy and redundancy costs of Pounds 252,000, the
pre-tax line fell from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 2.33m.
Mr Gotley said benefits of the acquisition in 1992 and subsequent
integration of Solomat Instrumentation, the water and air quality analysis
business, were becoming apparent. The results took in a full year from the
offshoot, against nine months last time.
Future growth, he said, depended on new technology. The formal launch of the
group's Electronic Nose (Neotronics Olfactory Sensing Equipment) is
scheduled for this month.
The device is intended to play a substantial role in aiding manufacturers in
the food and drink, cosmetic and perfume and medicine industries in quality
control and product standardisation.
Earnings per share dipped from 7.65p to 5.73p; a proposed final dividend of
1.75p maintains the total for the year at 2.6p.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: NU writ against Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union has issued a writ for damages, understood to be for up to
Pounds 80m, against a subsidiary of Tarmac, the construction group, for work
on the Galleries shopping centre in Bristol.
Tarmac, meanwhile, is claiming more than Pounds 2m in unpaid fees and costs
it said it is owed for work on the development.
The construction company said it had not had opportunity to analyse details
of the writ but it was 'satisfied the group had no material liability in
this connection.'
Schal International, Tarmac's construction management subsidiary, worked on
the project until spring 1991 when it was replaced. The claims by Norwich
Union relate to the late opening of the development which is now trading and
mostly let.
The construction group, which has rejected Norwich Union's claims, told
shareholders yesterday that the claims have been reviewed but no agreement
has been reached.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Shingles drug price war recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a price war between SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome, which
make the only two drugs that treat the condition called shingles, seemed to
be averted yesterday when SmithKline's drug was launched in the UK at
virtually the same price as its rival.
SmithKline launched Famvir at Pounds 107.35 for a seven-day course. Wellcome
cut the price of Zovirax by 5 per cent to Pounds 107.30 for a week-long
course as a shingles treatment.
SB said it had priced Famvir below the then price of Zovirax because buyers
such as general practitioner fundholders were under pressure to spend less.
Wellcome said that it had cut the price 'to bring it into line with European
pricing (of Zovirax).'
Annual UK sales of Zovirax are about Pounds 40m, of which less than one
third is for shingles.
However, both companies agree that at most only half the potential users of
their shingles treatments in the UK are currently prescribed the drug.
Mr Jonathan de Pass, pharmaceuticals analyst with BZW, said yesterday:
'There is no need for them to compete on price. The market is now an
oligopoly and there are no significant differences between the two drugs.'
Famvir has been submitted for regulatory approval in more than 20 countries,
with US approval likely next year.
About 40 per cent of world sales of Zovirax are in the US; the UK accounts
for about 5 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wyko loss grows to Pounds 0.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falls in turnover and margins in UK manufacturing and losses in South Africa
left Wyko, the West Midlands manufacturer and distributor of bearings and
power transmission components, with increased interim pre-tax losses.
The board has decided to pass the interim dividend, against last time's
0.5p.
Mr Philip White, chairman, warned that although trading was expected to
improve during the second half, all of the exceptional costs involved in
scaling down the manufacturing operations would be taken in this year's
accounts.
The loss for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 333,000 against a
profit of Pounds 121,000.
The group's fortunes slipped during the second half of 1992-93 and the year
ended with a deficit of Pounds 20,000.
There was an operating loss in UK manufacturing of Pounds 432,000, including
redundancy costs of Pounds 116,000. The South African activities, which were
sold earlier this month, recorded a loss of Pounds 103,000.
In UK manufacturing there has been a drive against costs, including the
merger of three businesses into one and a reduction in staffing. The group
payroll, 1,120 two years ago, is now 915 and will be down to about 850 by
the end of the rationalisation programme next May.
The international distribution business, however, is performing strongly and
UK distribution is seeing recovery in demand.
After a tax charge of Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 145,000) losses per share were
1.19p (0.07p). For the full year there were losses of 0.5p, when total
dividend payments came to 1p.
Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 29m). However operating
profits slumped to Pounds 96,000 (Pounds 685,000), which was not enough to
cover interest payments of Pounds 429,000 (Pounds 424,000), reflecting
gearing of 62 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore launches split capital investment
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore is launching a new split capital investment trust, the British
Income and Growth Trust, via an offer for subscription opening on February
15.
There will be two classes of shares: ordinary income, with a predicted
dividend yield of 9.3 per cent; and zero dividend preference shares, with a
forecast annualised gross redemption yield of 8 per cent. Packaged units,
yielding 4.4 per cent, are also available.
The trust will invest in UK shares with higher than average yields, though
not always the highest yielding, to allow greater diversification. The trust
is due to be wound up at the end of 2002. It will need to achieve growth of
5 per cent a year if income shares are to be repaid with no loss of capital,
and an annual yield of 140 per cent of the FT-SE-A All-Share to cover all
charges as well as predicted yields on income shares and packaged units.
Mr Lewis McNaught, of Gartmore Fund Managers, said he expected strong demand
for the zeros from institutions, and for the income shares from private
investors looking for Pep investments ahead of the tax year end.
Mr John Szymanowski, an investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, said the
trust was very similar to Gartmore's Shared Equity trust, which had a
slightly higher yield. Shared Equity was launched in November as a result of
the restructuring of Gartmore Value. Mr McNaught said that interest shown in
that launch had prompted the development of the new fund with an almost
identical structure.
Launch expenses will be capped at 4 per cent, and the annual management
charge will be 0.5 per cent. Pep charges will be 1 per cent initially and
0.75 per cent annually.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Price erosion leaves Microgen at Pounds
6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microgen Holdings, the specialist computer services group, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 8.24m to Pounds 6.7m for the year
to October 31 despite an 8 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 53.4m.
The shares fell 3p to 145p yesterday although the company warned of the
downturn when it reported interim results in July, then causing a 12p drop
in the share price to 173p.
Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said: 'We have suffered price erosion particularly
in our UK computer output microfilm business.'
However, he was confident about the current year and to back this up the
board is holding the final dividend at 5.05p to give a same-again total of
7.25p.
Earnings per share were 10.5p (13.8p).
'Because of the cash generative nature of the business, although our
dividend cover is only 1.4 (1.9) times, we feel it is appropriate to
maintain the dividend.'
He said the present year would see a full contribution from the company's
Norwegian operations.
Also, operating profits of Pounds 6.51m (Pounds 8.28m) reflected a Pounds
500,000 loss in the company's Danish operations which was not expected to be
repeated, as well as a Pounds 500,000 loss due to the one-off costs of
starting the Demand Publishing division of its electronic publishing
business.
The company said that the acquisition of the computer output business of JDC
was of strategic benefit.
'The important thing is the revenue that Microgen derives from electronic
publishing has grown quite strongly and is now 34 per cent of total
turnover.
'The area where demand is growing most strongly is becoming an ever bigger
part of our business.'
The company started its last financial year with cash of Pounds 2.5m and
ended with Pounds 1.3m, although it spent Pounds 5m as part of its programme
of capital expenditure and Pounds 1.5m on goodwill associated with
acquisitions in Norway and Germany.
Microgen booked a Pounds 187,000 interest credit (charge Pounds 33,000).

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bankers salvage little from late bail-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's sale by eight banks of the operating business of Magnet ends the
saga of one of the worst of the many poor lending decisions of the late
1980s, writes Maggie Urry.
The business, bought by its management through a leveraged deal in July 1989
for Pounds 629m, has been sold for Pounds 56m.
Senior lenders to the buy-out put in Pounds 372.5m. They were headed by
Bankers Trust, the American bank which at the time was trying to make a name
for itself in the London market as an innovative provider of finance.
Mezzanine lenders contributed Pounds 190m, a larger than usual amount.
With substantial interest on the debt being rolled up into the capital in
the intervening years, Airedale Holdings, Magnet's parent company, had debts
of Pounds 800m by the time it went into receivership two days before
Christmas 1992.
On the same day, the banks which were the original senior lenders bought the
operating company from the receiver. It is these banks which have now sold
to Berisford at what appears to be a knock down price.
Bankers Trust declines to comment on the whole sorry episode. But one banker
involved privately admitted, with masterly understatement, that 'it was a
mistake'.
The mbo was doomed from the start.
Management, led by Mr Tom Duxbury, then chairman, launched its bid in April
1989. Pre-tax profits for the financial year just ended were estimated at
Pounds 72.7m, including Pounds 12.2m of property profits. Bankers were told
that profits would grow at an annual 15 per cent.
As it turned out, according to Berisford, Magnet made a trading profit of
only Pounds 30m, excluding property profits, in the year to March 1989, and
the following year suffered a Pounds 23m loss, which rose to Pounds 26m in
1992.
Delays in completing the mbo - caused by complaints from some institutional
investors - meant it was not signed until July that year.
By then the retail market was turning sour, as interest rates rose and
housing activity fell, and other leveraged buy-outs, such as MFI and Lowndes
Queensway, were meeting problems paying interest on increasingly expensive
debt.
So when Bankers Trust attempted to syndicate the loan in early August it was
unable to do so.
By October - only three months after the deal was completed - Magnet was in
refinancing talks with its banks.
Discussions were concluded that Christmas, and Mr Duxbury resigned. Mr John
Foulkes, chief executive, was given a bonus deal of Pounds 1m in 1991 and
Pounds 2m in 1992. But by June 1990 Magnet was again unable to meet interest
payments and terms had to be renegotiated once more. By this time the
mezzanine debt and equity were worthless.
Apart from the fatal flaw of lending in the first place, the banks made a
second grave mistake. They failed to take security over the trading assets
of Magnet, which were held in a subsidiary company. The banks could not
force Magnet to sell assets in order to repay debt.
As the recession worsened, Airedale's losses rose and in the year to March
1992 reached Pounds 125.1m, by which time it had negative net worth of
Pounds 591.8m.
There appears to be nothing, beyond the Pounds 56m sale price, that the
banks can salvage from the wreckage, although litigation continues.
Lawsuits were started by GE Capital, which put up Pounds 70m of the
mezzanine debt and which sued the company and Bankers Trust, and by Bankers
Trust, which sued Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, over its role in the
mbo. The latter suit is expected to come to court in October.
The mbo backers are thus severe losers from the saga - and some would argue
are now compounding their losses by selling at the bottom of the market.
The winners must be the Magnet shareholders who, however reluctantly, sold
in 1989, and perhaps Berisford's shareholders if Magnet's new owner succeeds
in returning it to profits.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Campari expects Pounds 7.75m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Campari International, the leisurewear group, said yesterday that continuing
difficult trading conditions meant that initial indications were for a
pre-tax loss of about Pounds 7.75m for 1993.
The new management team had taken action to reduce costs, strengthen product
design and rationalise the supplier base, but these changes were unlikely to
significantly improve results until the second half of 1994.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Absence of exceptionals leaves Cray Elect
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An underlying 10 per cent increase in turnover and improved trading margins
helped Cray Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software
systems group, double interim operating profits from continuing operations
to Pounds 9.6m, against Pounds 4.79m.
However, pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 fell to Pounds
7.8m, after Pounds 1.12m in reorganisation costs, compared with Pounds
17.8m, swollen by a Pounds 13m exceptional gain on the sale of Malvern
Instruments.
Earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 3.1p (2.04p), but
fell on an FRS 3 basis to 2.52p (10.33p). The interim dividend is 0.75p
(0.5p).
The figures were in line with expectations, but the market focused on the
headline pre-tax figure and the shares slipped 6 1/2 p to close at 164 1/2
p.
Turnover, including a Pounds 5.22m contribution from P-E International
acquired for Pounds 16.2m in September and Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 11.7m)
from discontinued activities, increased to Pounds 114.3m (Pounds 81.9m).
The figure was boosted by higher overseas sales, particularly in the US and
Asia Pacific regions, and by a full contribution from the Dowty IT
businesses which were acquired in August 1992.
P-E contributed Pounds 32,000 to operating profits while the discontinued
Shrewsbury Technology operations incurred a Pounds 780,000 loss. Last year
discontinued operations showed a Pounds 919,000 profit.
Mr Roger Holland, chairman said: 'We have improved revenue, profit and
operating margin in our principal businesses. The growth we have experienced
outside the UK is particularly pleasing.'
The advance in operating profits and the overall trading margins, which
increased from 6.8 per cent to 8.8 per cent, was led by Cray Communications
which accounted for almost 70 per cent of turnover.
The division lifted operating profits to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 3.1m) while
margins improved from 7.3 per cent to 10.4 per cent. It was helped by the
strong demand for integrated local and wide area networking systems, and the
introduction of new products.
Cray Systems, which now includes P-E International's computer services
operations, reported operating profits of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 900,000) while
Cray Technology slipped from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 600,000.
COMMENT
Cray's management deserves credit for the detail and openness of the interim
figures which included an illuminating breakdown of Pounds 4.2m in fair
value adjustments following the P-E acquisition which has already helped the
systems division achieve critical mass. The core communications division has
a strong product portfolio in a dynamic growth sector and is aiming to lift
margins to 20 per cent over the next few years. A traditionally stronger
second half should lift full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 26m for earnings
of about 8.8p. The shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 18.7.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Retailers display renewed evidence of
strong Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence continued to build yesterday of a strong performance by retailers
over Christmas, as three retail groups reported sales increases of between 4
and 7 per cent.
Sears, the group which includes Wallis, Richards, Olympus, and Adams and
several high street shoe chains, said like-for-like sales - which exclude
store openings and closures - were up 7 per cent in the six weeks to January
8.
Sales were particularly strong at Selfridges department store, but were down
in childrens' wear in spite of strong trading in Christmas week.
The Body Shop said like-for-like sales for the nine weeks to Christmas were
up 4 per cent, while total sales were up 6 per cent.
International sales grew 14 per cent, with Asia up 22 per cent, Europe up 20
per cent, and Canada and Australia together up 7 per cent.
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said like-for-like sales for the financial year
so far were down only 1 per cent on last year, compared with 5 per cent
reported at the half-year.
Amber Day, now renamed WEW Group, said like-for-like sales in the five
months to the end of December were up 4 per cent, and total sales up 16 per
cent.
After a poor August and September, trading had improved from October to
December.
Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the Poundstretcher discount chain, said
like-for-like sales increased below expectations by only 2.7 per cent for
the 13 weeks to December 24. The pre-tax loss for the year to December was
likely to be bigger than current market expectations of about Pounds 4m.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rank at Pounds 277m in weak market - Upturn
attributed to cost-cutting and improved cash management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rank Organisation yesterday announced annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
276.6m, compared with a restated Pounds 125.8m, but said there had been
little improvement in market conditions.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the upturn was the result of
cost-cutting and improved cash management.
The UK and US markets had remained weak in 1993 and conditions in Japan and
some continental European countries had deteriorated.
There were signs, however, that consumer spending was picking up in the UK
and the US.
The year to October 31 saw sales rise 5 per cent to Pounds 2.11bn (Pounds
2.01bn). Operating profit increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 200.4m (Pounds
176.6m).
The shares rose 20p to Pounds 10.01p.
All of Rank's main business sectors increased operating profits. Film and
television's input rose to Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 22m). Mr Gifford said the
advance was largely the result of improved profitability in film processing.
Admissions to Odeon cinemas rose 10 per cent, largely because of the film
Jurassic Park. Rank was unable to increase admission prices, however,
because of strong competition.
Operating profit from holidays rose to Pounds 51m (Pounds 42.5m). Holiday
volumes grew by 8 per cent, although some of the improvement came in the
off-peak period when prices are lower. Profits rose at the Butlin's holiday
camps but the Shearings coach holiday business saw a small decline.
Mr Gifford added that holiday bookings for the first half of 1994 were up 9
per cent. Bookings for the second half, which includes the summer season,
had increased 7 per cent.
The recreation businesses, which includes bingo, casino and social clubs,
reported operating profits of Pounds 63m (Pounds 57.3m). Admissions were
similar to 1992, but spending per head in social and bingo clubs increased
by 6 per cent. Spending in the casinos rose 4 per cent on unchanged
admissions.
The leisure division, which takes in US resorts, Hard Rock Cafes and
nightclubs, lifted profits to Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 33.6m), of which the US
contributed Pounds 10m.
UK nightclubs increased admissions by 13 per cent, but spending per head
remained static. Mr Gifford said many of the new customers were coming to
nightclubs during the week, when spending was usually lower.
Rank's share of the pre-tax profits of Rank Xerox rose to Pounds 151.2m
(Pounds 137.3m). The contribution from other associates, primarily Universal
Studios in Florida, rose by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 11.5m.
Earnings per share were 46.5p (6.1p). There was no final dividend as Rank
announced last July that it was paying an accelerated total for the year of
31p, the same as in 1992.
A Kershaw, whose main asset is its shareholding in Rank Precision
Industries, had investment income after all charges of Pounds 10.1m (Pounds
9.9m). Profit on ordinary activities after tax was Pounds 9.9m (Pounds
9.7m). The final dividend of 18p makes a total of 27p, from earnings of
28.5p (27.9p).

Harmony Property, the former hotel and restaurants group, has harked back
towards its old business by acquiring a stake in Leisuretime Inns, the
unquoted pubs operator.
The company, which last month changed its name from Harmony Leisure, said it
was teaming up with Mr Barry Cox, a joint founder and former operator of the
Hard Rock Cafe, to inject fresh finance into Leisuretime.
Mr John Main, Harmony's chairman and chief executive, said the company had
reached agreement with Mr Cox and Mr Bob Halsey, managing director at
Leisuretime, to acquire a joint holding of 29.9 per cent in the group.
Mr Cox, whose latest restaurant operation is called Fatboy's Diner, would
offer extensive catering expertise to the company, Mr Main added.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hollas in red after restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A review of activities by the new management team at Hollas Group, the
Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, resulted in pre-tax losses of
Pounds 254,000 for the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds
255,000, writes Nigel Clark.
The outcome was after exceptional costs of Pounds 705,000, comprising Pounds
208,000 relating to management changes and Pounds 425,000 for losses on and
provision against the values of surplus properties.
Of the property charge Pounds 325,000 was accounted for by the net loss on
the sale of a Manchester property announced yesterday. The total
consideration was Pounds 2.4m, raising net cash of Pounds 1.85m which is
being used to cut borrowings and for working capital.
Mr Julian Lee, who retreated from the corporate scene following the sale of
Bricom, the industrial conglomerate, in 1990, came out of retirement to
become group chief executive in October.
Turnover was Pounds 12.8m, against Pounds 15.9m including Pounds 3.83m from
discontinued activities. Losses per share were 0.5p (earnings 0.3p). The
interim dividend is halved at 0.3p.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Attractive business with large potential -
Magnet's new direction after its acquisition by Berisford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford International, believes that
in Magnet he has found a business with substantial potential.
He will take up as many of the rights on his 1.5 per cent shareholding as he
can by selling some shares. He has convinced holders of another 24 per cent
to take up their rights.
Analysts were suggesting yesterday that Berisford's shares could be about
150p when trading resumes, compared to yesterday's 128p suspension price, if
the deal is approved by shareholders.
Mr Bowkett believes the joinery products maker and distributor retains a
strong brand name in spite of the problems it has suffered since its
ill-fated management buy-out of 1989.
The business was well known among small builders when it traded as Magnet &amp;
Southerns. However, in the 1980s Magnet changed direction and tried to
appeal direct to retail customers by opening high street shops.
When Mr John Foulkes joined Magnet a month after the mbo in July 1989, he
initially approved the strategy. But he quickly realised that the new shops
had simply added costs without a commensurate increase in sales.
As recession bit and people stopped moving house sales fell, leaving
Magnet's factories under-used. Sales were Pounds 376m in the year to March
1988 but are now running at a little less than half that level. About half
the fall, Mr Bowkett says, was a result of the falling market, a quarter was
lost market share, and the rest low margin business which Magnet got out of.
Mr Foulkes attacked excess capacity by closing shops and factories, until
today Magnet has 230 outlets, and four factories. The factories are
currently working at only 60 per cent of capacity, supplying 75 per cent of
Magnet's stock.
He concedes that despite his efforts, which have returned the business to
break-even, there is still more for Berisford to do.
Mr Bowkett says after six months of negotiations with Magnet's former
owners, his team has had a good look at the business and already formulated
a long list of actions to be taken.
First there is to be more cost-cutting, for instance by eliminating
unnecessary product ranges and integrating distribution. However, in the
medium to longer term there should be growth as well with the housemoving
market considered by some to be on the turn.
Mr Bowkett expects to increase market share as well. He wants to rebuild
Magnet's reputation among jobbing builders, and to attack the new
housebuilding and public sector repair and maintenance market that Magnet
had avoided.
Further, he has identified 50 places where new outlets could be opened, and
reckons they could be turning over Pounds 500,000 each within two or three
years and earn a return on the Pounds 150,000 each will cost to open.
If Berisford fails to revitalise Magnet, it will not be for a lack of ideas
or enthusiasm.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Metals group gives ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the stricken German metals, mining and industrial group,
gave ground to creditor banks yesterday, relaxing its uncompromising stance
on the DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing proposals.
Amid frantic negotiations on both sides of the Atlantic, Metallgesellschaft
reached an agreement with Norddeutsche Landesbank, the German public sector
bank which had denounced the terms.
But although the concessions wrung from the Frankfurt-based conglomerate are
to be offered to all banks, the modified proposals were not enough to win
over French banks who formed a new centre of resistance. Officials from
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks and
shareholders in Metallgesellschaft, flew to Paris yesterday afternoon to
hold talks with French creditors, including Societe Generale, Credit
Lyonnais and Banque Paribas.
Representatives of French banks gathered at Societe Generale's Paris
headquarters to outline their objections. French banks are believed to be
owed about one fifth of the near DM5bn lent by 120 banks.
Metallgesellschaft, whose shares were suspended yesterday, said it would not
be able to make a statement on the response to the refinancing plans before
Saturday. Neither the company nor Deutsche Bank would comment on details of
the concessions won by Nord LB. The original proposals envisaged a DM1.4bn
rights issue, the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible
stock and DM700m of new credit lines.
The company's willingness to make concessions represents a big shift in its
position. It had threatened to declare itself insolvent if the proposals
were not accepted in their entirety. But the Wednesday deadline slipped by
and many banks simply regarded the statement as a tough negotiating
position.
Protests focused on the terms of the debt conversion and the requirement for
bank creditors to contribute to the rights issue. Societe Generale argued
that the main shareholders, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and the
Allianz insurance group, should 'play a larger part'.

FT  14 JAN 94 / TSB pre-tax profits surge to Pounds 301m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group yesterday exhibited a solid recovery from poor lending in the late
1980s by announcing full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m, against Pounds
5m, helped by a large fall in provisions for bad debts.
The dividend for the year was increased by 20 per cent to 7.68p, against
6.4p. Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, said this restored the payout to
the level it would have reached if the bank had not frozen it in 1991 and
1992.
TSB stressed it intended to keep Hill Samuel, the merchant banking and fund
management arm which last year it indicated it might sell. Mr Peter Ellwood,
group chief executive, said TSB was investing in Hill Samuel.
Bad debt provisions in the year to October 31 fell from Pounds 597m to
Pounds 343m. The largest fall - from Pounds 334m to Pounds 112m - came in
the loan administration unit established in 1992 to run down a poor
corporate loan portfolio.
Mr Ellwood said TSB had replaced about Pounds 800m of poor assets in the
loan unit and Mortgage Express, a centralised mortgage lender, with Pounds
1bn of high quality assets, mostly by increasing mortgage lending through
branches by 25 per cent.
The bank reduced banking income to build its customer base by moving
deposits to higher interest accounts. Retail banking profits fell by 11 per
cent to Pounds 260m, although retail insurance profits rose 50 per cent to
Pounds 194m.
Strongest growth was in unit trusts, with sales of Pounds 457m, against
Pounds 109m. Mr Ellwood said this showed that although TSB's short-term
profits had been reduced by its policy on deposits it would create long-term
gains.
However, he said that the bank would have to increase the volume of business
in 1994 to sustain income growth. As competition intensified, margins were
likely to fall for both banking and life insurance products.
The bank's strong capital ratios were bolstered by retentions and a fall in
risk-weighted assets to Pounds 15.6bn from Pounds 16.9bn. The tier one ratio
of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose from 7.2 to 8.7 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 12.7p, against a 1.7p loss. Shares closed 15p up
at 267p.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong orders fail to brighten Siemens' outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, expects earnings to
fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the current financial year, in spite
of a strong flow of orders in the first quarter.
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the German group, yesterday warned
against drawing hasty conclusions from the 15 per cent rise in demand
recorded in the three months to December. Mr von Pierer based his estimate
of lower earnings on assumptions that financial income of DM2.1bn last year,
compared with about DM1bn in 1991/92, would fall. 'We cannot assume that
capital market conditions will remain unfailingly favourable.'
Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making computer business would return a
deficit of about DM300m (Pounds 117m), according to Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann,
finance director. SNI last year reduced its deficit from more than DM500m to
about DM400m. The company, which shed 5,000 workers last year, would again
be hit by plans for some 10,000 group-wide job cuts in the current year.
According to Mr von Pierer, the computer business still hopes to break even
in 1996. Officials said they expected semi-conductors, another drain on
profits, to return to the black in 1995.
Mr von Pierer rejected speculation that the departure of Mr Hans-Dieter
Wiedig as chairman of SNI was premature because of his failure to turn the
business round. Mr Wiedig, who is to hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer,
head of ABB in the US, on October 1, had told him that 10 years in data
processing was enough.
SNI was doing better than many others in the computer business, Mr von
Pierer claimed. New mid-range products had been well received. Volume sales
of personal computers had doubled, although the business was still suffering
from falling prices.
The company's problems stemmed from a culture clash when Siemens and Nixdorf
were merged in 1990. Those problems were compounded by a collapse in the
industry worldwide and by the recession, Mr von Pierer said.
Group pre-tax profit for the last financial year fell 9 per cent to DM2.9bn
and net income increased marginally to DM1.98bn.
During the first quarter of the new year, foreign orders rose 33 per cent to
DM13.2bn, but only 8 per cent when adjusted for the distorting effects of
booking large Asian contracts and for the inclusion of the Osram Sylvania
lighting business in the US. The domestic order book, heavily dependent on
public contracts, fell by 6 per cent to DM8.2bn.
Details of new orders booked for the last financial year, which were
released yesterday, showed clear signs of the recession and of reduced
government spending, particularly in Germany. Demand for public
communications, the group's biggest single business, fell 7 per cent to
DM13.4bn after rising by 10 per cent the previous year. The KWU power
generation division booked an increase of only 1 per cent.
However, fast-growing businesses, such as private communications and railway
operations, showed increased orders of 15 and 25 per cent respectively.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Reuters to take over Citicorp arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the UK-based business information and news group, is to
expand in the global equity markets by acquiring the struggling Quotron data
service business from Citicorp, the US banking group.
The deal signals the end of Citicorp's ambitions to expand into information
services, a business it once said would become as profitable as any of its
banking operations. Quotron provides quotes, news and analysis of equities
to professional investors and brokers in the US. A lack of investment by
Citicorp has led to a decline in its business in the years since it was
bought in 1986. The bank yesterday put the number of Quotron screens now in
use at 'more than 40,000', a fall from 80,000 in 1986.
However, the acquisition increases Reuters' share of the global equity
market to about 20 per cent - slightly behind Automatic Data Processing of
the US.
Quotron has made losses since Citicorp bought it for Dollars 680m eight
years ago. It lost Dollars 33m in the first nine months of last year,
compared with Dollars 40m in 1993. The bank recognised the extent of the
disaster at the end of 1991, when it wrote down its investment in Quotron by
Dollars 400m. Its decision to write off another Dollars 179m demonstrates
even that was too optimistic. Reuters said Citicorp had agreed to underwrite
certain operating costs in connection with the deal, which was conditional
on due diligence.
Quotron's screens have all but disap peared from the desks of the US's large
national stockbrokers. Last year it lost the accounts of both Dean Witter
and Kidder Peabody, which between them had accounted for some 7,000 screens.
The company has been attempting to expand its position with regional
stockbrokers and smaller investment institutions.
The acquisition of Quotron was one of the earliest and boldest decisions of
Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, who argued at the time that the bank should
seek to benefit from the expansion of financial information services.
The company was chosen in 1991 to build and operate a foreign exchange
trading system designed to attack Reuters' dominant share in that market.
That project, known as EBS and backed by several of the biggest foreign
exchange trading banks, will remain with Citicorp.
The terms of the sale were not disclosed. The amount paid by Reuters will
depend in part on Quotron's success in retaining its customers.
Reuters shares rose 28p to 1853p as analysts welcomed the deal.

FT  14 JAN 94 / LWT in talks with American suitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television is talking to a North American group which
proposes to take a stake of slightly less than 30 per cent in the ITV
company. LWT is trying to fend off a hostile bid from Granada, the
television, rental and leisure group.
If the talks lead to a deal, it could transform the battle for control of
LWT because senior managers own 10 per cent and have said they will not
sell.
It is believed the potential North American suitor's plan would be to hold
the stock for a relatively short time while other potential international
media investors, already lined up, carry out due diligence.
All the signs are that LWT is trying to put together an international
alternative to its defunct plan for a takeover of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
Time is short for LWT because Granada has extended its offer of six shares
for every five - worth nearly Pounds 700m - to January 26, and is expected
to come up with improved terms before the final closing date on February 4.
At the moment LWT is appealing to shareholders to reject the Granada offer
on the record of its management team, led by Sir Christopher Bland, and a
1993 pre-tax profit estimate of Pounds 43.8m.
Support for the LWT management came yesterday from Ms Katherine Pelly, media
analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, believed to be the first City
analyst to say unequivocally that the Granada bid should be rejected.
'The terms of the hostile bid by Granada Group for LWT do not represent the
economic and strategic value of LWT to Granada,' she argued in a research
note.
The widespread view in the City is that Granada will win the tussle, but
probably only after the terms are 'sweetened'.
The Kleinwort analyst pointed out that the offer, which on January 12 valued
LWT at 670p per share, represented an exit price/earnings ratio of 23.5
times, little more than that of Scottish Television which is not facing a
bid.
'This suggests that were the Granada bid not to be on the table, LWT shares
could be expected to trade at levels not far from the current price,' said
Ms Pelly, who added that with a cross-ownership media review under way, LWT
was one of the most attractive ITV companies.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Berisford pays banks Pounds 56m for Magnet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International yesterday announced it was buying Magnet, the
kitchen cabinets and joinery manufacturer and distributor, for Pounds 56m
from eight banks.
The purchase marks Berisford's first step in its planned transformation from
shell company to conglomerate. It also promised shareholders a dividend for
the current year, the first since 1989.
The deal brings together two of the casualties of the corporate excesses of
the late 1980s. Berisford, then a property and commodities group, nearly
failed under Pounds 1.4bn of debt but has since sold assets, including
British Sugar, and now has net cash. Magnet was the subject of a Pounds 629m
management buy-out in 1989 but succumbed to recession.
The deal is being financed by a one-for-two rights issue at 120p to raise
Pounds 58.7m net. Berisford shares were suspended before the announcement at
128p and will be relisted on February 1.
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said his aim was to build the
company into a 'conglomerate based on real things, not the financial
engineering of the 1980s'. Berisford was now a 'clean shell' while Magnet
was being bought free from litigation born of its past problems. Berisford
would be ready to look at a US acquisition by September 1995.
He said Magnet fitted all Berisford's acquisition criteria: operating in a
large market, with opportunities for savings and growth. It traded in a
fragmented industry, one that both he and Mr Roy Hammond, Berisford's
operations director, knew through previous roles at Boulton &amp; Paul.
Magnet had net assets of Pounds 137.7m on September 25 1993 - it broke even
in the previous six months on sales of Pounds 90.5m. It has Pounds 30m cash
and Pounds 60m UK tax losses. Mr Bowkett said the combined group would have
net assets of Pounds 220m before provisions, and Pounds 100m tax losses. It
would pay only 10 per cent tax for the foreseeable future.
Berisford came close to buying C&amp;J Clark, the shoe group, last May for
Pounds 184m. After that deal failed, Mr Bowkett called Bankers Trust, the
leading shareholder in Magnet, to reopen talks. By October the shareholders
had agreed to deal exclusively with Berisford and after lengthy due
diligence the purchase was largely agreed before Christmas.
Magnet was bought by the eight banks after its parent company, Airedale
Holdings, was put into receivership in December 1992. As well as Bankers
Trust, the banks are Bank of America, Creditanstalt Bankverein, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, Standard Chartered, Bank of Scotland, Hill Samuel and
Continental Bank. These eight were the senior lenders to the mbo.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Bundesbank fails to halt dollar rise after US retail surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bigger-than-expected increase in US retail sales last month pushed the
dollar up sharply yesterday in spite of Bundesbank intervention.
Retail sales rose 0.8 per cent last month and by 6.9 per cent in the year to
December, the Commerce Department said. Most economists had expected a
December rise of only about 0.3 per cent and the figures caused economists
to revise upwards their estimates of US fourth-quarter economic growth.
Separate inflation figures showed a rise in the consumer price index of 0.2
per cent last month and 2.7 per cent in the year to December, roughly in
line with projections.
Many Wall Street analysts have raised their estimate of growth in the fourth
quarter to an annual rate of 5 per cent or slightly more. But most expect
growth to moderate this quarter.
Nevertheless, the figures caused the dollar to break through its 1993 high
of DM1.7480, and then breach a second key market barrier of DM1.7520. The
dollar closed in London at DM1.752, up nearly 2 pfennigs on its Tokyo
overnight level. In New York it finished at DM1.7513.
The Bundesbank's attempt to defend the D-Mark against the dollar was the
first for at least seven months, dealers said.
After rumours of Bundesbank intervention swept the European markets in the
morning, the Bundesbank bought D-Marks worth 'several hundred million
dollars', according to one dealer, in an attempt to hold the dollar at
DM1.7440.
Mr John LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said he saw little reason for an
early adjustment of monetary policy. 'The inflation outlook is favourable,'
he told business people in Boston. He predicted the annual rate of inflation
would stay in the 2.7-2.8 per cent range this year.
The Fed expected the economy to grow by 3-3.5 per cent this year after
expanding at an unsustainable annual rate of 5 per cent in the fourth
quarter, he said.
Some analysts cautioned that the retail sales figures were less robust than
they appeared, especially after adjustments for a fourth-quarter surge in
car sales.
Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs,
said the momentum of consumer demand probably slowed as the economy moved
into the first quarter of this year, despite strong figures for December
sales. Goldman predicts real economic growth will decline to an annual rate
of 2 per cent by the second quarter.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Yeltsin may speed up reform of economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The process of Russia's economic reform will continue unabated and might
even be stepped up, President Boris Yeltsin promised President Bill Clinton
in Moscow yesterday.
Reporting on the first session between the Russian and US presidents, their
third meeting in the past nine months, Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, said Mr Yeltsin was clearly 'undeterred' by the
political turmoil in Russia. He said Mr Clinton had found his opposite
number 'confident' and 'on top of his form'.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, highlighted what he described as
'the real achievements' of the reform process - such as a reduction in the
monthly rate of inflation from 30 per cent to 12 per cent, the trebling of
real wages as measured in dollars, and the halving of the budget deficit as
a percentage of national output.
Mr Clinton, under the slogan 'more reform, more support', promised to press
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to release funds 'as
rapidly as possible' to ensure that the reform momentum was maintained. He
said he was willing to act as an advocate with international financial
institutions for any subsequent Russian proposals to alleviate the social
costs of reform.
His advice to Mr Yeltsin was that there should be 'no turning back' in the
fight against inflation, and no letting up in privatisation. He also
announced a second US enterprise fund, capit - alised at Dollars 100m
(Pounds 67m), to be directed by Mr Michael Blumenthal, former treasury
secretary.
In return, Mr Yeltsin disclosed that he intended to retain the privatisation
minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais. That follows another threat by the reform
group led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, to pull out of
the cabinet en masse if reformers did not get more government posts.
Mr Yeltsin has agreed to expand the number of deputy prime ministers from
four, as announced this week, to five. Mr Gaidar and Mr Oleg Soskovets, also
a first deputy premier, are said to be certain to be confirmed in their
present posts - with the two further deputy premiers still the focus of
intense backroom struggles between the different political forces.
The fate of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the reform-minded deputy prime minister for
finance, remained in doubt. He has said he will not serve if conservatives
such as Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank head, are retained, as
seems likely. Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Chubais met the US delegation but no
meeting with Mr Gerashchenko was scheduled.
Also not invited to a reception at the US embassy last night was Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, whom Mr Christopher described as
'unfit' to meet the US president. Mr Zhirinovsky said Russia had no need of
help from the US.
Most of Mr Clinton's first day in Moscow was devoted to economic matters.

Should the Magnet case study graduate to the Bankers Trust training
programme it is unlikely to appear as one of the great trades of the 20th
century. Still, as a salutary tale for young bankers it has its merits. The
Pounds 629m valuation put on Magnet by Bankers Trust when it led the buy-out
five years ago seems unimaginable now. While most of the money has long
since evaporated, selling out for Pounds 56m must still cause a wince of
pain.
The banks have performed their traditional role of selling a business at the
bottom of the cycle, but this by no means guarantees that Magnet is a good
purchase for Berisford. There is cash in the business but most will be
required to sort out the mess. By the time the assets have been written
down, Magnet will not look so cheap. At the strategic level, no one has yet
successfully combined retail and professional building supplies operations.
The new markets which Berisford is eyeing are already occupied by fierce
competitors. Spring Ram's Regency operation may generate substantial
overcapacity in doors; MFI will keep up the heat in kitchens.
None of that will make it easier for Berisford to boost Magnet's sales and
margins. At least the standard conglomerate spring clean will yield
sufficient savings to put the operation back into profit. Shareholders will
probably back what is, at heart, a classic piece of shell company financing,
especially since the upturn will underwrite most of the risk.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 5 per cent fall in Siemens' shares yesterday is nothing compared to the
rough treatment given to Alcatel-Alsthom following its profits warning on
Wednesday. Yet Siemens now stands 9 per cent below the peak reached at the
turn of the year, which underlines how far stock market valuations have run
ahead of earnings prospects. There are bright spots in yesterday's
statement, such as the prediction that semiconductors will return to profit
by 1995 and the promise of reduced losses at Siemens Nixdorf this year. The
snag is that loss elimination will be offset by declining profits elsewhere.
Like Alcatel-Alsthom, one of Siemens' most profitable divisions is starting
to suffer as European governments cut spending on telecommunications. That
squeeze on new orders and margins is worst on Siemens' home turf. Income
from its large investment portfolio, which helped maintain profits in
1992-93, is also in decline. While the impact of lower interest rates and
bond yields is impossible to predict, though, there are signs that dwindling
investment income is spurring management to tackle the operational problems.
The promise of 10,000 job cuts this year - around 2.5 per cent of the
workforce - is a step in that direction. More of the same would help support
the shares at the lower level now established. The lingering danger for
shareholders is that Siemens feels obliged to spread the pain and cut its
dividend as well. Since the pay-out was last raised in 1990, and then only
by 50 pfennigs, a cut at this stage would be especially cruel.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of this year's intriguing themes will be whether supposedly cyclical
consumer stocks prove to be as cyclical as the market presumes. The high
savings ratio seemingly highlights the scale of latent demand. Confidence
appears to be returning, too. Rank's shares have benefited from such
optimism in the leisure sector, outperforming the market by 12 per cent over
the past year. Its annual figures contain some substance to underpin this
sentiment. The current 8 per cent gain in bookings for domestic holidays is
encouraging. Small volume gains are also being made elsewhere - even if
price rises are hard to achieve, as First Leisure noted this week.
But recovery may prove precarious with the chancellor poised to hit
consumers with more taxes. Other factors, too, may swing against Rank this
year. Rank Xerox will have to swallow its share of Xerox Corporation's
Dollars 700m restructuring charge. Jurassic Park can no longer be relied
upon to pull viewers through cinema doors. Rank's Pounds 995m debt burden
will continue to restrain any grander corporate ambitions. And the renewed
rumours that it will dispose of its stake in Rank Xerox could prove as
ill-founded as the more ambitious recovery hopes.
The tax implications of disposing of Rank Xerox would prove especially heavy
now that Mecca's acquired tax losses have been exhausted. Rank may prefer to
hang on to the asset rather than sell it to pay down its debts. But Xerox's
poor prospects in mainland Europe are another reason to expect modest
progress at Rank this year.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: TSB's tough task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The leap from Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m in TSB's annual profits is
gratifying. But it reflects more the fading impact of past mistakes than any
vindication of current strategy. Strip away the impact of lower provisions
and profits grew only 11 per cent. Factor the exceptional Pounds 70m
restructuring charge back into staff costs and operating profits would have
been flat. There is not much sign of the bancassurance concept putting
revenue on an inexorably upward track. By keeping deposit rates high, TSB is
sacrificing banking income to attract customers into its branches so that it
can sell them insurance. Lending margins will come under pressure this year
as the mortgage market becomes more competitive.
Flat operating profit is a common problem for banks thanks to the impact of
low base rates and the failure of economic recovery to restore loan demand.
That may explain the industry's renewed emphasis on shedding jobs. At least
TSB can console itself with the fact that return on capital in its retail
bank is already 20 per cent. Barring any serious upsets over pension
refunds, which have been flagged but not publicly quantified as a possible
problem, group return should rise steadily to the target 15 per cent as
problem loans wind down.
That still begs the question of what TSB should do with its surplus capital.
Yesterday's statement seemed designed to steer expectations away from a
special dividend, but the tier one capital ratio is already 8.7 per cent and
rising. Sooner or later TSB may have to choose between a share buy-back or
another risky acquisition.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Embarrassment of riches: UK banks are addressing the problem
of how to employ an unfamiliar excess of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After five years of grappling with huge bad debts, inadequate profits and
dissatisfied customers, British high-street banks face an unfamiliar
concern. They may be about to start making too much money. 'It makes me more
worried about the industry than I've been for a long time,' says one
director whose bank is moving from bad times into good ones.
Following the lean years when banks made low profits - some even lost money
 -and three cut shareholders' dividends, a cash pile does not appear the
worst of problems. But when the TSB Group yesterday reported a rebound from
breaking even in 1992 to a Pounds 301m pre-tax profit last year, it marked
the start of what could be a testing era for bank managements.
The broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd estimates that the nine biggest UK banks
will add Pounds 3.7bn to their capital this year, 10 times their retained
(after tax and dividends) profits of Pounds 369m in 1992. As bad debts fall,
a big rise in banks' income will show through. 'Banks have been huge
consumers of capital, but are becoming cash cows,' says Mr Peter Toeman, an
analyst at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker.
Some improvement appeared inevitable. Banks' profits usually rise when
economies recover because bad debts fall, and they can earn more from
lending. But the scale on which UK banks are now starting to generate cash
is greater than in the past for a number of reasons:
Managements tried to offset the unprecedented bad debts of the downturn by
raising income. They widened interest rate margins on loans, and charged
higher fees to businesses and personal customers for services such as cheque
clearing. Mr Toeman estimates that returns on assets such as loans have
risen about 25 per cent since 1989 as a result.
They have also boosted profits by shedding staff and cutting branch
networks. Barclays and National Westminster this week announced that they
plan 7,700 job losses between them on top of previous cuts. While
cost-cutting and the introduction of new technology raise short-term
profits, income may be curtailed in the long term because there are fewer
branches through which to sell products. Banks traditionally absorb excess
capital by taking on fresh loans. But there has been weak demand for loans
so far as the economy picks up. Some companies have repaid bank loans, and
replaced them with equity and debt securities. Many private customers are
wary of taking on debt. So banks may find they are holding capital without
the conventional means of employing it. Banks are inherently more profitable
as a result of shedding businesses which made inadequate returns. National
Westminster decided last year to abandon retail banking in France after it
reviewed its operations to see what return they were likely to achieve on
average during complete economic cycles. Such judgments have made banks
smaller and more profitable despite short-term costs.
For all these reasons, banks are likely not only to make but to retain more
money than in recent recoveries. As bank executives point out, this might
not be a problem in other sectors. 'When industrial companies have cash,
people view it as a war chest, a sign of strength,' says Sir Nicholas
Goodison, chairman of TSB Group.
But banks face distinct pressures, both because of public perception, and
the constraints of the industry. First, customers may be offended by large
profits because they have become disenchanted at standards of service.
'There is a hard core of dissatisfaction with banks,' says Mr Jean
Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association.
A degree of public unpopularity may make banks vulnerable to the imposition
of windfall taxes by the government. This was done in the recovery from the
1979-81 recession when Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, then chancellor,
imposed a tax on interest-free deposits. Some bankers privately fear a
repetition. 'Our profits are particularly emotive,' says one chief
executive.
Second, banks with capital to spend are at risk of losing more money than
other types of company if their investments turn sour. Banks are allowed to
lend about 20 times their capital, using money from their depositors and
money markets. This means that if a banking venture goes wrong, they stand
to lose not just their own investment, but up to 20 times that amount. Thus,
shareholders tend to be worried if their banks acquire excess capital.
Third, well-capitalised banks may try to lend more despite weak demand. This
will lead to competition that could push down margins on lending, and erode
fees. There is already evidence of falling margins on loans to large
companies, and some banks have frozen small business charges this year.
Finally, the more capital a bank has, the harder it is to achieve good
returns on it. Banks have adopted returns on equity as their main measure of
profit. Barclays is aiming for a 15 per cent after-tax return, and NatWest
for a return of 17.5 per cent. The targets are testing in an era of low
interest rates.
These factors will militate against banks holding excess capital. The
problem is defining the right amount. Banks must have at least a 4 per cent
ratio of core capital - mostly equity and reserves - to risk-weighted
assets. But ratios of 7 per cent are common in the US. 'Four per cent has
become old hat,' says Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive.
Most banks are rebuilding capital lost as a result of bad debt problems, and
are yet to reach the core capital-to-assets ratio of 6 per cent which most
industry experts now regard as reasonable. Even after reaching that point,
the size of losses from bad debts in the last recession - four times that of
previous cycles - could make them anxious to retain capital.
'We face a lot of uncertainty. The view that the world is now a smooth and
easy place is not the only one,' says Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief
executive. Yet banks cannot simply sit indefinitely on their cash. 'Banks
with too much capital may be able to tough it out for a couple of years, but
they will have to do something eventually,' says Mr Ian Harley, Abbey
National's finance director.
Banks will then have three options. One is to return cash to shareholders.
Royal Bank of Scotland sent a signal a month ago by raising its
shareholders' dividend for last year by 25 per cent. The expectation that
dividends will rise substantially over the next two years is one reason for
the sharp rise in banks' share prices last year.
Raising dividends too ambitiously would be risky because they might have to
be cut again in the event of another recession. Some bank directors muse
about returning cash in ways that would not have to be repeated, such as
buying back shares. Others look askance at such ideas. 'When I talk about
giving money back, everyone looks at me as if I am completely mad,' says one
director.
A second way of using capital would be for banks to invest in their existing
businesses. NatWest and Barclays, for instance, have a target in their
investment banking arms in south-east Asia and the US. Banks concentrating
on retail banking in Britain could invest in technology and branch
improvements.
The third possibility is to take over a rival. Many bankers believe there
are too many financial services companies competing for custom in the UK.
Lloyds tried to take over Midland on these grounds in 1992. As banks
generate capital, they will have the capacity to buy each other or take over
life insurers, for example.
But the process of consolidation is not assured. Banks made costly errors in
their last buying spree in the 1980s when they acquired foreign banks which
lost money. Mr Chris Ellerton, an analyst at S G Warburg, the stockbroker,
says they are likely to be cautious about purchases that do not bring clear
benefits. 'The scars of the last mistakes have not healed yet,' he says.
The target returns on capital which banks have adopted mean they could find
it difficult to find appealing acquisitions. They could thus be left with
capital for which they have no obvious use. After the lean years, this may
seem like a pleasant challenge. But it could become an unwelcome problem
before too long.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Return to the family: Two Hong Kong residents looking
forward to China's takeover in 1997 talk to Simon Holberton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Dr H. Y. Lee, 53, the discovery of his Chinese roots came late in life.
In Beijing two years ago, he was awed by the historical monuments and by
walking among what he calls 'real Chinese'.
'I just felt really proud to be Chinese; I was among my people,' he says.
Mr Tsang Yok Sing's epiphany occurred much earlier, in 1966, during his
first visit to Guangzhou (Canton), southern China, to meet his family. He
was 19. 'It was love at first sight,' he recalls. 'I talked to older people
and to younger ones like me. They were all inspired by some higher goals
that were simply lacking in Hong Kong.'
Both men live in Hong Kong. By character they are very different - Dr Lee, a
medical doctor educated in England, is conservative by instinct, while Mr
Tsang chairs the 'pro-Beijing' Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong. But they are both looking forward to the end of British rule and
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
Uniting them is a shared ethnicity and nationalism. With the hand-over
approaching, voices such as Dr Lee's and Mr Tsang's are becoming louder,
signifying an apparent change of mood among Hong Kong's predominantly
Chinese population.
As Governor Chris Patten continues his brinkmanship with China - Hong Kong's
Legislative Council is currently debating his proposals for democratic
reform and he will discuss the confrontation with UK Prime Minister John
Major in London next week - the ground is shifting beneath his feet.
Both Dr Lee and Mr Tsang illustrate the divided loyalties of many Hong Kong
Chinese - not so much between the Chinese and UK governments, but between
the values of a China still ruled according to feudal traditions and western
ideas such as the importance of the individual.
Mr Tsang, for example, would not necessarily make a good Beijing communist:
he is keen on argument and discussing ideas and, unlike the typical Beijing
mandarin who is suspicious of debate, he does not think that political
disagreement need lead to turmoil.
Nevertheless, his anti-colonial instincts are clear. 'For people like me it
is always exciting to think about the end of colonial rule,' he says.
'There has been a lot of change in the way the government rules Hong Kong
and the way white people behave, but in my adolescent years - when one is
most sensitive to injustice - I had an unpleasant impression of white
people, especially British people. They belonged to the upper class. As for
the Chinese upper class, they lived in English ways and spoke in English.
When I was growing up it was impossible to have equality between the English
and the Chinese.'
Mr Tsang's objections to British rule have fuelled his Chinese nationalism
to such an extent that he does not perhaps appreciate the irony of his
affection for modern China, where a person's status in society and class are
still important.
On his first visit to Guangzhou, Mr Tsang, educated at Hong Kong University,
felt part of the Chinese nation. It was 'a feeling of belonging to this vast
country; it was a strange and pleasant feeling.
'This doesn't mean that I'm entirely happy with what has been happening in
China, or that I think the Chinese government will be better than the Hong
Kong government . . . But to me that is secondary; for better or for worse,
China is our country.'
Dr Lee would sympathise with many of Mr Tsang's views; but his attitudes to
1997 betray the ambivalence of most Hong Kong Chinese. For instance, he
dislikes the idea of British rule, but appreciates its emphasis on justice
and its relative lack of corruption. He sees the impersonal system of
English law as superior to the Chinese method of resolving conflict, usually
through personal connections and the payment of money.
At the same time, his cultural identification is with China. That does not
mean he likes the Chinese government, but for him 1997 means the end of the
domination of Hong Kong by the gweilos (a derogatory term for foreigners).
'This doesn't mean the gweilos didn't do a good job, but the feeling is that
Hong Kong will be ours. It's not that I like the communists, but they've got
the same colour skin.'
Dr Lee, who hopes to open a clinic in China this year, has found much to
dislike about China since his first visit. 'I hate doing business there.
Guanxi (connections) is so important and I hate that. But as a Chinese I
look forward to being part of China.' His fear is that corruption will
spread in Hong Kong after 1997. He comforts himself with the thought that he
is not a 'big timer' and that corruption might not permeate to his level.
But he says: 'You have no redress; that is the sad part about China.'
Dr Lee's hope is that Hong Kong, in the way a child might influence a
parent, will have a positive influence on China's development.
But for him the 1984 Joint Declaration between Britain and China provides
little guarantee post-1997. 'The Chinese interpret any document in their
favour in any argument they are going to win,' he says. But then he adds:
'Maybe the son can influence the father. Hope, hope, hope.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, Mr
Clinton has finished the trade agenda he inherited. This is a great
achievement. But now he must draw up his own. The signs so far are worrying.
He seems to be dedicating his country to distorting trade, where it will not
merely end up restricting it.
One part of the Clinton agenda already in effect is its approach to the
opening of Japanese markets. The objective is right. But the administration
is proposing the wrong instrument and the wrong procedures.
American policymakers protest that the quantitative indicators they propose
are neither targets nor of benefit to US exporters alone. They protest too
much. The semiconductor pact has shown that an indicator is a target by
another name. Similarly, the Japanese are bound to satisfy US producers
first, because they are the most powerful. Since cartelisation and
administrative guidance are needed for Japanese industry to deliver the
demanded results, the US administration is also, in effect, calling for
reregulation and deregulation at the same time.
What is wrong with the chosen procedures is that they are unilateral. If US
policymakers are confident they can prove that the Japanese cheat, they
should bring their complaint to a multilateral forum. As it is, they have
agreed to the creation of a world trade organisation within the Uruguay
Round settlement, but are managing their most important trade relationship
bilaterally. Faced with yet another contradiction, the Japanese must wonder
why occidentals are so inscrutable.
Distorting trade
If this approach to Japan threatens to distort trade, the emerging US agenda
for post-Uruguay Round trade negotiations may end up by simply restricting
it. Mr Clinton suggested this week that environmental protection, anti-trust
regulation and labour standards should be at the top of the agenda.
International agreement on competition policy is needed, particularly if the
cancer of anti-dumping is to be brought under control. But the other
suggestions could easily become excuses for outright protectionism. The
question of desirable standards is far more complex than most western
lobbyists and governments are prepared to admit.
Consider the environment. It is untrue that trade necessarily harms the
environment, that all countries ought to have the same environmental
regulations, that differences in environmental regulation are bound to
create unfair competititive advantages, or even that the chief global
environmental threat is posed by the development of poorer countries. US
policymakers and lobbyists would do well to remember, for example, that the
profligate 15 per cent of humanity emit far more greenhouse gases than do
the remaining 85 per cent.
Labour quagmire
Labour standards are an equally sticky quagmire. It is not true, for
example, that wages are low in China because of exploitation, but because
the country remains dreadfully poor. It is not true that wages in high
productivity factories should be far higher than elsewhere, because it is
their profits that fuel rapid development. It is also not true that sensible
minimum labour standards would eliminate the competitive threat supposedly
posed by cheap labour. Remember, above all, that high minimum wages are of
no benefit to the hundreds of millions of unemployed, while laws against
child labour are of no help to children who would otherwise starve.
The danger is that this supposedly high-minded agenda would punish the poor
for their poverty. The side agreements on labour and the environment in
Nafta do little to assuage that fear. Consider, for example, the fact that
participants may not lower any standards, however inappropriate and costly
they may turn out to be. Yet it is these agreements which are the model that
the administration seems to want to spread throughout the world.
What the Clinton administration's agenda lacks is a commitment to
liberalisation. It seems to see the emerging global market economy as a
threat to be curbed, not an opportunity to be exploited. International
standards will form part of the trade agenda. But they must be only a small
part.

Any offers for a second-hand ship from Greenpeace? Jeffrey Woodhead, of
shipbrokers Derrick Holdings, hopes to get as much as Dollars 800,000 for
the 18-year-old good ship Gondwana, which he says has had only two careful
owners.
They may have been careful; but let's consider under what conditions. Before
Greenpeace, the Gondwana, which has an ice-resistant hull, belonged to the
Swedish coastguard, so it probably saw risky duty chasing Soviet submarines.
As for Greenpeace, its vessels spend a good deal of time engaged in highly
dangerous activities, pursuing whalers and ships dumping toxic waste - that
is when they are not being sunk by the French secret service. Still, think
of the brownie points for political correctness; an anti-communist and
ecologically sound ship.

<TEXT>
If, as seems increasingly likely, the 'ring of steel' around the City of
London is made permanent, we know who to blame - Stani Yassukovich, the
former Euromarket star whose current hobby-horse is the City Research
Project.
Yassukovich, former chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, was explaining how
best to improve the UK sterling money markets yesterday when a hack bowled
him a low ball. Why was the City's cordon still in place?
Yassukovich had no hesitation in admitting that he was a permanent cordon
fan. Apart from the fact that many international banking pals liked the
roadblock idea, it has also done wonders to speed up his own journey to the
City from his home in west London.

Nice to see that some of those most responsible for fouling the English
language - US academics - are doing their bit to clean up the mess.
The Chicago Tribune tells us that staff at Lake Superior State University
have published their annual list of solecisms. The exercise is conducted in
order to tidy up language by banishing words and expressions that have been
misused, overused or generally proven useless.
First on the hit-list is 'politically correct'. The phrase 'mother of. . . '
also gets short shrift. 'Paradigm' is also out - 'while it is all the buzz
among jargon makers in Washington, the rest of the country hasn't yet
figured out what it is supposed to mean'.
Which surely makes it an ideal word for politicians everywhere?

<TEXT>
The old cliche about leftwing youth growing up into rightwing middle-age
rings true with Roger Rosewell, spokesman for Dame Shirley Porter, former
Conservative leader of Westminster council.
The Dame herself was unhelpfully abroad yesterday, thus avoiding the
immediate flak over her time as council leader. Rosewell kindly stood in.
He has an interesting pedigree. Back in the early 1970s he was industrial
organiser of the extreme leftwing International Socialists - now the
Socialist Workers' party - and steered its activities in various industrial
disputes, including local government.
Rosewell decided the dictatorship of the proletariat wasn't for him and
abandoned the IS around 1974. In 1981 he surfaced with a pamphlet for Aims
of Industry - the rightwing pressure group - attacking industrial
subversion.
Besides being the Dame's mouthpiece, he also writes for the Daily Mail
newspaper, does PR work and sits on the board of a cable TV company; so he's
still communicating with the masses after all.

Poor Romano Prodi. The chairman of Italy's IRI state holding company, which
among other things runs Alitalia, this week had the indignity forced on him
of having to fly by another airline. British Airways took him from Heathrow
to Rome. Almost all flights of Alitalia - which the Brits helped establish
after the second world war - were grounded because of a pilots' strike.
The BA captain couldn't resist inviting passengers to fly BA again, to be
sure of a reliable service. Prodi was not amused. But he might be smiling
soon; rumours are again flying of an equity link between BA and the troubled
Italian carrier.

Greg Hutchings's Tomkins, like most acquisitive conglomerates, wants to be
taken seriously. It's realised that if this involves strengthening an
in-bred board with a few non-execs, then so be it. After all, Lord Hanson,
who taught Hutchings deal-making, has added a few trophy names to Hanson's
letterhead.
Yesterday Hutchings recruited Jim Butler, who looked after the Lonrho audit
for KPMG Peat Marwick; David Crowe, a former senior partner of Gouldens,
Hanson's lawyers; and Lionel Stammers, just retired after 29 years with BTR.
All three in their various ways know what makes a conglomerate tick and will
be listened to at Tomkins, which is more than can probably be said for some
of Hanson's non-execs.
When will BTR, always jostling with Hanson for the title of Britain's
biggest conglomerate, follow suit? Now that Sir Owen Green has retired as
chairman there shouldn't be any problem about bringing in a few outside
faces.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Using the foetus to treat infertility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Yuk factor' has become the first catchphrase of 1994 in British newspapers.
It does not refer to politicians' private lives, but to the latest
developments in birth technology. People are supposedly saying 'yuk' to
grannies giving birth in their 60s, black women choosing white babies and,
above all, to the potential use of eggs taken from aborted foetuses for
treating infertility.
This may indeed be a natural first reaction to the prospect of removing the
ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in a test tube, fertilising them
with sperm and implanting them in the uterus of a woman whose own eggs are
defective. The public is still squeamish about any medical use of foetal
tissue - for example to treat Parkinson's disease - and it is easy to put
people off the idea of creating a baby whose genetic mother was aborted.
However, initial distaste should not be allowed permanently to block
development of a technique that could help many thousands of infertile
couples, who typically have to wait three to five years to receive eggs from
adult donors. (Giving eggs is an arduous process involving powerful drugs
and an operation.)
Opponents of new birth technologies argue that women have no God-given right
to bear children. But infertility is certainly a painful affliction, even if
it is not a disease in the conventional sense. Although fundamental moral
objections can be raised both to abortion itself and by deduction to any
manipulation of a rejected foetus, these cannot be decisive in a country
such as the UK, where abortion is legal under some circumstances. At the
crudest level of argument, it is surely better to make medical use of foetal
material if possible, than just to throw it into the hospital incinerator.
Moral issues
In the UK, the body responsible for regulating birth technologies is the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is admired worldwide.
Its members, derived from professional and lay backgrounds, are responsible
for assessing the many subtle moral and practical issues which arise.
One widespread concern is that a child could suffer psychologically from the
knowledge that its genetic mother was, in effect, an aborted foetus.
However, it is not difficult to imagine that the circumstances facing such a
child might be easier to accept than those of an adopted child who was
'rejected', for whatever reason, by both biological parents.
Another minefield will be obtaining informed consent - an essential part of
current donor programmes. Who should give consent on behalf of an aborted
foetus? Just the woman having the abortion? Or should the father of the
foetus have a say (if his identity is known) on the grounds that his genes
should not be passed on to future generations without his knowledge?
Medical decisions
The HFEA will also wish to ensure that women are not encouraged in any way
to have an abortion - or, perhaps more likely, to respond to pressures to
delay the operation so as to give the foetal ovaries more time to develop in
the womb. Medical decisions about the abortion itself must be kept strictly
separate from the procedure for seeking consent to use foetal material in
research or treatment.
The HFEA's record suggests that, if it decides in principle that foetal
ovaries can be used to treat infertility, it will be able to devise a
practical framework in which clinics can operate. The real obstacles would
then be scientific. Although the technique has worked in laboratory animals,
researchers still need to show that there is no excess risk of congenital
abnormality from using eggs from a foetus instead of an adult donor. That
means understanding better the factors that control the decline in egg
numbers from more than 1m in the foetus to less than 100,000 in a fertile
woman; if the body naturally discards inferior eggs during childhood, it
could be dangerous to use foetal ovaries.
Subject to these legal and scientific safeguards, researchers should be
allowed to develop foetal egg donation. If they succeed, the technique will
eventually join the armoury of accepted treatments that aroused distaste
when they were first mooted, including organ transplants and test-tube
babies.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Italian job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story so far: Britain's genteel form of corruption was described in this
space on Tuesday as a collection of 'wholly legal Italian practices'. In a
letter published in the FT yesterday Mr Antonio Armellini asked whether this
implied 'that corruption and impropriety are by definition connected to the
idea of Italy and things Italian'. Well of course it did. We all know the
disquieting features of Italian political life. The good news is that the
peninsula's voters have shown over the past year that they reject
single-party government and its consequences. The British electorate has not
been so perspicacious.
As Mr Armellini suggested, no country has a monopoly of rectitude. The
charge that president Clinton, when governor of Arkansas, did special
favours for a bank and benefitted from a deal in land speculation is
unproven, but the proposition that the US polity has often been soiled by
corruption is incontrovertible. The English are no different. They have,
however, been peculiarly adept at hiding their moral turpitude behind lace
curtains of outraged innocence. Italy is therefore owed an apology. Here
goes: various British political practices now being alleged or revealed
would bring a blush to the cheeks of any honest Italian.
Now read on: The indictment of Britain's party of government is becoming
serious. On Wednesday Lord Howe, who should know better, whinged about the
rules of the Scott inquiry into allegations of morally challenged behaviour
by Conservative ministers over the sale of arms to Iraq. The distinguished
former foreign secretary intimated that Lord Justice Scott's findings might
well be disregarded. Those who had already appeared before the inquiry, and
others watching from outside, were 'bound to be less enthusiastic to accept
the conclusions'.
That would be troubling enough, but it is not the whole charge-sheet.
Yesterday the Tories, who for many years appeared to regard Westminster city
council as naturally theirs to rule, were accused of what amounts to
vote-rigging. This devastating blow was struck by a report from the district
auditor, Mr John Magill, published in summary form. Mr Magill made a
statement containing the 'provisional' conclusion that Westminster sold
public housing in a manner that was 'influenced by an irrelevant
consideration, namely the electoral advantage of the majority party'. In his
view the council was engaged in gerrymandering, 'which I am minded to find
is a disgraceful and improper purpose . . .'
To be fair to the individuals concerned, this is not a verdict of guilty
after a hearing in court. Due process has yet to be completed. The outcome
cannot be prejudged. Yet the accusations alone will further damage the
Conservatives' attempt to project their party as the arbiter of the nation's
morals. Recent tittle-tattle about whose trousers have been found around
whose ankles is politically insignificant when set against this sort of
statement, provisional or otherwise. The Scott inquiry and Mr Magill's
report may in time be characterised by historians as glimpses of the kind of
rot that might set in when one party holds office for longer than its
natural shelf-life.
That said, it must be conceded that Lord Howe's protest is not wholly
without merit. His principal objection appears to be that Lord Justice Scott
acts as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge'. So he does, but this
would not be astonishing in a French court, where the inquisitorial
procedure is preferred to the adversarial.
Again, the inquiry is not a criminal trial. All that Lord Justice Scott can
do at the end of the day is point a finger, possibly at individual
politicians and certain officials. He can say that so-and-so misled
parliament, or improperly signed document immunity forms, an action that
might have led to an unjust outcome to the Matrix Churchill trial.
If he reaches that sort of conclusion - and he may not - some careers may be
damaged, but the alternative might have been the addition to the proceedings
of many delays and mountains of legal fees. In any event, it was the prime
minister himself - who appears before Scott on Monday  - who chose the form
of the inquiry. Its rules were agreed in Whitehall, perhaps before certain
ministers became worried about the possible outcome. Their alarm is what
should give us the greatest confidence in the Scott procedure.
Yet it would be wrong to be pious about this. Britain earns its living by
selling arms, and its secretive bureaucrats find no difficulty in tying
themselves into philosophical and terminological knots to protect both the
industry and their own flexible sense of right and wrong.
This has long been true. In 1935 and 1936 a Royal Commission on the Private
Manufacture of and Trade in Arms sat for 22 public sessions. It produced a
unanimous report broadly favouring greater governmental control over the
arms industry. Shortly after publication, the report was quietly buried. It
is an instructive little fable, recounted by David G. Anderson in the
January 1994 issue of the Journal of Contemporary History. 'Sir Thomas
Inskip, the minister for the co-ordination of defence . . . thanked the
commission for its hard work . . . and promptly sent the report to a
bureaucratic resting place . . . ,' writes Mr Anderson. Those who,
fortunately, favoured rearmament in view of the threat from Nazi Germany
could tell themselves that they were right to protect the munitions industry
from a well-meaning committee of honourable persons.
The days when such things could so easily be kicked into touch are, however,
gone. It is not possible to avoid the political effect of regular accounts
of appearances before Lord Justice Scott, or to wish that his lordship had
not been appointed to do the job he has been given in the manner that he is
undertaking it. The same irrevocability applies to the Westminster affair.
However innocent the individuals named by Mr Magill may be, however
provisional his findings, the effect on the Conservatives of yesterday's
news cannot be erased from the public consciousness. Crying 'sub judice' and
hoping the whole nightmare will go away for a few more years will not
achieve that. One more British delusion, that ours is the country of the
righteous and the incorruptible, is rapidly being destroyed.

Sir, Returning from Florence, I was able to peruse Haig Simonian's report
('Inquiry stokes Italian political fires', January 10) on the latest in
Italian politics, over which my friends there had been shaking their heads
in apology for 'un momento delicato per l'Italia'.
Sensing they felt Italy was showing badly in comparison with Britain, I
reassured them. Taking Iraqgate as the most recent example, I explained
that, whereas their politicians went in for flagrant illegality, the
approach of ours was merely more hypocritical - a British characteristic
they immediately recognised. Rather than flout an inconvenient law,
Britain's politicos change - or at least bend - it.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private rail operators will compete
with low fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER FREEMAN, MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported a BR manager's claim that there is a threat to discounted
fares on off-peak railway services on the new franchised passenger routes
('Rail sell-off threatens to limit scope of discount fares', January 13).
BR will have no part to play, however, in the setting of franchised service
discount ticketing levels except where it wins a franchise itself. The new
private sector operators will be extremely keen to attract the maximum
number of passengers to their routes. As has been the experience in other
transport fields, they will not achieve that by raising prices but by
offering their own discounts to tempt new passengers.
If BR finds it commercially sensible to offer discounted tickets, which it
does at present without any compulsion, you can expect the private sector to
be even keener.
A balance has to be struck between the convenience of commonly priced
inter-available tickets and the possibility of a wider choice of differently
priced services. Inter-availability and common pricing of tickets will
normally be a requirement of franchise agreements for season and full-fare
standard and first-class tickets on shared routes.
Discounted travel, even now, does not offer unrestricted travel. Off-peak
fares attract their own conditions limiting travel to particular trains,
days and times. The present success of Apex fares shows that many passengers
are prepared to accept restrictions on their time of travel to benefit from
cheaper fares, and I am sure that such passengers will benefit from allowing
operators to compete for their custom with discounted fares.

Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging', while accepting that my
argument for a statutory regulator has merit, concludes that we should

right.
There is no difference between us over the requirement for effective
regulation or over the necessity for public confidence in the eventual
structure. But those objectives are unlikely to be attained unless we
institute the best form of regulation we can devise. This is not
'foot-dragging' as you suggest but a genuine effort to do what is in the
best interests of consumers.
When a structure is finalised, Standard Life will work within that structure
to make the best of what we are given. In the meantime, I shall continue to
argue for getting it right rather than for just going with the tide.

Sir, Your leader, 'An end to foot-dragging' (January 12), proposes that I
may underestimate the challenge facing the insurance industry. Your
proposition astounds me.
It is precisely because I recognise the need for the industry to eliminate
bad sales and marketing practices - in the common interest of the consumer
and reputable life offices - that I reject as unworkable the current
proposals for reform on the basis of the Large report and Personal
Investment Authority.
For some 18 months now, the Prudential has argued that such is the wholly
unsatisfactory state of retail financial services regulation that the
experiment of 'self-regulation within a statutory framework' be admitted a
failure by the appropriate authorities. We advocate the appointment of an
independent committee of inquiry chaired by a senior judicial or legal
figure with an unrestricted brief to redefine the objectives of saver
protection and the statutory and institutional framework best suited to
achieve that.
Each day that passes confirms us in our view that the only likely way to
achieve those acceptable standards of protection due to the nation's savers
is by such a route, which implies single-tier statutory regulation with
direct accountability to Parliament.

Sir, Your article, 'Foreign investment projects in Hungary top Dollars 3bn'
(November 23), concludes that by June 1993 Hungary received Dollars 3bn in
foreign investment. In fact, Hungary received Dollars 5.5bn for the period
examined in the UN study referred to. The study itself pointed out that the
two sets of data used were not strictly comparable; and neither were the
valuation methods used.
You also stated that Germany is the largest investor in Hungary. This is not
so - the US is in that position. The comparative data in the study show
that, on an absolute basis, Hungary is the undisputed leader in attracting
foreign investment to central Europe. Foreign investment is an important
element in Hungary's transition to a market economy and industrial
restructuring, and the government has taken a number of steps to attract
international business to the country.

his review of Swedish attitudes to membership of the European Union,
understates the party political dimension of the debate in Sweden. The
decline in support for the 'Yes' campaign has taken place primarily among
Social Democrat supporters confused by the party leadership's decision to
await the outcome of the negotiations before formally campaigning for
membership.
I, too, have stood in the snow and dark of Arctic farms in Norrbotten and I
have no doubt that the European Union will accept the case for continued
regional and social subsidies. With the successful conclusion of
negotiations on March 1, I have every hope that the Social Democrat party
will overcome its tactical coyness and will campaign in public for the
membership to which its leaders are privately committed.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Bottom of the barrel: The diverse effects of low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conflicting consequences of low oil prices are apparent in scenes being
played out daily along US highways.
Motorists are counting the savings from a slide in wholesale petrol prices
to just 45 cents a gallon, the lowest in five years. But those travelling
through the 'oil patch' - parts of the Midwest and Texas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana and California - see another picture.
Thousands of 'nodding donkeys' - the 'stripper' wells which produce a few
barrels of oil a day - have long been a common sight in the region. But as
world oil prices have fallen over the past year from about Dollars 20 a
barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend to about Dollars 14 a barrel, hundreds
of donkeys have stopped nodding - they have become uneconomic and inactive.
Many more may soon be idle.
The impact of falling prices on marginal US oil production is such that
small US oil companies last month invoked national security concerns when
they asked President Bill Clinton to limit oil imports. But the oilmen may
get short shrift from an administration enjoying the macro-economic tonic of
low oil prices.
It is no surprise that consuming countries are winners from low oil prices
while producers feel the pain. For the US, a big importer and a leading
producer, the short-term benefits of low prices seem to outweigh longer-term
damage to its declining oil industry. Lower prices are putting downward
pressure on US inflation while economic growth is accelerating, thus helping
to stave off higher interest rates.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculates the US
is the biggest beneficiary among industrial countries of declining energy
import prices, evident in improvements in its balance of payments.
Japan, which imports 80 per cent of its energy requirements, will also make
big balance of payments gains. But even a 30 per cent cut in oil prices over
the past year may not be enough to kick-start the Japanese economy,
suffering from 32 months of economic slowdown and a credit squeeze.
The impact on the UK, a net exporter and big consumer of oil, seems
positive. While export earnings will be hit, an average price of Dollars 14
a barrel for 1994 would knock half a percentage point off underlying
inflation (the rate of increase in the retail price index, excluding
mortgage interest payments), now at 2.5 per cent. This would have positive
effects on headline inflation (which includes mortgage interest payments)
and pay settlements, according to early projections by Mr Don Smith, UK
economist at stockbrokers Midland Global Markets.
But UK, continental and Japanese consumers may see few direct benefits. Dr
Robert Mabro of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies estimates the retail
price of US petrol falls by 7-8 per cent for every 10 per cent reduction in
the oil price per barrel. The decline in the UK can be as low as  1/2 per
cent because of automatic annual rises in petrol taxes.
Other European governments are also reluctant to pass on the benefits. In
Germany taxes on petrol went up by nearly 20 per cent this month. For many
European consumers falling crude oil prices simply keep prices at the pump
steady.
On a sectoral level, energy-intensive industries, such as petrochemicals,
fertilisers, road transport and airlines, have suffered in recent years, and
low oil prices should soon feed through to higher cash flows, say energy
economists.
Big integrated oil companies - such as Exxon and Shell with operations in
refining and retailing - will weather current conditions better than those
specialising in exploration and production.
'The balance sheets of most oil companies are better than the producing
countries', says one oil company economist. For his part, Dr Mabro notes
that, unlike big oil companies, producing countries 'have lost a third of
their revenues'.
PetroStrategies, the energy newsletter, estimates that Opec members'
revenues fell by 22.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year, and by
about 10 per cent for the year as a whole. One of the most vulnerable
members of Opec is Nigeria, whose oil production accounts for more than 90
per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Receipts peaked at Dollars 25bn in
1980, but this year they will be about a quarter of that, while arrears on
external debt of more than Dollars 31bn exceed Dollars 5bn.
The outlook is also harsh for Iran: every dollar fall in the price of a
barrel of oil means the loss of Dollars 1bn in receipts. The low price means
Iran's oil revenues are unlikely to have exceeded a disappointing Dollars
13.5bn last year. Iran is also behind on servicing its foreign debt of about
Dollars 30bn.
But will prices fall to the point where the benefits to consuming countries
are outweighed by instability among the main exporters?
'We all lost in 1990 with Iraq,' notes Dr Mabro, referring to the invasion
of Kuwait triggered in part by Baghdad's fear of declining oil revenues.
Ironically, the possible resumption of Iraqi oil exports is now one factor
pushing prices lower. Traders reckon that the return on to the market of as
much as 3.5m barrels a day of Iraqi oil, once United Nations sanctions
against Baghdad are lifted, will maintain downward pressure on oil prices.
Industry experts do not exclude the possibility of a temporary oil price
fall to Dollars 10 a barrel or below, but expect longer-term prices to move
upwards. Some fear they could settle in the Dollars 10-Dollars 15 range,
rather than the Dollars 15-Dollars 20 band most producers say they need.
The only country capable of pushing prices back to the latter levels is
Saudi Arabia. Although it is putting a brave face on the impact of the fall
in oil prices on its economy, there is deep anxiety in Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia was warned by the International Monetary Fund last year that it
risked longer-term damage to its economy if it did not address its budget
and current account deficits. Since then the fall in oil prices has negated
measures, such as big cuts in capital expenditure, the government drew up to
correct the imbalances. With liquid foreign exchange reserves at a modest
Dollars 7bn, the government may have to borrow substantially.
The Saudi government insists it will not resume its role as Opec's swing
producer - that is, as the member prepared to cut output to keep prices
stable - as other producers nibble away at its market share. But some
experts say only a dramatic cut in Opec production, with Saudi Arabia
bearing perhaps most of the burden of a reduction as large as 1m barrels a
day, could reverse the steep price decline.
That would certainly signal that prices were on the way up again. It might
even waken some sleeping donkeys.

<BYLINE>
   From Ms SUE LEGGATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Dowlen's imaginative interest (Letters, January 11) in greengrocers
selling pots and pans rather than fruit and vegetables indicates that he has
either not read the Which? report on insurance companies - or he simply
missed the point.
According to our investigation and letters to the Consumers' Association,
some insurance companies are refusing to cover people they consider to be
high risk for car or house insurance. The Which? report did not compare
whether one type of car would be insured against another at all, as Mr
Dowlen claims.
We hope that the rest of the insurance industry adopts a more informed
attitude.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Piano duo par excellence - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two pianists on a single concert platform, whether performing on one
instrument or two, tend to be assigned to the fringes of the musical
profession. The dazzling qualities of Yaara Tal and Andreas Groethuysen,
whose recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday formed their London debut,
helped shed new light on why this general marginalising process has come
about, and why - at least on such occasions as this - it can seem so
wastefully unjust.
The domestic background to the two-pianist performance tradition has much to
do with it (before the arrival of the gramophone, the transcription of
orchestral and operatic works for four pianistic hands was the most popular
way of disseminating them throughout the the music-loving public). But too
often, once the novelty has worn off, the concert-hall pairings of even the
most celebrated pianists can prove more enjoyable for the executants than
for the audience.
Not this time. The European reputation of this young team preceded them here
 -the Israeli Tal and the German Groethuysen have been working together for
eight years, with already six records on the Sony label to their credit. The
pleasures of listening to them on Wednesday, in an entirely four-hand,
single-keyboard programme, revealed themselves as exactly those of the best
chamber-music-making: all freak elements of muscularity, gymnastic display
and co-ordinated trickery had been purged from the experience.
These two are both superb individual artists - Tal sparkles on the higher
lines, Groethuysen's suave yet solid tones amply fill out the lower - whose
personalities and characteristics contrast and balance each other with
satisfying exactitude. As in the best chamber-musical team-work, the highest
degree of ensemble co-ordination can be taken for granted: it is always
directed outwards, beyond the frissons of the immediate moment.
They opened with a 'display' sonata (in C minor, Op. 10) by Czerny, the
Beethoven pupil and noted piano pedagogue. What might in other circumstances
have sounded merely facile and flash was here continually exquisite, bold
and charming. In Schubert's F minor Fantasia their delicacy of sculpted
phrasing and expertise in range of dynamics could perhaps be criticised for
diluting the essential ruggedness of the invention. On the other hand, it
was not wilting, languid delicacy and expertise, and it touched veins of
pathos in the music rarely even hinted.
After the interval Brahms's 16 Waltzes, Op. 39, mounted a catalogue of
melodic verve exactly tempered by rhythmic subtlety. The finale, an
unattributed transcription of Mendelssohn's C minor Piano Trio, Op. 66,
summed up every quality that had made the recital so rewarding, and added
thereto a controlled large-scale bravura that sent one out of the hall on a
cloud of happiness and elation. I cannot wait to hear this duo again.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Into the mind of Modigliani - William Packer admires
the collection of largely unknown drawings at the Royal Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life of Modigliani too often gets in the way of the work, especially a
life so tragically romantic as his - the doomed, dissolute, handsome artist,
unrecognised by the world and dead too soon. What his drawings tell us,
however, is that whatever else he was or did, he kept a clear creative
intelligence, responding critically to all that he saw about him and
resolving it into something unmistakably his own.
Last year, at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, more than 400 drawings by
Modigliani went on public show for the first time. It was certainly the
exhibition of the year, if not the decade. Paul Alexandre was Modigliani's
doctor first, then his friend. From the time of the artist's arrival in
Paris in 1906, at the age of 22, until his own departure for the war in
1914, Dr Alexandre acquired every drawing by Modigliani that he could lay
hands on. The two men never met again and Modigliani died of TB in the
January of 1920. Dr Alexandre lived on until 1968, ever cherishing the
intention of publishing his collection along with a memoir of his
relationship with Modigliani. It has fallen to his son, Noel, to realise, at
last, the paternal ambition.
The scope of the collection is the surprise and revelation, more than
doubling as it does the published canon of the artist's graphic oeuvre, and
transforms our understanding of his work overall. The Alexandre collection
now comes to London not in its entirety, but in a selection, made by Mary
Anne Stevens of the Royal Academy, of some 240 drawings.
This substantial reduction is both welcome and regrettable. Drawing is a
special and often recondite study and those 400 sheets and more of
Modigliani, the mass of them insistently repetitive, were quite enough to
daunt even the most committed of connoisseurs.
While requiring still the closest critical attention, what seemed in Venice
perhaps too severe and exhausting an exercise, should be, in London, so much
more readily accessible to a general audience. At 240 or so, nothing of the
scope of the collection has been sacrificed; and yet that insistent, testing
repetition was, for me at least, rather the point.
Swings and roundabouts I suppose.
The signal importance of the collection lies in what it tells us, in
intimate detail, of Modigliani's development in his work from the first
flowering of his talent to the period of its full maturity. It is a period
marked by what once seemed abrupt shifts and transitions, in practice as in
interest: from painting to sculpture and back to painting; from the direct
observation of the figure to an extreme stylisation, based on tribal and
classical examples, and back again. What we are now able to see and realise
 -and I must emphasise that we may do so just as well in Dr Stevens'
selection as in the full feast - is that those transitions were not abrupt
at all, but natural, consistent and inevitable, the work all of a piece.
Here is the young man, looking now at Lautrec, now at the more decorative
expressionism of the Secession, now at the harder expressionism of the
Germans, now at the symbolism of early Picasso, with his clowns and
saltimbanques. But then the image of the figure is sharpened and simplified
into something more sculptural. The form may place him close to Brancusi,
but yet these kneeling caryatids with their swayed hips and shoulders, for
all that they carry the world on their shoulders, are clearly drawn not by
invention but from the model in the studio.
Even the severest of the busts, the most rigid of the standing figures,
carry with them the sense not of the remote and abstracted image, carved in
stone, but of the living model, flesh and blood. And so it is that the
reversion back to painting, to the portraits and the spectacular late
reclining nudes, done long after Dr Alexandre had gone off to the War, come
as no surprise at all. It is rather those sculptural qualities, there all
the time, that are now the surprise.
The line dances down the contour, with the merest inflexion this way or
that. The touch is by turns light, heavy, simple, subtle, crude - so
deceptively crude. There it is, conjured out of the barest outline, the
palpable human presence in all its weight and volume and living movement.
Wonderful.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Profitable revenge for Lloyd's loser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manya Igel is the stuff of TV documentary dreams: a widow, a stranger to
this country, who was taken in by the siren voices of Lloyd's of London and
lost her hard earned Pounds 100,000. But Manya Igel is also an art dealer
and she is gaining a profitable revenge by commissioning each year a
painting which warns of the pitfalls of Lloyd's.
Last year artist Alfred Daniels painted 'The Buskers of Lloyd's' depicting
three former Names, one shirtless, in penury outside the tubular Titanic. It
quickly sold, to the wife of a Lloyd's Name for Pounds 1,650. This year
Daniels has painted 'The Corporate Rope'. Are the bowler hatted executives
of the City companies that Lloyds sees as its financial salvation propping
it up, or is the rope so frayed that it is bound to tumble? Priced at Pounds
1,800 it will be on Igel's stand at Art 94, the contemporary art fair which
opens at the Business Design Centre in Islington on January 19.
Manya Igel will also be showing such popular Establishment artists as Ken
Howard, Bernard Dunston, Diana Armfield and Mary Fedden. As she ruefully
admits 'I wish I'd put all my money into paintings. Then if the worst came
to the worst I could have got something for them.'
Art 94 gives 70 dealers the chance to discover whether the upturn in the art
market has finally arrived. Prices start at Pounds 50, but anyone spending
over Pounds 1,000 qualifies for a two flights for the price of one offer on
a Virgin Atlantic flight to the US. Virgin Communications is showing off its
art collection at the Fair, including works by Paula Rego, Tony Bevan and
Fiona Rae. The enthusiast is not Richard Branson but Robert Devereux,
chairman of Virgin Communications. Virgin now shows contemporary artists in
its Upper Class Clubhouse at Heathrow and recently sold a Glynn Williams
sculpture to David Bowie.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Brigands and violets - Ronald Crichton reviews new
productions of Offenbach and Cilea at Opera Bastille, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial scandals, robbery, law and order - the subject of Les Brigands has
an enduring relevance while Offenbach's music remains unquenchably alive.
This production by Jerome Deschamps and Macha Makeieff, made for Amsterdam
and adapted for the Opera Bastille, uses an assemblage of scraps of old-type
scenery-painted cloths, paste-board, old methods, old gags and even old
costumes from provincial theatre wardrobes. That may sound tatty, but choice
and blending have been done with such flair and affection that the result is
ravishing, colourful and witty.
The performance crackles with a cheerful vigour calculated to please all
except the stuffies who do not want theatre to be theatrical.
There are problems: most of the cast have difficulty in projecting words in
the cold spaces of the Bastille auditorium. There are two casts of
principals. I heard Georges Gautier as Falsacappa (chief bandit), Michele
Lagrange as his daughter Fiorella, Brigitte Balleys in the travesty part of
her adored Fragoletto. Pleasing, warm-voiced performances all of them, but
only about half their words came over.
Of the permanent cast the ever-reliable Jules Bastin as the chief of the
carabiniers, Ryland Davies and Daniel Galvez-Vallejo as the Spanish envoys
and Steven Cole as the impenitently unreliable cashier had more luck. The
welter of noises off and on, the abundance of picturesque livestock real and
sham, though it gave the audience enormous pleasure, did not help the
clarity, but the size of the place was chiefly to blame.
Invaluable support came from the conductor (on the night I attended it was
Louis Langree) the soul of crisp discretion in accompaniments, in able
control of the ensembles. One does not often find Offenbach revivals where
riotous theatricality is so well joined to musical quality.
What better symbol for Cilea's opera Adriana Lecouvreur could there be than
a bunch of faded violets? Much is seen and heard of this nosegay in the
libretto, based on an old piece of theatrical hokum by Scribe and Legouve,
once a vehicle for Sarah Bernhardt. The opera, first given in 1902, has
survived chiefly by virtue of two popular arias; and, as Julian Budden
neatly puts it in the New Grove Opera Guide, mainly because of the
'opportunities it affords to an experienced prima donna who has already
passed her prime'.
There is not much else. Cilea knew all the tricks but his invention is weak.
In the well-known arias he explores a genuine gift for rather flaccid
melancholy reflection. But he works his themes too hard. The ascending
phrase associated with the 'humble handmaiden' aria is heard almost as often
as its cousin in 'Depuis le Jour' in Charpentier's Louise. Most of the
comedy scenes are made out of leavings from Falstaff
Mirella Freni takes the title-role in this new production at the Bastille.
Experienced she certainly is but not, on this evidence, in decline. There
was some hard tone, but she cossets and floats the lyrical phrases with
undiminished charm and skill. Still, she hardly suggests the burning fires
of the tragedienne, rather the quiet confidence and poise of a polished,
versatile comedienne - more Marie Tempest than monstre sacre.
Peter Drovsky, singing Adriana's lover Maurizio in place of the announced
Giacomo Aragall, was effective in his forceful way except when he belted out
phrases as if he were already on the battlefield. As Michonnet, loyal and
devoted stage director, Jean-Luc Chaignaud, a baritone of whom we shall
surely hear more, did full justice to the best of the male roles.
The young conductor Maurizio Benini accompanied skilfully without spurring
the orchestra to much eloquence. Production by Jean-Luc Boutte, decor and
costumes by Louis Bercut, were economical to the point of stinginess;
Bercut's costumes on the other hand were very fine.
Les Brigands is sponsored by France Inter.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Haywood, the European affairs manager at the WDA, is
moving to the Confederation of British Industry in Wales to succeed Ian
Kelsall, its long-serving director.
At the WDA she has a team of 12 people developing and co-ordinating the
agency's policy on Europe and has been responsible for programmes to
increase the involvement of small and medium-sized Welsh enterprises in
European markets, especially by encouraging strategic alliances.
Before joining the WDA four years ago, Haywood, who is 38, worked for the
European parliament in Luxembourg and Brussels and gained a doctorate in
French politics at University College, Swansea.
She will take up the post in March. 'My aim is to ensure a strong identity
for Welsh business and industry, and I plan to further the already strong
links between CBI Wales and the WDA to achieve this,' she says.
Kelsall decided to retire last autumn after 28 years as director, during
which time he became one of the best-known businessmen in Wales. On a
half-time basis, he has since become director of Merthyr Tydfil Business
Centre, which has been set up to encourage the town's economic growth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reshaping of the Welsh Development Agency, after last year's blistering
criticism by the Commons public accounts committee, continues apace. John
Redwood, Welsh secretary, is strengthening the board with two new members,
Garel Rhys and Rhiannon Chapman.
Rhys, who holds the chair in motoring economics at Cardiff, is an expert on
the automotive industry; Redwood describes Rhys' expertise as 'particularly
significant' as the motor industry is now the largest single manufacturing
sector in the Welsh economy. Chapman was until recently director of the
Industrial Society and previously personnel director at the London Stock

They will take up their non-executive posts immediately for a three-year
term under David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over as chairman last July. Roy
Thomas, a partner in the law firm Edward Lewis Bevan Ashford, was recently
appointed as the WDA's secretary and legal director.
One post yet to be filled is that of chief executive to replace Philip Head
who resigned in October in the aftermath of the Commons committee report. He
is continuing at the WDA until his successor is appointed.

<TEXT>
Television pictures as big as a sitting room wall have come nearer reality
with the development of Home Theatre by MGM, writes Richard Rosen.
The system looks like the wide-screen TVs used in hotels, but is designed
for the home. The pixels are magnified to lessen the gaps between them and
thus eliminate the picture fuzziness of present systems. An absolute colour
is given to each pixel rather than the conventional system in which an image
is made up by the eye blending red, green and blue dots. On sale from June,
it will cost less than Dollars 1,000. AEEC (MGM licensee): US, 510 416 1259

A unique tram system powered by a rechargeable flywheel has this week been
awarded its UK patent, writes Tim Burt.
JM Parry Associates, the company which developed the system, claims it
offers a low-cost alternative to light rail systems relying on overhead
wires or electrified rails.
Local authorities in a number of UK cities have already conducted tests on
the Parry People Movers, which operate on narrow gauge tracks which fit on
to existing roadways or sidewalks. The tram cars are powered by electricity
supplied through short conductor rails along the track. At each halt, the
flywheel recharges for the next stage of the journey. JM Parry Associates:

<TEXT>
Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, this month launches what it
claims is the smallest and lightest mobile phone for the new digital
networks springing up worldwide, writes Andrew Adonis.
Weighing less than 200 grams with a special lightweight battery, the Nokia
2110 'family' offers the same basic design and features for Europe's GSM and
PCN networks, the American TDMA standard and the emerging Japanese Digital
Phone System.
It intensifies competition in the market for digital handsets, the high
price of which is one of the main obstacles to the growth of digital
networks in countries - such as the UK - with mature analogue networks.
Nokia is likely to launch the 2110 on the UK market at a price competitive
with existing Siemens and Motorola digital handsets, which retail at between
Pounds 250 and Pounds 300. Nokia Mobile Phones: UK, 480 434343.

Robots are on the march. In the US, Frost &amp; Sullivan Market Intelligence
forecasts that the robot market will double from Dollars 592m (Pounds 400m)
in 1992 to Dollars 1.2bn by 1999. Pushing this expansion of nearly 11 per
cent compound growth a year will be competitive pressures for greater
productivity and quality at lower cost.
Robots will be used increasingly to replace workers in hazardous
environments, partly in reaction to soaring medical compensation costs, and
in complex automation systems. Until now, the US has lagged behind Europe

Lionel Stammers, who resigned from BTR last month, is joining the board of
TOMKINS, another acquisitive conglomerate. Stammers, 60, is one of three
non-executives joining a boardroom which has traditionally been dominated by
executive directors.
Apart from Stammers, whose 29 years at BTR covered its growth from a stock
market minnow into Britain's ninth biggest company, Jim Butler, 64, a former
senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, and David Crowe, 54, a former senior
partner of Gouldens, the city law firm, are joining Tomkins' board on March
1.
Crowe is currently an executive director of TT Group, a small conglomerate
which, like Tomkins, was set up by a former head of acquisitions at Hanson.
Crowe's old law firm is Hanson's legal adviser.
Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, says that his three new non-execs
will bring different things to the boardroom. In Stammers' case it is his
operational skills. Crowe's legal expertise will help ensure that Tomkins
complies with the Cadbury committee recommendations and Butler will advise
on accounting standards and internal control (See Observer).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Chippendale is to head up a new insurance venture which will seek to
emulate the success of Direct Line, the rapidly growing 'direct' motor
insurer owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Royal Bank announced its plans
to launch the new company, which will specialise in sales of non-standard
motor and home policies, last November.
Chippendale, 45, has been an executive director at Provident Financial, a
successful consumer credit and insurance company, since 1989. Chippendale
held responsibility for the group's operating companies in the insurance
sector - including Halifax Insurance, a motor insurance underwriter which
specialises in women drivers, and Colonnade Insurance Brokers, a chain of
registered brokers - as well as overall responsibility for the group's
corporate development. Chippendale will work closely with Peter Wood, the
founder of Direct Line, who will be non-executive chairman of the new
company. It will be launched before the end of the year and initially will
be based in Leeds.
Wood will invest Pounds 1m and own 40 per cent of the new company, with
Royal Bank investing Pounds 1.5m to acquire 60 per cent of the ordinary
equity and a further Pounds 22.5m in preference shares.
Chippendale's appointment was announced at the Royal Bank's agm in Edinburgh
yesterday where shareholders approved with only one dissenting vote a deal
which replaces Peter Wood's controversial bonus arrangement with the bank.
Wood, who received Pounds 18m last year, is to be paid a lump sum of Pounds
17m plus a contribution of Pounds 7m to his pension. He has also bought
Pounds 7.5m worth of shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology: Making monoclonal antibodies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first step is to inject a mouse with a disease-causing agent and extract
antibody-producing cells from its spleen. These are fused in the laboratory
with myeloma (cancer) cells to make hybridomas - immortal antibody-producing
cells that grow and divide indefinitely in a fermentation tank. One
hybridoma can produce billions of clones, all producing the same monoclonal
antibodies. Such antibodies have occasionally been used on their own to
activate the body's natural cell-killing mechanism. But researchers usually
make them more lethal by linking them to a poison molecule or to a
radioactive isotope.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology: Back on track - Monoclonal antibodies are in
favour again, thanks to new approaches to their use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just 18 months ago, antibody clones made in laboratories were considered the
bane of the biotechnology industry. Known as monoclonal antibodies, they
destroy disease-causing cells by binding to targets such as cancer.
The earlier hype surrounding antibodies in the 1980s was silenced in 1992
when the US Food and Drug Administration unexpectedly refused two
biotechnology groups, Zoma and Centocor, approval for drugs based on
monoclonals, on the grounds that their effectiveness had not been
convincingly demonstrated. 'The FDA's denial gave not only monoclonals a bad
name, it gave the entire biotechnology industry a bad name,' one
biotechnology executive says.
But rumours of monoclonals' demise may, in the words of Mark Twain, have
been greatly exaggerated. Monoclonal antibodies are making a strong
comeback. Cytogen has won approval for a monoclonal antibody product for use
in imaging ovarian and colon cancer, and other antibody-based drugs -
including a cardiovascular product by Centocor and an infectious disease
diagnosis aid by Immunomedics - are in phase three trials, the final stage
before the FDA hearing.
The industry predicts that within a few years many monoclonals should be on
the market. 'We'll see a few approvals in 1995, and by 1997 there will be a
slew of new products based on monoclonals,' says Samuel Waksal, chief
executive officer of ImClone Systems, the New York biotechnology group.
Since monoclonal-based antibodies target diseases as diverse as cancer,
asthma, Aids and cardiovascular disease, the potential for new drugs is
enormous.
Monoclonal antibody research has grown up in the past few years. In the
1980s, most attention was focused on mouse antibodies.
But these gave disappointing results in humans. The body's immune system
often recognised the antibodies as foreign and attacked them, at best
rendering them ineffective and at worst causing adverse reactions.
For these reasons, mouse antibodies are probably nearing obsolescence. In
their place is a far more flexible approach.
'People have figured out much better how antibodies work, and that gives us
a lot more leeway,' explains Donaldo Drakeman, president of Medarex, based
in Princeton, New Jersey. 'We can chop them up, glue different fragments
together, create our own versions.'
One problem with the original monoclonal research, according to James
Rusche, vice-president of discovery research at Repligen in Boston, was that
companies were pursuing the wrong targets. 'Originally, the focus was on
antibodies found on solid organs like lungs and kidneys,' he says. 'But it
is hard for an antibody to get inside a solid mass like a tumour. It is much
easier to target circulating cells, those found in the blood like platelets,
T-cells or circulating cancer cells like leukaemia.'
One trend is towards the use of antibody parts, either in the form of
fragments (antibodies broken into pieces through the use of enzymes) or
single chains (antibody pieces cloned in the laboratory). Many scientists
believe that by chiselling the antibody down to the section responsible for
binding, they can get a more effective response.
'The advantage of using fragments is that they are lighter, can move faster
in the body and therefore have a faster effect,' says Rusche. 'The
disadvantage is that they have a shorter life, so you have to administer
them more often.'
Many of the antibody products now in development - such as the Aids
treatment of Medarex, also in Princeton - are fragments.
Some scientists believe the smaller pieces will be able to penetrate large
masses like tumours. 'Fragments and single chains are the best hope for
entering organs,' says Douglas Hulse, vice-president of business development
for Enzon, a biotechnology group. 'Intact (whole) antibodies are just too
bulky.'
However, sceptics point out that most fragments are also too large to
penetrate organs and tumours effectively.
Antibodies can be 'designed' for specific functions. An extra binding
capacity, for instance, can be added to produce a 'bispecific' antibody.
Many companies hold 'libraries' of different antibody designs that they
screen for various effects.
Researchers believe the trend will continue away from mouse antibodies
towards humanised or human antibodies. Mice can now be genetically altered
to produce human antibodies, and through laboratory engineering, companies
have come up with a number of hybrid 'chimerics', half-mouse, half-human.
'Intact mouse monoclonals are probably a thing of the past, but intact
humanised or human antibodies are an important new trend,' says Hubert
Schoemaker, chairman of Centocor. By humanising the antibodies, scientists
hope they will be more acceptable to the human immune system. A number of
companies - including Centocor and Genentech - are making use of chimerics
in research to fight cancer, asthma and inflammation.
At the same time, companies are trying to bring down costs through more
efficient production methods. Enzon, for example, is developing a way to
produce antibodies through fermentation. 'By eliminating the mouse part of
the equation, the cost of antibody production can be heavily reduced,' says
Hulse.
The next step in antibody research, according to Waksal of ImClone, is to
induce the body to make its own antibodies. ImClone is working on what it
calls 'anti-antibodies'. By using antibodies to mimic certain diseases, the
company's scientists hope they can induce the body to produce its own immune
response.
'The antibody would be fooled into thinking that it is a cancer cell, for
example,' Waksal explains. 'The advantage of this approach, as opposed to
constantly injecting the patient with antibodies, is that the medicine has a
longer effect, working like a vaccine against cancer.'
Most monoclonal antibody products still have a number of hurdles to clear
before they reach the market. Their short life span in the body poses
serious problems for treatment. Whole antibodies, for instance, would
probably have to be administered intravenously every few days, and fragments
every few hours. Obviously, they are not practical for any long-term
treatment.
Moreover, it is not certain how efficiently some of the new monoclonals will
bind to their targets, or whether they will cause any adverse effect in
humans. Still, scientists have a far better understanding of antibodies than
they once did, and have far more options in their development. From the dark
days of being an embarrassment to the entire industry, monoclonal antibodies
may soon emerge as a big impetus for the biotechnology sector.

FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Cicutto flies in to Glasgow for NAB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which is a subsidiary of
National Australia Bank, has appointed Frank Cicutto, a high-flyer from the
parent company, to replace Charles Love, the ceo who died just after
Christmas.
Cicutto, 43, is currently state manager for New South Wales and Australian
Territory, the largest unit in NAB, with more branches and greater assets
than Clydesdale. He took up office in Glasgow yesterday but will not move
from Sydney to Glasgow until the second half of February.
Love, who was 48, died suddenly during a skiing holiday in France. He had
been ceo at Clydesdale for little over a year having previously held senior
posts with TSB. He had recently launched a project to create two branch
banking processing centres and a telephone centre for the Clydesdale in
Scotland, a project which will involve up to 800 job losses but will not
mean closing branches.
Cicutto has been with NAB for 26 years. His recent appointments include
general manager of the group's credit bureau and head of the bank's US

FT  14 JAN 94 / Management: A bashing from Metall - Germany's two-tier board
system has been exposed by the latest corporate debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Metallgesellschaft fiasco has put the spotlight on Germany's traditional
two-tier corporate board structure as never before.
Criticisms of the system are far from new, but they have been dramatically
reinforced by the scale and unexpectedness of the losses at the country's
14th largest industrial group.
As Metallgesellschaft's 120 or so bankers yesterday deliberated whether to
bail out the deeply troubled metals, mining and industrial group with a
DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing package, the wider questions go beyond
the immediate cause of the debacle - the massive losses run up by MG Corp,
the group's US trading subsidiary. These were incurred through speculative
trading on US commodities futures markets.
The broader issue is how this could have happened given the quality of the
company's shareholders and the calibre of management on Metallgesellschaft's
supervisory board.
Nearly 60 per cent of MG's shares are owned by the most reputable names in
German finance and in-dustry: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Allianz
insurance group and Daimler-Benz, coupled with the illustrious outsider, the
Emirate of Kuwait. As is traditional in Germany, these large shareholders
are represented on the group's supervisory board - the 'aufsichtsrat', whose
legal duty under the two-tier system is to oversee the performance of the
management board (the 'vorstand').
This two-tier board system has been looked at enviously by those in the UK
and the US concerned with the reform of what is broadly known as corporate
governance - the relations between executive management and the external
shareholders and other 'stakeholders' in a corporation, such as employees.
The role of external parties such as auditors and professional advisers has
also come under scrutiny.
The supervisory board, comprising representatives of capital and labour in
equal measure - with the chairman exercising a casting vote - is responsible
for appointing executive managers, voting on major capital expenditure
projects and broader strategic issues. The management board is responsible
for day-to-day management.
In recent years the system has faced torrents of criticism from outsiders
such as Ekkehard Wenger, a maverick professor of business studies, and
Gunter Ogger, who wrote a best-selling book called Nieten in Nadelstreifen
(nitwits in pinstripes). They condemned the cosy relations between
management and supervisory boards, asking 'who supervises the supervisors?'.
Formally subject to the control of shareholders, the twin boards had become
accountable only to themselves, the critics argued. This was buttressed by
the fact that German managers, with one or two exceptions, have never faced
the threat of losing their jobs as a result of hostile takeovers.
Until now, the criticism was not taken seriously by senior managers, but the
near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, and the speed with which the problems
materialised, have challenged this complacency in a way that earlier
corporate disasters did not. The lesson is especially acute because of the
high calibre of the managers on Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board.
Since March 1993 the chairman of the supervisory board has been Ronaldo
Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank and a former finance
director of the BASF chemicals group.
His fellow board members include Gerhard Liener, finance director of
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, Henning Schulte-Noelle,
chief executive of the Allianz colossus, and Bernhard Walter from the board
of Dresdner Bank - not to mention distinguished outsiders such as Friedhelm
Gieske, chief executive of the RWE energy conglomerate, and Peter
Schuhmacher, chief executive of Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest
producer of building materials. There are also representatives from IG
Metall and IG Chemie, respectively Germany's first and third largest unions.
The quality of these managers is second to none - yet they failed
spectacularly to oversee the affairs of Metallgesellschaft, a complex group
with 258 subsidiaries generating DM27bn of turnover from many business
areas.
Part of the blame must lie with Schmitz, a cold-blooded finance expert with
in-depth knowledge of many MG core activities. He was appointed because he
was deemed the right man to curb the management style of the then chief
executive, Heinz Schimmelbusch, an Austrian with a penchant for elaborate
and risky diversification strategies.
Schmitz will not talk at present about his relations with Schimmelbusch and
the role of the supervisory board, but press reports suggest Schmitz
exercised massive pressure to force Schimmelbusch to sell off loss-making
businesses (notably the Schiess machine-tools company) and to begin a
belated process of rationalisation.
Only after Schimmelbusch came into line was his contract as chief executive
renewed for five years by the supervisory board in November. Wolfgang
Schultze, deputy chairman of IG Chemie who joined the MG supervisory board
in the spring of 1993, told the FT that at the meeting before Schimmelbusch
was confirmed in office he did not mention difficulties in the oil-trading
area.
The official Deutsche Bank line is that Schmitz acted with commendable speed
once the magnitude of the problems at MG Corp became clear, and he was
entitled to rely on statements from Schimmelbusch which later proved
misleading.
It was only on December 3 that Schimmelbusch walked the 200m from his
headquarters on Reuterweg to Deutsche's twin towers in the heart of
Frankfurt's financial district to tell Schmitz of the problems at MG Corp. A
fortnight later, Schimmelbusch was ousted, with his boardroom colleagues.
Although the severity of Schmitz's response was unprecedented, the fact
remains that the supervisory board failed to identify the lack of controls
at MG Corp as a major risk. The blame for this cannot be apportioned to
Schmitz alone or indeed to his boardroom colleagues - it highlights a
broader 'system failure'. Many German managers now believe that the
commercial ties of Deutsche, Dresdner, Daimler and Allianz to MG made it
less easy for them to be critical of Schimmelbusch's autocratic style. And
privately, they point out that for years the big bank shareholders backed
Schimmelbusch's DM8bn expansion spree, exacerbating the control problems
caused by MG's very diversity and encouraging it to take on more debt.
Just how close relations between Deutsche Bank and MG were is illustrated by
the fact that it was none other than Schmitz, wearing his corporate finance
hat, who advised on Metallgesellschaft's biggest acquisition - the DM1.5bn
purchase of the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel in early 1992.
German managers' almost paranoid concern for secrecy means it is unlikely
that many details will emerge. But as they trickle out it will become clear
that the image of the German two-tier board system is one of the main
casualties of the Metallgesellschaft affair.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Management: Time to re-engineer the manager - Now it's the
boss's turn to be shaken up by the latest business theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES CHAMPY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers have been re-engineering business processes with a passion,
tearing down corporate structures that no longer can support the
organisation. Yet the practice of management has largely escaped demolition.
If their jobs and styles are left largely intact, managers will eventually
undermine the very structure of their rebuilt enterprises.
The work of managers in a re-engineered organisation must change as much as
the work of workers. Radical changes in the tasks of workers and the
organisation of their work - the operational processes for filing orders,
serving customers after the sale, developing new products, and the like -
demand concurrent changes in management processes, such as the roles,
styles, reward systems and other 'tools' used by managers to run their
organisation.
For the past four years, I and other consultants have been re-engineering
the operational processes of our clients. But we have paid little attention
to their management processes. We now understand that managers must remake
three aspects of their jobs to keep their re-engineered operational
processes structurally sound:
Managerial roles. With the radical redefinition of work, the traditional
boundaries between leaders, managers and workers are breaking down. As work
becomes organised around core processes (for example, order fulfilment,
product development, materials acquisition), two results occur: workers add
real customer value, and they are increasingly self-managed. That puts the
fundamental role of management into question. I recently visited a company
that had structured its work around self-managed process teams. Managers
were walking the halls asking: 'What is my job?'
The answer is that it is nothing like the job they had before. No more close
supervision of workers, no more focus on data irrelevant to running the
business, no more energy spent on defending turf. The role of managers
becomes one of empowerment - providing workers with the information,
training, authority and accountability to excel in a re-engineered business
process.
One caution: this is not empowerment as traditionally advocated. Managers in
a re-engineered organisation cannot relinquish all supervision in the belief
that people will figure out their jobs and rise to the occasion. Work may be
self-managed but it is not unmanaged. Instead, managers periodically must
inspect the work, measure the performance of the process and its
contributors, and coach the workers to even better performance.
As workers take on more management tasks, managers must take on more
leadership tasks - holding a vision for the business, articulating it to
workers and customers, and creating an environment that truly empowers
workers. This is a tough transition for managers used to being the
'managerial glue' that held their balkanised organisations together.
Managerial styles. Shedding the traditional 'command and control' model for
one of 'lead and enable' is proving a difficult transition for most
managers. Many continue to bark orders and micro-manage people in whom they
have vested new decision-making authority. I can count on one hand the
number of executives who have adopted a new style of empowerment.
Managerial decision-making style must soften, remaining open to finding
solutions to seeming paradoxes and contradictions. The tasks and activities
in a re-engineered business are much more interrelated. Decisions can no
longer be made independently by old functional leaders without regard to the
related activities in the same business process.
In this new team environment, behavioural knowledge and skills become
crucial.
Successful managers will be masters at getting people to work effectively
together, managing conflict and being effective coaches. Knowledge of the
content of the job is no longer the overriding requisite for promotion.
Management systems. As work becomes self-managed, executives will need new
'tools' - performance measures, incentives, hiring and training systems -
for steering the ship.
In any empowered organisation, what is important is what is measured.
Measures must track people's contribution to their team, and the team's
contribution to the success of the re-engineered process.
With fewer job descriptions and less hierarchy, managers must change the
fundamentals of career development and compensation. With people in jobs for
longer, compensation must be based more on the skills and knowledge they
acquire, not on their position on the organisation chart.
Overall, managers must shift their focus from watching the numbers to
measuring the performance of critical business processes. The new scorecard
for managers should be process performance: what percentage of customers are
we retaining? How fast are we filling orders? How many prospects are we
converting to customers? A blinding focus on financials is to treat the
symptoms of organisational distress, not the causes.
I am often asked whether workers will be able to perform in their
re-engineered jobs. When enabled and empowered, most of them can. The more
serious question is whether managers can make the transition. The answer
will determine whether it will take five or 50 years to reverse the errors
of the industrial revolution.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Property: Reversal of fortune: Small companies are tipped to
outperform their larger competitors in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year UK property shares went through the roof. The sector topped the
London stock market performance league, with a total return on capital and
income of 89.2 per cent. Its performance relative to the market as a whole
has rarely, if ever, been bettered.
But in the past month, property shares have faltered, posting a decline of 6
per cent relative to the market as a whole. Does this signal the end of the
bull run for property shares? Or have they merely paused for breath, before
resuming their headlong rise?
Analysts are divided in their views. 'Property shares may have moved too
far, too fast,' says Mr Chris Turner of BZW, the securities house. Mr David
Tunstall of stockbrokers Smith New Court is more sanguine. 'There has been
scope for profit taking but it doesn't alter the fundamentals which are
stronger than they were nine months ago.' Mr Tunstall thinks the sector is
still locked into the upswing of its cycle, which, he adds, 'does not
dissipate overnight'.
Even the optimists do not expect a repeat of last year's performance. The
bull run in 1993 stemmed from a potent combination of an unexpectedly sharp
improvement in the prospects for property, together with significantly
improved sentiment towards the sector.
The scale of the market improvement last year took many people by surprise.
At the beginning of 1993, many of the fundamental factors affecting property
were arguably poor: the tenants' market remained depressed as a result of a
glut of unlet buildings, falling rents and a reluctance on the part of
tenants to commit themselves to moving to new offices.
At the same time, there was concern about the impact of the gilts market on
property, because the burden of financing the public sector borrowing
requirement of an estimated Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 threatened to push the
yield on gilts even higher.
In the event, the bond market reported a strong performance which, in turn,
influenced property yields. The relationship between gilt yields and
property yields is currently particularly strong. This is because investors
have been focusing on the high yielding, secure income aspects of property.
The prospect of rental growth re-emerging at the end of the year was an
additional incentive to investors.
The result of the strong performance of the bond market was that property
yields plummeted, from an average of 9.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent at the end
of the year, pushing up average property values by 10.2 per cent, according
to chartered surveyors Richard Ellis.
For property companies, the effects of rising asset values are, of course,
greatly magnified by the level of their gearing, the ratio of borrowing to
assets. Consider, for instance, two companies with gearing of 100 per cent
and 50 per cent respectively. A 15 per cent rise in property values would
generate a rise in net asset value of 30 per cent for the first company and
a rise of just 22.5 per cent for the second.
Not surprisingly, the best performing shares last year were generally those
with above-average gearing or those that had experienced financial troubles.
Greycoat came top with a 346 per cent gain in share price performance,
followed by Development Securities, Chesterfield, Scottish Metropolitan,
Wates, Allied London and British Land.
Another important factor behind the strong performance of property shares
was the emergence of a premium to net asset values, an important yardstick
of share performance. Traditionally shares are valued at a discount to net
assets of more than 20 per cent, to compensate for capital gains tax
liabilities and investors' lack of direct control over their assets. But
investors' expectations of growth in property values over the next two years
have pushed shares onto a 20 per cent premium to their net asset values,
according to estimates by UBS, the stockbrokers.
Investors face a difficult task in deciding whether share prices reflect a
correct assessment of the improved prospects for the property market. Much
depends on the trend in bond yields. 'Any improvement in (property) values
over the next three years will almost entirely be yield driven and therefore
is critically dependent on long bond yields and a narrowing of the margin of
property yields over bond yields,' says Kleinwort Benson, the securities
house.
But, as Kleinwort Benson points out, its forecasts of property values are
highly sensitive to variations in its projections of bond yields. A
forecasting error of about 100 basis points on gilts for a company that is
50 per cent geared would result in an error of more than 20 per cent on the
net asset value.
Kleinwort Benson's property analysts say gilts could yield less than 6 per
cent by the end of 1994 or early 1995. Others, such as BZW's Mr Turner, are
more sceptical about the prospects of another significant improvement in the
gilts market.
Moreover, Mr Turner thinks that property stocks may fall out of favour this
year because their prospects for earnings growth are dull at a stage in the
cycle when investors want to buy shares with sharply rising earnings.
Already, the property sector's prospective dividend yield of about 3.7 per
cent is close to that of the market as a whole. But as the prospects for
earnings growth are poor, so dividend increase is likely to edge below that
of the market as whole.
Mr Selwyn Jones of Credit Lyonnais Laing voices another common reservation
about prospects for property shares this year. He thinks that the industry
is over-optimistic about the prospects of substantial rental growth
re-emerging, given a background of low inflation. He also points to the
large number of prospective flotations which could dampen the market's
enthusiasm for property shares.
Selectivity, therefore, may be the watchword for investing in property
shares this year. For analysts, gearing, management ability and flexibility
will be the primary themes behind their share choices.
Smith New Court backs Land Securities, Great Portland and Brixton Estates
because of their proven management ability. Credit Lyonnais Laing believes
that British Land, Bradford and Great Portland will be the best performing
shares among the leading property companies in 1994; Bourne End and Helical
Bar look the best value of the medium-sized stocks, it adds.
Smaller companies are tipped by some analysts to outperform their larger
counterparts. UBS favours smaller companies such as Cleveland Trust, Dwyer,
Five Oaks, Town Centre, PSIT and Allied London Properties. Kleinwort Benson
also favours a clutch of small companies - Bradford, Burford, Frogmore, Town
Centre, Asda Properties, Helical Bar, St Modwen and Shaftesbury.
Small companies are well-placed because they are generally more highly
geared (at levels of between 75 per cent and 300 per cent) than their larger
competitors, whose gearing is generally between 40 per cent and 80 per cent.
According to Kleinwort Benson, small companies can also benefit from greater
flexibility of operation than their bigger competitors: small companies can
carry out deals in an imperfect market, they can manage gearing and operate
in small niches areas. 'Small is beautiful,' it says.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (9): State-of-the-art
technology - German experience with FGDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1980s, reports of forests dying from acid rain pollution were
horrifying the German public. Power stations were soon identified as a
leading culprit and the West German government reacted swiftly by passing
the Large Combustion Plant Ordinance (LCPO) in July 1983. A massive FGD
programme began.
No other country in the world has carried out a power station
desulphurisation programme remotely comparable with that in West Germany
during the years 1983 to 1988.
The Ordinance laid down strict sulphur dioxide emissions limits for existing
and new plant and all large West German power stations using fossil fuels
were retrofitted with desulphurisation plant over this five-year period.
Today, SO emissions from power stations have been reduced to just 10 per
cent of the volume emitted in 1982. In 1991, specific SO output from coal
and oil power stations in Germany was by far the lowest in Europe at 0.92 gm
per kWh. Thus Germany already easily fulfils the European Community
directive passed in 1988 on large combustion plant. This requires a
reduction in SO emissions in Germany of 40 per cent by 1993, 60 per cent by
1988; and 70 per cent by 2003, compared with 1980 levels.
The EC directive required that only new power stations were fitted with
desulphurisation plant. Retrofitting of old plant was not obligatory and has
only been carried out in Germany.
The German Utilities Association in Frankfurt, VDEW, says DM15bn was spent
on the big desulphurisation campaign - while a further DM7bn was invested in
de-NOX plant - over the period 1983 to 1988 in Germany.
The annual expenditure on FGD operation, including serving capital costs,
amounts to some DM3.5bn. This adds 1.5 to 2.0 pfennig per kWh to the cost of
electricity generation. For comparison, in mid-1993, industrial customers
were paying an average 19.74 pfennigs per kWh for their electricity, not
including the average 7.5 per cent German coal support levy.
German unification has resulted in a new wave of FGD retrofitting in eastern
Germany, to large power stations which burn brown coal. A total of eight
500MW units at Boxberg and Jaenschwalde will have desulphurisation plant
installed. The other 8,000MW of brown coal-fired capacity will have to be
closed down by the end of June 1996 - the LCPO deadline applied to eastern
Germany.
How necessary this new desulphurisation campaign had become is illustrated
by the fact that in 1990 East German SO emissions were 1.84m tonnes; 10
times higher than those in West Germany although electricity production in
the east was just one tenth of that in the west.
In practice, German coal power station operators use almost exclusively the
so-called limestone wash process because a ready market can be found for
gypsum, a byproduct. The utilities and the building industry began talks
promptly when it became clear what volume of gypsum would be produced and
effective disposal arrangements have evolved.
In some cases, the building materials industry has set up shop close to the
power stations. For example, Rigips built a new plasterboard factory at
Gelsenkirchen-Buer within an easy pumping distance of three Veba Kraftwerk
Ruhr (VKR) power stations. These now supply 250,000 tonnes a year of gypsum
in water suspension through pipes to the Rigips factory, accounting for half
of VKR total gypsum production from its power station capacity.
In other cases, the fact that power stations operate at highest load in
winter but the building industry is in full swing in summer means the gypsum
must be stored before being transported during the warmer months to
different parts of Germany.
Fortunately, the German gypsum market has a volume of about 4m tonnes while
'hard coal' power stations produce 2.5m-2.8m tonnes a year.
The sale price achieved for the FGD gypsum generally covers only the cost of
storage and transport, making no contribution to the costs of operating the
FGD plant.
The story for gypsum produced from brown coal power station FGD plant is
rather different.
Partly due to the much higher sulphur level in brown coal, the gypsum
byproduct is yellow in colour and not of optimum quality. As a result, brown
coal power station operator RWE Energie has trouble marketing the gypsum.
But because the huge holes left by open-cast brown coal mining have to be
filled, disposal of the brown coal FGD-produced gypsum has not proved too
much of a problem.
When the German desulphurisation programme began, there was some criticism
that although the benefits to the environment were clearly very great, the
huge investment involved would prolong the life of generally inefficient
power stations.
In particular, brown coal power stations in western Germany have an
efficiency of just 34-38 per cent, so that more than 60 per cent of the fuel
input is lost as heat through the cooling towers. The FGD plant itself also
reduces both hard and brown coal power station efficiency by about 1 per
cent through the power consumption necessary for its operation.
Regardless of such criticism, FGD has now become state-of-the-art power
station technology in Germany. In fact, last year, leading utility
Preussenelektra decided not to use the new coal gasification technology for
a 400MW hard coal power station to be built at Luebeck, which would have
done away with the need for an FGD plant. It decided to use conventional
technology with FGD instead, concluding that efficiency and emissions would
be comparable.
A 900MW hard coal power station planned for Stendal at the beginning of the
next century by east German utility Veag is also on the drawing board as a
further-improved conventional hard coal-fired plant with FGD.
In eastern Germany, several new 800MW brown coal units with FGD are under
construction or planned.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (8): Remarkably few
problems - Materials handling system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the best ways to grasp the scale of the FGD project at Drax is to
consider some of the statistics generated by the materials handling facility
which has been built over the past three years by Birtley Engineering, part
of Taylor Woodrow.
Going round the facility is a varied experience. In part it is a mountain
walk - through a store 210m long by 38m wide that can hold as much as 60,000
tonnes of gypsum. Elsewhere, it turns into a stiff climb up one of the
steeper of the 3.2km of conveyors.
En route, visitors pass through the dedicated rail handling building, which
can unload 1,500 tonnes of limestone from a train in 60 minutes, and load
1,000 tonnes of gypsum in 100 minutes.
The system is the most visible part of the 'common plant' that supports all
three pairs of FGD units being built by Babcock Energy. It is a panoply of
hoppers, conveyors, drag-link feeders, scraper reclaim machines, belt
weighers, trash screens, magnetic separators and other materials handling
equipment.
Individually, all the equipment is of a kind tried and tested in other
material handling applications. 'There are no prototypes here,' says Mr Ivan
Harris, Birtley's engineering director. What is new is the collective use to
which the components have been put.
No other FGD projects approach Drax in the scale of the materials handling
challenge. Counterparts in Europe are much smaller and rely on road
transport for delivering limestone and ferrying away the gypsum. At Drax,
National Power has to use rail for the bulk of its transport needs, so in
that respect it had to start designing the handling system from scratch.
In other respects, the system's designers could look around at other FGD
plants and draw on the considerable materials handling knowledge already
within National Power and its antecedent, the Central Electricity Generating
Board. The Drax power station alone handles 10m tonnes of coal a year and
500,000 tonnes of ash byproducts.
Just as with the main FGD process itself, engineers had various alternatives
to examine when working out how to design a system that, when fully
operational, will typically handle 600,000 tonnes of limestone a year and
800,000 to 1m tonnes of gypsum byproduct.
There were, for example, three main ways that the gypsum could be moved
round the system, says Mr Alan Myers, a National Power project engineer who
has worked on the Drax FGD materials handling project since 1988: pneumatic
conveying through pipes, slurrifying it, and conveying it as a powder. The
first two would have required drying equipment and big tanks respectively,
and using conveyors was the preferred method in Germany, Japan and the US.
Similarly, in discussions with several equipment suppliers and users, it
decided that a batch loading system in the rail handling building would work
better than a silo system. Batch loading would be more economical for an FGD
operation of Drax's scale.
The end result was a system that is conservative in design, with
considerable duplication of equipment such as hoppers, reclaim machines and
conveyor belts to ensure security of supply, along with proven individual
plant. Mr Paul Chapman, National Power's project manager at Drax, says this
was partly because the CEGB was inherently conservative in its design
methods. 'But it was probably right to be so in this case, given the size of
the project,' he adds.
It was also a design that casts National Power and its predecessor in the
role of 'informed customer,' as Mr Chapman puts it. As well as laying down
the performance criteria of the system - which is as far as many utilities
go nowadays in designing power stations or related projects - it was also
quite specific about the type of plant to be used.
However, if the end result bears a striking resemblance to the original CEGB
specification, much of the detailed design work was carried out by Mr Harris
and his team at Birtley, which in 1989 won a closely-fought contest for the
contract, worth Pounds 24m-25m currently. Birtley specialises in such
contracts, and was responsible for purchasing all the plant from
subcontractors, apart from sampling equipment which it makes itself.
The project is essentially in two halves, each of which has a store in the
middle. The first begins with the limestone being dropped from the rail
wagons into hoppers and taken via conveyors to the limestone store, which
can hold about 45,000 tonnes - about 14 days' supply depending on the type
of coal used. It is then reclaimed from the store, passed through trash
screens - giant sieves - and magnetic separators before ending up in the
process plant bunkers, which represents the start of the Babcock contract.
At the other end, the gypsum material handling route begins as it leaves
Babcock's dewatering plant building, from where it is taken to the gypsum
store. From there it is reclaimed and conveyed directly to the rail loading
facility, or the road facility for shorter journeys. Because gypsum is
tacky, and still damp from the FGD process, it was important to avoid any
bunkers between the store and the rail building, says Mr Harris.
The feature of both stores is the reclaim equipment - in each case, two
portal scraper reclaim machines which move along the store automatically and
pick up the material with chain scrapers suspended from a portal frame. The
equipment, made by PWH in Germany and incorporating Hungarian steel
fabrications, is the only non UK-sourced plant in the materials handling
project.
Designers of the materials handling system have had to bear a number of
factors in mind. First, they have had to ensure it does not conflict with
the normal operation of the plant and its transport arrangements. In
particular, the rail link has involved nearly 5km of extra track and has
been designed with two spur lines to avoid snarling up traffic on the Aire
Valley rail network, which is vital for delivery of coal trains to Drax.
Secondly, the design has had to take the environment into account. The
stores and conveyor belts are covered, and dust control equipment has been
installed at each limestone conveyor transfer point.
Not least, though, the design has had to keep running costs at a minimum and
give station operators as much flexibility as possible. Mr Tim Clarke,
production manager at Drax, says the materials handling system would be
unmanned to all intents and purposes, apart from two men to handle the
loading and unloading of the trains. The system will be monitored by
closed-circuit television.
Final proof of how the system works will not come until 1996 when the FGD
project is completed. So far, however, it has come together with remarkably
few problems - National Power for example, wants adjustments made to the
gypsum store reclaimers to ensure batch loads are consistent, and other
hitches have been minor.
The success of the project is due partly to a good initial design and to a
rigorous risk assessment exercise at Birtley, which had only recently been
taken over by Taylor Woodrow when it won the contract and needed to prove
itself to its new parent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (7): Waste is recycled for
building industry - The gypsum market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Drax, the flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plants will leave up to 1m
tonnes a year of white powder as a byproduct. Instead of being dumped, this
waste material is about to be recycled in the form of products for the
building industry.
The byproduct of Drax, known as desulpho gypsum, will be used as a
substitute for natural gypsum, a widely occurring rock which is employed in
the manufacture of plaster and plasterboard, used for lining virtually all
internal walls and ceilings in homes and offices.
In the FGD process, a mixture of water and powdered limestone is sprayed as
a highly dense mist through which the spent gases from the generators is
forced. The spray reacts chemically with the SO and removes it from the
waste gas. Additional treatments remove impurities such as chlorides. A
liquid sludge of calcium sulphite (CaSO) is left and this is oxidised by
passing air through it to produce a water-based form of calcium sulphate
(CaSO). When this is dried, a white powder remains: gypsum.
The main use of gypsum used to be bagged plaster, which is mixed with water
and smeared on walls to form a smooth, hard skin when dried. Increasingly,
plaster is being replaced by plasterboard - a sandwich of a hardened plaster
core within two sheets of heavy grade paper - which is quicker and easier to
apply.
In 1990, British Gypsum, a subsidiary of UK-based BPB Industries, Europe's
largest plasterboard manufacturer with a turnover of Pounds 1.1bn, outbid
its two main rivals German producer Knauf and French group Lafarge - then
involved in a bitter three-way price war throughout Europe - to win
exclusive rights to gypsum from Drax.
Shortly afterwards, the company - which has approximately a 60 per cent
share of the UK plasterboard market - gained a similar concession from
Powergen's Ratcliffe-on-Soar FGD station in Nottinghamshire.
Neither BG nor National Power will say what was paid for the 15-year deal at
Drax. But the generator says it will only make a small contribution to the
Pounds 680m capital cost of the FGD plant. Mr Alan Turner, BPB chairman,
says the price will make the cost of desulpho gypsum equal on average with
extracting the natural material from BG's extensive mines at East Leake and
Barrow. Processed natural gypsum costs on average Pounds 15-Pounds 20 a
tonne - about 10 per cent of the cost of finished plasterboard.
Industry commentators say BG's motives were partly a spoiling tactic to stop
Knauf and Lafarge gaining local supplies of gypsum. Knauf and Lafarge have
to import all their raw material by ship, adding to costs. Mr Turner says
that winning both concessions was 'part of our strategy to remain the lowest
cost producer in the UK'.
Knauf, however, recently secured a deal with ICI which is building a flue
gas plant at its paint factory near the privately-owned German company's
Humberside works. This will produce gypsum by an equivalent process, which
strips toxins from the ICI factory's emissions.
Because it is a high-bulk, low-value material, transport costs are critical
to the economics of gypsum production. Road haulage costs about Pounds 5 a
tonne for each 100 miles. Rail costs are approximately half. BG could not be
luckier: East Leake, the largest of its four factories, is virtually next
door to Ratcliffe and two other plants are within easy reach of Drax.
Knauf, meanwhile says it pays about Pounds 6.50 a tonne for shipping
desulpho gypsum from Germany, while Lafarge imports quarried rock from
Spain.
Because BG has to take all the material from both stations, industry sources
say supplies may outstrip the company's demands. With Drax running at near
to full generating capacity and all six of the FGD units installed, gypsum
output will be 800,000-1.1m tonnes a year and from Ratcliffe roughly half
this range.
The amount of gypsum produced is dependent on two main factors: the
electricity output of the station and the proportion of sulphur in the coal.
National Power says it plans to run Drax at 'base load' - at or near to 24
hours a day, throughout the year - while using smaller stations
intermittently to boost the grid when national demand is highest. But the
sulphur level of the British coal it buys is relatively low, meaning less
desulphurisation will be required. Output is therefore likely to be at the
low end of the predicted range.
A tonne of gypsum is needed to produce 100 sq m of plasterboard. If the
combined output of Drax and Ratcliffe is 1.2m tonnes a year, this will be
enough to produce 120m sq m of plasterboard. Demand for boards in the UK is
forecast by NatWest Securities to grow from 150m sq m in 1994 to more than
180m in 1999.
Mr Turner says BG, which has four plants, intends to use desulpho gypsum in
a third to half of its board production and a smaller amount in its bagged
product, mixed with the ground natural rock. But if its 60 per cent of
market share remains the same, the company's sales of board will be less
than 110m sq m by the end of the decade, according to NatWest's predictions.
Even if BG decides to use 100 per cent desulpho gypsum in its boards, if
there is another deep recession in the building industry the company could
be left with very large stockpiles of gypsum on its hands. One industry
commentator suggests that BG would have to dump the material in its own used
mineshafts. But Mr Turner says BG can cope with 150m tonnes a year. The
company is developing new uses for the material, benefiting from the group's
experience in Germany where BPB has a market share of almost 50 per cent.
New uses of the material, that Mr Turner is prepared to disclose, include
ingredients in concrete flooring screeds and an additive to control the
setting time of cement. There are other, undisclosed, possibilities that
BPB's researchers are also investigating, he says.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (5): Complex structure of
controls - Environmental pressures in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drax's flue gas desulphurisation plant, while much the most ambitious in
Europe, is something of a late-comer in the context of moves to curb air
pollution in the region.
Over the past 20 years, a complex structure of emission controls has evolved
at both supra-national and national levels. These have been successful in
bringing about marked reductions in emissions in countries such as Germany,
for example, where fears of acid rain were strongest.
In other countries, such as the UK, progress has been slower because
governments have been sensitive to the enormous costs of power station
clean-up, particularly when it entails 'end of pipe' solutions. The quest
for alternative means of reducing pollution has also intensified.
Serious attempts to clean up the atmosphere at an international level began
in the 1970s when fears of the threat posed by acid rain prompted
negotiations in the UN's Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva.
This led to the 1985 Sulphur Protocol which committed signatories to reduce
emissions of sulphur dioxide to 70 per cent of 1980 levels by 1993. In 1988,
a similar protocol committed signatories to cut nitrous oxide emissions by
30 per cent by 1995-98.
In 1988, the European Union adopted the Large Combustion Plants Directive
which aimed to take the protocol a stage further. This called for reductions
of sulphur dioxide from existing plants of 25, 43 and 70 per cent by 1993,
1995 and 2003 respectively from 1980 levels. But it gave special
dispensation to countries with heavily reliance on large coal-fired power
stations, with targets of 20, 40 and 60 per cent respectively. The directive
also set a timetable for cuts in nitrous oxide.
The other aim of the directive was to set tough emission limits for new
plants - limits which are now in force.
These measures, plus others taken at the national level, have already
produced sharp reductions in emissions. Germany, with characteristic
thoroughness, has gone furthest. Following a 1983 ordinance, it has attached
clean-up equipment to all plants in the former West Germany. This has led to
cuts of 90 per cent in sulphur emissions, and 75 per cent in nitrous oxide.
But the cost of this has been huge. The total programme amounted to DM22bn,
plus DM5bn of annual operating costs. This adds about 3 pfennigs to the cost
of a kWh, according to estimates by VDEW, the electricity industry trade
association. Work has now started on the clean up of some 10,000MW of
coal-fired capacity in the former East Germany, with a completion target
date of 1996, again at a cost of billions of DM.
The experience of the first phase of clean-up is now having its effect as
European countries address the next stage.
Now that the first set of target dates for the sulphur protocol reductions
has been reached, moves are afoot to tighten the rules still further. Last
year, negotiations began on a second sulphur protocol which aims to bring
about further reductions by the year 2000.
The EU will also be updating the Large Combustion Plants Directive this
year, but although there is some concern in the power generation industry
that this might lead to even tighter targets, officials say that the new
LCPD is likely to fit in with the new protocol.
Unlike the first protocol, the second does not aim for blanket reductions in
emissions. The hope is to get a more flexible system which takes account of
the localities where environmental damage is being caused, and the ability
of those localities to cope with the pollution - an approach known as
critical load analysis which is supposed to give a clearer idea of where the
priorities lie.
Some countries, for example, are being asked to cut sulphur by 90 per cent,
others by only 50 per cent, although environmentalists complain that even
this is not sufficient because the effects of acid deposition are
cumulative, and even small amounts make a difference.
The new protocol is also likely to permit greater flexibility as to how the
results are actually achieved so as to bring a degree of cost effectiveness
into the equation. Although the principle of Best Available Techniques Not
Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) is the traditional method, some
signatories, such as the UK, want the protocol to leave room for alternative
means.
This has produced a debate about the merits of different pollution reduction
methods. One of these is economic instruments, including tradeable pollution
permits which have been launched in the US but have yet to make an
appearance in Europe, although countries such as the UK have been studying
them closely.
Another method is to encourage use of cleaner energy sources. France, with
its strong development of nuclear power, has achieved most by this means:
its power stations emissions are among the lowest in Europe on a per capita
basis.
Britain also hopes to make a lot of headway towards its targets by switching
from coal to gas - a process which is already well under way although at
considerable political cost, given last year's uproar over closures of
coalmines.
But this is a route down which Germany is clearly not prepared to go: it has
been unable to agree a shift from coal to nuclear power, and has no other
viable fuels to fall back on. It will therefore have to take the costliest
route of pursuing its retrofit programme. Even so, the EU Commission expects
the consumption of gas by Europe's power stations to increase sixfold by the
year 2020.
However, there are also other means, such as introducing greater energy
efficiency, or new clean technology for burning coal.
The efficiency option has recently been undermined by the fall in oil
prices, and by the failure of EU countries to agree some kind of energy tax,
such as a carbon tax, which might push the cost of electricity up to levels
which encourage greater savings. However the proposal has the support of a
number of EU members and is likely to remain on the negotiating table.
Individual countries are also jacking up fuel taxes, which is having the
same effect.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (6): One step towards a
cleaner environment - FGD Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power likens the process to a huge car wash. Instead of cars, the
FGD plant is washing the sulphur dioxide out of the gases which are the
result of burning coal to fire the generators.
The other main difference is that the FGD uses limestone, not soap, in the
washing process - and it has a significant byproduct in gypsum, the building
materials product.
While environmentalists welcome the reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions
which results from fitting the FGD plant, they are also concerned about the
effects of the plant's consumption of half a million tonnes of limestone
each year.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says the FGD construction at
National Power's Drax plant is a step in the right direction towards a
cleaner environment but says it would have liked a more thorough
investigation of FGD alternatives (described elsewhere in this survey) and
the effects they would have had on the environment.
First, the technology. The limestone-gypsum process at Drax is the most
widely used in FGDs throughout the world. Babcock, the contractor,
constructed the installation under licence from Hitachi, the Japanese
company.
Under the process, sulphur dioxide is routed through ducting which is big
enough to allow a red double decker London bus to pass through. At peak
output, flue gases will flow through the ducting at the rate of 6,000 cu m a
second.
A simple chemical reaction occurs in large containers called absorbers,
which are equivalent in size to 12-storey buildings. Limestone, ground to a
fine powder, is mixed with water to form a slurry mixture which is sprayed
on to the sulphur-laden gas in the absorber towers.
The sulphur dioxide then reacts with the limestone (calcium carbonate) to
produce calcium sulphite. Air blown into the absorber oxidises the calcium
sulphite, turning it into calcium sulphate.
Then, as in the spin cycle in a domestic washing machine, the water is
removed leaving the by-product of high grade gypsum.
The gypsum is stored at the site, then sold for use in the building trade.
Waste water is treated to ensure it returns to the environment to an agreed
standard.
The environmental lobby's concern is more to do with the sourcing of the
limestone and the transport of it on to the site and the gypsum off the
site.
Ms Fiona Weir, who heads the air pollution team at Friends of the Earth
(FoE), says there are worries that the process uses so much limestone
compared to other types of FGD. 'We wanted a much more serious consideration
of the alternatives and will certainly press for it if any other FGDs are
built in the UK,' she says.
'Other options may have been more costly but they may have been less
damaging to the environment,' she says.
Ms Weir acknowledges that some of FoE's concerns over issues including
transport and supplies appear to have been dealt with, at least in part, by
National Power.
The company has agreed that transport of the limestone will be by rail
rather than by road which would cause more disturbance to residents in the
areas in between. It contributed Pounds 4m to the building of a dual
carriageway ring road built while FGD building was in progress.
National Power has also agreed to source all of the limestone from areas
which are not in national parks. This goes only some of the way to meeting
FoE's concerns because Drax's use of 500,000 tonnes a year may lead to
pressure increasing from other limestone consumers for limestone to be taken
from areas of natural beauty.
In addition, strict planning controls have contributed to National Power
covering all of the FGD units with cream-coloured cladding and spending
considerable sums on landscaping.
Drax, like any other power station, will never be attractive but there are
worse industrial eyesores in the UK.
In lobbying Her Majesty's Inspectorate for Pollution last year, Friends of
the Earth pressed not for rejection of authorisation for the FGDs but for
conditions to be attached to the authorisation, including a fuller
assessment of alternatives and strict monitoring of sulphur and nitrogen
oxides from the plant.
Friends of the Earth has long campaigned that the generators should be
required to provide more detailed environmental assessments of their power
stations. It sees FGDs as only a short-term solution to the environmental
problems of Britain and Europe.
'There is a carbon dioxide penalty for FGDs,' says Ms Weir. This is because
FGD installations increase the amount of electricity needed to run a power
plant and thus increase the amount of carbon dioxide which is being pumped
into the air. There are no international limits for carbon dioxide
emissions.
Friends of the Earth thinks there are preferable long-term solutions to
emissions of both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide from power stations.
They would like to see national consumption of electricity cut through
energy conservation - and increasing use of renewable energy resources such
as wind and solar power.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (4): Crucial decision -
Coal's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flue gas desulphurisation units at National Power's Drax plant and
PowerGen's Ratcliffe station will ensure a role for coal in the UK well into
the next decade. But it will be a smaller role than in the past.
The size of the coal market will depend to a large extent on how Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), the government watchdog,
enforces and interprets pollution standards, and on how that affects the
ability of coal-fired stations to stay in operation.
Crucial to coal's role will be whether the generators build more FGDs,
either at stations which burn coal or those which burn Orimulsion, the
bitumen-based fuel imported from Venezuela, and whether they hasten the
so-called dash for gas-fired generation.
In the late 1980s, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then the prime minister, appeared
to commit the UK to building some 12,000MW of FGDs. But there seems little
prospect of that now. There are even doubts aboutwhether the 8,000MW
indicated by the government for England and Wales at electricity
privatisation three years ago will become a reality.
Mr Granville Camsey, managing director of group technology at National
Power, says his company does not rule out building more coal FGDs on top of
the 4,000MW being installed at Drax but he acknowledges it is unlikely.
FGDs for Orimulsion seem more probable, thus further eroding coal's role.
The coal lobby would be even more enraged, however, if PowerGen decided not
to go ahead with FGD installation at its Ferrybridge plant.
In the government's offer-for-sale document for National Power and PowerGen
at privatisation, PowerGen said it had 'informed the government of its plan
to install FGD equipment at 4,000MW of capacity at existing stations.'
The Ratcliffe installation comprises 2,000MW but PowerGen has yet to proceed
with the rest and there are doubts about whether it will.
Critics say that if it does not do so, it will have broken commitments in
the offer-for-sale. One argument is that the tax payer has already paid for
the full 4,000MW of FGD programme because PowerGen's share price was lower
than it would otherwise have been to take account of the 'commitment'.
Against this, PowerGen can argue that the form of words in the sale document
did not constitute a commitment and that, in any case, it could fulfil its
sulphur reduction obligations by burning less sulphurous coal, mainly
imported, and by building combined-cycle gas stations.
Gas has undoubted environmental advantages over coal. It emits about half
the carbon dioxide per unit of electricity and virtually no sulphur dioxide.
What infuriates the coal lobby is that the new gas plants will replace coal
stations which could have years of useful life left and could, in some
cases, be even cheaper to run when fitted with FGDs.
The coal lobby's explanation for the dash for gas is that regional
electricity companies became involved in joint ventures to set up new
generating companies because they were desperate to escape the clutches of a
duopoly in PowerGen and National Power which charged them more than
necessary for power. These new companies had a captive market in the
regional electricity companies through long-term contracts which allowed
costs to be passed on to customers.
National Power and PowerGen responded, the argument goes, by building their
own gas-fired stations so that they could retain market share. The coal
lobby's conclusion is that the dash for gas is the result of a flawed market
which will result in a waste of UK energy resources and pit closures which
will close off coal supplies for ever.
The generators' response is that it makes more sense to invest in gas-fired
generation which is more environmentally friendly and more thermally
efficient than to retrofit FGDs on to plant which has limited life.
The counter-arguments are unlikely to convince the generators to build
anything more than Drax, Ratcliffe - and possibly Ferrybridge and another
plant at Longannet with Scottish Power funds. What then is the future for
the other 22 coal-fired stations?
The HMIP's role will be crucial. There is considerable uncertainty about how
the inspectorate will interpret the European drive to introduce the Best
Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) through which
'old' plant must be brought up to the standard of 'new'.
The objective is that plant be upgraded by April 2001 at the latest.
The coal industry fears that unless the inspectorate is flexible, it is
possible that early in the new millennium there will be only two or three
coal-fired power stations still running; those fitted with FGDs.
That would provide sales of 15m to 20m tonnes of coal to the electricity
sector which constitutes by far the largest market for coal. That in turn
would provide outlets for considerably less than 10 pits, against the 22 in
operation today, and that assumes that all of the coal used was sourced from
the UK, a highly improbable scenario given the low sulphur content of
imported coal.
All of this is almost certainly too gloomy a picture. After all, PowerGen
expects that by far the majority of the seven coal-fired stations it will
still be operating next financial year will remain open by the end of the
century. Even National Power, more pessimistic on this issue, expects to be
operating at least 10 of its remaining power stations in the next
millennium.
But unless the market changes beyond all expectations, most of the
coal-fired stations that do survive will be operating at considerably less
than their capacity. The chances of coal sales to the England and Wales
generators reaching anything like the 40m tonnes of this financial year are
remote.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (2): Celebrations after a
difficult year - The Contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Babcock Energy formally handed over to National Power the first
two of six sulphur dioxide absorber towers and associated plant which it is
building at the Drax power station on an eight-year Pounds 400m-plus
contract.
After a difficult year at Drax for the subsidiary of Babcock International,
it was a time for celebration - tinged with feelings of relief.
According to Dr John Parker, chief executive and deputy chairman of the
engineering contractor, the completion of the first phase of the project was
'a major technological and operational achievement for both Babcock and
National Power and is the culmination of five years work on the contract to
ensure completion on time and to specification.'
Work on the remaining four units was proceeding to plan, said Babcock, and
more than 75 per cent of the contract had been carried out. The final pair
of absorbers would be handed over to National Power on the scheduled
contract dates in the spring of 1996.
The handover in December came only three months after Babcock had revealed
that it would be taking a Pounds 15m pre-tax provision to cover
higher-than-expected costs on the contract - along with a further Pounds 5m
provision to cover costs of closing non-core mining activities in Africa.
The news shocked the City of London, caused a 20 per cent overnight fall in
Babcock's share price and once again underlined the risks inherent in
large-scale engineering contracts.
Babcock's problems at Drax have, perhaps inevitably, overshadowed its
achievements on the contract and those of other suppliers and contractors.
The scale of the project, with 85km of pipework, 29,000 tons of steelwork,
and large ductwork assemblies which were moved around on the equivalent of
roller skates before being lifted into position, has produced some
significant construction achievements.
Building the FGD plant required the sinking of 14,000 piles into ground
close to the operating plant. For, apart from some temporary interruptions,
Drax has been continuing to produce power - which has been very important to
the customer.
'The ability of the construction team to build the FGD plant while reducing
the impact on our biggest revenue-earner has been masterful,' says Mr
Granville Camsey, National Power's executive director with overall
responsibility for the Drax project.
Overall, the project is running on time and under budget. The original
estimate was Pounds 750m, Mr Camsey says, but the eventual total cost will
be about Pounds 680m.
Apart from Babcock Energy, National Power has had about 50 main contractors
on site. Of them, the largest amount of work went to Birtley Engineering,
which won Pounds 30m of contracts to supply the materials handling system
and a waste water treatment plant. It is followed by Mowlem Civil
Engineering, which did Pounds 19.5m of piling, unit plant and ductwork
foundations, Amec Civil Engineering (Pounds 19m of work on common plant
foundations), Alfred McAlpine (Pounds 12m of preliminary civil works), and
W. S. Atkins (a Pounds 9m civil design consultancy contract).
Babcock Energy itself has also given work worth more than Pounds 1m apiece
to more than than 30 sub-contractors. By far the biggest contract, worth
about Pounds 45m, went to Cleveland Structural Engineering for all the
structural steelwork and cladding. Howden Sirocco won a Pounds 22m contract
for gas heaters and booster fans, while contracts of about Pounds 15m each
went to Plastilon of France for the glass reinforced plastic (GRP) pipework,
Balfour Kilpatrick for cabling and Ancorite for the absorber and flue
linings. Thompson Kennicott, part of Rolls-Royce, provided waste water
treatment plant in a deal worth about Pounds 10m.
Other household names from construction and engineering include M. J.
Gleeson, GEC Alsthom, Weir Pumps and Asea Brown Boveri. ABB had control
system contracts from both Babcock Energy and National Power itself, worth a
total of about Pounds 10m.
Overall, the bulk of the spending on the project has been in the UK -
National Power estimates that only about Pounds 45m of work was supplied
from overseas. At its peak, about 2,300 people were employed on site, but
the overall employment effect for such projects is normally between three
and five times that number - if steelmakers, transporters and others even
remotely involved are included.
For many of the suppliers, and especially Babcock itself, the Drax FGD
project has been one of their first experiences of the way the privatised
utilities are handling very big capital investments. In contrast to the
highly-detailed technical design work which used to be carried out by the
old Central Electricity Generating Board, National Power gave Babcock a
performance specification it must work to but very little technical
definition.
This is a fundamental change, says Mr Camsey, from what contractors and
customers are used to. The relationship between the two is now based around
performance-related criteria. National Power, for example laid down what it
wanted in terms of performance and durability from the project's pipework,
but did not say what it should be made of. In consultation with the
customer, Babcock decided on using GRP for 80 per cent of the pipework
rather than rubber-lined steel. Babcock also decided to line the mild steel
ductwork with a nickel-based material, Hastalloy, to meet performance
criteria there.
This method of construction clearly requires a high degree of trust between
customer and supplier but also needs a mechanism than enables both to spot
problems early and take action accordingly.
Leaving aside the relatively minor problem of a fire at one of Plastilon's
plants, the big problem has been at the heart of the FGD process itself.
The massive steel absorbers have to be lined with rubber to prevent
corrosion, but in August 1992 imperfections in the steel plate were
discovered after shotblasting, says Mr Keith Thorley, Babcock Energy's
project manager at Drax. Consequently, reaching the required level of
smoothness and cleanliness for the linings to stick properly proved to be
much more difficult than had first been thought.
Part of the problem was the specification of the steel plate itself, says Mr
William Fairney, National Power's director of project development and
construction. The original plate was supplied from the UK, but Babcock says
that for the later units it is switching to steel from a Belgium supplier
which was able to give guarantees on imperfection-free plate.
The technical problem in the absorbers was solved by Christmas 1992, but 20
weeks had been lost. National Power could see that Babcock would not be able
to complete the first two absorbers by December 1993 without considerable
additional manpower to catch up with its schedule.
'We sat down with them to look at the problem,' says Mr Camsey. 'They
realised they had to bring in more people.' This was the origin of Babcock's
cost overrun - which emerged in the summer after an independent team from
Babcock head office found a Pounds 15m gap between expected future revenue
on the contract and predicted costs.
Babcock's management team on site has been strengthened and top-level
oversight of the project tightened up through appointment of a director
dedicated to the project.
Mr Camsey says there has been some tough talking between contractor and
customer, and even some 'blood-letting.' But he adds that, overall 'in a
technical and a project management sense, Babcock have been good, and we are
satisfied.' The handover of the first two absorbers was made a day before
the December 17 deadline.
Mr Fairney adds that Babcock must be given credit for the way it handled
three 12-week outages (utility-speak for stopping production) for the
critical installation of the ductwork into the flues. It finished the first
with two days to spare, the second with seven days, and the third with 11
days to spare.
Both contractor and customer are now confident that the four remaining
absorbers will go ahead without further technical problems after the lessons
learnt on the first pair. The two sides will probably continue discussing
terms until the contract is completed and Babcock said in September it was
in talks with National Power about recovery of 'certain elements' of the
additional costs. Whether it achieves that remains to be seen - Mr Camsey
says 'No comment.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (3): Emerging technologies
 -The Alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, along with other generators of power from coal-fired
stations, has had two broad technology options when deciding how to respond
to the increasing pressure to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions.
The first is to use one of at least four methods to retrofit flue gas
desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to an existing coal-fired plant. These
methods essentially aim to improve the traditional pulverised coal firing
process through various emission controls after combustion.
The second is to start afresh with a new power station and a new method of
combustion. Typically, that would mean switching to combined cycle gas
turbine power generation, a significantly cleaner method than traditional
coal-fired generation. The extreme, no-emission, option is nuclear power.
In between are emerging technologies which use coal. Integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC), for example, involves turning coal into a gas which
is then used to fire gas turbines.
Relatively new types of boilers using fluidised bed combustion, which has a
number of variants, involve burning powdered coal in a bed of pulverised
limestone.
In the years up to the placing of the Drax contracts in 1988, the former
Central Electricity Generating Board weighed the various options for
cleaning up the station. Given the size of Drax - six 660MW units - it is
perhaps hardly surprising that the options it considered were the FGD
routes.
This was the prevailing philosophy in the early- to mid-1980s. European and
Japanese utilities were making use of the wide range of FGD choices
available, says Mr Granville Camsey, a National Power executive director and
managing director (group technology).
All the choices, he says, involve GCE 'O-Level' chemistry. The decision on
which technology to use will be based on cost-benefit grounds, and could be
influenced by anything from the chemical content of the coal to the
availability of seawater.
The choice at Drax has emerged as comfortably the most popular of the four
main FGD routes. This is the limestone-gypsum process, used on about half of
the 180 gigawatts of power plant fitted with FGD equipment worldwide.
The process uses the alkaline calcium carbonate in naturally occurring
limestone to capture the sulphur dioxide by contact with the flue gas in a
wet scrubbing vessel.
The byproduct, apart from water, is gypsum (calcium sulphate), the raw
material for plasterboard and other products used in the construction
industry. This consequently gives the process a commercial aspect that is
often lacking in environmental clean-up technology.
The second most popular FGD route is the regenerative process, which also
involves wet scrubbing and has a commercial spin-off. This uses a
sodium-based alkaline scrubbing liquor to capture the SO. The spent liquor
can be treated so that it can be used again, and the separate stream of
SO-rich gas can be sold or turned into sulphur or sulphuric acid, for use by
the chemical industry.
The two other main FGD processes are seawater washing, which uses the
natural alkalinity of seawater to remove the SO from the flue gas in a wet
scrubbing vessel. Air and fresh seawater are added to the scrubbing liquor
to neutralise pH levels before it is returned to the sea.
There are snags, however. There are no commercial byproducts; huge amounts
of seawater are required; and the flue gas has to be reheated for the
process to work, which is costly, leaving large quantities of warm seawater
to be returned whence it came.
In the fourth process, spray drying, powdered lime is injected into a dry
scrubbing vessel and the SO is removed by contact with humidified flue gas.
A solid by-product, a mixture of calcium sulphite-sulphate-carbonate and
flyash, can be partly re-used in the process but has no commercial use.
Spray-drying is not really an option for a large baseload plant such as Drax
because it it only captures about 50 per cent of the flue gas, compared with
as much as 90 per cent for the limestone-gypsum process, says Mr Camsey. It
would be more suitable for a power station used only for peak loads.
As it happens, there is a similar reason for preferring the limestone-gypsum
process than taking an entirely different tack, which is to use low-sulphur
coals instead of FGD. These coals, available on the international market,
typically have a sulphur content of about 0.8 per cent, about half that of
UK coals, so their use would only halve SO emissions. Low-sulphur coals can
be used with FGD, although that would reduce the amount of gypsum
by-product.
Since the old CEGB decided on its FGD route for Drax, priorities have
changed for utilities such as National Power, all of which have a
responsibility to reduce emissions. The question now is less likely to be
'Which FGD route should we use?' than 'Is it commercially more viable to use
FGD or start afresh?'
The 'dash for gas' - in the UK and elsewhere - is evidence of how this
question is being answered. Widespread acceptance of gas as a fuel for power
generation is relatively recent, but its use in combined cycle power
generation produces electricity more efficiently and more cleanly than
large-scale coal-burning.
As for clean coal technologies, the focus has switched from FGD with its
high installation costs to processes which are promising for greenfield
sites but cannot economically be retrofitted.
The big power equipment suppliers are spending heavily on two main methods
of fluidised bed combustion: pressurised FBC and circulating FBC. The latter
has so far won greater commercial acceptance but PFBC is coming up from
behind with strong backing from Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group.
Mr Camsey's preferred clean coal choice, however, is IGCC. National Power is
participating in a European Union-backed project to build a 350MW IGCC plant
in Spain, due to be commissioned in 1997. Another IGCC demonstration plant,
designed by Shell and located at Buggenum in the Netherlands, is now being
commissioned.
Unlike the modern boiler technologies, which are dependent on coal, IGCC
could offer flexibility of fuel use between coal and gas, says Mr Camsey. As
the costs of IGCC equipment come down and if gas prices rise relative to
coal, it could be retrofitted onto a combined cycle plant.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (1): Power station will
cut pollution - The impact of the FGD units will be felt throughout Britain
and, to a lesser extent other parts of Europe which have long complained
about the acid rain emanating from the UK
</HEADLINE>

Mr Barry Fincham and his colleagues at National Power were not impressed
when a party of Japanese visitors to the Drax power station in the early
1980s suggested they followed their example and built facilities to lower
sulphur emissions. 'We all thought it was a bit of a joke,' he recalls.
They have had to change their minds. A decade or so later Mr Fincham has
just completed his 33-year career in the electricity industry with a
six-year stint overseeing the construction of the flue gas desulphurisation
(FGD) units which the Japanese recommended.
The Pounds 700m project passed its first milestone recently, just before Mr
Fincham retired, when Babcock, the largest contractor, handed over to
National Power the first two of the six FGD units which are scheduled to be
built by 1996.
The construction of the units is not the kind of story which can capture the
public imagination in the way that, say, the Channel Tunnel, has. But its
environmental and economic impact has been, and will be, felt throughout the
country and, to a lesser extent other parts of Europe, including
Scandinavia, which have long complained of the acid rain emanating from the
UK.
The size of Drax, named after a small village near the site in north
Yorkshire, means that almost anything coming out of or affecting the power
station has widespread consequences. It is western Europe's biggest
coal-fired power station, generating about 10 per cent of England and
Wales's electricity needs or enough electricity to satisfy the needs of half
of inner London.
Design, construction and manufacture of the FGDs constitutes one of the
largest environmental projects in the world. Building the FGDs has provided
employment for 2,500 people with peak activity requiring 1,700 employees on
site. More than 90 companies have been involved with contracts ranging from
hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Pounds 420m of work undertaken by
Babcock.
For some companies the project has been a turning point. 'Drax has set us on
our feet again,' says Mr Ivan Harris, engineering director of Birtley
Engineering which had a Pounds 25m contract to build the materials handling
system for the project. 'It put us on the map as a mechanical handler and
has given us the references to win contracts elsewhere including Saudi
Arabia.'
The fact that Birtley, Babcock and other contractors were able to pass the
first stage of the contract into National Power's hands on time and within
budget will be seen as a significant achievement for British industry, and
one that perhaps 10 years ago would have been unimaginable on such a
large-scale project.
Days lost through industrial action on the project amounted to less than
0.25 per cent.
But while the project - and allied programmes to reduce nitrous oxide
emissions - has been welcome for an economy which was either in recession or
growing slowly for much of the past six years, its most long-lasting effects
are likely to be on the environment .
Fitting the FGD units will cut 90 per cent of the more than 250,000 tonnes
of sulphur dioxide which are emitted from the plant each year. It will also
make a hefty contribution to the UK's target of reducing emissions to 60 per
cent of 1980 levels by 2003, as part of a worldwide effort to reduce the
acid rain which causes such environmental damage.
If the coal lobby were to have its way, National Power and PowerGen, the
other main generator in England and Wales, would follow the lead of their
counterparts in western Germany and fit FGDs to each of their coal-fired
power stations. That would give a far better chance of survival both for the
25 remaining coal-fired stations and the remnants of the coal industry which
in the past 18 months has shrunk from 50 to 22 pits.
If current trends continue - that is, if gas-fired electricity and nuclear
power increase their market shares as expected - there will be about 15
coal-fired power stations by the end of the century and no more than a
handful of pits to service them.
The chances of FGDs being fitted to any more than Drax and two or three
other coal-fired stations are remote. Later in the decade, National Power
may consider building more FGD units for burning Orimulsion, a bitumen-based
fuel imported from Venezuela, but it is unlikely to add any to its 17
coal-fired stations other than Drax.
PowerGen, with seven coal-fired stations, is already building an FGD plant
to clean about 2,000 megawatts of electricity at its Ratcliffe power
station, but there are doubts that it will fulfil the strong indications
given in its flotation prospectus three years ago that it would build a
similar facility at its Ferrybridge C power station.
Although the government has said it expects PowerGen to fit 4,000MW of FGD,
the company is likely to argue that it should be relieved of any obligation
at Ferrybridge because of the contribution it is making to cutting sulphur
emissions by replacing coal-burning stations with gas-fired plants which are
more environmentally friendly.
'We will continue to make future investment decisions on a step-by-step
basis as emission targets and market circumstances require,' the company
says.
When Scottish Power was privatised, the company anticipated building 2,000MW
of FGD at its Longannet power plant but there are strong doubts both at the
company and among environmentalists about the worth of doing so because of
the low sulphur content of Scottish coal.
One possibility is that Scottish Power be relieved of some of the
requirement on it to reduce sulphur content in return for contributing
financially to an FGD construction in England and Wales.
The generators' reluctance to commit themselves to anything other than Drax
and Ratcliffe is explained by the cost. National Power says the Drax FGD
will add 0.6p a unit to the cost of producing electricity which compares
with about 2.6p per unit for power traded in England and Wales's wholesale
electricity pool.
It argues it cannot simply pass all of this through to the customer because
that would lead to its losing market share to new independent companies
producing electricity from combined cycle gas turbine generators.
The company's critics say National Power can afford to absorb the cost
increases following its stronger-than-expected financial performance since
privatisation and the value to the company of coal contracts agreed with
British Coal earlier this year.
Whatever the arguments, Mr Granville Camsey, National Power executive
director for group technology, says the company is willing to pay a price
for the environment.
'Any industrial enterprise that doesn't take responsibility for the
environment will lose out,' he says. 'Increasingly towards the end of the
decade, investors will choose companies with high profiles on the
environment. You can no longer afford to take a de minimis approach.'
But Mr Camsey also acknowledges that National Power would be unable to
satisfy the requirements of the government's pollution inspectorate on
reducing sulphur emissions had it not constructed the Drax FGD. Its
construction of gas-fired power stations, which produce virtually no
sulphur, are unlikely to be enough.
Drax employees are unlikely to be too concerned about the motives of
National Power and the Central Electricity Generating Board, its predecessor
prior to electricity privatisation, for building the FGDs.
The 630 workers know that most of them will have a job until well into the
next century if they want one. Not many employees at coal-fired power
stations can have anything like that kind of confidence.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Generator re-ignites row over coal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity generator, yesterday re-ignited the
controversy over coal policy. It said the cost of producing power from
combined-cycle gas stations was nearly 30 per cent higher per unit than from
coal-fired plants which they are replacing.
The company's breakdown of costs, which it had kept confidential until
yesterday, will provide ammunition for the coal lobby as it prepares to
fight a new round of expected pit closures.
Coal industry supporters have argued that distortions in the market rather
than the economics of producing power from different sources are responsible
for the contraction of the coal industry and the so-called dash for gas.
Separately, the government's pollution inspectorate indicated that it
expected PowerGen, the other large generator in England and Wales, to
proceed with fitting 2,000MW of flue-gas desulphurisation equipment in
addition to the 2,000MW it is already building.
In its flotation document three years ago PowerGen indicated plans for
building 4,000MW of FGD equipment. The coal lobby regards this as a
commitment but PowerGen has held back from ordering the second 2,000MW. The
inspectorate said it looked forward to the 'satisfactory completion' of
8,000MW in the generators' gas desulphurisation programme. This implies an
expectation that PowerGen would complete 4,000MW.
The inspectorate's statement came as National Power marked the opening of
the first phase of its 4,000MW FGD project at its Drax station in North
Yorkshire. Mr Roger Witcomb, National Power's UK director of business
planning, said the cost of electricity from combined-cycle gas turbines
running flat out was about 2.7p per kilowatt hour, compared with 2.1p from
older plants they are replacing. The 0.6p difference was the same as the
cost of fitting and running FGDs at Drax.
The coal lobby will see the figures as strengthening their argument that the
UK should invest more in FGDs rather than retire coal-generation plants
early.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Sports Council censured for lax finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sports Council, the government body which promotes sport in Britain, has
been severely censured by Whitehall auditors for poor administration of
public funds and for being unaware that its senior executives had business
interests which conflicted with their official duties.
In a damning report on the council's activities published last night, the
National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, said the
council 'did not provide full transparency of the benefits and cashflows'
between itself and several bodies it had set up to help administer sports
grounds.
The report said the council 'had not established the necessary arrangements
to avoid potential conflicts of duty or interest within the Council group'.
The NAO listed several business ventures in which council officials,
including the director-general and former finance director, had private
interests.
The NAO said it had discovered no evidence of financial impropriety. But Mr
Alan Williams, a Labour member of the Commons public accounts committee,
said he found it hard to understand the logic of the council's financial
arrangements.
The NAO had three main criticisms:
The council had not established a 'full arms-length' relationship with other
bodies within the Sports Council group, so that accounting arrangements were
confused.
The council's financial arrangements did not protect the taxpayer's
position. Three years ago, the council created a charitable company called
the Sports Council Trust Company, which administers Pounds 33.77m in assets,
including leading sports centres. The NAO discovered that the company's
officials would be in breach of their duties if they were to re-transfer
assets to the council or to the Exchequer.
The full council was not notified of conflicts of interest involving its
officials. Neither the director-general nor the finance director had, for
example, declared shareholdings in a company acquired by the Sports Council
Trust Company in 1990.
Yesterday the council stressed that the NAO's criticisms covered only a
small part of its operations. It said the cited conflicts of interests
related to businesses which were already within the Sports Council group
rather than outside it.
The NAO's report will go to the public accounts committee, which will
question officials at a meeting on February 21.

The two youngest sons of a couple who died in the M1 Kegworth air crash five

FT  14 JAN 94 / Power 'bills' issued to foil VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
East Midlands Electricity is sending blank 'bills' to millions of customers
to help them avoid the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
The 'bills' are going to 2m homes and invite people to pay as much as they
like in advance for their power.
Customers who build up credit will avoid the 8 per cent fuel tax which
begins on April 1. Next year it rises to 17.5 per cent.
The company said: 'It is no different from hearing that petrol prices are
going up in the Budget - and driving straight to the garage to get a full
tank.'
The carbon tax proposed by the European Commission would have nearly the
same effect on consumers as the government's plans to put VAT on household
fuel, a report argued yesterday.
The tax to help combat global warming would raise the price of household
fuel by about 18 per cent, according to a paper published in the Consumer
Association's policy review journal.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Safety executive to cut jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Health and Safety Executive is cutting 230 jobs in the next two years
because of reductions in government funding.
Trade unions have linked the cuts to what they claim is a lower priority on
health and safety laws. The GMB general union said: 'This confirms the
government's real intention not to enforce effective health and safety laws.
Between April 1986 and April 1992, 3,513 people were killed due to accidents
at work. The government has the lives of future workers in their hands.' In
the latest public expenditure round the HSE's funding falls from Pounds 195m
in 1992-93 to Pounds 190m in 1994-95. The 1995-96 figure is Pounds 192m,
Pounds 10m less than requested.
Mr John Rimmington, director-general, has assured staff it should be
possible to achieve 100 job cuts this year and 130 next year by natural
wastage.
The GMB has been campaigning against any weakening of health and safety
rules in the de-regulation bill to be published next week.
Unison, Britain's largest union, has signed a no-strikebreaking agreement
with Manpower, the employment agency.
Manpower, which placed 66,000 people in temporary employment last year, said
it had agreed not to support strike breaking or to let agency staff cross
picket lines.
In return, the public services union has agreed not to obstruct commercial
opportunities open to Manpower. The deal is designed to keep the agency and
the union on friendly terms.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Legal challenge to Thorp granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, yesterday won permission from
the High Court to bring a legal challenge to the government's licensing of
the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.
Lancashire county council, whose region is about 30 miles from the source of
the proposed radioactive emissions, has joined Greenpeace in the challenge.
Its scientific advisers have warned that the plant's emissions could exceed
the government's recommended safety levels.
The council said: 'A public inquiry is necessary to test our scientists'
findings against those of (the government's) scientists.'
The date of the judicial review has been set for the week beginning February
7. The plant's licence comes into effect on Monday, when British Nuclear
Fuels, the plant's owner, will begin moving used nuclear fuel rods stored in
ponds at the plant's entrance to ponds further inside.
Greenpeace and the county council have decided not to ask the court for a
formal order which would halt operations until after the judicial review
because BNF has indicated that preliminary tests will continue for another
month. Greenpeace expects the judicial review will take place before the
500m-long plant becomes fully contaminated with radioactivity.
Ms Bridget Woodman, Greenpeace's Thorp campaigner, said that yesterday's
ruling, which was reached in less than an hour, was 'a small victory'. She
added that Greenpeace would argue in the judicial review that 'the
government made an illegal decision to allow Thorp to operate before holding
a full public inquiry'.
BNF has opposed a public inquiry, which could delay operation of the plant
for months. It originally expected approval to proceed a year ago.
Mr David Bonser, director of Thorp, said yesterday: 'Leave (to bring a
judicial review) is only the preliminary stage of the legal action. The real
battle will come next month.'

The tax to help combat global warming would raise the price of household

Mr Mark Pearson, author of the study, also estimates that there would be an

food would rise by less than 1 per cent, however, he says.
The proposed tax on energy and its carbon content has been the European
Commission's main plan for curbing emissions, the aim of the climate-change
convention agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. European Union countries
ratified the convention before Christmas, but have not yet agreed to adopt
the carbon tax.
The UK and France have strongly opposed the proposals.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Temporary reprieve for Elstree Studios
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Elstree studios, birthplace of successful cinema and television productions
such as Capital City, has won a temporary reprieve from demolition.
Yesterday the High Court ruled that Hertsmere borough council had an
arguable case for insisting that the owner, Brent Walker, keep the site
open.
The Hertfordshire studios, where Laurence Olivier made his screen debut, was
used to make blockbusters such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Star Wars,
Superman, and the Indiana Jones adventures.
Brent Walker has given an undertaking not to proceed with demolition,
pending a full hearing of the council's case. The company has outline
planning permission to develop half the site as a retail superstore. Last
year it announced that the studios complex on the other half would close
because it was under-used.
But the council says it was a planning condition that the area would be kept
for film and TV production until 2015.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Labour attacks curbs on debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, yesterday rejected Labour's
claims that the government was treating parliament with contempt by the
repeated use of the guillotine to curtail debate on controversial bills.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, complained that the three pieces
of legislation that had completed their passage through the Commons since
the current session opened in November had been guillotined. She said: 'No
other government has shown such disregard for parliamentary safeguards which
have grown up with good cause over the years.'
Her complaints came shortly before a debate on the Non-Domestic Rating bill,
which went through the last of its Commons stages yesterday. The measure,
which aims to cushion businesses from the impact of increased rates bills,
gained its third reading without a vote after a stormy two-day passage.
Mr Newton said Labour's campaign of procedural 'trench warfare' had left the
government with no alternative but to guillotine yesterday's bill. He said
that 'boring and repetitious' speeches by Labour MPs had prevented the bill
being carried through all its stages on Wednesday as the government had
planned.
Mrs Beckett said there was no justification for the guillotine on the
business rates bill, particularly when the government itself had brought
Wednesday's debate to a premature end. She added that Labour had started its
procedural campaign when ministers forced through bills to increase
employees' National Insurance contributions and make employers fully
responsible for statutory sick pay on successive days before the Christmas
recess.

FT  14 JAN 94 / BAe plans another 580 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace plans to cut a further 580 jobs in its Avro regional jet
activities at Woodford, near Manchester, to reduce costs and improve
competitiveness after the setback in its partnership negotiations with
Taiwan.
The cuts will reduce the company's regional jet workforce of about 3,000 by
nearly 20 per cent.
At the peak three years ago there were about 8,000 workers at Woodford and
Hatfield, Hertfordshire. BAe has since shut down Hatfield and concentrated
regional jet activities - which involve the production of RJ Avroliners and
BAe 146s - at Woodford.
The company said this had led to savings of about 30 per cent, but it is now
seeking to cut costs further after difficulties in negotiating a regional
jet joint-venture agreement with Taiwan Aerospace.
Talks have now been suspended, although BAe yesterday said it was
maintaining a dialogue. The company has held talks with other manufacturers
over possible collaboration in the regional jet sector, which is suffering
from overcapacity in a depressed market.
BAe made a Pounds 750m after-tax provision in its 1992 accounts to cover its
loss-making regional jet activities. For the past 12 months it has tried to
reach a joint-venture agreement with Taiwan to secure the future of its
regional jet operations.
The company told unions before Christmas that in spite of the suspension of
talks it intended to pursue its regional jet activities on its own as a
result of the productivity gains and cost savings from concentration of
production.
But the latest job cuts suggests the company is having to intensify its
drive to cut costs in the face of continuing pressures.
The Avro regional jet activities delivered 17 aircraft last year compared
with a peak production of about 40 three years ago. It also won orders for
11 aircraft last year.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Adams is 'open to persuasion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, is 'very open to being persuaded' that
the Downing Street declaration provides a basis for an end to the IRA's
military campaign, he said yesterday.
But in a long statement he insisted that there was a need for clarifications
of the declaration and for 'immediate and unconditional dialogue with both
governments'.
He said Sinn Fein would respond positively to efforts to close a perceived
gap between the Hume-Adams peace initiative - which was launched last
September by Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party - and the Downing Street declaration. But he accused the
British government of being 'belligerent, arrogant and provocative' in
statements subsequent to the declaration last December.
'I am quite confident that the IRA would respond positively to a package
containing the principles, process and dynamic (of the Hume-Adams
initiative) . . . up to now I do not have any political package with which
to approach the IRA,' he said.
Mr Adams said that key issues in Sinn Fein's strategy were that the British
government should end partition 'and hand over sovereignty to an all-Ireland
government', that the British government should 'influence unionist
attitudes' in this direction, and that the London and Dublin governments
'should consult together to seek agreement on the policy objective of ending
partition'.
He said a viable peace process was 'dependent on the adoption of the
(Hume-Adams) proposals by the two governments'. Mr Hume has already welcomed
the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Adams lays great emphasis on the British government becoming 'persuaders'
of the unionist community in Northern Ireland to accept an all-Ireland
solution, a point which has been emphatically ruled out by the UK
government.
The Irish government insists that many of Sinn Fein's concerns have been
addressed by the joint declaration, and has attempted to persuade the party
to accept it by offering further clarifications, lifting a 20-year
broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, and an immediate seat at a new 'peace forum'
in the republic if the IRA ended its military campaign.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Trust hospitals to publish chiefs' pay under ethics code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Codes designed to strengthen ethical standards and accountability in the
National Health Service were published yesterday in the wake of serious
criticisms of mismanagement and financial waste.
Boards running hospitals and health authorities will be required to declare
members' private interests and income from NHS sources. This will mean
publishing salary details of chief executives and other executive directors
of trust hospitals, which previously did not have to be disclosed.
The NHS's reputation for probity has been seriously dented by recent reports
from the Commons public accounts committee on mismanagement in the West
Midlands and Wessex regions. These concluded that at least Pounds 20m had
been wasted in Wessex and Pounds 10m in the West Midlands, and spoke of
evidence of conflicts of interest, concealment of information and
shortcomings in managerial and financial control.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday that criticisms
from the public accounts committee and the Audit Commission were justified.
All corporate and personal conduct in the NHS must be underpinned by
accountability, probity and openness, and the new codes set out corporate
standards that the public could expect to apply.
The codes, drawn up by a working group established last year, will be
introduced in April. Consultation on their final form will take place until
February 18, but the main elements will include defining more clearly the
functions of chairmen and non-executive members of NHS boards; require
boards to establish audit and remuneration committees, and record all board
members' private interests relevant to NHS business.
Accounting, tendering and employment practices, said Mrs Bottomley, must
reflect the highest personal standards. 'Chairmen and board members should
act impartially and should not be influenced by social or business
relationships. No one should use their public position to further their
private interests.'
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the proposals would do
little to raise NHS standards of accountability and did 'not begin to
address the real concerns raised by the scandals in Wessex and the West
Midlands'.
The codes emphasise that it is unacceptable for any NHS board or individual
to 'ignore public service values in achieving results'.
Some trust hospitals have been criticised for paying senior executives
salaries that are high by public-sector standards, or not disclosing
remuneration details. Mrs Bottomley said she did not think it appropriate
for her to set pay ceilings throughout the service. There might be local
circumstances where it was appropriate to pay an above-average salary.
The government hopes, however, that the requirement to publish details will
eliminate any potential for abuse.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Men under 45 form bulk of redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Men under the age of 45 make up the largest number of those made redundant
in Britain and are twice as likely to lose their jobs as women, according to
statistics published yesterday by the Department of Employment.
A total of 262,000 redundancies were recorded for the three months prior to
the 1993 labour force survey, of which 169,000 were men and 93,000 women.
Two out of every three men made redundant were under the age of 35.
One in five of those made redundant had found paid employment by the time
they were interviewed compared with one in four a year earlier.
The Department of Employment said this showed that 'although fewer
redundancies had been made in 1993, a smaller proportion of those made
redundant managed to find jobs afterwards'.
As many as a third of all those made redundant in the period covered were
from south-east England (77,000), though the number was down from the
101,000 recorded in that region a year earlier. Wales and East Anglia
produced the lowest numbers of redundancies.
Half those losing their jobs were from the service sector and roughly a
third from manufacturing industries. Construction had the third-highest
number of redundancies.
Craft and skill-related workers accounted for about 20 per cent of all
redundancies while higher than average redundancies took place among plant
and machine operatives as well as clerical and secretarial jobs.
The highest proportions of people receiving redundancy payments last spring
were professional and technical staff.
The figures also showd that as many as 440,000 Irish nationals live in
Britain, with more than a third of them in London and more than half over
the age of 50.
They are more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population, with
13 per cent jobless last spring compared with 10 per cent for the labour
market as a whole.
Irish nationals are also more than twice as likely to work in the
construction industry compared with the rest of the population. As many as
38 per cent of them over the age of 16 have no qualification compared with
26 per cent for the rest of the population.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Ulster's hopes begin to fade: Prospects for the Downing St
declaration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The air of anxious expectation has all but evaporated. The most ambitious
attempt in 25 years of violence to persuade the IRA to swap the gun for the
ballot box looks like running into Ulster's blood-stained ground.
There are still faint hopes. No one can second-guess the IRA leadership with
any certainty. But Mr John Major's government is on the verge of
acknowledging that there is no immediate prospect of an end to the killing.
There are no regrets in Whitehall. Many of the politicians and officials who
negotiated last month's Downing Street declaration did so as much in hope as
expectation.
Even if, as the government now expects, the hawks in the IRA insist that the
military campaign continues, the UK-Irish declaration might yet prove the
foundation stone for peace.
The IRA has been isolated internationally. The mood in Northern Ireland has
changed. Mr Major's disavowal of any selfish or strategic British interest
in the province will render the republican charge of imperialist occupation
that much harder to make stick. Ministers remain hopeful that they have made
a small start to a process which will lead to the progressive isolation of
the men of violence.
So if Mr Major is being blamed for everything else these days, few at
Westminster will retract the praise with which they greeted a courageous
initiative.
Nor will the government's expected decision to press on without Sinn Fein
with the search for an internal political settlement in Ulster close the
door to the possibility of peace.
Mr Major will make it clear that the talks process cannot be paralysed
indefinitely by Sinn Fein's public equivocation. But that does not mean that
the offer of a place at the negotiating table will be retracted. The Downing
Street declaration will not be withdrawn.
The British government is not going to tell the IRA that because it has not
stopped killing by the end of this month, it has no alternative but to go on
doing so. In the words of one insider, the IRA will continue to hold the key
which could unlock the door to peace.
Nor should we expect the draconian security clampdown predicted by some in
the province. On one level it is simply unrealistic. As long as Northern
Ireland remains part of a democracy, there is not much more the government
can do beyond the measures already in place. On another, it would be foolish
to allow the hardliners in the IRA to claim that they had been right all
along in rejecting the peace initiative.
Internment - or selective detention as it is now known - remains a real
option if the violence threatens to escalate out of control. But without an
equivalent move in the republic, the costs could be higher than the
benefits.
The government has not changed its view that there is a significant faction
at the highest levels of the IRA in favour of a political settlement. For
all his attacks on Mr Major in recent days, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, is still seen as a dove.
Viewed from London, the position of Mr Martin McGuinness appears more
obscure. In spite of his repeated denials of involvement in the military
campaign, Mr McGuinness is said to be the chief of staff of the IRA. The
assessment in London is that in recent weeks his stance has straddled the
peace and war factions.
But overall, the opaque picture which emerges from the intelligence reports
circulating around Whitehall is that the opposing camps of IRA doves and
hawks have concluded that no deal could be struck without splitting the
movement. Mr Adams and his allies are unwilling or unable to contemplate
that prospect.
For his part Mr Major indicated again yesterday that he will not be drawn
into the dialogue sought by Mr Adams to 'clarify' the Downing Street
declaration.
In London's view the Sinn Fein leader is seeking negotiation, not
clarification. His recent insistence that Sinn Fein could take no decisions
until its convention at the end of February is seen as part of the same
strategy.
Mr Major must be conscious, however, that it will not be easy to relaunch
talks on a political settlement without Sinn Fein. Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish premier, has invested too much political capital in the exercise to
admit now that it has failed. He is likely to press for further efforts -
clarification if necessary - to entice the IRA to the negotiating table.
The prime minister will also have to persuade Mr John Hume, leader of
Ulster's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, that he is not
giving up too soon. Without the agreement of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume there
is no prospect of a deal among the province's constitutional parties.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Recovery 'faltering' in west Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in the west Midlands appears to be flagging as fewer
manufacturing companies report growth in domestic orders and service
companies confront sluggish export demand.
These points emerge from a survey of business performance covering 652
companies, which was carried out by the west Midlands regional group of
Chambers of Commerce and is published today.
The survey said the proportion of manufacturing companies reporting
increased domestic orders slipped to 37 per cent in December 1993 from 40
per cent in September. However, 32 per cent of manufacturers said export
orders were up, compared with 30 per cent in September.
For service companies, the position was reversed. The proportion of
companies receiving more domestic orders in December than in September was
38 per cent. Three months previously the proportion had been 35 per cent.
But only 27 per cent of service companies reported higher export orders in
December, compared with 34 per cent in September.
The pattern of orders suggests companies are carrying substantial amounts of
unused capacity into this year. The survey showed that, in December, 20 per
cent of manufacturers and service companies were working at full capacity.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Milk market left in disarray by delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 3bn milk market in England and Wales has been thrown into
disarray by the government's decision earlier this week to delay plans to
open it up to competition. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
rejected a plan for reorganising the Milk Marketing Board into a producer's
co-operative in time for the board to be abolished by April 1.
The market liberalisation could now be put off until the beginning of July
or even October, with the board remaining the statutory buyer and seller of
milk until then.
Some dairies have threatened to by-pass the board from April, even though it
would be technically illegal. 'My fear is that a Sunday trading situation
will develop if a lot of companies break the law,' said Mr Richard Smith,
who heads the Northern Milk Partnership.
The uncertainty has cast a shadow over some investment plans. 'While there
is this insecurity in the market, it is difficult to commit money to capital
investment,' said Mr Roger Clarke, commercial director at MD Foods, which is
holding back investment of up to Pounds 12m until the situation is clearer.
The Milk Marketing Board has to address important issues such as its plans
for selling milk in the new competitive environment, transfer of assets to
the new co-operative and haulage arrangements before it can gain approval
from government.
The Ministry of Agriculture is then expected to put the board's plans to
another consultation period which could take three months.
The milk marketing year begins in April, when farmers make their financial
plans for the coming season. The abolition of the board part way through the
year makes it difficult to plan ahead.
In addition, the board generally pays farmers a premium of up to 3p per
litre for milk during the summer in an effort to encourage production in a
slack period.
Farmers fear the board will abandon the practice this year in order to
preserve its cashflow before abolition.
Board officials, in an attempt to reassure farmers, stress it is just a
delay they face rather than any fundamental changes to the new market.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Manual staff at ABB get 5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Transportation, formerly Brel, the engineering subsidiary of British
Rail, has agreed a 5 per cent wage rise for its 3,800 manual workers. In
return they will give up the principle of last-in/first-out for those facing
redundancy.
ABB, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri conglomerate, said it was
keen to preserve its skill base and feared that if the last-in/first-out
principle enshrined in the collective agreement was maintained it could lose
key workers it had recently recruited. 'We will in future be able to select
who is made redundant,' it said.
The increase will improve the basic wages of skilled workers to Pounds
233.84 a week from Pounds 222.70. Last year ABB imposed a wage freeze on its
employees who work at plants in York, Crewe and Derby.
The agreement was concluded after prolonged negotiations with the RMT rail
union and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering unions. It does
not apply to the company's white-collar staff who have been offered a 2.5
per cent pay increase this year.
In the event of future redundancies, ABB management is to introduce agreed
criteria for deciding who should leave. This will cover length of service,
qualifications and skills, flexibility, attendance, and the quantity and
quality of work carried out.
Since April 1989 when the company was privatised, its workforce has fallen
from 9,000 to 5,000. Last year a third of ABB's 1,500 employees at the York
plant were made redundant under the old method but, as a result, the company
lost some workers it badly needed to retain.
The company said last night that it had no plans for more redundancies at
present.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Industrial tribunal research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers are more likely than employees to consider the outcome of their
cases at industrial tribunals to be fair, says research published yesterday,
Lisa Wood writes.
A random sample of cases covering unfair dismissal, redundancy payments, the
wages act, and discrimination in 1990-91 were examined in the research
published in the Employment Gazette, the official journal of the Department
of Employment.
Two-thirds of the participating employers thought the outcomes to be fair,
compared with half of the applicants.
About 70,000 applications to industrial tribunals are made each year, the
majority of them concerning unfair dismissal claims.
The study also found that two-thirds of all claims were either settled or
withdrawn before reaching a full hearing; of the one third that went to a
full hearing just less than half were upheld. The average payment made to
those whose cases were upheld was Pounds 1,490.

<TEXT>
British bank notes in circulation in the week to January 12 were 6.5 per
cent above the level in the same week a year ago, the Bank of England said.
Although this was below the 8.6 per cent recorded in the previous week, and
the 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29, it indicates buoyant consumer
spending. The week to January 12 had no bank holidays, so may be a more
reliable indicator than the two previous weeks.

Phone users will be able to take their numbers with them when they change
telephone companies, under plans announced yesterday by Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said its studies showed there
was 'a very strong and robust case for the introduction of phone number
portability'.
Competitors to British Telecommunications say that the inability of users -
particularly businesses - to take their phone numbers with them when
swapping operators is a significant barrier to competition.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Lloyd's offer faces a fresh blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on two more loss-making Lloyd's syndicates look set to reject the
insurance market's Pounds 900m settlement offer, designed to end litigation
by some 17,000 individual members, who have traditionally supported the
market's capital base, Richard Lapper writes.
Both syndicates - Pulbrook 90 and 334 - face losses from so-called long-tail
liability claims, many of which are emerging many years after the original
inception of policies.
One hundred and forty eight of the 168 Names on syndicate 334 and 161 of 201
Names on syndicate 90 who responded to surveys by Names, said they would
reject the offer.
Names on 334 have been offered about Pounds 2.5m to compensate for actual
losses of more than Pounds 35m in 1985, while Names on 90 have been offered
about Pounds 1.5m in compensation for losses sustained during the 1982 year.
A legal case by syndicate 334 Names is expected to come to court next month.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Major lukewarm on Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over the conduct of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry looked set to
continue yesterday after the inquiry was given only a lukewarm endorsement
by the prime minister.
Speaking four days before he is due to give evidence to the inquiry, Mr John
Major said: 'The government appointed Lord Justice Scott to conduct an
independent inquiry. I believe it is therefore for him to draw up his own
procedures and it is not a matter for the government to comment upon those
procedures and I have no adverse comments to make on them.'
His question-time comments came the day after Lord Howe, the former foreign
secretary and deputy prime minister, criticised the conduct of the inquiry
and issued a veiled threat that its eventual recommendations would be
considered invalid by officials and ministers.
It emerged yesterday that Lord Howe told friends - including former
government colleagues - as early as last July of his disquiet about the
procedures being followed by the inquiry.
'He was sufficiently exercised personally about the inquiry to criticise it
without anyone coming to beg him to do so,' said a former colleague.
Nevertheless Lord Howe's attack on the inquiry was being described inside
and outside Westminster as 'politically powerful' and one which could have
an even bigger impact in the longer term.
Conservative backbenchers were expected to use it in any parliamentary
debate after publication of the Scott report, expected in the autumn.
One high-ranking political source said Tory MPs would claim that the inquiry
had used unfair procedures if current or former ministers were singled out
for criticism.
Lord Justice Scott yesterday appeared to be trying to distance himself from
the row. An official said his priority was to proceed with his inquiry,
which will resume public hearings on Monday, when Mr Major is to give
evidence.
The conduct of the inquiry was backed last night by Ms Elizabeth Symons,
general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants.
'Thanks to Scott we have had a more public explanation of the inner workings
of government and that is a good thing,' she said.

FT  14 JAN 94 / CrossRail project is approved by consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 2bn CrossRail project to link London's Paddington and Liverpool
Street stations has been approved by consultants commissioned by the
Department of Transport to evaluate the scheme and consider proposals to
reduce the cost.
The consultants' report rejects alternative routes and recommends that plans
for the line should include six stations - one at Holborn in addition to the
five proposed by British Rail.
The report, from a consortium of consultants which included Bovis and
Alexander Gibb, concludes that keeping all options open for stations will
make it easier to raise private finance for the project.
The final decision over CrossRail is expected to be taken by the cabinet
next week so that the legislation needed to proceed with the project can
resume its parliamentary passage.
The project is strongly opposed by the Treasury, which is unwilling to
commit more than the Pounds 64m already earmarked in spending plans for the
next three years. It argues that demand for transport into central London
has eased and congestion declined.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, is coming under intense pressure to
back CrossRail from business leaders and the City Corporation, the local
authority for London's financial district.
Cancellation of the project would be a blow to London First, the
business-led initiative established with government backing to promote
London in the absence of a city-wide local authority.
Mr Stephen O'Brien, London First's chief executive, has also warned against
attempts to scale down the project by opening fewer stations or reducing the
line's capacity. 'This would be exactly the short-sightedness that will do
London no favours in the future,' he said.
Demand for transport projects such as the M25 London orbital motorway and
the Thameslink north/south rail line has been underestimated in the past, he
says.
Keeping all possible station options open could make it easier to finance
CrossRail, the report says.
The BR plan is for five stations: Paddington, Bond Street, Tottenham Court
Road, Farringdon and Liverpool Street. The report says the parliamentary
bill to build CrossRail - due to enter its committee stage in the Commons on
January 25 - should include permission for a station at Holborn.
The private sector promoter that wins the contract to build the line would
then have maximum flexibility to attract finance from property developers
wishing to develop sites along the line. Developers have said that most of
the cost of building the line could be raised from joint ventures to exploit
the development potential of sites above the stations.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Smaller civil service forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top civil servant in the Office of Public Service and Science yesterday
predicted a 'generally smaller' government and civil service in the
mid-1990s with its functions limited to the essentials.
Mr Richard Mottram, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office responsible
for carrying out the government's public-service reform initiatives, said
government would concentrate on a few core functions over the next few years
 -resource allocation, strategic and policy issues, procurement of services,
and essential finance and personnel work.
He acknowledged this amounted to a 'very large challenge in raising quality
and reducing costs' - but defended progress to date in putting out to tender
Pounds 1.5bn of work done by departments.
Mr Mottram, addressing the Royal United Services Institute, said about
Pounds 1bn of work had been hived off since last November - either
contracted out or entrusted to executive agencies - with a further Pounds
800m due to be allocated in the current year.
On the defence sector, Mr Mottram - who previously served in the Ministry of
Defence - said there was still scope for reform.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Tax change hits property schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced a change to its tax legislation which
will affect the ability of some property owners, such as London's Canary
Wharf, to take advantage of tax breaks in enterprise zones.
The rule change could have a severe impact on the viability of enterprise
zone trusts, which are tax-based property investment schemes for private
investors, said investment adviser Mr John Spiers of BESt Investment. Some
property developers in enterprise zones would regard the change as a 'a
breach of faith', he said.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the
government was rectifying a weakness in its capital allowances legislation,
by which property owners have been able to retain the benefit of their tax
allowances when they sold a long lease in the building.
The announcement could seriously delay Canary Wharf's ability to take
advantage of several hundred millions of pounds of capital allowances.
Yesterday it cancelled plans to launch an enterprise zone trust, as a result
of the announcement.
Mr Patrick Garner, finance director of Canary Wharf, said that the change
'in no way affects the viability of Canary Wharf'. Shareholders had not
factored in the benefits of the capital allowances into their calculations
in making their decision to take the scheme out of administration, he said.
The new rules will make it more difficult for some property owners to take
advantage of tax breaks by selling parts of their buildings to investors.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Bank is urged to shake up markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is likely to introduce changes in the sterling money
market and government bond market after yesterday's release of two reports
criticising some existing arrangements.
The reports say the Bank must make changes to its sterling money market
operations if London is to remain competitive as a financial centre and
fight off rival claims from other European cities.
In the reports, funded by the Corporation of London, Mr Norbert Schnadt, of
the financial markets group at the London School of Economics, blames the
Bank's mode of operation in the money market for recent volatility in the
overnight interest rate - it has ranged from about 4.5 per cent to nearly 20
per cent.
Mr Schnadt's main recommendations are:
The Bank should replace outright bill purchases in its money-market
operations with repurchase agreements (repos). The Bank would then lend cash
against a wider set of eligible securities, including government bonds
(gilts), as collateral.
The Bank should extend the ability to borrow and lend gilts to a wider range
of financial institutions, with the aim of establishing an 'open gilt repo
system'.
Treasury receipts should be paid into secured bank accounts rather than into
the Exchequer accounts at the Bank, to reduce the size of the money-market
shortage and make it more predictable.
Britain should not introduce positive minimum reserve requirements.
The result would be to allow a wider set of financial institutions and
instruments to be involved in the Bank's operations, while making the
money-market shortage more predictable and reducing the volatility of the
overnight rate. The Bank says it is already working on some of the concerns
expressed. It has already taken steps to reduce money-market shortages by
introducing a fortnightly 'sale and repurchase', or gilt repo facility with
effect from January 20.
Mr Schnadt suggests the next logical step would be for the Bank to make more
frequent use of the repo facility, which should make the idea of an open
gilt repo more prominent and help establish a 'master' or standard repo
agreement.
The Bank seems unlikely to do this, and may instead move towards an open
gilt repo system. There are concerns over whether banks and building
societies are big enough holders of gilts for this step to be feasible, so
the Bank might have to consider ways to improve the attractions of gilts for
these holders, for example, by having more short-dated issues or by issuing
floating rate gilts.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Fewer companies leaving London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies moving out of central London has fallen to its
lowest level since 1964, says a report by Jones Lang Wootton, chartered
surveyors.
The number of companies moving more than 100 jobs out of the capital fell to
eight in the year to September 1993, compared with 23 in 1992 and 37 in
1991. The number of jobs being moved out also fell sharply from about 11,000
in 1992 to about 3,500 in 1993.
The slowdown in decentralisation reflects the impact of the recession and
the sharp decline in London property costs, relative to other UK locations.
However, 1993 could be a trough in the recent level of decentralisation
activity, the report says. JLW expects 27 companies to move out of London
between 1994 and 1996, which is similar to the trends in the late 1980s.
Two-thirds of companies planning moves are expected to choose new premises
in the south-east. JLW said this was a significant break from the recent
trend of organisations making long-distance moves to cut accommodation costs
and improve labour availability.
It attributed this change to the 1995 rating revaluation, which is likely to
reduce the cost of rates in the south-east compared with other parts of the
country. In addition, the introduction of an Pounds 8,000 ceiling on
tax-free relocation expenses for each employee last July has reduced
companies' enthusiasm for moving long distances.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Safety executive to cut 230 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Health and Safety Executive is cutting 230 jobs in the next two years
because of a reduction in central government funding.
Trade unions have linked the cuts to what they claim is a lower priority on
health and safety laws. The GMB general union said: 'This confirms the
government's real intention not to enforce effective health and safety laws.
Between April 1986 and April 1992, 3,513 people were killed due to accidents
at work. The government has the lives of future workers in their hands.'
In latest public expenditure round, the HSE's funding falls from Pounds 195m
in 1992-93 to Pounds 190m in 1994-95. The 1995-96 figure is Pounds 192m,
Pounds 10m less than requested.
Mr John Rimmington, director-general, has assured staff it should be
possible to achieve the 100 job cuts this year and 130 next year through
natural wastage.
The GMB has been campaigning against any weakening of health and safety
rules in the de-regulation bill to be published next week.
A letter from Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, to Mr Frank Davies,
chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, suggests the government is
backtracking from earlier plans after taking advice from the commission.
Mr Forsyth appeared to concede that 'much of the perceived burden on
employers is unnecessary in that it stems from a misunderstanding of the
law'. He favoured 'clear and accessible guidance' for employers as the key
to an effective health and safety system.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Lautro imposes Pounds 130,000 fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fines amounting to Pounds 130,000 and costs of Pounds 20,000 have been
imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry,
on Crown Financial Management, the life insurance and pensions subsidiary of
Crown Life in Canada.
The fines, among the highest imposed by Lautro, are for Crown's failure to
maintain responsible control of its internal affairs, and its employment of
Mr Alan Joyner as a sales agent.
Mr Joyner, who worked for the company for six months in 1991, was convicted
of activities associated with illegal deposit-taking - a business Crown
allowed him to continue to operate - and is serving a custodial sentence of
three years.
Breaches of Lautro rules, accounting for Pounds 80,000 of the fine, were
discovered in a Lautro inspection in 1992.
The charges included failure to ensure sales representatives were
proficient, and helping them to cheat in examinations.
Lautro also highlighted Crown's failure to ensure that its sales
representatives followed 'best advice' in activities such as transfers out
of occupational pension schemes.
Mr Malcolm Berryman, who became Crown's chief executive after the period of
the offences, emphasised yesterday that Lautro had paid a further visit last
May and was satisfied with the internal systems. He said Lautro agreed that
in the 180 or so cases it had examined the problem was poor record-keeping
and that there had been no disadvantage to clients.
Crown has carried out its own investigation into more than 1,000 other
cases, and found four cases of potential client disadvantage, in which they
offered compensation.
Mr Berryman said there had been a change of management at Crown, but this
was coincidental rather than caused by the compliance problems.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Manpower signs deal over strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unison, Britain's largest union, has signed a no-strikebreaking agreement
with Manpower, the employment agency.
Manpower, which placed 66,000 people in temporary employment last year, said
it had agreed not to support strike breakers or to allow agency staff to
cross picket lines.
In return, the union has agreed not to obstruct commercial opportunities
open to Manpower. In effect, the deal is something of an employment peace
treaty designed to keep the agency and the union on friendly terms.
Manpower said it would not encourage its employees to join the union but
agreed that it would issue union enrolment forms at the time of interviews
and 'point out the benefits of union membership'.
Manpower said: 'We offer them the opportunity to join a union appropriate to
the work they are doing.
'It is entirely their choice but we draw people's attention to it.'
The company said that as a matter of policy it did not allow itself to be
used for strike-breaking.
The union signed a similar agreement with the Reed Care employment agency in
June which covered care assist-ants.
Mr Keith Sonnet, assistant general secretary, said: 'The agreement widens
our influence over the treatment of temporary staff and will enable us to
look after their conditions of work more closely.
'It guarantees temporary staff will not be used where industrial action is
taking place or be substituted for permanent staff.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Ex-oil chief denies BCCI fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial health of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International was
fraudulently exaggerated by the former head of an international oil company,
who signed bogus documents to help inflate the bank's profits by Dollars
90m, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
The allegation was made on the opening day of the first criminal prosecution
over the collapse of BCCI to go before a UK jury.
Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, denies 16
charges relating to the furnishing of false information about the bank's
finances.
Opening the prosecution on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office, Mr Brian
Barker QC said the main perpetrator of the fraud had been Mr Basheer
Chowdry, a former manager of BCCI's UK division. Mr Chowdry had left for
Pakistan after the collapse of the bank in June 1991 and was now out of
reach of the British authorities, he said.
'If we could have had him in the dock we would have done,' he continued.
Mr Chowdry, along with other BCCI staff, created a series of accounts in the
name of Attock Oil which falsely stated that it owed Dollars 90m to BCCI.
They enabled Mr Chowdry and others to successfully 'pull the wool over the
eyes' of Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, who endorsed the bank's
accounts, complete with over-stated profits, Mr Barker said.
The accounts falsified the financial positions of BCCI and Attock in four
areas - management fees charged to Attock, service charges and transactions
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Paris-based
International Arab Investment Bank.
Mr Baqi took part in this exercise between September 1986 and April 1990 by
writing letters to Price Waterhouse that confirmed Attock Oil owed the money
to the bank.
'Mr Baqi signed and wrote a series of letters to the auditors confirming
that various large amounts were genuine when they were nothing of the sort.
They were a sham and a fake,' Mr Barker said.
'The letters from Mr Baqi deflected any further challenge from the auditors.
That meant for some considerable time that this fraud remained undetected,'
he continued.
Price Waterhouse had understood Attock Oil to be a company that was
completely separate from BCCI. The reality was that it was 'inter-meshed'
with BCCI, Mr Barker said. Both had offices in the Cayman Islands which were
used to put through transactions.
After the bank's collapse in 1991, Mr Baqi left the country. When he
returned in February 1992 he was arrested and questioned by police. He told
them BCCI had effectively owned Attock Oil and that he 'did what he was
told' when given documents to sign.
The fraud enabled the bank to retain existing deposits and perhaps attract
new ones. Mr Baqi might have benefited by keeping his well-paid job with
Attock Oil, Mr Barker said. The trial continues today.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Former leader attacks 'dictatorial'
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Weeks, former leader of Westminster council, last night attacked
the basis for the inquiry in which he said the district auditor had acted as
the 'prosecuting counsel, judge and jury'.
He said the council's actions on housing policy had been approved as legal
by Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a Queen's Counsel who specialises in local
government, on three separate occasions between 1987 and 1993.
Mr Weeks, who is still a Westminster councillor and works as a marketing
executive at the Lovell construction group, said Mr Magill, the auditor, had
taken a 'naive and dictatorial view' of how councils ran their housing
policies.
Mr Weeks said party political issues had been one consideration in the
council's actions but not the only one. Mr Magill had been incorrect 'in not
seeing a role for party politics' in the council's activities in housing.
'Party politics is a fact of life in local government,' said Mr Weeks.
Any shredding of documents that may have taken place had been a 'normal
part' of people disposing of files after they moved jobs.
Mr Weeks said he had not shredded any papers personally because he did not
have an office at the council and did not keep papers for any length of
time. Over the next few weeks he would be writing to Mr Magill to set out
his views formally.
Mr Weeks was leader of Westminster from 1991 to last year. He was a key
player in Westminster council's policies in the late 1980s. He said it was a
'misconception' that the council had formulated its housing policies on the
basis of 'tramping around in the undergrowth' when it had taken careful
advice from Mr Sullivan.
He added: 'We (the council members) knew what we wanted to do and he (Mr
Sullivan) told us it was legal. We went ahead on the basis that the policy
was legal and I am still sure that it was legal.'
He said that Mr Sullivan had been asked to provide an opinion on three
separate occasions, in 1987, 1989 and in May last year, and each time gave
the same answer that the council's actions were within its legal powers.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: MPs see threat to Major's position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shocked Conservative MPs were last night absorbing the details of the report
into Westminster council which some think threatens the leadership of Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
Most repeated warnings by Mr Major and other cabinet ministers that MPs
should not 'rush to judgment' on the provisional findings released by the
district auditor.
A few also sought to minimise the impact of the report by drawing attention
to auditors' investigations into the financial problems of the
Labour-controlled councils of Monklands in Strathclyde, Liverpool, and
Lambeth, south London.
Mr Bernard Jenkin (Colchester North) said that Westminster council was 'one
of the best housing authorities in London'. He told laughing Labour MPs: 'It
is not a crime to encourage home ownership.'
But there was mounting gloom in the Conservative ranks as MPs thumbed
through unofficial copies of the unpublished full version of the district
auditor's report.
Labour MPs said the full report contained even stronger criticism of
Westminster Conservatives than had been expected.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, gleefully drew attention to
repeated previous endorsements by cabinet ministers of Westminster as a
Conservative flagship council.
He said the report showed that the Conservative party had abandoned basic
principles of public morality by putting party interests before the public
good. The Conservatives had ignored the laws and conventions which separated
functioning democracies from banana republics.
Mr Straw added: 'Arrogance, incompetence and utter contempt for those who
disagree with them have led to the systematic disregard of those laws and
conventions by the Tory party.
'The public interest, and the Tory party's internal interest have, in the
minds of leading Conservatives, become indistinguishable. The public's
government has become the Tory party's private fiefdom.'
The allegations against Westminster councillors dominated Mr Major's first
appearance at question time since the Commons resumed after the Christmas
recess.
Amid rowdy scenes, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, labelled the report 'a
devastating example of financial corruption and the abuse of power by senior
members of the Conservative party'.
Mr Major retorted: 'If the allegations are confirmed, I condemn it
unreservedly. But as has been made clear, this is the start of the legal
process.
'Unlike you, most people will prefer to wait until that is completed and not
to find people guilty until and unless they are proven to be guilty.'
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, also urged MPs to reserve judgment
until the auditor's final report was completed.
However, he added: 'If these allegations turn out to be supported and
proved, no one will be tougher in opposition to them or in my insistence
that the law should take its course.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Legg refutes allegations of
impropriety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South-West, was chief
Tory whip during his 12-year spell as a Westminster councillor and thus
played an important role in formulating council policy, David Owen and Peter
Marsh write.
Mr Legg said yesterday: 'I utterly refute any suggestion of impropriety.
When the time comes for me to put my case I will be answering in full the
matters raised in the report.'
Mr Derrick Conner, treasurer of the Bletchley Conservative Club, which lies
in Mr Legg's constituency, said: 'I can't pick any holes in his performance
as an MP. As far as I am concerned he is innocent until proved guilty.'
Since being elected to parliament in April 1992 for the new constituency of
Milton Keynes South-West, he has made his mark as an astute member of the
Treasury and civil service select committee and as a Maastricht rebel.
A co-founder of the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward, he was among the
hard core of Tory backbenchers who most uncompromisingly opposed the
Maastricht bill's passage in the Commons last year.
This stance will have won him few friends in the Conservative whips' office.
Mr Legg, an accountant, is a former director of the food group Hillsdown
Holdings, remaining as a consultant until last year. He received a Pounds
200,000 severance payment when he left the board after becoming an MP.
Labour - which lost out last time by nearly 4,700 votes - would be
disappointed not to take his seat even in a general election. If a
by-election were to result from yesterday's report it would expect to win
with a large majority.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Council feels weight of damning
criticism - Authority acted with 'disgraceful and improper purpose' / Effect
on homeless people attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster city council yesterday suffered arguably the most damning
criticism a district auditor has ever made of an English local authority.
The Conservatives' local government flagship had in the provisional opinion
of Mr John Magill, the district auditor, been guilty of 'gerrymandering' -
defined by Collins dictionary as 'dividing constituencies of a voting area
so as to give one party an unfair advantage'.
It did so through its policy of 'designated sales', in which council houses
were left vacant until they could be sold to middle-income families who
would not otherwise have been able to buy their own home. The policy had
been introduced in 1974, but only about 20 houses were sold each year.
But in 1986 the Conservatives came close to defeat in the local elections,
with their overall majority slashed from 26 to only four seats. In July 1987
the housing committee decided to expand the programme radically, with about
500 sales each year.
Mr Magill has drawn up a report running to more than 200 pages which details
his provisional findings. It is an offence under the Local Government
Finance Act to reveal information gained by a district auditor in the course
of his duty, and so it is not possible to quote from this.
However, Mr Magill issued an 11-page statement about his provisional
findings.
He said in the statement that he believes a decision was made to move likely
Conservative voters into marginal wards.
Nine wards were identified as 'key' marginals and eight were later targeted
as 'battlefield' wards.
He said: 'Both the decision to increase the number of designated sales and
the selection of the properties designated for sale were influenced by an
irrelevant consideration, namely the electoral advantage of the majority
party. I am minded to find as a fact that the electoral advantage of the
majority party was the driving force behind the policy of increased
designated sales and that this consideration was the predominant
consideration which influenced both the decision to increase designated
sales by 500 per annum and the selection of properties designated for sale.
'My provisional view is that the council was engaged in gerrymandering,
which I am minded to find is a disgraceful and improper purpose, and not a
purpose for which a local authority may act.'
The attempt to gain political advantage was not the only element of the
sales policy condemned by Mr Magill. His statement attacks both the
consequences for the homeless in the borough, and the expense involved. He
said: 'No local housing authority acting reasonably would adopt a policy,
the anticipated consequences of which were that the number of homeless
households placed in temporary accommodation would increase by 172 each year
and that the net revenue costs to the council would increase, as a result,
by over Pounds 1.5m in each succeeding year on the previous year's costs.'
Westminster ignored both its statutory duties to the homeless, and even
failed to consider the needs of 'Category A medical cases', who need to be
rehoused urgently if their condition is not to deteriorate.
According to professional valuations, the council lost Pounds 13.3m by
selling the properties at a discount to their open-market values.
Homeless families were put into temporary hotels while council flats were
left vacant. Accommodation costs came to just over Pounds 2m.
The housing committee also introduced a scheme of capital grants to existing
secure tenants to purchase non-council accommodation. Mr Magill said his
provisional view was that this was unlawful as the payments were not
authorised by statute and such powers which the council had were exercised
for a 'disgraceful and improper purpose'. The grants totalled Pounds 2.6m,
he said.
So many documents were printed to identify the best wards to target that
Magill estimates the illegal expenditure on them at Pounds 5,000.
Westminster council continues to argue that the policy is legal, citing
opinion from a barrister in its support. Mr Miles Young, the new leader of
the council, said the policy was intended to boost home ownership and
support social cohesion in an area of the country where property prices were
artificially high.
However, Mr Neale Coleman, a former councillor and leader of the objectors
who first called for the report, said that details of the report, which he
had studied, made it 'absolutely clear' that the council's legal advice had
been abused.
Labour also said that Westminster had expanded its policy since Mr Magill
started his work 4 1/2 years ago, to 'export' the homeless by housing them
in newly built developments in outlying London boroughs.
The 10 people named in the auditor's statement are Dame Shirley Porter,
former leader of the council; Mr Barry Legg, former chief Tory whip; Mr
David Weeks, council leader after Dame Shirley resigned in 1991; former
councillors Mr Peter Hartley, Mr Michael Dutt and Ms Judith Warner; Mr Bill
Phillips, former managing director; Mr Robert Lewis, former deputy city
solicitor; Mr Graham England, housing director; and Mr Paul Hayler,
divisional director in the housing department.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Tory Lords question publication
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hailsham, the former Conservative Lord Chancellor, last night
questioned the publication of the district auditor's provisional findings.
During exchanges on a government statement to the Lords he said: 'What would
one think of a judge who, halfway through a case, said he was minded to find
the accused guilty but that the accused would have the opportunity of making
his defence?
'Grave charges ought not to be made unless the person accused has the right
to rebut.
'I understand that the right of the accused in the present case to rebut the
charges has yet to be made. I am deeply concerned at what has happened.'
Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar, a former Conservative cabinet member, demanded
if this procedure was 'usual or unusual'.
And Lord Elton, another Tory ex-minister, suggested that the case should be
treated as if it were sub judice.
Lord Campbell of Alloway, a Tory, said that from information published
'there doesn't appear, so far as I can see, to be any evidence as to those
very serious charges or of misappropriation of funds'.
The Conservative Earl of Onslow suggested that Britain was taking the matter
'miles more seriously than any other country in Europe' would have done. He
said: 'Lambsdorff got away with murder. France is corrupt up to its eyeballs
and the Italians and Spaniards are the same.'
The Earl of Arran, junior environment minister, defended the district
auditor's actions and added that technically the provisional report was not
sub judice.
He also said it would be 'extremely unwise' for Westminster City Council to
continue its policy of designated sales while it was still under
investigation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Magill, author of the critical report on Westminster Council, is a
low-key accountant who is highly regarded within the profession and has
gained a reputation for local government work over many years, Andrew Jack
writes.
He is one of a small group of accountants who act as district auditors to
Britain's local authorities.
He is a senior partner with Touche Ross, the UK's sixth largest accountancy
firm, which is responsible for a number of district audit contracts, and has
been the firm's lead partner on work for the Audit Commission, which
oversees the district auditors, since 1983.
He was appointed auditor to Westminster City Council in 1986 and also holds
the role for Buckinghamshire County Council, Luton Borough Council and St
Albans District Council.
He has not been afraid to make strong criticisms in the past. In a previous
special report on Westminster he called the sale of three of the council's
cemeteries to a Panamanian-registered company for 15p in 1987 'unlawful,
unauthorised and to the detriment of rate-payers'.
Mr Magill has been a partner with Touche Ross since 1975 and became national
director of accounting and auditing in 1987. In this role he represented the
firm in its ultimately successful appeal to the House of Lords after it was
sued for alleged negligence in relation to its audit of a company acquired
by Caparo Group.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Officials may face public hearings
in the autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster councillors could be required to face public hearings in the
autumn following the critical report from the district auditor.
After four years of investigation, yesterday's statement was a heavily
edited version of the auditor's report of his provisional findings.
There will be at least several more months before a final version of the
report is released.
Mr John Magill, the district auditor from accountants Touche Ross, has
invited anyone in the council, those mentioned in his report or the original
objectors who triggered his investigation, to submit written responses by
July 29.
He asked anyone wanting to make oral representations to him on his findings
and views to make a request in writing by February 28.
He must then decide on grounds of 'justice or the public interest' whether
to hold an oral hearing and if so whether to hold it in public or private.
He said that an a hearing the onus would be on the objectors who raised the
original complaint with him to prove any allegations made. The process would
be similar to a court hearing, with opportunities for cross examination and
the submission of evidence.
Only after any hearing would Mr Magill decide whether to use his powers
under the 1982 Local Government Finance Act.
If he concluded any action was lawful but implemented with reckless
indifference, he could surcharge officers without reference to a court.
If he believed the action was unlawful, he could seek a declaration from the
court to this effect.
The court has the power to impose surcharges and disqualify for a period
those responsible from being a member of the local authority.
Touche Ross said yesterday that anyone criticised in the report could seek
judicial review on its procedures and findings, but that in the past the
High Court had ruled that any complaint should wait until the final report.
At this point, there is a statutory right of appeal.
The Westminster report, which has so far cost an estimated Pounds 1m, is one
of a number of special investigations triggered each year by complaints or
issues raised during the annual scrutiny conducted by district auditors.
Last year there were 31 objections lodged and 14 final 'public interest'
reports published. Many others were rejected.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Party chiefs heaped praise on
'flagship'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A history of praising Westminster city council makes it almost impossible
for the national Conservative party to distance itself now.
Westminster, which has always been Conservative-controlled, emerged as a
Tory 'flagship' in the late 1980s.
In 1990, the year the community charge or poll tax was introduced,
Westminster and neighbouring Wandsworth were promoted by Mr Kenneth Baker,
then Conservative party chairman, as 'flagship boroughs'. Results from the
two boroughs dominated the headlines the day after the local elections that
year, where elsewhere in the country Conservatives made serious losses.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, yesterday relished
publishing details of previous praise heaped on Westminster by ministers
during the campaign.
In 1990 Mr David Hunt - now the employment secretary but then minister with
responsibility for the community charge - described Westminster's election
performance as a 'stunning success' and 'a source of cheer for every
Conservative'.
Mr Baker, in his memoirs, describes the council as being led 'with verve by
Shirley Porter . . . with spirit and imagination she had cut back
expenditure but improved services'.
Westminster's role as a 'pioneer' for ambitious Conservative policies has
continued. Its council tax is one of the lowest in the country and is
proudly displayed on a banner in City Hall. It has also introduced a series
of controversial reforms. These have not been thwarted by the district
auditor's investigations.
Only last month Westminster became the first council to invite the private
sector to take over its day nurseries. The council is in the forefront of
extending competitive tendering beyond manual blue-collar services.
It also took a more confrontational stance in last year's dispute between
the government and the teachings unions over national curriculum testing.
Westminster sent a letter to headteachers threatening that those who refused
to co-operate in carrying out national curriculum testing 'should have
deductions made from their salary'.
It also said that deductions from teachers' pay would be made. The move was
widely interpreted as an attempt by the government to persuade other
education authorities to take a similar stance, although eventually the
tests were boycotted in all Westminster schools, and the council took no
action.
Dame Shirley Porter was the figurehead of the flagship. Leader for eight
years until 1991 and then mayor of Westminster for a year, she was arguably
the best-known Tory politician in the capital.
However, she was no stranger to financial controversy, the most famous
incident being the decision by the council in 1986 to sell three cemeteries
for a total of 15p. In 1990 the district auditor found no case for
surcharging councillors over the cemeteries, which had been valued at more
than Pounds 15m, but the decision opened the council to ridicule before the
1990 elections.
The council rode out that storm, but the repercussions of the
'gerrymandering' allegations could last much longer.

FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminister Report: Legg refutes allegations of
impropriety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South-West, was chief
Tory whip during his 12-year spell as a Westminster councillor and thus
played an important role in formulating council policy, David Owen and Peter
Marsh write.
Mr Legg said yesterday: 'I utterly refute any suggestion of impropriety.
When the time comes for me to put my case I will be answering in full the
matters raised in the report.'
Mr Derrick Conner, treasurer of the Bletchley Conservative Club, which lies
in Mr Legg's constituency, said: 'I can't pick any holes in his performance
as an MP. As far as I am concerned he is innocent until proved guilty.'
Since being elected to parliament in April 1992 for the new constituency of
Milton Keynes South-West, he has made his mark as an astute member of the
Treasury and civil service select committee and as a Maastricht rebel.
A co-founder of the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward, he was among the
hard core of Tory backbenchers who most uncompromisingly opposed the
Maastricht bill's passage in the Commons last year. This stance will have
won him few friends in the Conservative Whips' Office.
Mr Legg, an accountant, is a former director of the food group Hillsdown
Holdings, remaining as a consultant until last year. He received a Pounds
200,000 severance payment when he left the board after becoming an MP.
Labour - which lost out last time by nearly 4,700 votes - would be
disappointed not to take his seat even in a general election. If a
by-election were to result from the shadow which yesterday's report has cast
over Mr Legg's political career, it would expect to win with a large
majority.
He first ran for parliament in 1983 when he challenged Mr Derek Foster, now
Labour chief whip, for the safe Labour seat of Bishop Auckland, losing by
4,300 votes. Mr Foster remembers him as a 'fairly conventional Tory
opponent'.
Last summer Mr Legg co-authored a radical pamphlet recommending ways of
cutting Pounds 8bn from the social security budget. Ideas included raising
the retirement age to 67 and integrating non-contributory benefits into a
new 'whole-person' benefit.

Amnesty International accuses the US of executing innocent and mentally ill
people, in a report to be released today, Reuter reports in London.
The death penalty in the US was arbitrary, racist and more expensive than
imprisonment, the human rights group said. It has written to President
Clinton calling for an urgent presidential commission into the death
penalty.
The London-based group said one man on death row in the US was cleared last

the US for executing people in the last five years for crimes committed when
they were minors.

Venezuela's financial authorities yesterday decided to suspend Banco Latino,
Venezuela's second largest commercial bank in terms of assets, from the
national bank clearing system, said Mr Jose Bouza, president of the
Venezuelan Banking Council.
Banco Latino's cheques will thus not be accepted for clearing as of today,
although Mr Bouza said no decision had been made on government intervention
in the bank.
Banco Latino, whose shares trade on the Caracas Stock Exchange, is the
centrepiece of a group that includes other large financial and leasing
institutions. Mr Bouza said the bank had been the victim of reports of
financial difficulties which had prompted depositors to withdraw large
amounts.
Venezuela's economy suffered a 1 per cent contraction in GDP last year and
there is concern that the recession will have a big impact on weaker
commercial banks.

<TEXT>
Children in Thailand who labour in back-alleys assembling goods, or who sell
themselves as prostitutes, might be reassured to know that the US government
has taken up labour rights cases such as theirs.
US officials say that threats made by the US Trade Representative to
eliminate duty-free status on Thai goods, and on imports from other
developing countries, under the US Generalised System of Preferences GSP,
have produced 'concrete actions' on labour conditions throughout the Third
World.
In a recent report, Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative, noted with
satisfaction that the Thai government has approved draft legislation which
brings worker rights 'closer to international norms'.
Final enactment is expected before the next session of the Thai parliament
ends in late July. Meanwhile, Mr Kantor's office will be monitoring
progress.
It is also watching in Malawi, Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia and other
countries where labour organisers are often jailed or murdered, where the
growth of unions is curbed, where workers are exploited and ill-treated, and
where conditions are unnecessarily hazardous.
For the past decade, US law has required the trade representative to use GSP
benefits to press for improvement in workers' rights in developing
countries. The law was passed despite objections in the 1980s of the Reagan
administration, which never seriously attempted to implement it unless
unfriendly governments were the accused.
The Bush administration improved enforcement, fearing a loss of flexibility
when the GSP came up for congressional renewal. But it investigated labour
petitions with nothing like the enthusiasm it displayed in pursuing
violators of intellectual property rights.
Activity has quickened with the arrival of Mr Kantor as trade representative
under the Clinton administration which began a year ago. He began his law
career helping migrant farm workers. Cases filed at the trade agency by
labour and human rights groups are now seriously investigated and programmes
have been set up to prod various governments.
In its most recent review, the representative's office closed cases against
Costa Rica and Paraguay, these having enacted labour rights legislation. It
commended Malawi's release of a labour leader, Mr Chakufwa Chihana, from
prison and noted that free union elections are scheduled there for early
this year.
'We are terminating the review on the basis of these actions, with the
expectation that union elections will be free and fair and conducted on
schedule,' Mr Kantor said, adding a warning that any reversal of this trend
would lead the US to reopen the case.
The representative gave Guatemala six months to continue progress in
training and hiring labour inspectors, and in reducing the backlog of unions
applying for formal recognition. Oman, too, was given a further six months
to show progress, after it had agreed to joint the International Labour
Organisation and begun to revise its labour laws.
Mr Kantor said a case against El Salvador could be dropped soon if, as
expected, it passes revised labour legislation before the end of the current
legislative session in March.
Although trade officials complain they are not being given sufficient
credit, human rights and labour activists say Mr Kantor still allows foreign
policy considerations to play a role in his office's findings.
'In countries like Mexico, facts fly out the window,' says Mr Pharis Harvey,
executive director of the International Labour Rights Education and Research
Fund.
However, he added, labour groups are at least getting the same 'respect'
from trade officials as business representatives. 'We are no longer seen as
something akin to plague of locusts.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU turns screw in banana row - Latin
Americans divided over what Brussels says is its 'last' offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American banana exporters meeting in Costa Rica were yesterday divided
over whether to bow to intense European Union pressure to accept Europe's
proposed new banana import regime.
Acceptance would end a two-and-a-half year row that has sullied relations
between Latin America and Europe. The row has also embarrassed the EU by
exposing its preferential trading arrangements with former colonies as
illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
It would offer several Latin American exporters improved quotas in Europe's
protected banana market, but would legitimise a quota-based regime at a time
when the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation, finalised a
month ago, has demanded all quotas be converted to tariffs as a first step
to elimination of protection.
The issue has come to a head this weekend because of the imminent release of
a Gatt panel report on a complaint from five Latin American countries
attacking Europe's banana regime as illegal.
A hard-hitting first panel report, released in July last year, upheld the
Latin American complaints and ruled that the Lome convention of preferential
trading arrangements between EU members and their former colonies could not
be defended as a free trade agreement, or customs union.
In a letter to the trade ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela,
Guatemala and Nicaragua, unprecedentedly signed jointly by three EU
commissioners - Mr Manuel Marn, commissioner for developing countries, Sir
Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, and Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture
commissioner - the Latin Americans were warned that the new quota offer
tabled on December 14 in the final stages of the Uruguay Round negotiation
would not be improved, and would be withdrawn if it was not accepted before
the Gatt panel report is published.
'A decision  .. is now very urgent,' the letter says. 'Once the draft panel
report is sent to the parties involved  .. the offer of December 14 could
not be maintained.'
Main beneficiaries of the new quota offer would be Costa Rica, which would
see its share of the 2.1m tonne quota for 1994 rise to 23.4 per cent from 19
per cent in 1992, Colombia, which would see a 0.8 per cent rise to 22 per
cent over the same period, and Nicaragua, its 1992 share of 1.1 per cent
rising to 1.9 per cent.
The main casualty would be Ecuador, which strategically drove its exports up
to a peak of 27.7 per cent of EU imports in 1992, in the hope of capturing a
larger quota. Its share would be 20.2 per cent.
Of the five Gatt complainants, Guatemala chose to be absent from the meeting
in Costa Rica yesterday and appears reluctant to accept the EU ultimatum.
A Brussels-based Latin American ambassador said yesterday: 'The deal is not
perfect, but it goes a long way to meeting our objectives of better market
access.'
The EC Banana Trade Association condemned the EU ultimatum as limiting
commercial choice, imposing higher costs, and encouraging over-production in
Central America.

<TEXT>
France will continue to supply Taiwan with 'non-offensive' military
equipment, as well as with spare parts for Mirage jets and frigates already
contracted for, Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, said
yesterday.
Following the Paris-Beijing announcement that French companies would sign no
new arms contracts with Taiwan, as the price of normalising French relations
with China, Taiwanese officials were reported to be worried about the
long-term supply of spare parts for French Mirages and frigates due to be
delivered from 1995-6.
France's new policy means French companies will now drop out of contention
for the FFr20bn (Pounds 2.26bn) Taiwanese tender for submarines because
these were clearly 'offensive weapons', a senior defence ministry official
said yesterday. But French companies could still supply Taiwan with such as
air defence gear and light armoured vehicles.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W consortium wins Latvian telecom deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Latvian government will today award a contract to modernise the
country's telecommunications network to a consortium headed by Cable &amp;
Wireless, the UK telecommunications group.
The contract includes the privatisation of Lattelekom, the Latvian state
operator. In return for a guaranteed Dollars 160m (Pounds 108.10m) of
investment over the next three years, the consortium will take a 49 per cent
stake in the company.
The deal is the first internationally-tendered privatisation of a state
telecommunications operator in the former Soviet Union. It follows the
partial privatisation of Matav, the Hungarian state operator, last month,
which was the first in the former eastern bloc.
C&amp;W has a 70 per cent stake in the Latvian consortium; Telecom Finland, the
Finnish state-owned operator, the other 30 per cent. The two defeated a bid
by Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator, which won the Matav contract
as head of consortium from which C&amp;W withdrew at a late stage.
C&amp;W and Telecom Finland have agreed to carry through a 10-year modernisation
plan to include the installation of at least 650,000 new digital phone
lines, almost doubling Latvia's number of phone lines.
Although Latvia has one of the former Soviet Union's more extensive phone
networks, its number of lines per head is barely half that in the UK and the
equipment is antiquated. A year ago there was a 170,000-long waiting list
for new lines.
C&amp;W's largest business is Hong Kong Telecom. The Latvian contract
strengthens its north European base. It has an 80 per cent stake in the
second national network in the UK (Mercury), and a 39.9 per cent stake in
the second carrier in Sweden (Tele2).
It also has mobile phone activities in Belarus, and a 40 per cent stake in a
company providing international services in St Petersburg.
Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said he expected the Latvian privatisation to set
a precedent for the other Baltic states.

<TEXT>
European Union exporters are optimistic about their chances of forcing
amendments to plans to harmonise insurance regimes governing medium- and
long-term export credit, following a meeting with the European Commission.
But Commission officials warned yesterday that it would be difficult at this
late stage to change the minds of national governments.
Member states' experts have been working on recommendations for
two-and-a-half years, with the aim of eliminating distortions to trade
caused by differences between export credit insurance regimes. The
Commission is poised to absorb their work into a draft proposal, which would
eventually be returned to EU members for formal approval.
A delegation of exporters, led by Mr Keith Johnson, chairman of the British
Exporters' Association, met Commission officials on Wednesday. He said
yesterday that it was 'a very, very positive meeting'.

FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Germany to relax dual-use curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German cabinet yesterday approved a series of proposals to pave the way
for Germany to comply with European rules on the export of equipment which
could be used for military purposes.
The move illustrates the willingness of the German government to allow
German companies to export dual use industrial goods which can potentially
be used for both civilian and defence purposes.
Germany and Britain have some of the strictest export rules for dual-use
goods in Europe. Germany tightened its legislation three years ago after
German chemical companies were found to have been exporting to goods to
Libya which were used to produce chemical weapons.
German companies have been lobbying to have such strict requirements
relaxed, arguing that they are placing German exporters at a disadvantage.
Members of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), both in the
parliament and in the government, have increasingly thrown their weight
behind a relaxation of arms exports rules.
The cabinet proposals aim to change the German jurisdiction so it can be
adapted to an EU directive on the export of dual-use goods. The directive,
currently under discussion in Brussels, is expected to follow less stringent
requirements applied by other EU states.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong showing for Old Masters in NY: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first major art sale of 1994, at Christie's in New York on Wednesday,
confirmed that demand for top-quality antiques is becoming steadily
stronger. The auction of Old Master paintings totalled Dollars 15m (Pounds
10m) and was 90 per cent sold by value.
Highest price was the Dollars 2.6m paid for a still life of fruit and
flowers by the Dutch 18th century artist Jan Van Huysum. Its top pre-sale
estimate had been Dollars 1.5m.
One of the last major works by the French artist Louis Boilly, who died in
1845, entitled 'A Carnival on the Boulevard of Crime', sold for Dollars
937,500. It shows low life in the Boulevard de Temple in Paris which had a
reputation for pleasure.
A still life of fruit and marigolds by the 17th century Valencian artist
Tomas Hiepes, estimated at up to Dollars 80,000, sold for Dollars 772,500,
while a typical Roman vista by Panini was at the top of its estimate,
selling for Dollars 640,500.
'We are delighted with the results,' said Rachel Kaminsky, head of
Christie's Old Master department. 'Many lots sold well above their estimates
and the market overall appears to be much stronger than this time last
year'.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amnesty International accuses the US of executing innocent and mentally ill
people, in a report to be released today, Reuter reports in London.
The death penalty in the US was arbitrary, racist and more expensive than
imprisonment, the human rights group said. It has written to President Bill
Clinton calling for an urgent presidential commission into the use of the
death penalty.
The London-based group highlighted ways in which the penalty was used. One
man on death row in the US was cleared last year but other innocent people
had gone to the electric chair, Amnesty said. It criticised the US for
executing people in the last five years for crimes committed when they were
minors.
Amnesty referred to what it called the ingrained racism of the death
penalty: '40 per cent of death row prisoners are black, compared to just 12
per cent of the population.'
It said also more than 50 mentally of ill or impaired prisoners have been
executed since 1982.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Black governor quits politics in surprise move
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Virginia Democrats had been bracing themselves for a brawl in the primary
for this year's Senate election, but Governor Doug Wilder's surprise
withdrawal from politics leaves the way clear for incumbent Senator Chuck
Robb to win his party's nomination.
Mr Wilder, who became the first elected black governor in the US in 1989,
will leave office this weekend - Virginia law allows only a single term -
but no-one anticipated he would leave politics.
In a farewell speech he said the governorship had given him 'the luxury of
political zenith I never imagined.' His election in 1989 was a striking
example of a black candidate building a multi-racial electoral coalition,
even in a southern state such as Virginia.
His efforts to move on to national politics proved less successful and his
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992 quickly fizzled
out.
In Virginia, Mr Wilder established a record as a fiscal conservative,
steering the state through a budget crisis without raising taxes. He also
succeeded last year in winning passage of gun control legislation, no small
feat in a state traditionally one of the easiest places to buy a gun in the
eastern US.
Sometimes he spoke with real fire on broad social issues, but Mr Wilder
often seemed to be driven less by political conviction than by petty
resentment, especially in his long feud with Mr Robb.
Mr Robb now seems the overwhelming favourite to win this year's Democratic
senate nomination, but he still faces an uphill race for re-election. Once
the most golden of Democratic presidential prospects, Mr Robb is now
irredeemably branded as the man who claims he 'only' had a nude massage from
a beauty queen.
His likely Republican opponent in the election for Virginia's senate seat,
Mr Oliver North, is, like Mr Robb, a decorated former Marine, but has
drawbacks of his own.
Mr North's conviction on three felony charges arising from the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages affair was overturned on the grounds that his trial was
tainted by earlier testimony that he had given to Congress under a grant of
immunity.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Lobbyists bombard Clinton health plan with heavy criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lobbying against President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan is
intensifying as Congress prepares to return to Washington this month for a
session likely to be dominated by health legislation.
A group of right-wing economists - including Professor Milton Friedman, a
monetarist Nobel prize-winner, and Mr Michael Boskin, former President
Bush's top economic adviser - yesterday issued a letter attacking any
inclusion of price controls in a reform plan. 'Your plan sets the fees
charged by doctors and hospitals, caps annual spending on health care,
limits insurance premiums and imposes price limitations on new and existing
drugs,' the 565 economists said.
Mr Alan Blinder, a member of the White House council of economic advisers,
retorted that market incentives and competition formed the first line of
defence in the administration plan, with caps on the growth of medical
spending serving only as a back-up.
But Professor Alain Enthoven, the Stanford University economist whose
concept of managed competition provided the germ for Mr Clinton's plan, said
separately that the plan was flawed by the inclusion of price controls.
Also, the New York Times reported that the American Medical Association was
circulating to other medical lobbying groups a list of 37 changes it wants
in the Clinton plan, including demands for an exemption for doctors from
anti-trust laws and the elimination of curbs on doctors' fees.
The AMA has been ambivalent about Mr Clinton's reform plan, backing away at
its half-yearly congress last month from earlier support for the idea of
obliging US employers to pay most of the cost of their employees' health
insurance - the central financing plank of the Clinton plan.
But associations of general practitioners, paediatricians and nurses have
been much more enthusiastic about a reform plan that is expected to shift
earnings away from the specialists who dominate US medical practice.
The employer mandate is also expected to be the main target for attack by
Republicans and centre-right Democrats when the reform legislation is
debated in Congress.
Doubts about core elements of the plan could undermine Congressional
enthusiasm for passing any kind of ambitious reform in this election year.
Some Republicans are already arguing that there is no urgent need for
sweeping reform.
White House officials were dismayed when Senator Pat Moynihan, Democratic
chairman of the Senate finance committee, also declared last weekend that
there was no health care crisis, insisting that he would not allow welfare
reform to be pushed aside in favour of health legislation.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Counsel decision takes heat off White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's request for the appointment of a special counsel to
investigate his involvement with the Whitewater property venture and the
bankrupt Madison Guaranty savings and loan entity appeared yesterday to have
drawn some of the sting from the controversy, at least temporarily.
Some of Mr Clinton's Republican foes kept up their attack: Senator Robert
Dole, who only a few days ago was urging Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, to appoint a special counsel, turned around and complained
that her decision to do so, at the White House's request, showed her lack of
independence.
Mr Dole had promised 'no second-guessing' on his part if Ms Reno were to
appoint a special counsel.
Late on Wednesday, though, he changed tack by pressing for a Congressional
select committee to investigate Whitewater - a suggestion seen as having
virtually no chance of approval from the Democratic majority, so long as Ms
Reno's choice of counsel is regarded as acceptable.
Mr Clinton has tersely brushed off questions about Whitewater, which have
distracted attention from his summit meeting with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin this week in Moscow.
Ms Reno declined to comment on the scope of the investigation, saying that
to do so could compromise the independence of the counsel she is to name.
Among the questions that have been raised, however, are those concerning
possible influence by Mr Clinton over thesupervision of Madison, whose
bankruptcy cost the government over Dollars 50m for the reimbursement of
federally insured deposits, and the possible channelling of money from
Madison to Whitewater or to Mr Clinton's campaign funds.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Rao must move swiftly to enact his reforms: Widely seen as a
stop-gap, Narasimha Rao is now likely to complete the full term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, Premier PV Narasimha Rao of India turned down an invitation to
speak at the World Economic Forum at Davos. With the Ayodhya mosque in ruins
and northern India torn by religious unrest, he judged it the wrong time to
try to woo the world to do business with India.
He now plans to travel to Switzerland at the end of the month at the head of
a high-powered delegation, probably to include Mr Manmohan Singh, his
finance minister and main architect of India's economic reforms.
Mr Narasimha Rao is riding high after three political victories in the past
two months. In November, the ruling Congress (I) party fared better than it
had expected in state elections; the opposition Hindu militant Bharatiya
Janata party, whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque, suffered defeat
as voters rejected its ideology.
Last month the prime minister skilfully defused a potential crisis after an
all-party parliamentary committee criticised ministers, including Mr Singh,
over their handling of the 1992 Rs40bn (Pounds 862m) Bombay securities
market scandal.
Mr Narasimha Rao capped this victory by winning over to the government
benches a small opposition grouping of 10 MPs led by Mr Ajit Singh, thereby
securing a stable parliamentary majority for the first time. Seen as a
stop-gap, he is now widely expected to complete the full term of the current
parliament, which runs until mid-1996.
He has lasted longer than any other prime minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi
family. Mr Singh, too, has grown in authority. Both are now better placed to
promote their pro-market reform than in over a year. But they do not have
much time. If controversial issues are not tackled soon, these could be
postponed indefinitely; by the end of 1994, at the latest, the next general
election will loom large in MPs' minds.
Next month's budget will test the government's willingness to carry on. But
unfortunately for the supporters of pro-market reform, the Congress party is
increasingly complacent.
The economy has made unspectacular but steady progress under Mr Singh. A
surge in exports and inward foreign investment has helped India amass nearly
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in foreign exchange reserves, against Dollars
1.1bn when reforms began. The rupee has been made convertible on the trade
account. Import duties are coming down; the 'licence raj' of government
controls has been largely dismantled.
Shares in some state-owned enterprises have been sold off in the name of
privatisation, and Mr Singh is seen in the party as having driven the wolf
from the door. MPs will accept further modest rationalisation of the
economy, but do not seem ready for the painful restructuring of state-owned
enterprises which account for half the nation's capital.
Trade unions in banking, telecommunications and other industries have
reacted angrily to suggestions of job cuts; conservatively-minded
businessmen have urged ministers to keep their interests in mind when
opening India to foreign competition.
Mr TN Ninan, editor of a leading business daily, says: 'Mental attitudes
must change, and the growing body of evidence is that they haven't changed
enough'. The government is behind schedule for cutting public borrowing. It
had planned to cut the public sector deficit for the year to the end of
March 1994 to 4.7 per cent of GDP. The real figure will be nearer 6.5 per
cent.
However, reforms have created many opportunities for Indian and foreign
companies. When he speaks at Davos, Mr Narasimha Rao will be able to say
India has made considerable progress, for example, in attracting investment
proposals in core industries such as power and petrochemicals.
With the stock market soaring in the past two months by more than 40 per
cent, fuelled by foreign investment, he will be able to claim India's
standing in international financial markets has been transformed. But
without further radical changes, it could fritter these gains away. Mr Singh
is aware of the arguments for continued reform. He has spent much time
impressing them on Mr Narasimha Rao. The budget will show how persuasive he
has been.

The governments of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Benin and Burkina Faso have imposed
price controls on imported goods, services and commodities to halt a sharp
rise in in-flation after Tuesday's 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc.
Governments in the CFA franc zone - created more than 40 years ago and
grouping 14 Central and West African nations - say the medium-term effects
on economies will be beneficial, but the devaluation sparked panic among
commercial and parastatal companies earlier in the week.
In Senegal the government has pegged the official price of rice, sugar,
bread and other foodstuffs, electricity, transport and health services at
Tuesday's level and said price rises must be officially approved.
Although devaluation had been predicted for more than three years, CFA-zone
governments had not prepared the public for the shock. There have been angry
accusations against France for removing its support for the overvalued
currency.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Smoke still obscures the outlook for Sydney: The worst may
not be over, nor is it yet clear how much damage has been caused by the
fires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week ago, Number 47 Winchester Avenue was a comfortable family house in
one of Sydney's affluent North Shore suburbs. Today it is a charred wreck,
razed to its foundations. The owners have fled, and only the ornamental
plant-holders - which, bizarrely, survived the weekend's bush-fires
undamaged - hint at the home that once was.
A few yards down the road, Number 53 has been luckier. The low-slung
residence is still intact, although the weekend blaze licked at its doors.
However, while the building was once perched on a leafy hillside, its
outlook now comprises burnt undergrowth and blackened trees.
A smell of charcoal hangs in the air, and carpet-cleaning vans line the
street. 'At least, we're still standing,' remarks one resident stoically, as
she scrubs at matting in the 30-degree heat.
These inhabitants of West Lindfield are only a small portion of the New
South Wales residents totting up damage from the past week's bush-fires. The
infernos - the worst to hit the state in more than a century - have left
four people dead, several hundred injured, and almost 200 buildings
destroyed.
Viewed from the air, the Royal National Park, a 15,000-hectare expanse just
to the south of Sydney, resembles a huge, black smudge. Across the state,
more than 600,000 hectares are reckoned to have burnt.
Even now it is hard to say with any certainty that the worst is over. All
week the authorities have urged against complacency, and yesterday the NSW
Bush Fire Services warned that the situation 'remains fairly volatile'. More
than 100 fires are still burning, although half are not viewed as dangerous,
and the main focus has shifted away from Sydney to the Gosper
Mountain/Wollemi National Park area to the north of the city.
Weather forecasts offer only moderate encouragement. While storms are
predicted, they are not expected to have a significant dousing effect - and
lightning strikes could yet hamper the fire-fighters' task. A smoke-related
haze hangs across Sydney, pushing pollution indices to about 10 times their
normal level.
Meanwhile, questions about New South Wales' handling of the disaster are
already being asked. No one queries the dedication and skill with which
fire-fighters tackled the blazes, but there are suggestions that inadequate
forward preparation allowed the disaster to get out of hand.
The problem is that NSW rarely suffers from long, dry spells, and the 10-day
stretch which led up to this week's fires was highly unusual. Nevertheless,
in a 1992-93 report, the state's department of bush fire services warned
that other government agencies should review their fire prevention and
public education strategies.
Mr Phil Koperberg, commissioner of the NSW Bush Fire Services, added that he
was 'duty bound to express concern' about the lack of action being taken to
reduce hazards. He pointed out that much of the eastern part of the state
was heavily forested and produced 'high levels of combustible material'.
'There continues to be an alarming downturn in both the quantity and quality
of those elements of fire management practices designed to reduce the amount
of such fuels,' he suggested.
This week both Mr Koperberg and Mr Terry Griffiths, the NSW police minister,
played down this prophetic caution - saying that no one had urged an urgent
response, and that immediate action would have been impossible, given the
approaching summer season, anyway. But this rejoinder has not deterred calls
for a reassessment of NSW's fire-management practices. On Wednesday Mr
Griffiths conceded that a review will almost certainly take place.
But, as the damage assessment is made, a few brighter spots are emerging.
Estimates of the cost to the insurance industry are being scaled back, for
example. The Insurance Council of Australia, the main industry group, said
yesterday it now expected insured claims to total between ADollars 50m
(Pounds 24m) and ADollars 100m, with most of this stemming from residential,
rather than commercial, policies. To date, ICA members report about 877
claims, for an expected payout of ADollars 40m.
This compares with estimates earlier in the week of ADollars 150m, and
contrasts favourably with other recent catastrophes. The 1983 'Ash
Wednesday' fires in Victoria and South Australia, for example, cost insurers
about ADollars 400m. In the US, Hurricane Andrew - which ripped through
Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 and was the nation's costliest disaster
 -brought a insurance bill of USDollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn).
That said, insurers admit that it is still hard to assess the degree to
which affected homeowners may have been either under-insured or without
insurance altogether. The ICA reckons that about 10 per cent of Australians
lack property insurance, but acknowledges that the figure can vary
enormously between areas.
'It's too early to make an assessment,' commented one official. He added
that member companies had received 'hundreds of phone-calls' from residents
in both Sydney and Melbourne, checking up on coverage levels for the future.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Malaysian success story hits currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian ringgit, one of Asia's more stable currencies over the past
year, has developed a sudden volatility.
For much of last year the ringgit stuck near the MDollars 2.52 mark against
the US dollar. In the last week of 1993 it plunged 7 per cent to MDollars
2.70 against the US dollar before bouncing back to under the MDollars 2.60
mark.
Now the currency has again dropped sharply and yesterday was trading at a
two-year low of about MDollars 2.73 against the US dollar.
Currency traders say the year-end drop was mainly due to Bank Negara, the
central bank, buying in large quantities of US dollars to revalue its
reserves and reduce year-end book losses because of foreign exchange
transactions.
Last year the bank, known in the money markets as an aggressive foreign
exchange dealer, was forced to reveal MDollars 9.3bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of
foreign exchange losses.
But this week's ringgit fall has more to do with positive factors in the
Malaysian economy. Latest estimates indicate that in 1993, for the sixth
consecutive year, Malaysia's gross national product grew by more than 8 per
cent.
The ringgit has become a victim of the country's economic success. Funds
have been flooding into the country, attracted by the strong economy,
comparatively high interest rates, and, until recently, the strength of the
currency and the bullishness of the local stock market.
This has led to excess liquidity in the financial system. To prevent
inflationary pressures building up, Bank Negara has been forced to mop up
large amounts of excess funds. A move last week to raise the statutory
reserves requirement for banks from 8.5 to 9.5 per cent seemed to do little
to ease the problems.
In the last few days the central bank has taken further action: on Tuesday
it announced measures to broaden its definition of banks' eligible
liabilities - against which the banks have to make provisions  - in order to
'capture all inflows of funds from abroad'.
Bank Negara also said that from January 17 it would impose an unspecified
limit on bank holdings from external sources which were not demonstrably
trade related or for genuine investment.
The bank's action has sent shockwaves through the currency market, with
traders moving swiftly to offload ringgit.
Foreign fund managers believe this will restrict levels of investment in the
Kuala Lumpur stock market, one of the world's leading performers last year.

Signs that improvements in the Australian economy are finally having an
effect on the nation's labour market were evident yesterday when it was
announced that the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate fell from 11.1 per
cent to 10.7 per cent last month.
This is the largest monthly decrease since July 1992, and the improvement
was far more marked than most analysts had predicted. The consensus estimate
for the December unemployment rate had stood at about 11 per cent.
The sharp decline last month will come as a considerable relief to the
Keating government.
There has been strong pressure from the country's powerful trade union lobby
and Labor party caucus for action to be taken to address the jobless
problem.
Even the coalition opposition said it 'welcomed the recent improvement in
the employment situation,' although Mr Alexander Downer, shadow treasurer,
added that 'a substantial improvement in unemployment will require
increasing levels of investment and consumer expenditure in the economy.
'It is crucial the government keep in perspective the severity of the
unemployment problem that still exists in Australia, and tailor economic
policy to reflect this,' he added, pointing to the 6.4 per cent unemployment
rate in the US.
The December figures, which represent the fourth straight month of jobs
growth, showed that 23,200 new jobs were created last month, while the
'participation rate', the percentage of working-age population either in a
job or actively looking for one, eased slightly from 63.2 per cent to 63 per
cent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Syria 'puts US links ahead of Israeli peace'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is seriously pursuing peace with Israel
but will have to clarify his intentions concerning security arrangements and
political ties if negotiations are to succeed, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli
foreign minister, said yesterday.
In an interview ahead of Sunday's Geneva summit between Mr Assad and US
President Bill Clinton, the 70-year-old veteran Israeli politician said the
Syrian leader's priority was improving relations with the US and that peace
with Israel was a by-product.
The US keeps Syria on a blacklist of nations supporting international
terrorism, obliging the US administration to vote against international
loans to Damascus.
'Assad would like to make a comeback in the international arena with the
opportunity to be helped financially, so his best address is Washington,' Mr
Peres said. 'Assad, like everybody else who looks to the next century, knows
we have come to the end of the hunting season.'
Mr Peres's remarks reflect a widespread view among senior Israeli analysts
that the summit will help unlock Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which for more
than two years have been more like pre-negotiations.
Syria is demanding the return of all the Golan Heights, the strategic
plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel has said it will
withdraw 'on' the Golan, not 'from' the Golan, but has consistently refused
to spell out its territorial offer until Damascus commits itself to a full
peace with Israel, including open borders, trade and diplomatic relations,
and comprehensive security guarantees.
The normally optimistic Mr Peres, however, believes the negotiations with
Syria will be complicated and could take some time because of the sensitive
geographical, security and geo-political implications of peace. 'Assad must
understand that as he demands territory from Israel he must be crystal clear
about his intentions on security and relations,' Mr Peres said. 'Peace
cannot be just a greeting card at Christmas.'
Mr Peres stressed the importance of secret diplomacy and the involvement of
the US and said he was unsure if agreement could be reached this year. 'We
have to see first what Assad has in his pocket.'
Mr Peres's caution is echoed by many other Israeli 'Syria watchers'. Mr Arye
Shalev, a former general and now an analyst at the Jaffee Strategic Studies
centre at Tel Aviv University, said peace with Syria would have to be deeper
than the peace reached in 1979 with Egypt. 'It must be a real peace between
people, rather than between leaders,' he said.
Mr Shalev believes that, from a military point of view, Israel must retain a
2km-3km strip of the Heights to protect Israel's northern valleys from
attack and defend the Jordan River headwaters, which drain into the Sea of
Galilee and provide Israel with 30 per cent of its water needs. He says such
a strip could be negotiated under a leaseback deal and is vital to prevent a
repetition of an incident in 1965, when Syria tried to divert the Jordan's
waters to a reservoir, or the 1967 and 1973 wars.
Other Israeli analysts are less optimistic about negotiations, pointing to
Syria's strategic relations with Iran, its involvement with Palestinian
groups opposed to peace, and the nature of Mr Assad's regime, which has
justified years of political oppression and economic stagnation on the need
to be mobilised against the 'Zionist enemy'.
However, despite the difficulties, most Israelis accept that a comprehensive
Middle East peace will depend on progress with Syria. They believe Syria
dictates policy to Lebanese officials negotiating peace with Israel and
influences Jordan.
On peace talks with the Palestinians, Mr Peres said the PLO had made a
tactical error to argue over every point blocking implementation of the
agreement for self rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
The Palestinians were losing time as all issues would be re-opened when
talks began within months on extending self-rule to the rest of the West
Bank and within two years on a permanent solution.
'The Palestinians should remember this is an interim within an interim and
they can come back later and negotiate further,' he said.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Chaebol select their core sectors: S Korean conglomerates
cut the size of sprawling business groups
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Many of South Korea's 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, have disclosed
the industries on which they plan to focus under a government policy to
reduce the size of the sprawling business groups.
The 10 biggest groups must by Tuesday select three core industrial sectors,
and the next 20 must pick two sectors, as part of a government drive to
improve efficiency and reduce their dominance of the Korean economy. At
least 14 of the 30 have made their selections, including five of the top 10.
Daewoo, the fourth-ranking chaebol, yesterday named motor vehicles, heavy
industries including shipbuilding, and trading and distribution operations
as its core business sectors.
A related company, Daewoo Electronics, is entitled to almost the same
benefits as those provided by the government under the specialisation
programme, because it has a widely-diversified share ownership structure.
Core businesses selected by the chaebol will be free of strict state
controls on borrowing and will be supported by government subsidies for
research and development.
Chaebol which dispose of non-core subsidiaries by reducing their
shareholding will be allowed to select an additional one or two core
industries.
Among others in the top 10, Hyundai has chosen motor vehicles and
electronics, but remains undecided between chemicals and heavy industries,
which includes its shipbuilding operations.
Samsung has picked electronics and heavy industries, with chemicals or
trading and distribution likely to be its third choice.
Lucky-Goldstar has selected electronics and chemicals, but remains undecided
between energy or distribution. Hanjin chose transportation (Korean Air),
shipbuilding and heavy industries, and construction.
Ssangyong picked motor vehicles, non-metal minerals and energy. Kia selected
motor vehicles, machinery and steel. Hanhwa took energy, chemicals and
trading and distribution services.
Sunkyong has decided on energy and chemicals and will probably choose
distribution over electronics, since SKC, its main subsidiary, is involved
in both chemicals and electronics.
Lotte will concentrate on food and beverage products and distribution and
will select construction over chemicals as its third sector if Hyundai and
Samsung specialise in the latter area. Other big chaebol are still
considering their options.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Loyalty pledge boosts Tokyo coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The position of Japan's governing coalition in the battle for political
reform has been strengthened by a pledge of loyalty from the Social
Democratic party, the largest but shakiest partner in the seven-party
alliance.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said last night he was confident the
four political and electoral reform bills would be adopted. He was speaking
a day after the end of the SDP's annual convention, at which a divided SDP
closed ranks enough to issue a promise to support the coalition and the
reform plans.
The government aims to put the plans to an upper house vote next Wednesday,
the last hurdle before they become law. Success in the upper house, where
the coalition has a slender majority, would further speed the biggest
realignment of the political system since the second world war.
Yesterday, a group of opposition Liberal Democratic party MPs accused the
coalition of using 'fascist' tactics to obtain agreement on reform - strong
words by Japanese standards. Separately, Premier Morihiro Hosokawa denied
press suggestions he was planning a cabinet reshuffle, to strengthen the
government's economic management and quell coalition differences.
Speculation is growing that agreement on reform will be the signal for
another round of realignments of parties and politicians. The SDP pledge of
support represents a victory by the party's moderate leaders over a powerful
left-wing minority, which fears the reforms spell disaster for the party.
The bills were 'cyanide', one such delegate said during a heated two-day SDP
annual convention which ended on Wednesday evening.
In a disappointing step for Mr Hosokawa, the SDP agreed to continue
resisting plans for a sales tax increase. This casts a shadow over any
economic recovery because it complicates the government's attempts to launch
an economic stimulus package, including tax reform, as soon as the reform
vote is over.
Leading coalition members take the finance ministry line that a drop in
income tax, seen by many as essential to pulling Japan out of recession,
must be funded by a rise in sales tax.
Analysts believe the SDP's desire to hold on to its first experience in
power in 45 years means it will compromise on tax at the last minute, just
as it is doing on political reform.
If the SDP left the coalition over tax, so bringing down the government, a
future administration would decide a far higher rise in sales tax than even
SDP moderates can accept. 'That's a compelling reason for them to stay in
the coalition,' one analyst said.

<TEXT>
The Japanese government said talks between Tokyo and Moscow on the
territorial dispute over the northern islands, originally scheduled for this
month, could be postponed due to personnel changes in the Russian
government, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The delay in negotiations could cause increased resentment among Japanese,
who have been alarmed over reports that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of
an extreme nationalist party, had threatened to bomb Japan if it pressed for
the return of the four islands, north of Hokkaido.
The Japanese government is, however, due to hold talks over bilateral
co-operation on environmental protection with South Korea and Russia this
month following the outcry caused by Russia's dumping of nuclear waste in
the Sea of Japan last year. This created tensions between Tokyo and Moscow,
which has since been calling for more foreign aid for its nuclear waste
management.

FT  14 JAN 94 / EU steel cuts deal 'politically contrived'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German steel industry faces two years of 'severe pain' following last
month's Brussels agreement on state subsidies in the European Union steel
sector, a leading UK consultancy warned last night.
More jobs will be cut at all the big German plants as a new wave of
restructuring takes place and further plant closures are inevitable, said
Sheffield-based Meps Europe in its latest quarterly review of world steel
outlook.
The report comes nearly four weeks after the agreement by EU industry
ministers on state subsidies, which has been widely criticised by
non-subsidised steel companies in Germany, France and the UK.
Yesterday Meps added to the simmering row over the agreement by claiming
that the 5m tonnes of capacity cuts by subsidised companies hammered out at
Brussels was a 'politically contrived' figure to embellish the deal.
'The effective capacity cut from the subsidised companies is nearer to 2.5m
tonnes,' it says.
Non-subsidised companies are now left to find 25m tonnes of capacity cuts to
meet the original target of 30m tonnes across the entire industry.
However Mep says the subsidised companies offered less capacity cuts than
were expected. 'Other enterprises are not likely to increase their offers of
capacity reductions now that the terms of the agreement with the subsidised
companies are known.'
Meps said the German steel sector would carry a large proportion of the
capacity cuts and job losses in any plan for the non-subsidised steel
companies.
The agreement by industry ministers to allow Ekostahl, the struggling east
German producer, to build a hot strip mill would reverberate throughout the
German industry. But the effect would be felt mainly in western Germany,
where many more jobs would go - on top of some 2,200 job cuts from last
year's closure of the Krupp-Hoesch Rheinhausen plant.
Meps forecasts EU crude steel production will be 127m tonnes this year, down
3m tonnes or 2.3 per cent on the expected out-turn for 1993.

<TEXT>
Switzerland's private banks are balking at a government proposal obliging
them to report suspicions of money laundering by their clients, writes Ian
Rodger in Zurich.
'It is not our task to be investigators for the authorities,' Bank Julius
Baer in Zurich said. The 'obligation to denounce' promises to be the most
controversial of several measures proposed to fight organised crime.
There is already a widely supported proposal before parliament to give
bankers the right to denounce a suspected criminal client, as well as recent
directives from the Swiss Banking Commission and the Swiss Bankers'
Association providing for sanctions against a banker knowingly dealing with
criminals. The new measure seeks to extend the right to denounce into an
obligation to do so.

<TEXT>
A late surge in popularity by Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the Finnish defence
minister, yesterday rattled her opponents in Sunday's presidential election,
for the first time raising some doubt that the eventual winner will be Mr
Martti Ahtisaari, the Social Democrat and former senior UN diplomat.
An opinion poll for the national television station put Mrs Rehn, of the
Swedish party, in third place among the 11 candidates in Sunday's first
round of voting with 18 per cent, only just behind Mr Paavo Vayrynen, the
former foreign minister and candidate of prime minister Esko Aho's Centre
party, who had 19.2 per cent support.
Mr Ahtisaari still leads the field with 26.6 per cent. But the poll showed
that if Mrs Rehn can reach the run-off vote on February 6 between the two
leaders that emerge on Sunday, she stands the best chance of any candidate
of beating Mr Ahtisaari. The poll showed a 50-50 split between Mr Ahtisaari
and Mrs Rehn in a second round contest, compared with a 62-38 Ahtisaari
advantage over Mr Vayrynen and a 54-46 Ahtisaari lead over Mr Raimo
Ilaskivi, the candidate of the Conservative party.
Mrs Rehn appears to have gained a significant and well-timed momentum in the
hitherto stale campaign, despite representing the Swedish-speaking minority
in Finland which accounts for only 6 per cent of the population. She has
apparently attracted strong support among women and among non-socialists who
lack faith in either Mr Vayrynen or Mr Ilaskivi and are looking for a strong
personality to take on the popular Mr Ahtisaari.
She - like Mr Ahtisaari - is an unequivocal supporter of Finland's
application to join the European Union, an issue that is set to be decided
in a referendum later this year. Despite being a member of an unpopular
government, her straightforward style seems to have cut through a widespread
public animosity towards the political establishment engendered by deep
recession - an asset previously exploited by Mr Ahtisaari.
Commentators in Helsinki say Mrs Rehn's cause was also boosted by Finnish
outrage over a statement by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist
leader, who said recently a country with a woman as defence minister did not
deserve to be independent.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Scalfaro prepares to call election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night looked set to dissolve Italy's
parliament and call general elections for late March following the
resignation of the eight-month-old Ciampi government.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the 73-year-old former governor of the bank of
Italy and the first non-elected premier this century, handed in his
resignation during a brief meeting with President Scalfaro early yesterday
afternoon.
The president did not formally accept the resignation. Officials said he was
anxious to consult with the leaders of the two houses of parliament and
other prominent politicians, first, to ensure Italy possessed a stable
caretaker government in the run-up to elections.
An announcement on the dissolution of parliament is expected at the weekend.
Elections must then be held within 60 days. Politicians said yesterday the
most likely dates would be March 20 or March 26.
Mr Ciampi's resignation followed an abortive attempt by a hard core of
Christian Democrats and their allies to prolong the life of the present
parliament, at least until June so as hold general elections alongside
European parliamentary elections.
The manoeuvre was backed by some Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals
plus a group of mavericks among the Radicals and Republicans - in effect
those that have long dominated Italy's political life and risk oblivion in a
general election. Their aim was to delay elections as long as possible to
allow new parties to form, while at the same time exploiting their
parliamentary privileges to protect them from prosecution in the corruption
scandals.
In the classic manner of Italy's byzantine politics, the move to prolong
parliament took the form of a no-confidence motion tabled just before
Christmas. Thus the 170 signatories hoped to remove Mr Ciampi or ensure he
was forced to form a new government. This backfired when the motion began to
be debated on Wednesday and it became clear the motion lacked a majority in
the 630 seat house.
Yesterday, Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader who tabled the motion,
withdrew it. The backers of the no- confidence motion then changed tactics
and proposed a confidence motion which has yet to be debated. Such a
confidence motion, however, threatens, if not carefully controlled, to
undermine the constitutional justification of President Scalfaro dissolving
parliament when the government enjoys the confidence of the legislature.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Three consortia seek to dial into Italian mobile network:
The race to win liberalised phone market licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So popular has cellular telecommunications become in Italy that many fashion
houses are producing snappy designer pouches to hold the growing number of
phones in circulation.
The state airline, Alitalia, has started warning against the use of phones
on its flights. But this only provokes the same cravings as the ban on
smoking: as soon as the doors open dozens light up or start pushing buttons.
But cellular telephony is more than just a fad in Italy, whatever the
national propensity to follow fashion. As elsewhere in Europe, the ability
to make calls on the move has become a valuable business tool. The division
of responsibilities between the political capital in Rome and the business
centre in Milan means managers are often in transit.
In a country where ownership of a second, or even third, holiday home is not
just a luxury for the ultra-rich, access to a mobile phone can also
represent a saving compared with paying charges for a fixed line, which may
be used only occasionally.
The merits of the mobile phone are now so widely perceived that Italy has
become Europe's third-biggest market, with more than 1.1m subscribers. That
is still behind the UK - the biggest user of mobile telecommunications,
thanks to a relatively early start - but not far behind Germany, considering
the latter's bigger population.
For the companies jockeying to win the licence to run Italy's new
Europe-wide GSM standard network, the hope is that such sharp growth will
continue. Mr Tommaso Pompei, managing director of Pronto Italia, one of the
bidders, predicts subscribers will rise more than six-fold to about 8m by
the turn of the century.
Pronto Italia is one of three consortia putting the finishing touches to
their proposals before the pre-qualification deadline on Saturday. The
others are Unitel, composed of Fiat, Fininvest and Vodafone of the UK; and
Omnitel, comprising Olivetti, Swedish Telecom, BellAtlantic, Cellular
Communications and Lehman Brothers.
All three have been slightly taken aback by the speed with which Italy is
moving to liberalise its mobile telecommunications market after months of
false starts. Hitherto monopolised by the state-controlled Sip telephones
utility, the market is being opened up after pressure from the European
Commission in Brussels to meet European Union commitments on greater
competition.
After paying lip service in the past, matters have moved forward fast under
the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The post and telecommunications
ministry has 15 days after the first deadline on Saturday to name companies
meeting its pre-qualification criteria. Although no timetable has been set
after that and matters could slip because of uncertainty surrounding new
elections, expected in March, a winner should be revealed by the end of
April.
The race has already produced some surprises. This week, Etra, one of the
bidding consortia, comprising subsidiaries of the big Eni energy and
chemicals group, Premafin, BellSouth and Millicom, said it was throwing in
its lot with Unitel, reducing the competition to a three-cornered fight.
Though that may have put Unitel in pole position, its two rivals are not
giving up. Mr Francesco Caio, Omnitel's chairman, says his consortium is the
only one to include a company - Olivetti - which sees telecommunications and
information technology services as core businesses. Having Swedish Telcom,
recently renamed Telia, on board adds a partner with a strong record from
the country with the highest per capita penetration of mobile phones, he
adds.
Perhaps reacting to lingering doubts about its precise composition, which
has yet to be revealed, Pronto Italia also stresses the experience of its
members. Mannesmann and Pacific Telesis, the two foreign partners, won the
mandate to operate Germany's GSM network, which has signed up 500,000
subscribers within 18 months of opening.
There is still some confusion about the other partners, however. Mr Pompei
says the remainder, comprising about 15 medium-sized Italian companies, will
only be revealed next week.
All three consortiums, which are expected easily to fulfil the
pre-qualification criteria, point to their financial muscle. Omnitel, in
which Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has 8 per cent, is raising
its capital to L200bn (Pounds 78m). Unitel is also planning a big rights
issue, opening the way for the entry of the Etra consortium members. Pronto
Italia, meanwhile, notes that its shareholders include some big banks.
Access to capital will be as important as having the right technology on
tap. Both Unitel and Omnitel have so far spent about L7bn just on
preliminary studies and market research. Pronto Italia, advised by SG
Warburg, the UK merchant bank, claims to have got through about L35bn.
Mr Nicolo Nefri, Unitel's chairman, confidently draws attention to the
combination of Fiat's industrial might with the marketing skills of Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group. The arrival of the Etra partners should
further enhance Unitel's image.
Olivetti, the main partner in Omnitel, has been pitching all out for the
business. With revenues from hardware in decline, it knows it must move into
services to maintain profitability, while distinctions between computers and
telecommunications are tending to blur.
The winner is unlikely to be known until after the elections. However, with
such powerful corporate forces at play, some cynics are already predicting
the mandate may eventually be awarded jointly to Unitel and Omnitel, which
would then join forces to run the new network together.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Sweden in fresh delay on bridge

Sweden yesterday paved the way for an eventual bridge and tunnel link with
Denmark, but avoided a government crisis by again postponing a formal
decision on the issue.
Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, said the government needed to be sure that
water flows into the Baltic Sea would not be disturbed by the bridge before
the final go-ahead could be given. Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen said the postponement was 'deeply regrettable'.
The Water Tribunal, which has already examined the issue, has been asked to
give further guarantees. Provided the assurances are forthcoming, the
government has said it will approve the project. But its position may not be
supported by the Centre party, one of four members of the minority coalition
government, which has strongly objected to the link on environmental
grounds. The party has retained the right to dissent from the final
decision.
Yesterday's formula makes it more likely that the government will remain
intact in the run-up to September's general election, although differences
between the Centre party and the other coalition partners remain
significant.
'The risk of a government crisis is now wholly averted,' said Mr Bildt.
A final decision on the link is expected before the election, although the
exact timetable is unclear. The environmental investigations will take a
month.
The 17km road and rail link across the Oresund between Copenhagen and the
southern Swedish city of Malmo is strongly supported by most Swedish and
Danish politicians, as well as industry and trade unions. It will cost
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn).
Construction of the onshore access roads on the Danish side of the bridge
has already begun, after Denmark and Sweden agreed to build the link three
years ago. But, following yesterday's announcement, the Danish government
said it was considering calling a halt to the building work.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A key Yeltsin aide was elected speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament
yesterday as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader, announced that
he was withdrawing his candidacy as head of the lower house.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, was elected as speaker of
the Federation Council. In the lower house, however, Mr Zhirinovsky
recommended that his rivals be sent to psychiatric hospitals and said he was
saving his health in order to become president.
'I temporarily withdraw my candidature until presidential elections (due in
1996) and then we will talk,' he said. 'In two years, through our special
(security) services, we'll know who was ill and with what.'
When Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical privatisation minister reconfirmed in
his post yesterday, pointed to his watch to get Mr Zhirinovsky to cut short
his hectoring, Mr Zhirinovsky yelled: 'You'll be doing that to call for your
supper in Lefortovo jail.' Lefortovo is where Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
former parliamentary speaker, is being kept for his role in last year's coup
attempt.
As the Liberal Democratic party leader continued to make a mockery of
parliament, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg, claimed he had
evidence that the KGB picked Mr Zhirinovsky to head an alternative,
controllable party requested by the communist politburo as it formally gave
up its monopoly on power in 1990.
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, former Soviet president and head of the party,
yesterday denied his politburo had decided to set up such a party, although
he could not vouch for other forces such as the KGB.
Mr Zhirinovsky's withdrawal from the race for speaker means the likely
victory of Mr Ivan Rybkin, a 47-year-old former Communist party secretary
who belongs to the conservative Agrarian party.
Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to Washington, was eliminated from
the race in early voting yesterday. He had the support of the democratic
parties, including Russia's Choice, the largest single group in parliament.
Two anti-Yeltsin candidates, including Mr Rybkin, remain for a run-off vote
to be held today.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Balladur loses case on private schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's constitutional council yesterday slapped down the conservative
Balladur government's private school finance reform, in a move which the
Socialist opposition hailed as a victory for public education.
The nine-member council ruled that the bill's controversial removal of an
1850 limitation on public funding of private, largely Catholic schools,
infringed the constitutional equality between public and private education.
'Article 2 of the law on investment aid to private education institutions by
local authorities is contrary to the constitution,' the council said. But it
threw out Socialist objections that the government had improperly rushed the
bill through the Senate just before Christmas.
Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party leader, said the ruling was 'a victory
for all those who are attached to public education'.
The schools row has galvanised the Socialist party, shattered in last
March's elections, into helping to organise a big Paris protest this Sunday
against government education policy. Evidently aware that the council's
ruling might reduce attendance, Mr Rocard still urged 'all defenders of lay
education' to turn out on Sunday.
An opinion poll published in the weekly magazine Globe-Hebdo earlier this
week said 60 per cent of voters backed the protest, while only 33 per cent
opposed it. The Socialists have argued that the law would have created
discrimination and a two-tier system.
The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, facing his first test on an issue
for which the opposition has popular backing, refused any immediate reaction
to the council's ruling. But earlier, on a trip to Bordeaux, he commented
that criticism of his school funding plan was motivated 'less by hostility
to private education than by worries about public schools'.
The 1850 law stipulates that regional and municipal authorities can fund no
more than 10 per cent of private schools' infrastructure, though for the
past 35 years the French state has paid teachers' salaries and running costs
of private schools which undertake to follow the state syllabus and exams.
Mr Balladur has this month tried to appease his opponents, who argue that
any more public funding of private schools will be at the expense of state
education, by promising an extra FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) to improve physical
safety in public schools.
But yesterday's ruling will not stop his own backbenchers, particularly in
his UDF coalition party, from railing against the 1850 restriction which
many right-wing councils are anyway flouting.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Belgian scandal takes its toll on markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian deputy prime minister, yesterday hit back at
allegations that he committed forgery, and was involved in illegal acts
connected to the award of a lucrative government helicopter contract five
years ago.
'I have not committed forgery, there has been no forgery, and no illegality.
The procedure is perfectly correct and in line with all legal requirements,'
Mr Coeme, former defence minister, told a news conference.
Mr Coeme, now communications minister in Belgium's centre-left coalition, is
the most senior of three ministers from the country's French-speaking
Socialist party, wanted for questioning by Mrs Veronique Ancia, a Liege
magistrate.
Mrs Ancia is investigating allegations of bribery and corruption in relation
to the 1988 contract awarded to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer.
In particular, she is examining the possibility that bribes were offered or
paid to the francophone Socialist party to influence the decision. Mrs Ancia
has asked the national parliament and the assemblies of the country's
Walloon region and French-speaking community to lift the parliamentary
immunity of the three ministers.
The widening political scandal took its toll on the Belgian franc and bond
markets yesterday morning, as dealers speculated about the possibility that
the Agusta affair might damage the government.
A committee of members of the Belgian parliament's upper house should vote
today whether to lift the parliamentary immunity of Mr Guy Spitaels,
minister-president of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon interior
minister. The balance of votes in the committee appeared yesterday to be
tipped against Mr Spitaels and Mr Mathot, both of whom have argued against
lifting of immunity, but offered to talk separately to Mrs Ancia.
Mr Coeme, and Mrs Ancia herself, are likely to be questioned by a similar
committee of the lower chamber next week about the request.
All three men have this week denied any wrongdoing, and Agusta itself has
repeatedly denied any connection with illegal financial dealings.
But the trio - dubbed les trois Guy - have also attacked the widespread
leaking of what they say is an inaccurate report to the parliament,
justifying Mrs Ancia's request for the lifting of immunity.
Mr Coeme called yesterday's press conference specifically to tackle charges
contained in that report. In particular, he struck back at allegations that
vital documents were doctored to favour the Agusta bid over French and
German competition, claiming that Mrs Ancia was referring to an unauthorised
rough copy of the final document.
Explaining his refusal to resign while the case was being examined, Mr Coeme
said: 'I have a feeling of deep injustice about what has happened concerning
my role, and a resignation would be considered . . . a second injustice.'
Political commentators appear to be divided about the significance of the
affair for the survival of the government, a fragile coalition of Dutch- and
French-speaking Christian Democrats and Socialists. Flemish opposition
parties have been particularly critical, but the potential scandal has not
touched any other ministers in the current government directly.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Russia clouds reform path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first day of the summit between the Russian and US leaders produced some
pro-reform rhetoric and a commitment from President Boris Yeltsin to confirm
Mr Anatoly Chubais as a deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, pronounced his president, and
himself, pleased: 'Reform is going right ahead: there was unanimity of
opinion on this,' he said after talks yesterday with Mr Yeltsin, and
separately with Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance.
Sources in the reformist camp say, however, that the reappointment of Mr
Chubais was the fruit of an appeal from the Russia's Choice group, led by Mr
Gaidar, to Mr Yeltsin to increase the number of radicals in the cabinet -
without which Russia's Choice would refuse to participate in government at
all.
Still unknown is the future of Mr Fyodorov, who has said he will not serve
either with some of the more conservative members of the present cabinet or
with Mr Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman.
Further, Mr Chubais's programme of privatisation does not directly impinge
on the drive to hold down inflation, restrict credits and attack the budget
deficit - the central macroeconomic issues which are most in contention
between the radicals and the conservatives. Thus the day's good news for
President Clinton and his team - in the form of assurances of continued
reform from Mr Yeltsin - must be balanced by the questions which remain
open.
First, what will the cabinet's programme and policies be? It has as yet no
budget for the first quarter of this year - and is faced with the terrible
problem of accommodating at least Rbs6,000bn estimated to be the spending
which should have been committed at the end of last year but was delayed or
cut in order to get last year's deficit down to under 10 per cent.
If, as the US leaders claimed yesterday, there was a 'unanimity' on the need
for reforms, these decisions cannot again be finessed - but are very hard to
square with the announced intention of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister, in his speech to the State Duma on Tuesday to avoid future shocks.
Second, what will the west's assistance consist of? Mr Bentsen and his
senior officials have made it clear both that they expect the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to be the lead agencies in
providing support to the Russians.
US officials want them, especially the Fund, to be less fussy and much more
active in getting funds into Russia.
'The issue,' said one official, 'is not less conditionality on the part of
the Fund, but less passivity.'
This line is now the accepted one within the Group of Seven. Mr Bentsen made
the point obliquely yesterday, when he showered praise on Russian success in
stabilisation - the budget deficit down from 20 per cent of GNP at the end
of 1991 to 9 per cent at the end of 1993, inflation down from 30 per cent to
12 per cent a month last year, wages up three times in real (dollar) terms.
'When the president heard this,' said Mr Bentsen, 'he said, 'this message
must get out'' By which he meant: this message must be accepted by the Fund
and the Bank.
However, the Fund and the Bank made it perfectly clear in their joint note
published last week that they believe they cannot lend because the Russian
government has been unable to deliver on reform.

FT  14 JAN 94 / French employers in interest rate plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Patronat, the French employers' federation, yesterday called for further
interest rate cuts, particularly for short-term loans, to help revive what
it described as the country's stagnant economy.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Selliere, the vice-chairman, said that gradual reduction
in French interest rates over recent months had been insufficient. 'Economic
activity has never revived without relatively low short-term interest
rates,' he told a press conference, calling on the newly-independent Bank of
France to show courage and move quickly to cut borrowing costs.
France's intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, currently
stands at 6.2 per cent. It has been gradually reduced since the summer's
currency crisis, but with inflation standing at an annual rate of just 2.1
per cent businesses still face relatively high real borrowing costs.
Mr Selliere gave a downbeat assessment of the state of the French economy.
'We are leaving recession, but the situation is fragile,' he said,
forecasting that gross domestic product would expand by between 0.5 per cent
and 1 per cent this year. The government is forecasting growth of 1.4 per
cent.
The Patronat vice-chairman also defended French industry against charges
that it has not done enough to help curb the rise in unemployment, which is
currently standing at more than 12 per cent of the workforce.
President Francois Mitterrand last week chastised employers for failing to
create jobs despite having received FFr80bn (Pounds 9bn) through the removal
of a delay in the reimbursement of value added tax payments, the transfer of
family allowance welfare contributions for low-paid workers from companies
to the state, and other measures. Mr Selliere also said he opposed a
proposal by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, that refunds of value
added tax should be conditional on job creation.
The proposal, made earlier this week, has drawn strong criticism from French
industrialists. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of the Peugeot-Citroen
automobile group rejected the idea as illogical. 'The state should pay back
companies the sums which they are owed. There should not be any conditions.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Death of Norway's Mideast peacemaker: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Johan Joergen Holst, Norway's foreign minister, has died in his sleep at
a recuperation centre outside Oslo after suffering two strokes. He was
central to the contacts between the Israeli government and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation which produced the peace handshake last September in
Washington between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO chairman.
Mr Holst was always one for overworking and the burden of too little sleep
and years of prodigious academic output on strategic issues took its toll.
Apart from his political career, he was head for many years of the Norwegian
Institute for International Affairs.
Born in 1937, Mr Holst was among a number of Norwegian politicians, part of
a tradition going back may years, to have an apparently disproportionate
influence on international affairs.
When he took over as foreign minister last April from Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, who left to become the United Nations peace envoy to former
Yugoslavia, the secret Middle East peace talks had already been under way
for several months. But they were still at a fragile early stage, lacking as
yet the participation of Israeli government officials.
Mr Holst later said he 'took over the baton' in a relay. It was a baton he
carried with enthusiasm and tenacity to the finishing line four months later
when he presided over the initialling of the declaration of principles at a
secret ceremony in Oslo in the early hours of August 20.
Mr Holst's role in the negotiations was probably most important at those
times when the talks were most in danger of collapse. In mid-July, a crisis
blew up at a session in Halvosbole, with the two leading PLO and Israeli
negotiators exchanging insults, and one threatening to pull out. Both sides
went home, leaving the negotiations apparently at an impasse.
After the Halvosbole row, Mr Holst spent long hours in Tunis with Mr Arafat
discussing the shape of the proposals so far drafted.
With other Norwegian mediators, they spread out maps of Israel and the
occupied territories, and pored over them while they debated key issues of
dispute. Mr Holst later said the meetings convinced him that Mr Arafat was
not only fully committed to achieving a settlement, but was personally in
charge of the PLO negotiating effort and fully briefed on all its aspects.
In letters, telephone calls and face-to-face meetings, Mr Holst conveyed
this conviction to Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and the
talks resumed. At the same time Mr Holst sought assurances from the Israeli
side that Mr Rabin was as committed as Mr Arafat.
In an interview later, Mr Holst said there was underlying the negotiations a
fundamental problem which he set about overcoming: the lack of essential
mutual confidence between the Israeli and PLO leaderships over their
respective commitment to the talks, and their ability to make a deal and
then to make it stick.
Mr Holst was also at the centre of the final negotiating session which
sealed the agreement.
It took place not in Oslo but in Stockholm, where Mr Holst was summoned at
short notice on August 17 by Mr Peres, who was on a visit.
An unfairness of his passing was the extent to which he looked after himself
physically. To ski with him was to watch with frustration his skilled
disappearance over the horizon. At other times, his passion for stamp
collecting more than once niggled his wife, Ms Marianne Heiberg - who was
central also to PLO-Israeli contacts. He was a fluent Russian speaker.
He had four children from a previous marriage and one from his present one.
His diplomatic skills, as a dedicated pro-Nato (he was tipped to succeed Mr
Manfred Worner as its chief) and Atlanticist advocate, outstripped his local
political instincts, although he was an assiduous worker for the Labour
party. Regarding him as aloof, the Norwegian press attacked him when he was
defence minister.
The strongest tributes came yesterday from Palestinians and Israelis alike.
Mr Rabin said: 'The state of Israel will remember Johan Joergen Holst as the
person who succeeded in bringing the distant together, in overcoming the
enmity of generations and in laying foundations for peace.'
Mr Arafat said: 'We lost with his early departure one of the sincerest
friends of our Palestinian people.' The PLO leader added: 'With this, he has
registered his name and his country's name in the pages of the world's
peace.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Germans may avert pay war: It all appears to be over except
for the shouting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual German wage round yesterday began in earnest, as formal
negotiations were launched in three key regions of the mighty 3.4m-strong
engineering industry, and public sector pay talks began with the 250,000
postal workers.
If the rhetoric from both employers and trade unions is to be believed, then
a long and bitter pay round is in prospect. Most employers are demanding an
absolute pay freeze, while the unions insist that incomes must be protected,
and working hours reduced to provide new jobs for the unemployed.
Yet many commentators outside government and industry believe that the worst
is already over, and only the shouting remains. They hope that a 2 per cent
pay deal for the chemical industry, agreed this week after arbitration for
the 170,000 workers in the north Rhine region, will set a clear signal of
moderation and good sense.
There certainly will be a good deal of sound and fury in a pay round coming
on the eve of a mammoth election year, with a whole series of state
elections leading up to a general election in October.
On the other hand, the prospect of unemployment reaching 4m this year, and
the memory of the sharpest downturn in the west German economy since the war
last year, have certainly caused the trade unions to moderate their
militancy. It is employers who are making headline-catching demands for cost
cuts in 1994, while the unions are simply attempting to hold the line.
The chemical industry may prove to be important psychologically, most
analysts believe, especially for the rest of the private sector. Yet the
most important message from the deal is probably not in the agreement on a 2
per cent pay rise, after a two-month pay freeze, meaning a real cut in
wages. As far as the employers are concerned, the best part of the agreement
is a significant shift towards more flexibility.
In the first place, the deal provides for a 'working time corridor' for the
industry, with individual enterprises free to negotiate working hours at
plant level between a 35-hour and a 40-hour week.
Secondly, it allows companies to take on new workers from the dole queue at
only 90 per cent of the agreed basic wages, an important concession by IG
Chemie, the chemical workers' union, in order to promote job creation
instead of redundancies.
But employers warn against any overhasty calculation that the rest of German
industry will now fall in line.
'We cannot assume that there will be the same sort of deals throughout
industry,' according to Mr Johannes Gobel, deputy head of the wages
department at the German employers' federation (BDA).
Top priority for the employers now is to see real cost cuts emerging from
the talks between IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and an
increasingly militant Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers. Their aim is
a pay freeze on basic rates, and abolition of extra holiday pay, thus
leading to an overall 10 per cent cut in costs.
Talks began yesterday between the two sides in North Rhine-Westphalia and
Hesse, where the union is calling for a 5.5 per cent pay rise to match
inflation and higher productivity, and in northern Baden-Wurttemberg (home
of Daimler-Benz), where it is seeking 6.0 per cent.
Few believe they will emerge with anything better than the chemical workers,
but Mr Walter Riester, the deputy leader of IG Metall, is not ready to
capitulate yet.
The public sector union, OeTV, is also adamant that it will not accept a pay
freeze, as sought by the three levels of employers in the public service -
central government, the 16 states, and the local authorities.
Ironically, it is the lower levels of government, where the opposition
Social Democrats are most often in control, where the financial constraints
are most severe.
OeTV has already lowered its sights to 4 per cent, loaded in favour of the
low paid.
'There is a clear expectation amongst the workers that we will and must do
better than a nominal pay freeze,' Mr Rainer Hillgartner, the union
spokesman, said yesterday.
What the employers hope is that sector by sector they can negotiate similar
deals to the chemical industry, providing a real element of flexibility for
individual employers to set their own plant-level agreements.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged a special role for Germany, because
of its geography and its history, in seeking to integrate both Russia and
the rest of eastern Europe into the institutions of western Europe.
He suggested that both the Nato alliance and the European Union had the
identical aim of including the emerging democracies of central and eastern
Europe in their existing communities.
At the same time, he defended the slow process of moving towards full
membership, implied by the Nato 'partnership for peace' programme, as
essential to prevent new divisions opening up on the continent.
In an apparent attempt to reassure the new east European democracies,
including Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, Chancellor Kohl
stressed the parallel process of integration into the European Union as well
as into the Nato alliance as the decisive achievement of this week's Nato
summit in Brussels.
He recognised the security concerns of the east European democracies, and
equally, the fears in Russia of being isolated or fenced in by hostile
forces.
'We must not create new divisions, and thus create new tensions in Europe,'
he said.
'Security and stability in Europe are indivisible. That is why
disappointment or discouragement at the decisions of the Nato summit are not
appropriate.'
Germany had friendly relations with all the countries of eastern Europe, and
with Russia, he told the German parliament.
It had a particular role to play in ensuring their integration with the
west, because of good neighbourliness and because of its special historical
responsibility.
'We want the accession of these countries.' However, they must themselves
create the necessary political and economic conditions for this to occur.
Membership of the European Union also meant involvement in the common
foreign and security policy of the existing member states.
Future EU members could be involved in that common policy, even before their
full accession to the union.

FT  14 JAN 94 / UK sees little hope of early end to IRA violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government has concluded that the odds are now stacked heavily
against an early end to the IRA's 25-year campaign of violence in Ulster.
The underlying assessment in Whitehall is that the 'peace' faction within
the IRA has not won over the advocates of violence in the Republican power
struggle that has followed last month's Anglo-Irish peace initiative.
Mr John Major has yet to reach a final judgment on the reaction of the IRA
and its political wing, Sinn Fein, to the Downing Street declaration. But
unless there is an unexpected volte-face by the powerful IRA faction still
backing terrorism, the prime minister is expected soon to relaunch talks
without Sinn Fein on the province's future. Officials expect that move
within weeks.
Monitoring of secret deliberations within the IRA since the declaration have
led to strong suggestions in Whitehall that Mr Martin McGuinness, a
prominent member of Sinn Fein, also heads the IRA's military command.
Mr McGuinness, whose views recently are said to have straddled those of the
opposing peace and war factions in the Republican movement, has been
identified as the IRA's chief of staff.
The mood of pessimism was reinforced yesterday by demands from Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, for Mr Major to open an 'unconditional
dialogue'.
Blaming Mr Major for an 'intolerable stalemate', Mr Adams said that up to
now he had not been offered 'any political package with which to approach
the IRA'. But Mr Major told MPs at Westminster he would not be drawn
'bit-by-bit' into negotiations with Mr Adams while violence continued.
The British government believes that Mr Adams, regarded still as a 'dove' in
the Republican movement, is unwilling to contemplate the split in the IRA
senior ranks which would follow a cessation of violence.
That view has apparently been confirmed by Mr Adams' recent letter to Major.
The letter, which has not been published, demands direct negotiations as
well as clarification of some aspects of the Downing Street declaration.
Despite the present mood of pessimism, Mr Major will make it clear that the
opportunity for the IRA to renounce violence will remain on the table - as
will the offer of an eventual place in negotiations for Sinn Fein.
The government, anxious not to weaken the commitment of Dublin and the
mainly Catholic SDLP led by Mr John Hume to a settlement excluding Sinn
Fein, insists there is no question of revoking the declaration.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Hume have invested
enormous political capital in the effort to end the IRA's campaign of
violence. Mr Major will meet Mr Hume for talks today. He will indicate the
IRA cannot be allowed to hold up indefinitely the search for internal
political settlement.
There is a strong suspicion in Whitehall that the recent IRA attacks on
Northern Ireland security forces mark an attempt by the IRA hawks to provoke
a harsh British reaction, which the IRA would then use as an excuse to
intensify its campaign.
The government's view is that both sides of the IRA leadership feel it would
be disastrous to split the movement.

FT  14 JAN 94 / Downing St tries to limit 'back to basics' damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downing Street launched an immediate damage limitation exercise last night
designed to keep the government's 'back to basics' initiative alive.
The move came as Tory MPs braced themselves for further damaging revelations
about the Westminster council affair.
Copies of the unpublished report circulating in the Commons were said to
contain further detailed allegations about how the gerrymandering was
conducted.
Gloomy Conservative MPs saw the report as a further instalment in the series
of disclosures which has rocked the government in the past two weeks.
Few blamed Mr Major for the latest revelations, but many said they would
have been less damaging under the leadership of a more resolute prime
minister.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, said the report
disclosed political corruption on a scale unknown in modern Britain.
'It is the stuff of banana republics. It shows that the Tory party is
rotten, and amoral to the core. They have abandoned basic principles of
morality,' he said.
There was also concern about the position of Mr Barry Legg, Conservative MP
for Milton Keynes SW, who was chief whip to the Conservatives on Westminster
council in the period covered by the allegations.
Mr Legg, who could be surcharged if the Westminster district auditor decides
to pursue the issue in the courts, said he was innocent of any impropriety.
Labour also made clear that it would pursue allegations that Mr Peter
Brooke, the MP for Westminster South, knew about Westminster council's
housing policies when he was chairman of the Conservative party.
Several cabinet ministers are expected to make speeches on the initiative
today. They will include Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, who have differed strongly on the
moral content of the campaign.
Mr Major told the cabinet the campaign should not be derailed. 'The message
is sound. We must not let ourselves be diverted by isolated incidents. We
must keep our nerve,' he said.
'There is a moral dimension; it is not a moral crusade,' he was said to have
told ministers.
Mr Major won the support of the executive of the influential 1922 committee
of Conservative backbenchers at a long meeting last night, but MPs said
there had been tough exchanges.
Mr Major is understood to have been urged to act more decisively when
dealing with future ministerial indiscretions.
There was further gloom for the government in a Gallup poll for the Daily
Telegraph last night. The survey showed Labour on 46.5 per cent from 48.5
per cent in December.
Conservative support was at 25.5 per cent (27 per cent), with the Liberal
Democrats on 20.5 per cent (20 per cent).
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said last night that he had read the
British papers while abroad in recent days 'with growing disbelief'.
Mr Clarke said on BBC Question Time that he had 'come back to find that a
kind of hysteria is spreading, with allegations that are unsustainable
against any political party.'

FT  14 JAN 94 / Flagship Tory council sold homes for votes, says auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, KEVIN BROWN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was struggling to sustain his government's authority last
night after his tottering 'back to basics' initiative was further undermined
by official allegations that Westminster city council, a Tory 'flagship'
borough, had manipulated its housing policy in an attempt to win votes.
The report, believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind, alleges that
Pounds 21.25m was wasted.
Mr John Magill, Westminster's district auditor, says in provisional findings
that six councillors and four council officials might be required to repay
the money.
Dame Shirley Porter, a leading Conservative politician and leader of the
council until 1991, and Mr Barry Legg, MP for Milton Keynes SW since 1992,
are among those named.
Several sweeping allegations are made in the report, a copy of which has
been obtained by the Financial Times.
However, the full 250-page report and an annex including about 500 pages of
detailed documentation may not be published or quoted. It is a criminal
offence to disclose information gained by a district auditor in the course
of his duty.
The central allegations made by Mr Magill paint an extraordinary picture of
political manipulation centred on targeting sales of council houses - which
would mostly be bought by likely Conservative voters - on eight 'key'
marginal wards, and the rehousing of the resulting homeless families at the
council's expense. Mr Magill says in his conclusions that:
The council was engaged in 'gerrymandering', which Mr Magill described as 'a
disgraceful and improper purpose, and not a purpose for which a local
authority may act'.
The number of homeless families who had to be put into temporary
accommodation increased by 172 each year, at a cost to the council of Pounds
2m. Meanwhile, homes they could have occupied remained empty, awaiting new
buyers.
The council lost Pounds 13.3m by selling the properties at a discount to
their open market values.
Last night Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the report disclosed 'a
devastating example of financial corruption and the abuse of power by senior
members of the Conservative party'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local-government spokesman, emphasised the close
links between the council and the Conservative leadership and highlighted
the publicity the party's campaigners gave the council during the 1990
election.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he would condemn the alleged
activities 'unequivocally' if they turned out to be true.
Mr David Weeks, one of the councillors named in the report and leader of
Westminster council until last year, attacked the basis for the inquiry, in
which he said the district auditor had acted as the 'prosecuting counsel,
judge and jury'. He said the council's actions on housing policy had been
approved as legal by Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a Queen's Counsel who specialises
in local government, on three separate occasions.
Mr Weeks, who is still a Westminster councillor and is a marketing executive
at the Lovell construction group, said Mr Magill had taken a 'nave and
dictatorial view' of how councils ran their housing policies.
Other councillors named in the report made robust denials. They have the
opportunity to make representations to Mr Magill on his provisional
findings, which they must do no later than July 29.
Dame Shirley, who was out of the country and could not be located, issued a
stern denial of the charges through her solicitor. Her statement said she
had received legal advice that the auditor's provisional view was 'neither
correct in law nor in fact'.
The statement continued: 'A leading firm of accountants have also advised
her that Mr Magill's views about alleged losses are equally wrong and
misconceived. She now, at last, has the opportunity to make representations
and to defend herself.'
Mr Legg said: 'I utterly refute any suggestion of impropriety. When the time
comes for me to put my case I will be answering in full the matters raised
in the report.'
'Various British political practices now being alleged or revealed
would bring a blush to the cheeks of any honest Italian. '

FT  14 JAN 94 / District auditor's report: Main points
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster city council had been guilty of 'gerrymandering' to give the
ruling party an unfair electoral advantage.
The council kept flats empty so that whole blocks could be sold to
owner-occupiers, preventing their use to house the homeless.
The council spent public funds to prepare papers for discussing the
promotion of the majority party's electoral advantage.
The sale of homes cost the council Pounds 21.25m, including Pounds 2m for
housing homeless families in temporary accommodation.
Ten councillors and officials - including Dame Shirley Porter, then council
leader - should be required to reimburse the council.
Six councillors - including Dame Shirley - should be disqualified from being
councillors.

FT  14 JAN 94 / TSB sets cash aside in case of pension transfer claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group, the UK's sixth-largest bank, said yesterday it had made 'prudent'
provisions for possible compensation payments from the sale of pensions to
people transferring out of occupational pension schemes.
The group has 55,000 pension transfer customers - about 10 per cent of the
estimated 500,000 or so pension transfers sold. The total value of amounts
transferred from occupational schemes to TSB is about Pounds 500m.
Mr John Elbourne, retail director, said the bank had taken the step because
of the study of pension transfers by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the
Securities and Investments Board.
The report, which suggested that nine out of 10 pension transfer cases had
not complied with regulators' rules, prompted the SIB, the City's chief
watchdog, to set up an inquiry into the transfer business. The inquiry is
not expected to reach conclusions until the summer about how to compensate
people who have suffered from being wrongly advised.
TSB has written to all its pensions transfer customers giving them a
telephone number to contact if they have any concerns. Mr Elbourne said the
bank had received only 40 letters or calls about pensions transfers in three
months.
He said the bank was satisfied with the quality of its pensions transfer
business and was continuing to write it, under strict rules.
He added that there would be a continuing debate about the standards KPMG
had used in the study, saying that those went further than the standards
imposed by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry,
in the guidance it issued in mid 1992.
Announcing TSB's results, Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said it would
not be 'good commercial practice' to say what provision was being made.
There is no figure for provisions in the group's results, but the assessment
will be reflected in the annual return that the TSB makes to the Department
of Trade and Industry in connection with its insurance activities.
The results presentation also highlighted continuing job losses in the
banking industry, as Mr Ellwood confirmed that 110 branches would shut in
1994. He said there would be no compulsory redundancies this year. Even so,
about 1,000 jobs are expected to be lost, with the focus on the group's
administrative centres.
Mr Ellwood said there would be further job losses in future years as the
bank continued to respond to competitive pressures and the increasing use of
technology.

chief quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
By Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has received yet another
blow following the resignation of Mr Gianfelice Franchini, managing director
of the big Standa retailing group.
Standa, controlled by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group, is Italy's second
biggest retailer. The company has been gradually nursed back to
profitability following its acquisition by Fininvest in the late 1980s.
Mr Franchini joined Standa in 1992 in a complex deal linked to the
acquisition of his family's regional supermarkets chain. In return, Mr
Franchini, who has a strong reputation in the Italian retailing business,
received a 7 per cent stake in Standa.
This week's split follows differences over the future of the business.
While Mr Franchini wanted to pursue heavy discounting, along the 'no-frills'
lines of some big German groups, he is believed to have been opposed by Mr
Berlusconi and Mr Giancarlo Foscale, Standa's chairman.

Pakhoed, the Dutch tank storage company, is negotiating to acquire Lambert
Riviere, a French-based chemical distribution company with a market
capitalisation of around FFr300m (Dollars 50m).
The acquisition would give Pakhoed access to chemical warehouses and depots
in southern Europe, expanding its geographical reach. Lambert Riviere, with
turnover of FFr1.6bn and a workforce of 500 people, is also active in Italy,
Spain and Portugal.
The talks, expected to be completed by the end of March, are being conducted
with the Halliez family and other shareholders who together own 80 per cent
of Lambert Riviere's shares. Pakhoed said it would launch a public offer for
the rest of the shares at the same price and conditions.
Pakhoed, which is pursuing the acquisition through its associate company
Univar, is already active in chemicals distribution in the Netherlands,
Belgium, Sweden, Singapore, Thailand and the US. The group's main activity
is oil storage.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fiat and Peugeot unveil range of
vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat and Peugeot Citroen yesterday unveiled a new range of jointly-developed
vehicles in which they have invested some Dollars 1.5bn. They intend to
capture a larger share of the European van market and attack, for the first
time, Europe's rapidly-growing multi-passenger vehicle (MPV) sector.
The new vehicle ranges have involved an investment of L1,234bn (Dollars
725m) at the Sevel vans joint venture plant, which first came on stream at
Val di Sangro in Italy's Mezzogiorno 13 years ago, and FFr6.04bn in Sevel
Nord, a new facility to build the MPV, near Valenciennes, which will employ
3,200 people.
Sevel was set up in 1978 with Fiat holding a 50 per cent share and PSA 50
per cent through its Peugeot and Citroen subsidiaries.
The projects have a combined production capacity of 320,000 units a year, of
which 130,000 is for the MPV. The 190,000 annual capacity at the vans plant
represents an increase to 800 units a day from the 550-a-day capacity limit
for the old van models.
The latest Sevel projects represent one of the most complex and extensive
collaborative projects to be undertaken between two European vehicle makers.
The van ranges alone were said at yesterday's launch to have 30 different
body configurations, with three wheelbases and three vehicle heights. As
with the original Sevel project, they will be marketed under Fiat, Peugeot
and Citroen badges - as the Ducato, Boxer and Jumper respectively, except in
the UK where the Citroen version will be known as the Relay.
The MPV is to be sold under the Lancia as well as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen
badges, although names are not being revealed until the vehicles' launch in
the spring.
The new MPV is entering one of the few European vehicle market sectors to
enjoy growth last year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Brussels warns on EU entry talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday hinted that it might not be possible to
meet the March 1 deadline for wrapping up negotiations with all four
countries seeking to join the European Union.
At a briefing in Brussels, an official left open the possibility of leaving
behind one or more applicants. This would mean abandoning the 'convoy'
principle, whereby Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway all conclude
negotiations at the same time.
The March 1 deadline is viewed as crucial if the present European parliament
is to have enough time to give a favourable opinion on membership before the
June elections. A delay would mean waiting for a new parliament, thus
jeopardising the target date for EU entry at the start of 1995.
A Brussels official suggested that the warning marked a shot across the bows
to the candidate countries as all parties brace themselves for the last lap
of negotiations on agriculture, regional policy, fisheries and budget
contributions, by far the trickiest dossiers. 'It is a question of who
blinks first,' said the official.
Sweden has made the most progress, with Norway lagging. The Oslo government
opened talks two months later than its fellow candidates, but it is also
sticking to a tough line on whaling, agriculture and fisheries.
Both Finland and Austria are somewhere in the middle. Austria still has
problems with the treatment of transit traffic and secondary homes, and it
shares Finland's deep reservations about Commission proposals to align farm
prices with EU levels on entry into the Union.
Talks are now focusing on the level and duration of compensating income
support for farmers, with the bill to be picked up by the applicant
countries. This affects, in turn, how much the four rich applicants can put
into the EU budget.

<TEXT>
A preliminary study of air strikes against Serb targets in the United
Nations effort to feed besieged Moslem enclaves in Bosnia was ordered
yesterday by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the new head of UN peacekeeping forces in former
Yugoslavia, will today visit Belgrade as part of a mission to investigate
the prospects for opening the airport in Tuzla, the biggest government
enclave, and facilitating the rotation of some 300 Canadian peacekeepers
stranded in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
At the close of a two-day Nato summit, the 16 member countries issued a
joint declaration warning all three warring parties - but the Serbs in
particular - that the use of air strikes remained an option.
Those impeding UN operations in Srebrenica and Tuzla had to realise that
'force is available' to support relief efforts, said Mr John Major, UK prime
minister.
Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, he refused, however, to give a
firm guarantee that Nato would use force to assist the relief effort in
Bosnia. He stressed that UN commanders on the ground would have to give the
go-ahead first.
But Mr Major stressed that while every Nato country was prepared to use
force, no government would take the decision lightly. 'We will seek the
advice of the military commanders on the scene,' he said.
But in a familiar response, Bosnian Serb leaders scoffed at the renewed Nato
threats. Political and military leaders this week repeated their vehement
refusal to allow the opening of Tuzla airport, which UN relief workers say
would be an important life-line to the desperate city.
Serb chieftains indicated, however, that they would allow the relief of the
Canadians in Srebrenica.
They have called a session of their 'parliament' for Monday to decide
whether to adopt a new platform to put forward at partition talks, due to be
held in Geneva on January 18.
While Serb leaders dismissed the Nato communique as a 'storm in a teacup',
the response in Sarajevo was also lukewarm. A Bosnian radio commentary
appeared to warn against false hopes. It said the stepped-up threats should
not be taken seriously, describing the show of Nato air strength over
Bosnia's skies as a 'spectacle'.

The French government has announced an aid package for the print media in
response to a crisis caused by the recession and outdated publishing
practices, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government
spokesman, gave no overall figure for the aid, which includes a previously
announced subsidy of FFr200m (Dollars 34m) to dailies with poor advertising
revenue. But he said it would involve guaranteeing loans.

FT  13 JAN 94 / US to give Moscow reform incentive: Clinton to press for
faster economic change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will today hold out the promise of accelerated
assistance to Russia, in talks with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, if
the new Russian government remains committed to reform.
Mr Clinton's move comes as the prospect of a reformist cabinet still hangs
in the balance and as the main reformers - Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy
prime minister, and Mr Anatoly Cgubais and Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime
ministers for privatisation and for finance - are themselves doubtful and
divided about the possibility of working in the new cabinet.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is said to favour a 'balanced'
inner cabinet of two conservative and two radical deputy prime ministers - a
structure with which the reformists have said they would be unhappy, and in
which they may refuse to take part.
Mr Clinton's message on the economic front, according to a senior US
official last night, is for 'more reform in Russia and more money from the
west to support it'. This comes after a meeting of senior officials from the
Group of Seven industrialised countries in Frankfurt last weekend agreed
that the International Monetary Fund - the main instrument for providing
financial aid to Russia - should become much more active in offering
assistance to reform.
The IMF last year disbursed, after some hesitation, a Dollars 1.5bn tranche
of a systemic transformation facility designed to encourage and support
reform efforts.
However, negotiations of the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche, and the further
Dollars 4bn for stabilisation, are not expected until the end of this month
and are delayed because of lack of a budget for this year and uncertainties
about the shape of the new cabinet.
The G7 officials, who represent the IMF's main paymasters, believe that
while the IMF should remain the lead agency for assistance and that no new
money should be made available, a fresh effort should be made by the fund
and by the World Bank to put the resources already committed, and their
expertise, more immediately at the service of reform strategies - assuming
that these survive the coming cabinet changes.
They do not believe as some senior US administration members, including
vice-president Al Gore and Mr Strobe Talbott, ambassador at large for the
former Soviet Union, appeared to suggest in the past few weeks, that Russian
efforts to bring down inflation and the budget deficit should be eased.
Instead, they have taken the lesson of the Russia's December elections, in
which communists and ultra-nationalist parties won large shares of the vote,
to mean that the west must not be seen to be too carping in its demand for
precise inflationary and deficit reduction targets.
They believe that western governments and financial institutions should
instead show recognition of the structural reforms already achieved,
especially in the field of privatisation.

<TEXT>
The Swiss government has stepped up the pressure on France over its
expulsion of two Iranian murder suspects, demanding an explanation of why
Paris sent the two home rather than comply with Switzerland's request for
their extradition. writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
French leaders have said only that the move, which violates European
conventions on extradition and the prevention of terrorism, was 'related to
the national interest'. Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, has
already given a dusty response to a US state department request for an
explanation.
'I have no explanation to give the Americans. I am not an employee of Mr
Clinton,' Mr Pasqua said on French radio.
The two Iranians, Moshen Sharif Esfanhi and Ahmed Taheri, were arrested in
France in 1992 at the request of the Swiss authorities in connection with
the murder of Kazem Radjavi, the brother of a Mujahideen leader, in a Geneva
suburb in April 1990.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Georgia near deal on rebel province
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Georgian government officials and representatives of the breakaway province
of Abkhazia were yesterday edging towards an agreement on deployment of
international peacekeeping forces while negotiations on Abkhazia's long-term
political status continue.
The talks, mediated by UN special envoy Edouard Brunner with Mr Boris
Pastukhov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, acting as 'facilitator', began
in Geneva on Tuesday and are due to end today.
The two sides have observed a de facto ceasefire since last September when
Abkhaz forces, in violation of a Russian-brokered ceasefire, seized control
of the territory. In that brief but bloody show of force, 250,000 people,
mostly Georgian, were forced to flee their homes.
On December 1, following a first round of talks in Geneva, the Georgian
government and Abkhaz representatives signed a memorandum of understanding,
which included a pledge not to use force during the period of negotiations,
an exchange of prisoners and the creation of conditions for refugees to
return.
The two sides also appealed to the UN to increase the number of
international observers and to send peacekeeping troops to the conflict
area. The UN security council responded last month by agreeing to send 50
observers.
This week's negotiations have focused largely on where UN troops should be
deployed. The Abkhaz delegation is pressing for them to be confined to the
Inguri river separating the two sides, while the Georgian government wants
them stationed within Abkhazia.
Also under discussion is a plan for refugees to return to a small part of
Abkhazia where the authorities can guarantee their safety. Abkhaz
representatives admit that this is not yet possible throughout the province.
Relatively little progress has been made on the future political status of
Abkhazia. The Abkhaz side wants either full independence or a high degree of
autonomy within a confederal Georgia, despite the fact that before the war
Abkhazians made up only 18 per cent of the region's population. The Georgian
government of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze is pushing for more limited autonomy
within a unitary Georgian state.

FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fading hopes of a reduction in British interest rates in the wake of better
than expected UK employment statistics brought heavy selling pressure in the
derivatives for a second session in a row, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, a brief attempt at an advance in the March contract on the FT-SE
100 Index as it opened at 3,422 petered out with the release of the jobless
numbers, leaving the contract to drift lower.
US investment bank Goldman Sachs was said to have been the day's main player
in the market and independent traders also joined the selling. March
continued to slide, trading at a discount to fair value for most of the day.
However, there was little sign of nervous selling among the London traders
and one futures broker simply said: 'This is an inevitable correction that
should lead us to 3,300, where we are likely to find good support.'
The low of the day was reached at 3,379, but a bout of bear closing in the
last few minutes of the session was expected to continue in after-hours'
trading. March finished at 3,380, down 46 and at a 5-point discount to its
fair value premium of around 13 points.
Business in the stock options boosted overall volume in the traded options,
which saw a total of 48,957 lots dealt by the close.
Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 13,097 contracts and the Euro FT-SE
option traded 5,223 lots.
British Steel was the busiest stock option with a total of 5,006 lots
transacted, followed by Tesco at 4,245. Prudential, at 2,039, and Land
Securities, at 1,898, were also heavily traded.
