FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS overhang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large stock overhang in Great Universal Stores saw the shares marked
sharply down at the opening of business yesterday. But they later recovered
as Smith New Court, the UK securities house, apparently cleared its position
in the stock, which had been taken aboard from a large institutional seller.
The drama started on Tuesday when Smith New Court took delivery of 13m GUS
shares. Just under half were placed on Tuesday at 610p, then a mere 3 per
cent discount to the market price. However, the remaining 8m or so shares
remained unsold overnight, and rival marketmakers were quick to mark the
shares down as soon as London opened yesterday morning.
In late trading it appeared that Smith finally got the majority of the stock
away as a block of 6m was sold at 590p, a move which will have sharply
reduced the broker's profits on the deal. GUS shares closed 27 1/2 down at
592 1/2 p.
BP's move to close its Baglan Bay ethylene plant in South Wales and take a
Pounds 200m exceptional charge in its fourth-quarter results to encompass a
Europe-wide restructuring came as no great surprise to the market.
Nevertheless, the news helped the company's shares outperform most of the
FT-SE 100 stocks and other big international oil issues.
The BP share price raced up to 373p at the outset as a technical short
position was hurriedly filled in. But subsequent weakness across European
equity markets and an early fall on Wall Street saw the appearance of
profit-takers and BP ended a net 3 off at 362 1/2 p.
A Europe-wide retreat by leading electronic stocks impacted heavily on GEC,
the UK's flagship electronics group. The slide was prompted by a profits
warning from Alcatel, of France.
The Alcatel revelations triggered a 9 per cent fall in Alcatel shares in
Paris and also affected Siemens, the German electricals/electronics giant,
which fell about 2 per cent in Frankfurt. GEC dipped 6 to 328 1/2 p amid
hectic trading which saw 9.1m shares dealt.
Optimism from David S. Smith, the paper manufacturer, lifted the sector.
Although the group reported a 10 per cent decline in first-half profits to
Pounds 13.7m, it said the UK economy was picking up, while continental
Europe's slide seemed to be over.
The results coincided with positive comments from Arjo Wiggins Appleton on
European pricing. Arjo rose 7 to 263p, David S. Smith 18 to 456p and Bowater
13 to 477p.
The market became increasingly enthusiastic about the Securicor group of
companies ahead of preliminary figures due this morning. Securicor 'A' added
9 at 910p and Security Services 13 at 780p.
Talk of a share placing at well below the market price hit Vodafone, which
fell 20 to 591p.
Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott jumped 14 to 244p on takeover
speculation.
Food retailers were firm, with SG Warburg said to be positive on selected
stocks. Tesco put on 6 at 235 1/2 p.
Results from First Leisure received a warm welcome from analysts, although a
lack of buying saw the shares drift 4 lower to 291p. Smith New Court was
considering moving its 'hold' stance to 'buy', while NatWest Securities
upgraded to 'outperform'.
More management changes at Ladbroke kept the positive news flow rolling and
the shares gained 3 1/2 at 201 1/2 p.
Good results from Remy Cointreau helped Highland Distilleries, in which it
has a cross-holding and marketing agreement, climb 14 to 373p.
TI Group gave up 13 to 438p after Credit Lyonnais Laing turned seller,
having been a strong buyer recently.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 14.7m, making it the day's most actively
traded stock. After a cautious press interview with the chairman, the shares
shed 3 to 123p.
Shanks &amp; McEwan fell 17 to 97p after the waste management group warned of
lower profits and said Mr Roger Hewitt, its chief executive, was leaving
over a policy row. Smith New Court cut its forecast for the year to March by
Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 8m but strengthened its recommendation, saying the
management change was a step in the right direction.

FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Internationals hit

<TEXT>
Internationally traded stocks suffered as a stronger pound against the US
dollar affected the value of shares traded in New York.
Comments from a UK Treasury official, who sought to dampen further
expectations of early UK interest rate cuts, helped sterling to rise more
than a cent to breach Dollars 1.50 against the dollar. This left UK stocks
traded as American Depositary Receipts looking expensive.
One ADR trader cited Glaxo and suggested that at least half of the slide in
the pharmaceutical company's shares, which fell 16 to 666p, was the result
of sterling's strength.
Many international stocks also attracted fundamental sellers. Among them,
Reuters Holdings fell 47 to 1825p as a lingering row with the Chicago Board
of Trade over Reuters' Globex dealing system flared up again. Perennially
bullish analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said the row was a
'storm in a tea cup' and promptly wrote a buy recommendation.
Wellcome drew some attention after it was announced that full results from
last year's big French study on the anti-Aids treatment AZT would be
published shortly in the Lancet medical journal. The shares dropped 22 to
674p.

FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical stocks unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading chemical companies BOC and ICI were hit by changes of stance from
sec-urities houses which exacerbated the pressure of a sliding market.
Industrial gases group BOC dropped 21 1/2 to 638 1/2 p on turnover of 6.8m
shares after Hoare Govett, a long-term bull, turned seller of the stock and
lowered its current year profits forecast to Pounds 295m from Pounds 340m,
well below the present range of analysts' estimates.
Hoare's Mr Martin Evans said: 'The industrial gases side will be hit as low
inflation inhibits price rises, and we expect a poor performance from the
health care side.'
However, Smith New Court's Mr Philip Morrish said yesterday's share price
move was 'unwarranted' and he reiterated his buy stance.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs advised clients to take profits on stock of ICI,
arguing that the share price could comfortably decline to 700p, although the
company's fundamentals were sound. ICI shares retreated 23 to 773p with 5.8m
traded.

FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall sharply following
employment data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market fell heavily yesterday after news that domestic
unemployment had fallen sharply last month, indicating that good economic
news can be bad news for investors. The fall in unemployment, considerably
greater than predicted, was seen as reducing the chances for an early cut in
UK base rates, and thus weakened one of the props supporting the current
level of share prices. Also disturbed by the overall weakness in continental
European markets, the FT-SE 100 Index tumbled 41.8 to 3,372.
Although upset by yesterday's statistics on the UK economy, and by the
consequent firmness in sterling which also reduced the chances of a base
rate cut, UK market strategists appeared unwilling to change their views on
market prospects. Most strategists have already put back expectations for
the next base rate cut at least until the spring, when the government may
feel that the changes in social security and mortgage taxes will take
effect.
But the general conviction that there is another cut in base rates ahead
remained unchanged. Some analysts, including the BZW team, held to the view
that UK base rates could come down to 4 1/2 per cent this year.
There was good deal of selling yesterday from investors who had remained
unconvinced by the pre-Christmas run-up in share prices. However, the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index, down 24.6 at 3,864.6, continued to outperform the FT-SE 100
Share Index and non-Footsie business represented around 60 per cent of the
day's Seaq volume of 807.6m shares. Tuesday's 882.8m shares through the Seaq
electronic network was worth just over Pounds 2bn in retail business worth,
confirming that genuine investment activity in UK equities remains very
high.
Share prices opened lower in London and were again influenced strongly by
trends in stock index futures. The picture was much the same as at the
beginning of the week. Bank shares continued to soften ahead of the sector
trading statements, and there was little recovery in the store and retail
stocks which are still seen as the key to a genuine recovery in both the UK
economy and also in market sentiment.
International stocks were depressed by yesterday's firmness in sterling,
which threatens their export prospects. Oil shares gave back some of their
recent gains and the pharmaceuticals sector lacked supporters.
One factor undermining overall sentiment across the London markets as well
as in the blue chip sector was the suggestion from several global market
strategists that institutional cash flows could begin to move back towards
Japan. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banking and securities house,
warned that this could mean significant withdrawal of global funds from
other markets - with the UK high on the list of those markets threatened.
London benefited last year from an inflow of international funds.
Weakness in the New York market, which fell 10 Dow points in UK hours, was a
final blow to London, although UK traders saw this as no more than another
temporary factor which did nothing to change investment sentiment. A
technical setback on profit-taking has been widely predicted in the wake of
the pre-Christmas advance in UK equities and few London specialists were
prepared to change their minds on the basis of yesterday's fall in share
prices.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation news is offset
by profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended little changed yesterday after early profit-taking had
overshadowed good news on inflation and a sharp drop in bond yields, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.68 at 3,848.63. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a marginal 0.04 up at
474.17, while the American SE composite gained a net 0.50 at 479.87 and the
Nasdaq composite was 1.35 firmer at 786.87.
NYSE volume totalled 310.7m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,129 to
938.
The day's big economic news was bullish for financial markets. The
government announced that its index of producer prices rose by only 0.1 per
cent in December, and the 'core' measure of producer price inflation (which
excludes the volatile food and energy components) increased by 0.2 per cent
during the month.
The data were in line with expectations, but still produced a strong
reaction from the bond market, where prices of long-dated government
securities advanced sharply, pushing yields lower.
In the late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was up about a point and
the yield was down to 6.169 per cent.
Neither the inflation numbers, nor the bond market's strong performance,
however, was able to breathe life into the equity market, where investors
continued to take profits in the wake of the six-day long new year rally.
However, the profit-taking was not especially heavy, although, as on
Tuesday, some stocks tied closely to the economic cycle (many of which have
risen substantially in recent days) were targeted by the sellers.
Auto makers, which have been in particularly heavy demand lately as
investors bet on another year of improving car and truck sales, retreated.
Ford slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 , General Motors Dollars  1/8 to
59 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 59.
Westinghouse Electric eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of
almost 3.9m shares as investors responded to the news that the company will
take charges of Dollars 750m in a restructuring that will cut Westinghouse's
workforce by 6,000. The company also plans to raise Dollars 500m of new
capital to bolster its balance sheet.
After firming early on, American Express ended down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars
30 5/8 after an analyst at Merrill Lynch upgraded his rating on the stock
from 'neutral' to 'above average'.
Fannie Mae moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 85 3/8 on news of record
fourth-quarter and annual earnings of Dollars 493.6m and Dollars 1.87bn
respectively.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed, with Intel
Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 68 3/8 , Microsoft up just Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 85 1/2 and Apple Computer off Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 1/2.
Canada
Toronto stocks staged a late-session turnround in extremely heavy trade on a
rebound in bank issues and a continued strong rise in media shares.
The TSE 300 index was finally 7.3 up at an all-time peak of 4,454.7 and
advances led falls by 403 to 390 after volume of 99.5m shares, the fourth
heaviest day's trade on record, and valued at CDollars 1.32bn.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Alcatel slides 12% putting
pressure on French equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual stories played a major part in trading yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Alcatel was the main story in PARIS as investors reacted nervously to
comments by Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman, that turnover and profits would
fall this year. Brokers' downgrades followed and the shares were suspended
during the session limit down, before closing off FFr110 or 12.2 per cent at
FFr792. A low of FFr787 was recorded as volume reached some 3.8m shares.
The effect on the CAC-40 index was to leave it down 49.43 or 2 per cent at
2,281.90.
Turnover was heavy at FFr9.2bn.
In contrast Thomson-CSF gained from switching out of Alcatel, with the
shares rising FFr11.30 or 5.8 per cent to FFr206.90.
FRANKFURT slipped back further as worries over the future of
Metallgesellschaft affected sentiment and the slide in Alcatel affected
Siemens stock.
At the official close the DAX index was quoted down 19.57 at 2,209.18, but
in after hours trading selling took hold to drive the Ibis calculated index
down 45.70 to 2,182.36.
Turnover was DM11bn.
News that Norddeutsche Landesbank, one of industrial group's main creditor
banks, was unwilling to accept the rescue package by yesterday's 5pm
deadline, hit overall sentiment. Deutsche Bank, the main shareholder, which
has criticised the stance of NordLB fared badly, down DM10.70 to DM851.50 at
the close, and then sliding to DM839.00 in the after market. Daimler,
another shareholder, fell DM7.50 to DM849.00, and to DMDM834 in the post.
Metallgesellschaft lost DM10 to DM226, then to DM223 in the after market.
Siemens dipped ahead of today's expected announcement of results with
analysts anticipating disappointing news. The shares fell DM19 to DM762.50,
before ending the post-bourse session at DM751.50.
AMSTERDAM also saw a downturn as the AEX index slipped 7.66 or 1.8 per cent
to 416.35 following sharp falls in a number of the major issues: Royal Dutch
off Fl 1.70 at Fl 208.00, Unilever down Fl 4.50 at Fl 219.30 and Elsevier
down Fl 4.90 at Fl 177.70 for instance.
Further switching was seen out of Akzo and into DSM as the former lost Fl
4.90 to Fl 203.00 and the latter rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 112.30.
MILAN was distracted by the day's fast moving and constantly changing
political developments as the government faced up to the long awaited vote
of confidence. The Comit index added 3.26 to 605.39 with the mood again
restrained by the absence of a firm date for the general election.
Montedison again saw huge volume of 47.9m shares, slipping L6.30 to L922.40
as the market awaited the outcome of the rights issue which closed on
Monday.
Olivetti shed L6.30 to L2,047 on news that ENI had joined forces with Fiat
and Fininvest to bid for the second license for Italy's mobile telephone
network.
ZURICH finished easier but up from earlier lows with the SMI index 27.6 down
to 2,999.0.
SBC bearers, the most actively-traded share, fell SFr6 to SFr507 after
Tuesday's strong gains. Winterthur shed SFr26 to SFr833 and Swiss Re was
SFr12 lower at SFr720.
Recently strong cyclical shares recorded losses. BBC Brown Boveri fell SFr33
to SFr1,132, and Alusuisse bearers were SFr24 lower at the day's low of
SFr620.
Foreign selling again pressured SMH, the watchmaker, leaving the registered
shares SFr10 lower at SFr191.
MADRID was left lower by profit-taking and the early fall on Wall Street,
and the general index shed 2.55 to 330.84, with constructions and electrical
stocks hardest hit.
Banks were stable, still soothed by Tuesday's comments by Mr Mario Conde,
the former chairman of Banesto. Banco Central Hispano added Pta15 to
Pta3,260 while Banco Santander added Pta50 to Pta6,590.
STOCKHOLM closed lower for the first time in 1994 mainly on profit-taking
and awaiting the outcome of today's Riksbank council meeting. The
Affarsvarlden general index dropped 13.2 to 1,495.3.
Volvo B bucked the trend to jump SKr8 to SKr585, with the climb attributed
to positive analyses and car statistics. Ericsson B tumbled SKr8 to SKr353
on Wall Street declines.
OSLO lost out as investors took short term profits on recent gains. The all
share index fell 6.08 to 641.23 in turnover of NKr784.4m.
Shipping shares bore the brunt of the falls but financials moved ahead on
hopes of lower interest rates and good dividends from smaller companies.
BRUSSELS reversed early gains and the Bel-20 index lost 5.12 to 1,489.91.
Turnover was BFr2.4bn. Clabecq added BFr60 to BFr840 on improved earnings
prospects.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Time to reflect on gains seen in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an impressive year all round for the world's emerging markets in
1993, but the question now exercising many minds is whether similar returns
can be expected in 1994.
Already in the first few days of the new year sharp declines have been
recorded in a number of markets - Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Mexico for
instance - although for different reasons.
With regard to the Asian region, some analysts find few surprises in the
reverses being recorded: they note that there was substantial year-end book
building and the current situation is a healthy return to more realistic
levels.
However, a more measured opinion comes from Mr Jonathon Compton at Credit
Lyonnais Securities. He suggests that the 100 per cent returns which have
delighted investors over the last couple of years are unlikely to be
repeated in 1994.
'Such returns are almost certainly unrepeatable this year, and I would
expect instead to see something in the order of 10 per cent; still pretty
good but not like people have been used to,' he says.
Of particular concern is the situation developing in China, he adds, which
is, he believes, heading towards a balance of payments crisis, sooner rather
than later.
'One is looking at a 50 per cent probability that China will face a
combination of high inflation, high interest rates and a weak currency.'
Another factor likely to influence Asian trading this year, says Mr Compton,
is the trend towards higher interest rates, heavily influenced by the
situation in the US.
In Latin America, Brazil remains the unknown, depending on the outcome of
the reform plan, but otherwise, says Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson,
the region is likely to be a beneficiary of a movement of funds out of other
regions, particularly Asia.
In addition it can be expected that UK funds will move increasingly into
Latin America since they have minimal exposure there at present, notes Mr
Palmer.
If the Brazilian rescue package is supported by congress a further boost
will be granted to both the country and the region.
The team at BZW in London find Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile
attractive.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok falls 7.3% on
selling flurry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Late afternoon index-linked buying lifted prices, and the Nikkei average
finished 1.7 per cent higher, posting its sixth consecutive rise, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index added 308.63 at 18,793.88 after a low of 18,301.93 in
the morning and a high of 18,807.08 just before the close. The sudden wave
of demand after a mainly quiet day took most investors by surprise, with
some traders saying much of the buying was speculative.
The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 10.59 up at 1,511.43, and
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.68 at 1,252.09. Volume came to
410m shares, against 441m. Rises led declines by 792 to 234, with 144 issues
unchanged.
Corporate investors continued to take profits ahead of the March book
closing, depressing bank stocks. Active buying by foreign investors, seen
during the past few trading sessions, was absent, while some dealers also
took profits.
Housing and real estate shares were supported by reports that Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, was planning to set up a task force to study
measures to revive the real estate market. Tokyu Land rose Y18 to Y666 and
Daiwa House Industry put on Y10 at Y1,610.
Shipping issues, considered relatively cheap, were bought, with Dawasaki
Kisen Kaisha moving ahead Y15 to Y345 and Iino Kaiun Kaisha Y15 to Y575.
Some banks were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y10
to Y2,860 and Sumitomo Bank also lost Y10, to Y1,980.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 117.73 to 20,502.48 in volume of 41.7m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets remained in an extremely volatile state yesterday, with
sharp falls seen in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Singapore.
However, Mr Jonathan Dennis of HG Asia commented that there was no common
theme to link the day's falls; each of the markets was reacting to local
developments. He noted that the day's falls had returned the indices in the
four markets close to the levels seen on December 21 as the speculative
bubble seen over the Christmas and new year period had finally burst. This
begged questions about whether there would be the traditional run-up to the
Lunar New Year from February 10 to 12.
BANGKOK plummeted 7.3 per cent, its sharpest ever one-day fall, as
foreigners and local investors joined in a selling flurry that hit the
recent gainers hardest. The SET index shed 117.30 to 1,487.76 in turnover of
Bt24bn.
Finance, property and banking led the falls, with finance issues down 9.2
per cent.
KUALA LUMPUR tumbled 6.4 per cent, having been more than 12 per cent down at
one stage, after the central bank took tougher measures to sap liquidity and
flush out hot money from the banking system. The composite index was off
73.33 at 1,066.22 after a day's low of 1,015.14.
Yesterday's fall came on top of a 5.6 per cent slide on Tuesday after a
warning by a government adviser that the market had risen too steeply.
HONG KONG continued its steep slide as it saw further profit-taking by
foreign, mostly Japanese, institutions. The Hang Seng index dropped 443.08,
or 4 per cent, to 10,712.73, having been 562 points down at one stage.
Turnover amounted to HKDollars 7.78bn.
SINGAPORE saw another plunge amid heavy retail and institutional selling
which left the Straits Times Industrial index 87.89, or 3.7 per cent, lower
at 2,260.31.
TAIWAN finished weaker in shrinking turnover as the market consolidated and
an official was quoted as saying that the central bank would act to correct
excessive flows of funds into the market. The weighted index fell 25.18 to
6,215.21.
MANILA was down for the fourth straight day, although bargain hunters
emerged for selected stocks. The Manila index shed 111.39 to 2,978.00.
SEOUL picked up on demand for blue chips and shares with low price/earnings
ratios, in spite of further selling by the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation
Fund. The composite index put on 5.29 at 886.31.
BOMBAY moved sharply higher after the market was shaken out of a dull start
by a fresh round of buying in later trading, brokers said. The BSE 30-share
index finished 123.69 ahead at 3,903.79. KARACHI remained at a record peak
and the KSE 100-share index rose 35.73 to 2,382.87.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sterling sharply higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pound yesterday remained the focus of market attention after stronger
than expected UK employment data, and growing scepticism about the
likelihood of an early British rate cut, pushed the British currency sharply
higher against the D-Mark and dollar, writes Gillian Tett.
After breaching the DM2.60 level early in the session, it moved by more than
1 1/2 pfennigs over the course of the day to reach its highest level since
the ERM crisis in September 1992. It gained a cent on the day against the
dollar, which was little changed by the US producer prices index released
yesterday.
The UK employment data, which showed that the jobless total fell a
provisional, seasonally adjusted 46,800 in December to 2.77m, down to 9.8
per cent from 10 per cent in November, took the market by surprise. Market
forecasts had been around 20,000.
The data triggered a rapid rally in the British currency. After closing at
DM2.5944 in London on Tuesday, it pushed through the DM2.60 barrier early in
the morning and then briefly hovered near DM2.6130 before finally closing at
DM2.6072.
Sterling also rose against the dollar yesterday, although dealers said its
movements were primarily a by-product of trading between sterling and the
D-Mark. It briefly touched Dollars 1.5050, before slipping back to Dollars
1.5013, up from the previous day's finish of Dollars 1.4913.
The pound's initial rise was dogged by some controversy, after it staged a
small rally against the D-Mark about 10 minutes ahead of the release of the
employment data.
But though this sparked rumours that figures might have been leaked, traders
pointed out that the move might simply have been the result of one
particular bank taking a view.
With the unemployment data now reinforcing the market's confidence in the UK
economic recovery, sterling is expected to rise further against a weak
D-Mark. 'There is a good chance of seeing it at the DM2.65 levels soon,'
said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, who
predicts it could reach DM2.63 levels shortly.
The only factor that could undermine sterling now, he said, would be a
serious UK political upheaval. But since the UK is one of the few European
countries not to have an election planned this year, he thinks this poses
less of a threat than elsewhere in Europe.
Sterling's trade weighted index closed at 82.9 per cent of its 1985 value,
its highest since September 1992. Some dealers believe that the UK
government might intervene if the pound rises much above DM2.65 to protect
exporters.
But after Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday
said that the government was comfortable with existing monetary policy and
'unlikely' to cut rates, expectations of an early rate reduction receded.
'Many people did not believe the upside was very large, but now there is
some revision going on about how high sterling can go,' said Mr Mark Austin,
treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets.
Interest rate scepticism was reflected in sterling futures, where the March
contract fell to 94.63, its lowest level this year, compared to 94.81 on New
Year's Eve.
'The market now thinks we are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle. We
have been in a negative yield curve (in the UK money market) for a long
time, but the signs are we could be moving into a positive one,' commented
one money market dealer.
Anticipation of today's US consumer price index ensured that the dollar
continued to attract attention. Yesterday's producer price index figures,
which showed that the PPI fell 0.1 per cent in December, were broadly in
line with the market forecast.
As a result the dollar remained fairly steady against the D-Mark and yen,
ending at Y112.4 from a previous Y112.5, and at DM1.7366 from Tuesday's
DM1.7398 close. In New York trading it finished at Y112.27 and DM1.7338.
Dealers said the dollar was likely to remain bound in a narrow range against
the D-Mark unless the Bundesbank signalled that it would cut interest rates
or today's US CPI figure was significantly different from market forecasts.
However, the release of revised figures showing that average West German
inflation grew by 4.2 per cent in 1993, up from 4 per cent, again underlined
the inflationary factors that are underpinning the Bundesbank's cautious
monetary stance.
The Bundesbank yesterday allocated DM75.5bn of securities repurchase funds
at this week's tender at a fixed rate of 6 per cent.
Today's repo is the first of two set at a fixed rate of 6 per cent at the
Bundesbank council meeting last week.
German call money rates yesterday remained steady, with call money traded
within a range of 6.05 to 6.15 per cent. Conditions on the UK money markets
eased yesterday after the Bank of England removed Pounds 1.413bn of the
Pounds 1.6bn forecast shortage. Overnight money rates fell to 5 1/4 per
cent.
The Italian lira remained in the spotlight as markets awaited the outcome of
the no confidence debate in the Italian parliament.
In spite of concerns that fresh political scandal could undermine the lira,
it marginally strengthened to L974.7 against the D-Mark, from a previous
day's close of L978.4.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators push up metal
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculators are ignoring the fundamentally poor outlook for base metals and
driving up prices on the London Metal Exchange, traders and analysts
suggest. The trend could be reversed very quickly, they point out.
'Metals are cheap compared with the stock and bond markets and a little
money can move prices quite a long way,' Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain
&amp; Co, part of the Deutsche Bank group, said last night. 'Any speculator who
bought at the lows and sold at the highs today would have made a tidy
profit.'
Traders said the only solid buying yesterday was in the copper market, where
some investment funds were influenced by strengthening demand for the metal
in the US and a fall in New York Commodity Exchange stock levels.
Mr Bielski pointed out that nickel was the 'star performer' in the present
rally, having moved up by 50 per cent from the lows in October even though
the metal's prospects had been deteriorating.
Nickel for delivery in three months closed last night another Dollars 160 up
at Dollars 5,707.50 a tonne, having jumped by nearly 8 per cent since
Friday's close. Three-month copper added Dollars 27.75 a tonne yesterday to
close at Dollars 1,800.5, up by about 3 per cent since Friday.

New Zealand's sheep and beef farmers are looking forward to a bonanza year
thanks to a happy coincidence of excellent weather, an improving
international economic climate and the settlement in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Rob Davison, director of the Meat and Wool Board's Economic Service,
yesterday predicted that the average farm's pre-tax profits would rise by
about 15 per cent to NZDollars 42,300 (Pounds 15,900), which would be the
highest level since the 1984-85 season.
Mr Davison said the year's start was 'excellent by all measures'. Cattle
were in good condition and the numbers and condition of lambs was greatly
improved on last season. He suggested that there could be some rebuilding of
the national sheep flock, which fell to 50.3m head late last year, a 30-year
low.
Over the past decade sheep numbers have fallen by 20m, from an all-time high
of 70.3m in 1983, in reaction to a combination of low wool prices and
adverse weather conditions that has encouraged farmers to switch to dairying
and forestry.
Good seasonal conditions were expected to boost the wool clip and provide a
7 per cent rise in production, Mr Davison said. Wool prices had been
volatile but were expected to show an underlying upward trend.
In a separate report the Wool Board said that the average market indicator,
the price of wool per kilogram, was 400 NZ cents at December 30, compared
with the board's own forecast 400 to 425 cents. In its review of the first
six months of the season the board said it expected prices to continue to
improve over the rest of the season to June 30. It said it was sticking with
its prediction of an average price this season of up to 425 cents a
kilogram.
In his report Mr Davison said farmers should expect good prices to continue
for lamb and sheep, which should rise by a further 5 per cent on last
season.
'The outlook for sheep products is good. Though wool prices are at a low
level for the fourth consecutive year, growth in the world economy and lower
wool supplies are expected to lift prices over the next few years,' he
explained.
'The Gatt agreement provides optimism for the future, though in the current
year access problems remain.'. Last week the US confirmed that it was
reducing the amount of beef it would buy from New Zealand in the coming 12
months.
'The medium term prospect for meat and wool farmers is for less competition
from subsidised producers, which has been leading to surpluses on world
markets and lower prices,' Mr Davison said. New Zealand farmers operate
without subsidies of any kind.
Discussing beef prices, Mr Davison said the outlook was less certain.
'Prices are are expected to ease by 5 to 8 per cent from last season, but
will still be at a good level for the fifth consecutive year,' he said.

compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Court is being asked to decide whether the British government
should set up a scheme to force tenant farmers to compensate landowners when
they transfer European Union livestock quotas elsewhere.
A judicial review sought by the Country Landowners Association, which says
holdings can become uncommercial if farmers transfer or sell quotas on
giving up the land, yesterday transferred the case to the European Court.
This could mean a delay of up to 18 months before it is heard.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian copper/gold reserve
estimates lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further confirmation came yesterday that the highlands of Irian Jaya in
Indonesia contain one of the world's great copper-gold ore bodies.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold revealed that proven and probable reserves at
the Ertsberg/Grasberg mining complex there had been increased substantially
in the past year and said that the current USDollars 140m expansion
programme was on schedule to boost annual production to about 1.1bn lb of
copper and 1.5m troy ounces of gold in 1996. This will make the complex the
world's second-largest copper producer - accounting for about 5 per cent of
western world demand - and one of the top ten gold producers.
Last year Ertsberg/Grasberg sold about 644m lb of copper and 740m ounces of
gold.
Grasberg already had the largest published gold reserve of any single
operating mine. Freeport said yesterday that in the past year another 7m
ounces had been discovered, boosting reserves by 22 per cent to 39.1m
ounces. Copper reserves were up by 28 per cent, or 5.9bn lb, to 26.8bn lb
and silver reserves jumped by 72 per cent, or 32m ounces, to 76.7m ounces.
Even at the expanded capacity the increased reserves give the mine a life of
about 25.5 years but Freeport continues to explore - it has nine drilling
rigs in operation.
Freeport also announced that its fourth-quarter 1993 net income would be
about 15 cents a share compared with 17 cents in the same months of 1992.
The latest figure includes an estimated Dollars 9m loss at Rio Tinto Minera
in Spain, which Freeport acquired last year so as to have 'captive' copper
smelting capacity for some of the Indonesian concentrate (an intermediate
material).
Freeport Copper, 72 per cent-owned by Freeport-McMoRan, another US quoted
group, in turn controls 85 per cent of Freeport Indonesia, which owns and
operates the Ertsberg/Grasberg complex.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Adding value to the sweet-talk
 -Alison Maitland meets a man who is undaunted by the task of reviving the
fortunes of the International Sugar Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Peter Baron, the new executive director of the International Sugar
Organisation, likes to look on the bright side. He even professes to be 'one
of the few who like Canary Wharf,' the controversial east London development
in which the ISO now has its headquarters. 'It's the 21st century here,' he
says, surveying the Thames and an adjacent muddy building site from the
fifth floor office in which he took up residence at the start of the year.
The German-born commodity expert's cheery outlook could be a valuable asset
as he takes the reins of an organisation struggling to recover from a series
of setbacks that threatened its survival.
'It was a real challenge for me to come back,' says Dr Baron, 53, who has
run German wine policy in Bonn for the past three years, after 15 years as
his country's chief representative at the world's food commodity meetings.
He was seen as a forceful chairman of the International Cocoa Council in
London in 1990 and presided over the United Nations sugar conference in
Geneva in 1992, which hammered out a new five-year agreement.
'I love the international commodity business and I jumped at the chance. It
was a particular challenge to take over an organisation under difficult
circumstances.'
A financial crisis in 1992, precipitated by defaults in subscription
payments, took the ISO to the brink of liquidation. Then, when the new sugar
agreement was reached, the US withdrew because its proposal to downgrade the
body to a study group was rejected.
Some say a study group is what the sugar body has effectively become. The US
move coincided with a growing rejection by governments of international
commodity agreements on the grounds that the market, rather than buffer
stocks and quotas, would prove more effective at balancing supply and
demand.
International sugar agreements were stripped of economic measures for
intervening in the market in 1985, following the failure of buffer stocks to
stabilise the market in the 1970s and 1980s.
A further blow to the ISO's standing was the break-up of the Soviet Union,
which led to a drop in votes of more than 10 per cent. Today the
organisation has just 30 members, compared with 59 in 1982, when the sugar
agreement still contained economic measures, and 42 in 1992.
Dr Baron is undaunted. 'Let's start with the good news,' he says. 'Ecuador
joined a few days ago.'
He sees the recruitment of new members as one of his most important tasks.
'The more members we have, the better and more reliable our data and studies
because members have to give us their statistical data. We also need a safe
financial base. The more members share the burden, the less individual
members have to pay.'
The cost is Pounds 396 a vote, with smaller countries having at least six
votes while the European Union, the largest member, has 413 out of a total
of 1,834.
Dr Baron, whose appointment followed the death last year of his predecessor,
Mr Alfredo Ricart, hopes to persuade the US, as well as Canada and the
Philippines, which left at about the same time, to return to the fold. He
also aims to win back Russia and Ukraine and has had 'very encouraging
contacts' with Arab League states, which are big sugar consumers.
'The key question is whether the ISO can convince its bosses, the
governments, that it's valuable having membership and continuing to
subscribe,' says Mr Chris Pack, head of research at Czarnikow, the London
trade house.
The ISO has a budget of just Pounds 800,000. It is still owed Pounds 250,000
in subscription arrears, some of it dating back to 1988, and has cut its
staff from 29 to 10 in the past three years.
'It's not easy to cope with the expectations of members with this small
budget,' says Dr Baron. 'But in a couple of years we should convince them
we're worth that and a bit more.'
The ISO has 'the best data network in sugar worldwide', he says, pointing to
its 'little red book' of statistics on production, consumption, imports,
exports and stocks for each country, its regular publications, international
seminars and market analysis.
Another of his objectives is to help raise sugar consumption, growing by
about 2 per cent a year globally, by exploring non-food uses for sugar.
Mr Pack of Czarnikow believes Dr Baron is the man for the job, although he
says it is unclear what new functions the sugar organisation might take on.
'He's got a reputation for hard work and lots of German thoroughness. If
there's a role for the ISO to play then he will spend a great deal of energy
in finding it.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Hectic trading as borrowers rush to
take advantage of low rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent flood of Eurobond issues showed no sign of abating yesterday as
borrowers rushed to take advantage of low funding rates while investors
continued to buy heavily in the hope that yields would continue to decline.
Most of the activity took place in the Eurosterling market, which saw Pounds
950m of fresh supply, and the reviving Ecu sector, where more than Ecu1bn of
new bonds were issued. In total, some 25 issues were launched.
Barclays Bank kicked off a hectic day in the sterling sector with its Pounds
500m of 10-year bonds via joint lead managers BZW and Salomon Brothers. The
bonds were priced at 30 basis points over gilts and, according to the lead
managers, met with good investor demand, especially from investors in Europe
and eastern Asia who were attracted by the UK currency's recent strength.
Overseas interest in sterling assets has been spurred by the pound's recent
rally. Sterling yesterday reached its highest level against the D-Mark since
September 1992 at DM2.613, and many investors expect that trend to continue
amid further signs of economic recovery in the UK. Some expect UK interest
rates to be cut if the currency firms much further, which would give an
added boost to sterling bond markets. 'Whichever way you look at it, you
have a 'win-win' situation,' said one observer.
Close on the heels of the Barclays issue came three five-year sterling
deals. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society issued Pounds 150m of
five-year floating-rate notes paying interest of three-month Libor plus 10
basis points, which saw solid demand from UK and continental European
investors, an official at lead manager Kleinwort Benson said.
Another two straight bonds followed, driven by attractive swap opportunities
in the five-year area. The Dutch bank, De Nationale Investeringsbank, issued
Pounds 150m of five-year bonds at 30 basis points over gilts via Samuel
Montagu. That compared with a 45 basis-point spread over gilts for the
Pounds 150m five-year bonds for the Nationwide Building Society, which was
launched shortly afterwards via Baring Brothers.
Syndicate managers expect more sterling issuance in the next few days,
including a 25-year bond for Lloyds Bank totalling around Pounds 300m.
Meanwhile, the Ecu market continued its comeback, absorbing five issues
worth Ecu1.07bn with relative ease, helped by the market's resilience
following the French government's auction of Ecu990m of five- and 10-year
OATs.
'There's very real investor demand for current-coupon Ecu bonds - retail
investors like to see a fresh name priced below par,' said a syndicate
manager. Moreover, with some Dollars 16.2bn worth of Ecu bonds maturing this
year, the deals provide much-needed liquidity after the recent dearth of Ecu
issuance.
BellSouth Capital Funding Corporation's Ecu125m of five-year bonds met with
strong retail demand in continental Europe, especially Switzerland, a
syndicate official with lead manager Morgan Stanley said.
The remaining issues all had seven-year maturities: Ecu200m for the Caisse
Francaise de Developpement via joint lead managers BZW and Goldman Sachs;
Ecu200m for KFW International Finance via Goldman Sachs; Ecu300m for Credit
Foncier de France via Paribas Capital Markets, and Ecu250m of bonds for UK
Pass-Through Securities via Morgan Stanley.
The market was awash with rumours that Canada will launch Dollars 2bn of
five-year floating-rate notes today, priced at between 15 and 20 basis
points below three-month Libor.
Syndicate sources said that Goldman Sachs, UBS and CS First Boston have been
awarded the mandate for the issue.
The D-Mark sector had to digest another large bank issue, DM1bn of 10-year
bonds for Bayerische Landesbank, via Bayerische Landesbank and UBS. The
issue, syndicated by a small consortium of non-German banks, was placed
mainly outside Germany. While the pricing was fair, recent heavy supply of
10-year bank bonds may mean that the paper will only be absorbed slowly,
said an official with one of the deal's co-managers.
The French franc sector saw the launch of FFr2.5bn for the triple-A rated
Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes via J. P. Morgan and Societe Generale. While
the issue was 'not a blow-out', it was seen to be fairly priced and met
interest from European investors attracted by franc's strength, a syndicate
official said.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange is to offer options on the Nasdaq-100
index, a popular over-the-counter stock index, from January 28. The
Nasdaq-100 index has a 94 per cent price correlation with the Nasdaq
Composite Index.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Low inflation figures prompt big advances
in US Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN AND SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
The long end of the US Treasury market posted big gains yesterday as
investors reacted positively to news of low inflation.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  29/32 at 101
1/16 , to yield 6.166 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly firmer,
however, up  1/32 at 100 13/32 , yielding 4.015 per cent.
The news that sparked the buying was the 0.1 per cent rise in December
producer prices.
Although the figure was in line with market expectations, prices rose as
investors judged that the second half of the monthly inflation data -
today's consumer prices report - would be equally bullish for fixed-income
instruments.
Dealers said the long end was further buoyed by short-covering and
futures-related buying. The latter was the result of the March T-bond
contract breaking through a technical barrier, which sparked demand from
retail accounts, and which in turn prompted heavy buying in the cash market.
A dramatic decline in the UK unemployment rate for December wiped out hopes
of a near-term cut in interest rates and depressed the gilt market yesterday
morning, reducing earlier gains in UK government bond prices.
Short-dated gilts closed marginally weaker while longer-dated issues ended
about  1/8 of a point higher.
The gilt market opened on a firm note, and prices rallied across the curve
with the long end showing the strongest gains. However, prices fell back
after the release of unemployment data which showed that the number of
jobless fell by 46,800 in December, reducing the unemployment rate to 9.8
per cent from 10.0 per cent the previous month.
Dealers said the news fuelled speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, will decide to keep interest rates at current levels when they hold
their regular policy meeting today.
Other European bond markets gained encouragement from the US rally. However,
the German bund market lost some of its earlier gains as hopes of a further
easing of interest rates faded, following comments by several Bundesbank
council members. 'If German M3 money supply for December is high, the
Bundesbank won't be cutting rates this month,' one analyst said.
The Spanish market, which is experiencing a revival of international
interest, performed strongly, gaining half a point.
'Spain has come back into fashion,' said Mr Juonni Kokko, an international
economist at Warburg, noting that the peseta has recovered to Pta82.70
against the D-Mark. 'If anything, the implication of the Banesto scandal is
that rates may have to come down more than expected,' he added.
The Italian market also performed impressively, rallying a further 30 basis
points as political fears eased. Traders hope that the parliamentary debate
over a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Carlo Ciampi will produce an
early general election.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: 'Flex' deals offered on FT-SE
Mid 250
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, is to launch both
standard and 'flex' futures and option contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index.
This steals a march on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange (Liffe), which has also been granted a licence by the London stock
exchange to trade Mid 250 derivatives.
'Flex,' or flexible contracts - which can be tailored to individual needs,
like over-the-counter products, but which are cleared through an exchange -
have already been introduced in the US market, but the OMLX instruments will
be the first of their kind in the UK.
'What we discovered is that there is not a huge demand for one specific use,
but for a range of uses,' said Mr Lynton Jones, OMLX chief executive.
These uses include asset allocation, hedging existing portfolios, writing
options against stock holdings to enhance returns, and playing the spread
between the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices or the cash market.
OMLX said it expected to launch the contracts in a matter of weeks.
Liffe has not yet formulated its plans for Mid 250 derivatives. 'We believe
that the timing is very important,' said Liffe chief executive, Mr Daniel
Hodson. 'We are still engaged in looking at the alternatives.' These include
listing Mid 250 futures on its APT screen trading system.
Liffe is also developing an options trading system, which could be used for
the Mid 250, including 'flex' options.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia posts 50%
profit rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Alcoa of Australia, the alumina producer owned by Aluminum Company of the US
and Melbourne-based Western Mining Corporation, yesterday reported a 50.4
per cent surge in profits after tax but before abnormal items for 1993, to
ADollars 389.4m (USDollars 268.69m).
Earlier, its US parent reported a loss of USDollars 16.7m, or 28 cents a
share, for the fourth quarter, blaming a continued fall in prices for
primary aluminium and aluminium sheet used for drinks cans.
Alcoa of Australia warned that the outlook for 1994 was far less
encouraging.
'The prolonged recession, inventory problems in the industry and consequent
depressed alumina and aluminium prices present a very difficult start to
1994,' it said.
Inter-government negotiations over how to deal with the industry's
over-production problems are expected to take place in Brussels next week;
weak demand and increased aluminium exports from Russia have sent prices
tumbling to record lows in recent years.
Alcoa of Australia's progress last year came on sales revenue virtually
static in domestic dollar terms, ADollars 2.19bn against ADollars 2.17bn
last time. However, the company said that this masked higher shipments and a
lower exchange rate. Export revenue totalled ADollars 1.87bn, compared with
ADollars 1.85bn in the previous year.
At the operating profit level, the company saw a 35.3 per cent improvement
to ADollars 584.8m, helped by improvements in productivity and lower raw
material costs. After tax and abnormal items, which generated a tax-related
gain of ADollars 59.7m, Alcoa's profit reached ADollars 449.1m, compared
with ADollars 258.9m last time.
In the final quarter of the year, net profit after tax reached ADollars
88.9m, against ADollars 55.3m, but Alcoa said the alumina production rate
was cut by 6 per cent during the period because of decreased demand. This,
in turn, raised unit costs.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Emirates airline discloses
results for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emirates, the fastest growing Middle East airline, which yesterday won the
Executive Travel Magazine 'Airline of the Year Award,' made a net profit of
Dh10.6m (Dollars 2.9m) for the year ending March 1993 on turnover of
Dh1.8bn.
Mr Maurice Flanagan, the Dubai-based airline's managing director, yesterday
disclosed its financial performance for the first time since the Dubai
state-owned carrier was set up nine years ago.
He said Emirates had operated profitably every year since its constitution
except in its second financial year, ending March 1987.
The airline expects net profits to increase in the current year, although
the total would depend on its expansion plans, Mr Flanagan said.
Net profits for 1992-93 were sharply lower than the Dh67.5m reported for
1991-92 on turnover of Dh1.46bn.
Although 1991-92 coincided with the Gulf war and the most difficult year in
the airline's short history, the record profits that year reflected the fact
that Emirates continued to operate all its flights to Europe and to India
and south-east Asia.
'Although the market diminished significantly during the Gulf war we
massively increased our share of the market,' Mr Flanagan said.
The lower profits last year reflected a 54 per cent increase in the
airline's capacity at a time when the rest of the world airlines industry
was seeking to reduce expansion.
Emirates now flies to 32 destinations and expects passenger numbers to
increase from 1.7m in the year to March 1993 to more than 2m in 1993-94.
Mr Flanagan said the airline received no subsidies from its government
shareholder and was expected to operate under the same tough financial
conditions as other market driven companies. 'We get no favours from our
owners,' Mr Flanagan insisted.
The airline and its associate airport activities employ 7,800 people and
operate a fleet of 13 Airbus wide-body A310 and A300 aircraft and two Boeing
727 narrow-body aircraft.
The airline also has firm orders for seven Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and
options for an additional seven, all powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines.
Mr Flanagan said Emirates was planning to expand its services to London next
summer, with additional flights to Gatwick on top of the two daily services
to Heathrow. In the longer term, the airline is considering using its new
Boeing 777s to start non-stop services from Dubai to New York.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Equity Issues: Bumper crop of US offers makes
1993 record year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year saw a surge in new international equity issues, making 1993 a
record-breaking year with a bumper crop of share offerings from US
companies, as well as privatisations in Europe and some emerging market
countries.
Altogether, new international equity issues raised Dollars 38.78bn, a 71 per
cent increase on the Dollars 22.67bn of 1992, according to IFR Securities
Data. Investment bankers expect international equity offerings to continue
to boom in 1994.
Low US interest rates and the prospect of declining rates in much of Europe
encouraged investors to look for higher returns elsewhere, with the focus on
the rallying stock markets in the main industrialised countries and some
emerging markets.
The US topped the league table of issuers, with Dollars 10.1bn of new
issues. Argentina jumped to second place with a total of Dollars 2.88bn
following the privatisation of YPF, the country's oil and gas company, in
June, when the state sold 45 per cent for Dollars 3.04bn, including a
Dollars 2.28bn international tranche.
Spain (Dollars 2.83bn), France (Dollars 2.59bn), Mexico (Dollars 2.38bn) and
the UK (Dollars 2.03bn) saw substantial issuance, with privatisations
providing the lion's share.
France saw privatisation issues from BNP, the banking group, and from
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, while Spain saw substantial issues from
Argentaria, the banking concern, and Repsol, the energy and chemicals group,
and the UK government sold its remaining 22 per cent of British
Telecommunications.
In addition, a handful of European companies launched Initial Public
Offerings for their US subsidiaries to take advantage of US stock market
conditions.
For example, Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group,
launched US IPOs for minority stakes in its Union Switch Signal and Elsag
Bailey Process Automation subsidiaries; Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and
metals group, sold OM Group, its US speciality chemicals subsidiary, through
an IPO in the US; and Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group, launched
an IPO for its associate Home Holdings.
Mr Hank Erbe, equity syndicate manager at Lehman Brothers in London, says
these IPOs provided 'opportunistic ways to raise funds' as companies saw
their assets could get better valuations in the US.
As for 1994, bankers hope to see the privatisation bonanza continue in
Europe, with France and Italy expected to provide the main candidates, while
Latin America and the Far East should also generate plenty of new issues for
emerging market investors.
'The key to new issuance will continue to be the interest rate environment
and the increasing internationalisation of US investor portfolios. As yields
decline across the curve, we will see further flows into equities,' says one
banker.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paint manufacturers learn the
oldest lesson of all - A sector shake-up has shown that the customer must
still come first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New technology is not enough. Without a network of customers to sell to,
innovators are doomed to licensing.
So said Mr Alex Ramig, one of the US's most respected industrial chemists,
when discussing ICI's pollution-reducing car paint Aquabase in 1991.
Yesterday, his words proved prophetic - although Mr Ramig, who was picked up
by ICI when it bought the US paint giant Glidden in 1986 and now heads
paints research, was part of making them so.
ICI has withdrawn from a joint venture to provide paints for European car
makers, leaving Du Pont, its US partner, to go it alone with an Aquabase
licence. Du Pont already has a network of customers in the US on which to
base a marketing strategy.
ICI quit after a four-year programme to adapt Aquabase - which uses water
instead of organic solvents - for the vehicle repair market. It already has
a customer network of thousands of vehicle repair shops worldwide and thinks
it will do better. The move marks the latest stage of a 12-year
reorganisation of world industrial paint markets.
Industrial paints are high technology products, and big business. Modern
anti-corrosion guarantees rely on a vehicle's paint, and paint used during
manufacture in Europe alone is worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 969m) a
year. Vehicle repair worldwide generates annual sales of about Pounds 2bn.
As manufacturers of vehicles, televisions sets, video recorders, and
consumer durables 'went global' in the 1980s, their suppliers - paintmakers
included - were forced to follow suit. The result was a rash of mergers and
acquisitions as giants such as ICI and Courtaulds of the UK, PPG and Du Pont
of the US, BASF and Herberts of Germany and Akzo of the Netherlands, bought
their way into national paint markets around the world.
A vigorous shakeout is now under way. Research and development has to be
continuous and is expensive; each company is concentrating on markets where
it has the best prospects, shedding businesses which cannot justify their
consumption of working capital.
Even the acquisitive Netherlands chemical company Akzo - which last year
bought Sweden's Casco Nobel, which in turn had swallowed Beckers to dominate
Scandinavian markets - is trying to sell its European manufacturing
automotive coatings business to PPG, the world market leader.
Mr Austin O'Malley, who heads PPG's European paints operations, said
yesterday the deal was now only waiting for the approval of the Netherlands
and Belgian governments. Go-ahead will trigger big PPG investment in Akzo's
former plant and laboratories.
Courtaulds, best known for the International Paint brand of marine coatings,
has turned itself into a transportation sector specialist. It bought ICI's
aircraft painting business in 1992. It is also a leader in powder coatings -
which use no solvents, so are the most environmentally friendly of all.
ICI decided to go for powder markets, too. In 1992 it tried to merge its
powder business with Ferro, the US leader, but withdrew after doubts over
management structure and capital needs. It then sold the business to Ferro.
The lesson - that technology alone does not make a market - is shown in an
ICI success story. Glidden developed an environmentally friendly, inert,
tasteless, water-based lacquer for spraying the insides of aluminium drinks
cans, which separates the contents from the metal of the can and ensures
that the drink tastes the same worldwide.
Thanks to Glidden's long standing as a supplier to the canning industry, and
ICI's similar position in the rest of the world, ICI now has 44 per cent of
the US market and 32 per cent in Europe.

Hongkong Land Holdings, Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm,
has raised USDollars 360m through a convertible bond issue to fund general
corporate requirements, including commitments from Trafalgar House and
development of the colony's Container Terminal 9.
The seven-year bond will carry a coupon of 4 per cent and a conversion price
of HKDollars 31.05 - a 15 per cent premium over the current market price.
The bond was initially planned to raise USDollars 300m, but this was lifted
to USDollars 360m. Approval is being sought to list the convertible bonds on
the London or Luxembourg stock exchange.
Mr Ian Durant, finance director of the company, said the issue was in line
with Hongkong Land's aim of diversifying sources of funding.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: PosGold adds to Aztec bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon mining and
minerals empire, yesterday submitted expanded offer documents for Aztec
Mining Company to the Australian Securities Commission in an effort to
acquire the medium-sized mining house for ADollars 261m (USDollars 180m).
PosGold's move came after the federal court in Sydney declared invalid the
bidder's previous 'Part A' statement, one of the formal bid documents
required in Australian takeovers.
Aztec's directors, who oppose the bid, claimed that PosGold should divulge
more information in specific areas; these ranged from PosGold's sources of
finance to Normandy Poseidon's relationship with the South African
Anglo-American group and the bidder's plans for Aztec's base metal
interests.
PosGold said yesterday that it had decided to lodge the expanded document in
an effort to expedite the bid, although it added: 'PosGold remains of the
belief that none of the matters raised by Aztec . . . were sufficient to
affect the validity of its 'Part A' statement'. It said that additional
information had been provided in various areas requested by Aztec, including
funding arrangements and the Anglo-American relationship.
Aztec directors will now have approximately two weeks to consider the new
document before it is sent out to shareholders. They would be free to raise
fresh legal objections if they felt the information was still deficient.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft puts pressure
on its creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group,
yesterday strengthened pressure on its 120 bank creditors, saying if they
did not accept the entire proposed DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing
package the group would declare itself insolvent.
The threat was an attempt to crush last-minute resistance to the package.
Norddeutsche Landesbank, a large German public-sector bank owed DM239.4m,
denounced the bail-out plan this week.
Metallgesellschaft's ultimatum was sent to bank creditors and made public
yesterday. Deutsche Bank, which is chairing the bankers' co-ordinating
committee, said the outcome would not be clear until late today or Friday.
Reflecting uncertainty about the group's fate, its shares dropped DM10 to
close last night at DM226.
Metallgesellschaft argued on legal and business grounds it would be obliged
to declare itself insolvent if banks did not accept the DM3.4bn package. The
package envisages a DM1.4bn rights issue, coupled with the conversion of
DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock and the provision of
DM700m of new credits.
Despite the continuing opposition of NordLB yesterday, other leading banks
said they would support the proposals. Bayerische Landesbank, another public
sector bank owed DM381m - compared with the DM240m owed to NordLB - said it
would back the bail-out package, as did Barclays Bank, the UK clearer owed
DM154.5m. Barclays however expressed reservations, saying there were areas
of the agreement which 'required future work'.
Although many other banks share the concern about the debt-equity
conversion, as well as worries about the way in which the deal has been
presented on a 'take it or leave it' basis, they have voted in favour of the
package in the knowledge that their financial exposure to the group would be
greater if it were declared insolvent.
NordLB argues the group's capital should be reduced before banks are obliged
to exchange debt into equity. Metallgesellschaft said this was impossible as
it would deny the group access to international capital markets.

   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
record fourth quarter profits of Dollars 493.6m.
It predicted that the US housing market would continue its strong recovery
during 1994 thanks to a healthy economy, low interest rates and low
inflation.
In the same quarter a year ago, Fannie Mae earned Dollars 426.4m.
It was the 24th consecutive quarter of record earnings for the company,
which is the largest source of home mortgage funds in the US. Full-year 1993
profits reached Dollars 1.87bn, up from Dollars 1.62bn the year before.
The company's fourth quarter results were affected by Dollars 38.8m in
after-tax losses incurred because of the call of debt at a premium and the
repurchase of high coupon debt. The latest figures, however, also included
Dollars 28.3m in pre-payment fees from a special multi-family loan
refinancing programme, and a Dollars 15m contribution to the Fannie Mae
Foundation.
Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae chairman and chief executive, hailed 1993 as an
'outstanding' year. He said the company was able to service a record 3.3m
families through mortgage purchases and security guarantees.
Net income rose sharply during the year because of three main factors: a 22
per cent increase in Fannie Mae's net mortgage portfolio to Dollars 190bn; a
45 per cent increase in REMIC (real estate mortgage investment conduits)
fees to Dollars 125.5m; and an 11 per cent increase in the balance of
outstanding mortgage-backed securities to Dollars 496bn.
Also during 1993, the number of foreclosed properties acquired by the
company rose 20 per cent to 11,557, but the single-family delinquency rate,
a key indicator of credit quality, declined over the year.
The quarterly and annual results initially triggered selling of Fannie Mae
shares before investors reacted more positively and the price rose Dollars 1
1/4 to close at Dollars 85 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Student Loan Marketing Association said its student loan purchases rose
to Dollars 6.7bn in 1993, up Dollars 1bn from 1992, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'That enabled us to hold our share of what was a rapidly growing market in
1993 despite low interest rates and a slow economy that made it more
attractive for originating lenders to retain their loan production,' said Mr
Lawrence Hough, Sallie Mae president and chief executive.

Dayton Hudson, the Minneapolis-based department store operator which has

low-margin goods, sent a signal of confidence about its long-term earnings
prospects by raising its dividend, Reuter reports from Chicago.
The 5 per cent increase in the quarterly dividend to 42 cents a share comes
amid a push by the retailer to turn around its suffering Mervyn's division,
analysts said.
California-based Mervyn's has been hard hit by the state's slow economic

Tandy, the US electronics retailer, is to open 30 new stores this year,
creating more than 3,600 jobs in the US. The company forecast increased
growth and profitability for the year.
Last year, Tandy divested its manufacturing operations to focus on
retailing. The company is the largest electronics retailer in the US with
around 6,900 stores and dealer franchise outlets.
'Driven by new store openings and innovative services ideas, 1994 should
provide excellent sales growth for Tandy,' said Mr John Roach, chairman and
chief executive.
Tandy's expansion plans reflect strong sales of personal computers and
related products.
The new stores to be opened this year include 24 new Computer City
SuperCenters, which will employ approximately 1,600 people.
In addition, Tandy will open six new Incredible Universe consumer
electronics superstores, creating about 1,800 jobs. The company added that
it would add about 200 employees to its infrastructure and financial
departments.
Tandy recently reported an 18 per cent increase in sales at its US retail
operations to Dollars 687m for the month of December 1993, compared with
Dollars 581.4m in the same month a year earlier.

Hilton Hotels could record a net income increase of more than 20 per cent in

reserve, said Mr Raymond Avansino, president and chief operating officer,
AP-DJ reports from Beverly Hills.
The US hotel and casino company expects to report quarterly net income of 64
to 70 cents a share, or about Dollars 30m to Dollars 33m, compared with 55
cents a share, or Dollars 26.5m, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is
expected to rise to between Dollars 356m and Dollars 366m, against Dollars
336m a year ago. The reserve, about 16 cents a share after tax, stems from a
loan made to a hotel managed by Hilton.

property link
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, has formed an
alliance with Remsen Partners, the property financing group, that will
provide funds for the US commercial property market, writes Patrick
Harverson.
Under the terms of the deal, Remsen will arrange mortgages on commercial
property funded by Smith Barney which the brokerage firm will eventually
sell as mortgage-backed securities. to investors.
The two partners said that they had already put together more than Dollars
100m in mortgage loans, and they expected the venture to generate as much as
Dollars 1bn in financing before the end of the year. For Smith Barney, owned
by Travelers, the insurance and financial services group, the aim of the
alliance is to boost its presence in the huge large US mortgage-backed
securities market by linking up with Remsen's network of property owners and
mortgage bankers.
Last year, Smith Barney was only ranked 15th among underwriters of mortgage
deals in the US, even though the firm is was the second largest brokerage
house in the US.
The appeal of the alliance to Remsen is the speedy fast access the private
partnership it will get to Smith Barney's capital and the ability to win
business on the back of the brokerage firm's name.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw shifts focus to core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste services and passenger transport operator,
is pursuing a new relationship with ADT, the security and vehicle auction
group, and Attwoods, the UK-based waste services operator. The move is part
of a strategy to focus on its core North American businesses.
Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder in both companies, with 24 per
cent of ADT and 35 per cent of Attwoods.
However, Mr Jim Bullock, who took over as chief executive last October, said
yesterday that there was 'no merit in Laidlaw being a minority shareholder
in companies in which it has little or no input into the day-to-day
management and operation'.
Laidlaw has the option of disposing of its ADT stake in five years by
tendering the shares to redeem a series of convertible debentures issued
last month. Mr Bullock's remarks suggest that it will seek a buyer for the
ADT stake before then.
Laidlaw will no longer include its share of ADT earnings in its income
statement. The Bermuda-based company contributed Dollars 5.7m, or 2 cents a
share, to Laidlaw's earnings for the three months to November 30.
Net first-quarter earnings slipped to USDollars 38m, or 14 cents a share,
from Dollars 48.9m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose by 6.5 per
cent to Dollars 546.2m.
The 22 per cent drop in earnings came despite a 6.5 per cent rise in
revenues to Dollars 546.2m. The setback was blamed on a combination of
problems in its hazardous waste business, lower income from equity
investments and higher interest costs.
Operating income from solid waste and passenger services was little changed.
But hazardous waste income tumbled to Dollars 11.4m from Dollars 19.3m, and
margins from this segment narrowed to 8.8 per cent from 16.1 per cent.
The drop was due mainly to disruptions at the flagship Pinewood landfill
site in South Carolina, and a decline in Canadian business. Pinewood is
expected to return to prior levels of profitability later this year.

International Paper, the diversified US paper, packaging and wood products
company, reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents a
share, up 15 per cent from Dollars 87m, or 71 cents, before extraordinary
charges in the fourth quarter a year ago, writes Laurie Morse.
The earnings advance came on strong performances by the company's forest
products and specialty products businesses. However, sales for the quarter
were flat, at Dollars 3.4bn.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said the results continued to be deflated by weak
worldwide price levels in most paper and packaging products.
Excluding special items, International Paper had earnings of Dollars 314m,
or Dollars 2.54 a share, for the full fiscal year 1993, down from Dollars
405m, or Dollars 3.34, in 1992.
The company recorded sales of Dollars 13.7bn in 1993, little changed from
1992.

Asarco, the New York-based integrated copper producer, has sold its
remaining 45.3 per cent interest in Asarco Australia, for Dollars 79.5m,
writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
After taxes, the company expects to realise Dollars 31.9m from the sale.
The company sold a 9.9 per cent interest in the Australian venture in the
third quarter for an after-tax gain of Dollars 5.4m.
Asarco Australia operates the Wiluna and Jundee gold mines in Western
Australia, which in 1992 produced 110,000 troy ounces of gold.
Asarco intends to use the proceeds of the latest sale to reduce corporate
debt.
It has recorded losses in recent quarters, pressed by the costs related to
US copper mine and processing expansions and by depressed prices for copper
and other minerals.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: IBM heads list for US patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines ranked first in the number of US patents
awarded in 1993, the first time since 1985 that an American company has
headed the list.
It received 1,088 patents last year, followed by Toshiba, Canon and Eastman
Kodak, according to IFI/Plenum Data, a market information service.
In 1992, IBM received 842 patents and the top four companies in the US
patent stakes were all Japanese.
IBM began a concerted effort to increase the number of patents it receives
in the early 1990s. These efforts are now beginning to bear fruits, the
company said.
'This ranking demonstrates IBM's continued leadership and dedication to
innovation and leading-edge technologies,' said Mr Marshall Phelps, IBM
vice-president, intellectual property and licensing services.
The IBM patents were almost exclusively in the field of information
processing, with an increase in software-related inventions.
Examples include several multi-media patents as well as patents for a
folding computer keyboard, new types of data storage systems and an
environmentally safe solvent.
'IBM continues to believe that it has the world's strongest portfolio of
patents in the information processing field,' Mr Phelps said.
IBM said IBM PC has formed a new unit to increase its commitment to the US
federal marketplace.
It said IBM PC Co Federal Channel will focus exclusively on federal products
and requirements to meet the specialised needs of federal customers.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcatel profits warning drives
share price down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Alcatel-Alsthom plunged more than 12 per cent yesterday after the
French-based engineering, transport and telecommunications group warned of
lower sales and net profits this year. The shares lost FFr110 to close at
FFr792.
The group said that barring an upturn in market conditions, net profits
would be between 10 and 20 per cent lower than last year, which it said
would be about the same as the FFr7.05bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in 1992. Sales this
year are expected to fall by a smaller proportion than profits.
Most industry analysts had expected a rise of about 5 per cent in net
profits this year. The sharp fall in the share price was also attributed to
the fact that Alcatel-Alsthom previously resisted the effects of European
recession, having increased profits every year since 1986. 'It caught
investors rather off guard,' said one electronics analyst in Paris.
In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Pierre Suard,
chairman, blamed the expected decline in profits on a deterioration in some
of the group's principal telecommunications markets. He cited Germany, Italy
and Spain as countries where conditions were particularly difficult. He said
the economic situation in Europe had been exacerbated by a 'unilateral
opening of the market', and the failure of other developed economies to
adopt similar measures.
'The ongoing problems in mature markets mean that 1994 will be a difficult
year,' said Mr Andrew Haskins, electronics industry analyst at James Capel
in London. He said Alcatel-Alsthom remained in a strong position to benefit
from the introduction of new technologies.
Mr Suard emphasised the strengths of the group and prospects for expansion.
He said Alcatel had made progress in diversifying its markets, and that the
combined European subsidiaries of the group had increased their exports by
30 per cent last year, and should raise them again by about 20 per cent this
year.
The international telecommunications industry, he said, showed strong growth
potential in areas such as broad-band transmission, mobile communications,
and interactive television. Mr Suard said Alcatel planned to compete for a
third radio-telephone licence to be awarded by the French government.
The Alcatel chairman also expressed confidence in the conclusion of a
Dollars 2bn high-speed railway contract with South Korea. GEC-Alsthom, the
Anglo-French joint venture, has been competing fiercely with a German
consortium for the contract.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney's week of reckoning
 -Rescue negotiations are at a delicate stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If all goes well, a team of auditors at KPMG Peat Marwick in Paris should
this week put the finishing touches to a preliminary report on the financial
condition of Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group struggling to avert
bankruptcy.
The report will be distributed to the 60 international banks that own Euro
Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.43bn) net debt. The banks are expected to
spend next week scrutinising the report in the hope of later this month
starting full-scale negotiations over a rescue package with Euro Disney and
Walt Disney, its US parent company.
The critical question as the two sides prepare for the final stage of
negotiations is whether they will be able to agree a deal to rescue Euro
Disney and to save the EuroDisneyland theme park from closure.
Euro Disney's position is clear. Bruised by recession and crippled by debt,
it made a net loss of FFr5.3bn in the year to September 30. It has
repeatedly warned that it risks running out of cash. When that happens, the
US group has promised to keep EuroDisneyland going - but only until March
31.
If the banks have not agreed a deal by then, Disney will pull the plug. Euro
Disney would be wound up, leaving the banks to write off their loans.
Disney, advised by Lazard Freres in New York, has already suggested a
solution. It asked the banks at a November meeting in Paris to accept
proposals to halve Euro Disney's debt through a FFr5bn rights issue and a
debt-for-equity swap. It has also asked Caisse de Depots, the state
financial institution that holds Euro Disney's FFr4.8bn fixed interest rate
debt, to reduce the rate payable from the present 7.8 per cent.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London,
calculates that such a package would 'reduce Euro Disney's losses in the
1994 and 1995 financial years' and enable it to produce 'a very small
profit' in 1996.
Walt Disney is doubtless gambling that it has enough leverage over the banks
to persuade them to agree. The French government, which would be loathe to
lose over 10,000 jobs at EuroDisneyland at a time of rising unemployment,
could use its influence to persuade the Caisse des Depots and other French
creditors - including Banque Nationale de Paris, Indosuez and Credit
Agricole - to accept.
Disney could try to influence US creditors such as J. P. Morgan and
Citibank. It has considerable clout in US banking circles, thanks to its
policy of holding 'beauty contests' for its deals rather than retaining a
house bank. If the French and US creditors said 'yes', Disney could be
reasonably hopeful that the remaining Japanese, German and UK banks (which
hold a smaller chunk of the total debt) would fall into line.
The hitch is that the banks are anxious to minimise their exposure by
ensuring that Disney is involved with the rescue. 'Disney got us into this
mess and, frankly, it's going to have to bear its fair share of the pain,'
said one banker involved with the negotiations.
Disney would, of course, be expected to participate fully in the rights
issue. This would represent an investment of roughly FFr2.45bn for its 49
per cent stake. However, it would be reluctant to raise its equity stake
further because, under US regulations, it would then have to consolidate
Euro Disney's debt on to its own balance sheet.
However, Disney might be persuaded to buy assets, such as its hotels, from
Euro Disney, or to use its influence to attract new equity investors. New
York analysts report strong demand for Euro Disney's debt on the second-hand
market. A FFr130m parcel of debt is believed to have been sold earlier this
month in London for 60 per cent of its original value. This suggests that
there is interest in Euro Disney as a distressed investment.
However, the banks are determined to force Disney to make concessions by
reducing its royalty fee on Euro Disney's revenue worth FFr262m last year.
'It's the least Disney can do, particularly as it expects us to take
equity,' said one. 'The structure of those fees will make a tremendous
difference to Euro Disney's financial performance.'
The banks may also try to protect their investment by insisting on changes
in the management of EuroDisneyland. They have asked KPMG to review the
running of the park, as well as its finances, to see if Disney's present
strategy is the right one.
So far, Disney's conduct of the negotiations has been anything but
conciliatory. One banker present at the November meeting described the
Disney team as 'arrogant and overbearing'. 'Disney is used to success,' said
another. 'It hasn't had any experience of a mess like this. And it shows.'
Recent warnings from Disney that it will close EuroDisneyland if the talks
fail appear to have aggravated the situation. 'We've gone into this hoping
that if we work like crazy over the next few months we can save Euro
Disney,' said one creditor. 'We can do without these threats. Disney's
aggressive attitude may be a negotiating ploy, but I'm not sure that it's a
good one.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Framatome state sale under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday said that
the government had launched the process of privatising Framatome, the
nuclear power station group.
Framatome, which also has activities in computer services and electronic
components, is not on the list of 21-publicly owned groups which the
centre-right government has slated for privatisation. It will be sold
through a limited tender offer.
Officials at the French economy ministry said the government has instructed
the privatisation commission, an independent agency which advises it on the
sale of public sector companies, to value its 51 per cent stake in
Framatome.
The likely candidates to take a controlling stake in the group include
Alcatel-Alsthom, the engineering, transport and communications group, which
currently holds 44 per cent of the shares in Framatome.
Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman of Alcatel-Alsthom, has made no secret of his
desire to take control of Framatome. He believes the two groups would
complement each other, with Framatome's strength in the construction of
nuclear power stations combining with Alcatel-Alsthom's presence in
conventional power generation.
In 1990, Alcatel-Alsthom briefly managed to acquire a majority stake in
Framatome, raising its investment from 40 per cent to 52 per cent. But the
socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced Alcatel to reduce its
shareholding.
Framatome was formed in 1958 to design and build light pressurised water
reactors and nuclear components. It has since diversified and has expanded
sales to more than FFr12bn a year. In 1992, the latest year for which
figures are available, it reported net profits of FFr900m.
In addition to the privatisation of Framatome, Mr Longuet said plans were
being advanced to establish an alliance between Pechiney, the aluminium
group, and Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydro-electricity generator.
The alliance is aimed at providing Pechiney with a relatively cheap source
of energy and a counter-balance to the highly cyclical aluminium industry to
render the group more attractive in its forthcoming privatisation.
Mr Longuet also confirmed the government's plans to privatise Renault, the
state-owned motor vehicle group, later this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Popular, the Spanish bank more than 50 per cent-owned by non-Spanish
institutional investors, yesterday reported net profits of Pta58bn (Dollars
401.5m) last year, a rise of 7.3 per cent on 1992.
The results pleased analysts, who noted that Popular, which has high
liquidity and is an important lender to small and medium-sized businesses,
was particularly exposed last year to Spain's sharply falling interbank rate
and to the enduring recession.
The profits, however, continued the downward trend set last year when
Popular posted a net income rise of 9.6 per cent against an increase of 15
per cent in 1991.
The tightened margins, as interbank rates fell from 15 per cent to 9 per
cent last year, were partly responsible for pushing Popular's return on
equity down from 27.77 in 1992 to 25.55 in 1993. Strict credit control by
the bank, together with poor domestic demand held growth in loans and
discounts at the year end to just 1.5 per cent.
Popular's non-performing loans were up 36 per cent to Pta55bn, against a
rise of 28 per cent in 1992. They represented 2.9 per cent of total lending,
a proportion which is well under half what is estimated for the domestic
banking sector as a whole.
Coverage of non-performing loans stood at 103.8 per cent over the mandatory
requirements set by the Bank of Spain, against 110.1 per cent in 1992.
Popular will pay a dividend of Pta790 per share, up from Pta730 in 1992.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Champagne lifts Remy Cointreau
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, yesterday invigorated the
international drinks industry with a 24 per cent increase in net profits for
the six months to September 30 to FFr129m (Dollars 21.8m) from FFr103.8m.
Despite slower growth in the third quarter - due mainly to tax changes in
China - turnover for the nine months to December was up 6.2 per cent to
FFr4.67bn, led by a 9.1 per cent rise in champagne sales.
Mr Marc Heriard Dubreuil, joint managing director, said: 'We are optimistic
that full-year results will show an improvement on the previous year. The
last quarter generally benefits from the impact of sales in south-east Asian
markets, particularly over the Chinese new year.'
First-half operating profits rose to FFr357.7m from FFr327.7m on sales 12
per cent ahead at FFr2.68bn.
Growth was achieved in all sectors of the business. Sales of champagne -
Piper Heidseck, Charles Heidseck and Krug - for the first nine months
totalled FFr556.7m, against FFr510.3m, with a 30 per cent increase in
exports to the UK leading a worldwide recovery.
Prices were maintained and margins would improve as the effects of cheaper
grapes worked through over the next few years, said Mr Dubreuil.
Cognac sales to end-December rose 5 per cent to FFr1.93bn, despite a
temporary lull in shipments to China after tax changes in December.
With growth in most leading markets, Remy has increased its market share to
19 per cent and overtaken Martell as number two in the cognac sector.
Liqueurs and spirits turnover increased by 5.4 per cent to FFr1.3bn. Sales
of Cointreau rose after a 10-year decline.
The alliance with Highland Distilleries, the Scotch whisky group, continued
to prosper. Overall, whisky sales were 24 per cent ahead and Remy now
handles more than half of Famous Grouse exports.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lisbon investigates Banesto link
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, said yesterday that
Lisbon authorities were investigating the possibility that Banesto, the
troubled Spanish bank, may have acted illegally in acquiring its holding in
Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's leading private bank.
Banesto's former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, implicitly recognised that the
Spanish bank might have contravened a Portuguese law limiting foreign
ownership of BTA to 25 per cent, when he said on Tuesday that Banesto
controlled about 50 per cent of the Portuguese institution. He said about
half the equity was held directly and the remainder indirectly.
Mr Cavaco Silva said Banesto would be required to reduce its shareholding in
BTA if the authorities found that Banesto had infringed Portugal's
investment regulations. Mr Conde was ousted from Banesto's board when the
Bank of Spain intervened on December 28.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lex to import Komatsu trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing group, has become
the sole importer of Komatsu lift trucks into England and Wales after paying
a total of Pounds 6.5m to acquire the lift truck distribution business of
Handling Analysis.
Lex has paid Pounds 5.9m out of its own cash resources for the distribution
business and importership, and a further Pounds 600,000 for an associated
transaction involving Handling Analysis' 60-strong fleet of contract hire
lift trucks and service facilities.
The net assets being acquired were Pounds 3.5m after a pre-sale dividend of
Pounds 2m.
Handling Analysis, a subsidiary of Northampton-based AJ Mackaness, imports
and distributes lift trucks through a network of 12 independent dealers.
In the year to October it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 900,000 on
turnover of Pounds 13m.
The company's biggest customer, representing about 40 per cent of UK sales,
is Harvey Plant which is managed by Lex and jointly owned by Lex and Lombard
North Central.
Harvey has 7,500 lift trucks on long term contract hire and is the largest
company in the sector in the UK with 19 depots around the country.
Harvey buys about 1,000 lift trucks a year of which about 40 per cent are
Komatsu. The Japanese-based group is the third-largest lift truck
manufacturer in the world having risen from sixth place in 1990.
Last year Komatsu's share of the UK market was about 8 per cent. The UK is
Komatsu's most important European market. In order to offset the rising yen
the Japanese group has shifted production to Europe in recent years.
Lex said yesterday that despite the close links between Handling Analysis
and Harvey Plant, the two companies will continue to be managed
independently with Lex emphasising the development of Handling Analysis'
dealer network.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sale of cash and carry side boosts M&amp;W
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;W, the Southampton-based convenience store company, reported pre-tax
profits ahead by 37 per cent at Pounds 2.77m for the 53 weeks to October 31,
against Pounds 2.03m.
The result was boosted by exceptional income of Pounds 465,000, mainly
resulting from the sale of its cash and carry activities in July, compared
with Pounds 35,000 last time.
Turnover was Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 72.5m) of which Pounds 8.09m (Pounds
10.4m) related to discontinued activities. Continuing activities showed an
increase of 15 per cent.
During the period 14 stores were opened or acquired and one sold taking the
total to 111.
Sales on a like-for-like basis rose 4.7 per cent.
Earnings per share came out at 12.52p (8.17p) and the proposed final
dividend is 1.9p for a total of 3p (2.5p).

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sharp recovery at J Saville Gordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Saville Gordon, the property investment group with merchanting interests,
is doubling its interim dividend on the back of a sharp recovery in first
half profits, writes Paul Cheeseright.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 were Pounds 2.62m, more
than twice last time's Pounds 1.26m.
Earnings per share climbed from 0.85p to 1.74p; the interim dividend is
raised to 1p but the company told shareholders 'this should not infer a
similar increase in the final dividend.' The total for 1992-93 was 2.2p.
Total turnover was Pounds 17.6m against Pounds 13.8m, after sales of Pounds
12m (Pounds 10.4m) from the pipeline equipment and stockholding subsidiary.
Underlying the improved performance were three factors. First, there was a
rise in property rental income, largely because of rent reviews; this should
continue in the second half. Second, rising prices in the property
investment market encouraged the group to make sales of properties unwanted
in its portfolio; there had been no property trading income in the
comparable half.
The third factor was the effect of lower interest rates. Interest payable
fell from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.53m. Helped by property sales, gearing
fell from 78 per cent to 65 per cent over the period, but is expected to
rise again in the second half if two planned acquisitions are completed.
'Our property portfolio continues to perform well,' said Mr John Saville,
chairman. The group calculates that the value of its holdings, all of which
are outside central London, has probably increased by about 20 per cent
since the last financial year as investment yields have narrowed.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Business falls to Pounds 12.2m -
Pounds 3m provision for renegotiating leasing contracts with customers hits
outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Business Group, the photocopier and vending machines supplier,
blamed a Pounds 3m provision for renegotiating leasing contracts with its
customers for a 21 per cent fall in annual profits.
In the year to September 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds
12.2m on flat turnover of Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 57.3m).
The provision followed the decision last year to make fundamental changes in
the way leasing arrangements were marketed and administered.
Such arrangements are being examined by the Office of Fair Trading, which is
expected to publish a report next month on the tactics of photocopier
companies.
Shortly before the OFT began its inquiry last year a number of Southern's
employees resigned or were sacked after the company admitted improprieties
in dealings with some clients. Since then contracts have been overhauled to
'ensure continued goodwill' with customers.
Mr David McErlain, chairman and chief executive, said: 'During 1993 the
emphasis has been on retraining our sales staff. They now operate under a
strict code of conduct.'
The group has renegotiated some 2,000 contracts, about 20 per cent of the
total, and said it would renegotiate other deals in the next 12 months. The
company said that future provisions would not exceed Pounds 200,000.
Seven former customers, however, are involved in legal action against the
group. They are seeking damages for alleged breach of contract and
misrepresentation, but the total claims are thought to be less than Pounds
100,000.
The company is also engaged in legal action against five former salesmen for
alleged breach of agency agreements and breach of confidence.
Mr McErlain said the action had not hampered an improvement in the company's
current trading but warned that 1994 would be another tough year for
suppliers.
'We've changed our ways. Now we can now grow by taking business from
rivals,' he added.
Although earnings per share fell to 8.44p (10.62p), the company said it was
strong enough to propose an increase in its final dividend to 2.45p making a
total of 3.72p (3.38p), a rise of 10 per cent.
COMMENT
Photocopier leasing companies are still suffering from their reputation for
extracting onerous contracts from unwitting customers, and Southern is no
exception. Although it has spent Pounds 3m to put its house in order,
continuing legal action has not enhanced the company's standing. It has,
however, made contract changes beyond the anticipated scope of the OFT
inquiry and now offers some of the most flexible deals around.
Unfortunately, hopes that the changes would make it the dominant company in
the leasing market have been undermined by the arrival of two large US
rivals, Alco Standard and Danka. Intensifying competition is expected to
keep profits at about Pounds 13m, which puts the shares on a prospective
multiple of 9.4. Against those flat prospects, the shares, down 2p yesterday
at 82p, are not expected to show a sharp improvement in the year ahead.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Geared shows 25% jump in net assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fleming Geared Income and Assets Investment Trust raised net asset value per
share by 25 per cent to 291.6p at the end of November, against 233.7p a year
earlier.
Net revenue for the six months to November 30 slipped from Pounds 1m to
Pounds 944,000, giving earnings per share of 6.12p (6.66p). The interim
dividend is 0.75p (2.97p) and there is a special 2p arising from larger than
expected non-recurring accrued income received on redemption in specie of
two unit trusts.
At the last year end, the trust's sole investments were three unit trusts.
Since then two of these have been redeemed in specie and the third redeemed
for cash.
The company is now invested in UK company shares.
The directors said they still considered that their forecast current year
dividend of 2p, excluding the special, to be the base level from which
dividends should be able to grow in subsequent years.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance breaks lower 10-year trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Alliance has improved pay-outs for with-profits endowment policies over
both 10 and 25 year terms, making it the first insurer to raise its 10-year
pay-out so far this year.
The company said the upturn in the UK equity market during 1993 allowed it
to improve maturity values by increasing terminal bonuses, but it has cut
reversionary bonuses, which are added to each policy annually and reflect
the company's view of likely future investment returns.
The pay-out on a typical 25-year policy, taken out by a 29 year old man
paying Pounds 30 a month is Pounds 52,640, up 5.2 per cent from last year.
The 10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,115, up 1.8 per cent. However, Sun
Alliance's maturity values are still at the lower end of the scale: the
comparative figures for General Accident are Pounds 65,604 and Pounds 6,567,
and for Norwich Union Pounds 58,694 and Pounds 6,674.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant rises after realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Goode Durrant rose by 10p to 151p yesterday after the industrial
holding company said improvements resulting from the realignment of
activities were beginning to show through.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 4.29m in the six months to
October 31 including a Pounds 400,000 exceptional credit from the sale of
the Laidlaw motor distribution subsidiary to Quicks last June. Sales fell
from Pounds 90.6m to Pounds 58.1m mainly due to the sale.
Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said that Northgate, the core commercial
vehicle hire business, had doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m. Utilisation
rates had increased marginally to 92 per cent, and rates had firmed as
customers, who were overwhelmingly business users, increased their activity
levels.
Northgate had successfully integrated two small acquisitions announced in
October, Trukvan Rental and Bowey Hire. It was a priority to extend the
network nationally, both organically and by acquisition.
The equipment hire division made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 279,000,
compared with a loss of Pounds 174,000 previously, and the Ravenstock
business had returned to profit.
Rawlings, the housebuilding and construction business which has been
earmarked for disposal, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 134,00, compared with
a Pounds 179,000 loss.
Earnings per share to rose 5.8p (2.3p). Stripping out the exceptional,
earnings rose to 5p. The interim dividend is increased to 2.2p (2.15p).

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Volatile trading hits Bromsgrove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim profits at Bromsgrove Industries sagged as its operating divisions
contended with volatile trading and continuing pressure on margins.
The Birmingham-based specialist engineer announced pre-tax profits for the
half year to September 30 of Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 4m); turnover expanded to
Pounds 57.5m (Pounds 53.7m).
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 3.67m to turnover and Pounds 672,000 to the
pre-tax line.
If non-recurring costs, amounting to Pounds 1.1m against Pounds 400,000 last
time, are stripped out the disparity is less marked. Profits would have been
Pounds 4.2m against Pounds 4.4m.
At the trading level, the aerospace and medical and industrial divisions
performed strongly while automotive and plastics were steady, but the marine
and offshore and environmental divisions faced reduced demand.
Overall operating margins fell from 10.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent.
Gearing since the end of the first half has fallen from 69.8 per cent to 57
per cent and can be expected to fall further as Bromsgrove sells companies
it now sees as peripheral to a plan for greater concentration of its
interests. The group is seeking to create larger profit centres from a
series of small but specialist engineering companies.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.65p, payable from fully diluted
earnings of 3.18p (4.07p) per share.

First Leisure, the discotheques, bowling and tourist attractions group, is
entering the health and fitness market with the acquisition of a 75 per cent
stake in the Royal County of Berkshire Racquets and Health Club.
Directors Lord Rayne, chairman (above left), Mr John Conlan, chief executive

the group intended to build further health clubs over the next few years.
Mr Conlan said he regarded health and fitness as a growing leisure market.

further payment of Pounds 1.9m due after completion of the audit of the club
accounts for the year ending October 31 1994. The deferred payment is
dependent on the club achieving growth of Pounds 300,000 in operating
profit.
The club earned pre-tax profit of Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.4m
in the year ended October 31 1993. It has net bank borrowings of Pounds 3.9m
and membership debentures totalling Pounds 1.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, plans to recapture lost market share on
its transatlantic services with the announcement yesterday of plans to
replace its two ageing Boeing 747s, now in service for 25 years, with three
leased Airbus A330s.
New transatlantic fare structures are also to be introduced, alongside a new
daily direct service to the US from both Dublin and Shannon.
Mr Bernie Cahill, the chairman who has overseen a complex restructuring plan
which was finalised last month, said: 'The acquisition of this new
transatlantic fleet and the unveiling of the new plans for the Aer Lingus
operation marks the turning point in what has been a difficult and testing
time for the airline'.
The restructuring plan involved cutting IPounds 50m (Pounds 48m) in annual
operating costs through 800 voluntary redundancies and changes in work
practices, in return for which the government is to provide a total of
IPounds 175m in new equity over the next two years.
Aer Lingus said it will increase its promotional spend in the US market by
75 per cent this year, and is to offer fare reductions of between 10 and 20
per cent into Ireland from the US.
The company 'is aiming for a general growth in leisure traffic as a result
of the competitive fares which will arise from a lower cost base . . . a key
objective of the new Aer Lingus schedule is to reverse the trend of US
traffic to Ireland via London, Manchester and other UK points'.
In 1992-93 the airline's transatlantic services incurred an operating loss
of IPounds 13m. A total of 4.3m passengers were carried with a load factor
of 71 per cent.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hornby link with US toymaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hornby Group yesterday announced that it had taken a 10 per cent stake in
the privately-owned Original San Francisco Toymakers. The deal gives the UK
company, best known for its model train sets, exclusive UK distribution
rights for the small US toy company's product range.
The range includes action figures, talking story books and talking story
'pals' - stuffed toys which narrate literature.
Mr Saul Jodel, president of Toymakers, said the deal solidified a
long-standing relationship with Hornby, which he described as a quality
company: 'It gives them the motivation to do a good job with our line
because they have a piece of our company.'
Mr Jodel founded the company two years ago with Mr David Galoob, chief
executive officer. Both had previously been executives with Lewis Galoob
Toys, another San Francisco toy company which is quoted on the NYSE.
Mr Galoob resigned abrubptly as chief executive officer at Lewis Galoob in
June 1991 after the company was sued by Nintendo of America, the video games
company, for alleged copyright violation. The case was subsequently settled
in Lewis Galoob's favour.
Mr Jodel said yesterday the parting between the man and the company founded
by his family had been a 'mutual decision.'
Toymakers reported 'minor losses' on sales of Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) in 1993
and is forecasting that it will treble or quadruple in size this year.
Mr Jodel declined to disclose the consideration for the deal. No one at
Hornby was available to comment.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Property Trust drops to Pounds 0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Property Trust declined from Pounds 426,000 to Pounds 102,000
pre-tax in the six months to September 30, though last year's figure was
boosted by Pounds 900,000 from the sale of development properties.
The company said these sales had the effect of reducing rents receivable in
the period under review, which declined from Pounds 747,000 to Pounds
713,000.
It added that there had been no sales in the first half and it was unlikely
that there would be any in the second.
Rather, the company stressed that it had been buying properties, though the
full impact in rental terms would not be reflected in the accounts until
next year.
Gross annual rental income from the acquired properties and other proposed
acquisitions was currently some Pounds 856,000.
The company expects to accrue net income of some Pounds 449,000 a year after
interest - an initial return on equity of about 18 per cent.
With the benefit of acquisitions gross rental income is expected to rise by
some 40 per cent to more than Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.54m annualised).
Earnings fell to 0.5p (5.6p).
In December the company announced the acquisition of 207/213 High Street,
Dorking, and the proposed purchase of 1/30 The High Parade, Streatham High
Road, London.

rise 18p on news of smaller than expected profits fall
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office supplies group,
yesterday reported a 10 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
15.2m to Pounds 13.7m, but said there were signs of a recovery in the
market.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said growth in demand in the UK
corrugated market had averaged about 3 per cent last year, but had reached 8
per cent in recent months. There had also been a recent 'uptick' in France.
'Last year we felt the UK economy was on the rebound, but it slowed down
over the summer. We feel the recovery has accelerated again,' he said.
The profits fall in the six months to October 30 was smaller than many
analysts had expected, and the shares closed up 18p at 456p.
Group turnover rose 31 per cent to Pounds 338m (Pounds 259m), thanks largely
to a three-month contribution from Spicers, the office products wholesaler
acquired for Pounds 91m. Excluding Spicers, turnover was up 3 per cent.
But low paper prices, due to depressed demand and competition from cheap
imports from Germany, meant operating profits - excluding a Pounds 3.9m
contribution from Spicers - fell from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 15.6m. David S
Smith Packaging, Regis Paper, and Kaysersberg in France all reduced their
contributions.
The group operating margin, excluding Spicers, fell from 7.6 per cent to 5.9
per cent.
Increased interest charges of Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 4.4m) reflected higher
borrowings due to the capital investment programme, likely to be about
Pounds 60m this year.
Much of that has been spent on the development programme of the Kemsley
mill, now completed. Mr Williams said Kemsley's new paper machine had
started up in November, and was on target to reach its annual production
level of 200,000 tonnes of recycled packaging papers.
Earnings fell to 9.3p (12p), but the interim dividend is maintained at
2.75p.
COMMENT
David S Smith has been a 'jam tomorrow' story for some time, but yesterday's
better than expected results suggest that tomorrow may at last be on its
way. Whether or not paper prices recover, completion of the Kemsley mill
redevelopment should convert operating losses there into a profit next year,
and gives Smith a low-cost facility to compete with continental European
producers. Smith has successfully integrated Spicers, and is hopeful of
turning around Spicers France. Demand in its main markets shows sign of
picking up, and Smith could ride the recovery both in the UK and France.
Full-year forecasts of about Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 22 - a substantial premium to the sector - but that falls to 17
on forecasts of Pounds 48m in 1995.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Atreus sales well below estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atreus, the shower screen and mirror supplier which came to market in March
via the reverse takeover of URS International, a shell company, yesterday
gave a warning on sales.
The statement - which was issued after the market had closed - said that
while sales for the three months to December 31 were 'slightly ahead' of the
corresponding period last year, they were 'substantially below
expectations'.
The shares slipped 1p to 20p.
The company said that margins had come under pressure and the second half
would not now be as profitable, reflecting costs of the new initiatives it
was taking.
However, the group said it intended to declare a final dividend of 0.527p to
make a total of 0.791p for the year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: FNFC cuts losses despite commercial lending
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, yesterday
reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.8m in the year to end-October 1993,
less than half the previous year's deficit of Pounds 57m.
The shares responded with a 1p increase to 71p.
The group continued to have problems with its commercial lending division,
where losses increased from Pounds 19m to Pounds 23.3m.
Last November, FNFC took the precaution of issuing a warning that it
expected its commercial lending losses to be 'somewhat higher' for 1993 than
for 1992.
Property losses declined from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 9.6m, but the group's
core consumer credit business returned to profit, making Pounds 19.7m after
a loss of Pounds 4.6m in 1992.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said that the group's strategy was to build
and improve the consumer credit business with its associated insurance
products, while managing down its property activities and the commercial
lending portfolio.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts in commercial lending amounted to about
Pounds 20m, following a Pounds 14.2m provision in the previous year.
The group said it was taking a 'sterner view' than in 1992.
FNFC said it did not expect an annual provision of this scale to be required
'in the foreseeable future', though it admitted that it was difficult to be
certain what some of its smaller commercial properties would realise.
The group sees the key to profitability in commercial lending as property
valuation.
Despite the end to the falls in property prices, Mr Mays-Smith said
unemployment and fear of unemployment had had a continuing adverse effect on
confidence.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 1p, following an interim of
0.5p, and an enhanced scrip dividend alternative worth 1.5p.
In July, the group agreed a refinancing deal for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed
to 107 international banks.
The agreement saved it from collapse, but the fees for arranging it are
estimated to amount to about Pounds 13m. This is being spread over the life
of the bank facilities.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: UB takes a larger bite from its Finnish
biscuit - A Nordic expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, is
strengthening its position in the Nordic market by buying a further 21 per
cent of Fazer Biscuits, Finland's leading biscuit company, from the Fazer
confectionery group.
The move lifts UB's holding in the Finnish company to 70 per cent and
follows its purchase of a 49 per cent stake in April 1991. Acquisition terms
are not being disclosed.
'This move to majority control will enable us to drive forward our Nordic
strategy with even closer integration of our Nordic operations and
co-operation with the rest of our European biscuit network,' said Mr Hartwig
Conzelmann, managing director of McVitie's, UB's biscuits division.
The latest move crowns a hectic three-year expansion period for McVitie's,
during which its share of the Nordic biscuit market has risen from 10 per
cent to 47 per cent and annual sales have grown tenfold to Pounds 100m.
The expansion, achieved through acquisitions and organic growth, has been
designed to boost the company's market share and increase overall biscuit
consumption in the region. It is also part of UB's wider thrust to
strengthen its position in continental Europe and is in line with its
strategy of obtaining leading positions in the markets where it operates. It
also has a dominant market presence in the Netherlands through Verkade and
in Hungary through Gyori Keksz.
McVitie's purchase of the initial 49 per cent stake in Fazer Biscuits has
proved successful. Sales at the Finnish company have increased by nearly 50
per cent since 1990 to exceed FM320m (Pounds 37m) last year and pre-tax
profits have risen nearly five-fold.
Apart from this latest purchase, UB has also gained full control of Oxford
Biscuits, Denmark's leading biscuit group, and bought 90 per cent of Jyvas
Hyva, Finland's second largest biscuit group. The expansion has cost less
than Pounds 50m.
The acquisitions have brought the company a range of new products and
enabled it to build up the position of its own brands by using the local
companies' distribution networks. McVitie's Digestive and Hob Nobs, exported
from the UK, are now the top two brands in the Nordic region.
The purchases have also meant that UB has been able to use its Nordic
production facilities to feed into its own network. For example, the
Finnish-produced Riva chocolate biscuit was successfully launched in the UK
last year.
McVitie's market share amounts to 70 per cent in Denmark, 65 per cent in
Finland, 28 per cent in Sweden and 21 per cent in Norway. This makes it the
region's leading biscuit supplier, ahead of the Norwegian group Orkla, which
has 36 per cent of the market.
The group is confident of further sales and profits growth, partly based on
the potential for increasing biscuit consumption in the Nordic region.
'Per capita biscuit consumption in the Nordic region is between 2kgs-3kgs a
year, compared to 14kgs-15kgs a year in the UK and 8kgs-10kgs in Germany and
France,' said Mr Orla Topholt Pedersen, managing director of McVitie's,
Nordic region.
He said Nordic biscuit consumption had grown by an annual 5 per cent over
the last three years, despite recession in the region, compared with a
static trend during the late 1980s.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Granada extends LWT offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada, the leisure and television group yesterday extended its offer worth
some Pounds 700m for London Weekend Television, after LWT shareholders
adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
The number of acceptances grew by only 0.3 percentage points to a total of
2.61 per cent. This gives Granada, which bought 17.5 per cent of the company
last summer, a total of 20.12 per cent.
The offer was extended to January 26 - a shorter period than expected. The
current terms are six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares with a
cash alternative of 528p.
The shorter than expected extension gives Granada the obvious peg to make a
final improved offer - something that City analysts believe will be needed
to clinch the deal. It might, for example, pay a final LWT dividend.
No decision has been taken on an improvement - Granada wants to wait at
least until Friday, the final date for LWT introducing new information.
Another factor is the continuing investigation by the Office of Fair
Trading.
The OFT is believed to be looking carefully at the implication for
advertising sales of any takeover.
Last night Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), said his board
believes that 'LWT shareholders should not exchange their investment in a
valuable television company for shares in a conglomerate, nor accept a poor
cash offer. We continue to advise shareholders to reject the offer'.

FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Irish Contl rises to IPounds
4.74m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Continental Group, the largest shipping and ferry group operating from
Ireland, has reported a 14.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds
4.74m (Pounds 4.55m) on turnover up 5.8 per cent to IPounds 108.8m, for the
year ended October 31 1993.
The company said the turnover increase was primarily due to the inclusion of
a full year's contribution from B&amp;I ferries (10 months in 1991-92) which ICG
bought from the Irish government for IPounds 8.5m two years ago.
The B&amp;I routes saw modest increases in both passenger and cargo traffic
during the year, while its Irish Ferries operations had lower passenger
carryings 'but in line with expectations' due to a chartering of one of its
ferries for operations out of Helsinki during the Easter period.
Roll on-roll off operations out of the Dublin ferryport terminal saw an
increase of 8.8 per cent to 123,000 units, although conventional container
cargoes declined from 54,000 to 34,000 units as a result of the reopening of
competing terminals in Dublin port after the ending of a prolonged
stevedores strike.
Last September ICG took a 25 per cent holding in Bell Lines, a short-sea
European container shipping service, and last November paid IPounds 55.5m
for the ferry Pride of Bilbao, which is operating out of Portsmouth to the
Continent on charter to P&amp;O Lines.
Mr Eamonn Rothwell, group managing director, said that the P&amp;O charter was
providing a net yield of some 11 per cent before depreciation.
The company expects strong growth in all its markets in 1994, due to a
predicted upturn in the UK economy as well as improved economic outlooks in
Ireland and the Continent.
Earnings per share were 27p (21.8p) and a final dividend of 2p is
recommended for a total of 3p, up 24 per cent on the previous 2.42p.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Paramount board recommends QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount Communications last night recommended that
shareholders reject a controversial Dollars 9.2bn offer for the
entertainment company made last Friday by cable company Viacom and accept a
rival Dollars 9.7bn offer from QVC Network.
The decision does not settle the marathon five-month takeover battle, since
shareholders remain free to accept either bid and Viacom could still make a
higher offer by February 1, the date set for final bids.
However, the board's re-endorsement of QVC's offer maintains the
psychological advantage the television home shopping business has enjoyed in
the battle since shortly before Christmas.
That was when the Paramount board, which had previously supported a friendly
merger with cable company Viacom, switched sides under pressure from the
courts and said QVC's offer gave shareholders better value.
Last Friday night, shortly before QVC's tender offer was due to close,
Viacom announced a new bid which increased from Dollars 85 a share to
Dollars 105 a share the cash it is offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's
stock, but sharply cut the value of the securities it is offering in a
'second step merger' for the remaining 49 per cent.
Simultaneously, it announced an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video
rental group Blockbuster Entertainment, which is providing Dollars 1.25bn to
finance the higher cash offer.
The new Viacom bid offers Dollars 13 a share more cash than QVC, but the
total value of its offer is some Dollars 5 a share less than the QVC bid.
A statement from Paramount last night said the board had yesterday evaluated
advice on the new bid from its legal and financial advisers.
It had decided that 'although the per-share cash consideration offered in
the revised Viacom offer is higher than that offered in the QVC offer, the
aggregate consideration offered in the QVC offer and its second step merger,
taken together, represents the best value available to Paramount
stockholders'.
Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman,
said any future bids would continue to be 'rigorously reviewed with regard
to their compliance with the bidding procedures.'
He added that Paramount would not extend the February 1 deadline for final
bids.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Westinghouse chairman shows his hand: Michael Jordan's aims
have met with scepticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Jordan has one of the least enviable jobs in US industry.
Westinghouse Electric, the struggling conglomerate he was brought into six
months ago to salvage, is still suffering from the financial trauma wrought
by losses of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) it sustained in a disastrous move
into financial services in the late 1980s.
Many of its core businesses - led by power systems and defence electronics -
face low growth and weakening profit margins. Its shares are languishing at
a third of their level of four years ago.
Now, after six months as chairman and chief executive of the
Pittsburgh-based group, Mr Jordan has decided to show his hand. The former
senior Pepsi executive and one-time McKinsey consultant has this week
unveiled pre-tax charges of Dollars 750m (Dollars 500m after tax) to cover
restructuring and lay-offs, as well as a further Dollars 376m write-down in
the group's equity to meet pension liabilities and other one-off items.
Mr Jordan's plan involves tackling the groups' financial drag on all fronts.
It also involves simultaneously restructuring the group's core businesses
and raising new capital to finance growth in markets where, he admits, the
profit potential is some way into the future. The reaction of Wall Street,
which marked down the company's share price again yesterday to Dollars 13
5/8 , down Dollars  1/2 this week, suggests that this will be a tall order
to fill.
Attempts to extricate itself from the troubles of the past have eaten deep
into Westinghouse's capital base. At the end of 1993, shareholders' funds
were down to around Dollars 1bn, says Mr Jordan (full 1993 figures have not
yet been published). That is less than half the Dollars 2.2bn of a year
before. The company is now on a tight rein from its bankers, whose approval
it had to seek before it could go ahead with the write-downs.
Even after the latest clean-out, the company still has Dollars 5.2bn of
debt, though Dollars 1.4bn of this should be paid off shortly with the
proceeds from disposals.
Westinghouse also has a growing pension fund deficit. Under pressure from
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Westinghouse has been forced to
adopt a progressively more conservative accounting approach to its pension
fund. These changes have lopped another Dollars 255m off its capital base,
and forced Westinghouse to issue Dollars 200m of new shares to its pension
fund to try to stem the shortfall.
To make matters worse, the group's businesses are generally in low-growth
areas, and profit margins have been under pressure. And Mr Jordan doesn't
even have the luxury of slashing costs to give an immediate fillip to
Westinghouse's cash-flow.
Attempts at restructuring over the past five years have already reduced the
workforce by 20-25 per cent to 54,000 in the group's continuing businesses.
There is little fat to be cut, and any further gains will have to come from
a more far-reaching reorganisation of the way the group's businesses
operate. The new Westinghouse boss has set his sights on three years for
pay-back from the latest restructuring costs, and five years to change a
corporate culture which he calls 'a throw-back to the 1950s'.
Against that background, Mr Jordan's plans look ambitious. First, he has
attempted to put all of Westinghouse's past problems behind it. Thus the
charges this week, which also include reserves to cover litigation and
environmental clean-up costs.
With these changes, he promised an end to the traditional 'annual surprise'
which Westinghouse has sprung on Wall Street at the end of each year. Last
year, environmental services were an 'unmitigated disaster', he says.
Previously, big losses came from financial services. If Mr Jordan can really
stem the flow of bad news and restructuring charges in future, he will have
done much to restore the badly dented credibility of Westinghouse's
management.
Second, he has decided to limit disposals and hold on to a wide range of
businesses, sticking closely with a partial divestment plan developed in
November 1992. There have been one or two changes: Knoll, the loss-making
furniture group, will not now be sold because Westinghouse could not get a
good enough price for it, while large parts of the environmental business
are for sale.
However, Mr Jordan has turned his back on a full-scale break-up of the
group, or the sale of any of what he calls its 'core' businesses. These
include power generation, defence electronics, broadcasting, refrigerated
transport services, and the provision of services to the nuclear energy
industry.
Third, the Jordan plan envisages investment and growth. To back this, it
plans to issue Dollars 500m of preferred shares in the first half of this
year, which will be converted into ordinary shares at some stage in the
future. 'Just to sit with our hands in our pockets and wait two years for
our balance sheet to improve is not an option,' he says.
One business targeted for investment is power generation, an operation with
sales of Dollars 1.5bn in 1992. Westinghouse believes it can benefit from
growing demand in Asia, particularly China. Others are Thermo King (the
refrigerated transport business) and broadcasting. Through its ownership of
broadcast television stations and a group of radio stations, Westinghouse
generated operating profits of Dollars 160m in 1992 on sales of Dollars
853m, and now aims to become the US's biggest radio group.
Mr Jordan also sees prospects for more modest growth from two of the group's
biggest businesses: defence electronics and energy systems, which between
them accounted for Dollars 4.2bn of its Dollars 9.3bn sales in 1992. He
plans to reverse attempts to tilt the electronics business to non-defence
areas, betting instead that US defence cuts on hardware spending have
reached bottom and that existing projects in which Westinghouse is involved
will not be high on the Pentagon's list of cuts. Also, the nuclear power
industry needs services to improve its facilities and bring down its costs
to be able to compete with other power producers, says Mr Jordan.
Wall Street's reaction signalled its disbelief in what was seen as an
ambitious plan. Even before Mr Jordan's public comments, Moody's, the US
rating agency, downgraded the group to junk bond status last week. Straining
credibility were Mr Jordan's claims that the group could pick itself up from
its current lows and expand aggressively in rapidly-changing markets.
Commenting on changes in broadcasting, for instance, he said: 'We have the
ability to be a player in this industry as it reshapes and consolidates.'
Some analysts would rather see Westinghouse sell its broadcasting unit and
use the cash to concentrate on power and electronics.
Mr Jordan does not rule out the prospect of a flotation and partial sale of
the broadcasting business in the future. For now, though, the division
remains central to his plans to strengthen the group's cash-flow (operating
profits at the group are projected to grow at 10-12 per cent a year in
future). If he is right, then these earnings will enable the group to pay
down its debt, strengthen its capital base and emerge with a broad range of
profitable businesses by 1996.
But if Mr Jordan has bitten off more than Westinghouse can chew, he is under
no illusions about what the reaction of the market will be. 'The honeymoon
is now officially over. It's now open season on CEOs again.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / First Leisure feels tight grip on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Leisure yesterday provided further evidence of the tight grip
consumers are keeping on their wallets when it announced pre-tax profits up
2.3 per cent to Pounds 31.8m on turnover up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 121.8m.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive of the discotheques, bowling and tourist
attractions group, said that while admissions were stable or had increased,
spend per head had not.
The only business to show a profits increase was discotheques. Operating
profits were Pounds 14.5m, compared with Pounds 12.5m last year. Turnover
was Pounds 44.5m, compared with Pounds 38.2m in 1992.
Mr Conlan said discotheques were the first part of the group's business to
be affected by the recession and were the first to recover. The south and
south-east of England, the first regions to turn down when consumer spending
fell, were also the first to recover.
While discotheques admissions rose 14 per cent last year, the group had not
raised admission prices.
Profits from the group's resorts fell to Pounds 11.7m from Pounds 12.3m on
turnover of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 40.1m). The group said resorts outside
Blackpool performed well. This was largely offset, however, by a
disappointing summer season in Blackpool itself, following adverse publicity
over bad weather and beach pollution.
The group said it expected Blackpool visitor numbers to rise this year as a
result of activities to mark the 100th anniversary of the Blackpool Tower,
and the opening of the world's highest roller coaster on the Pleasure Beach,
which is not owned by First Leisure.
Profits at the sports division fell to Pounds 13.7m from Pounds 14.1m on
turnover of Pounds 32.1m (Pounds 30.2m). The fall resulted from a drop in
spending on bowling, compared with its peak at the end of 1992. Mr Conlan
said that the number of bowling games played had remained stable, but spend
per head had fallen.
Profits from the bingo business, acquired last year, were Pounds 900,000.
Earnings per share fell 6.8 per cent to 14.75p. Adjusted to exclude the
effect of property transactions, they fell by 2.5 per cent, which the group
said was wholly attributable to the increase in the tax charge. The final
dividend is 4.53p, bringing the total payout to 6.53p, compared with 6.14p
last time.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Chief resigns as Shanks &amp; McEwan warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan fell sharply yesterday after the Glasgow-based
waste contractor issued another profits warning, instigated an urgent
strategic review and announced that its chief executive, Mr Roger Hewitt,
had left the group following a disagreement on future policy.
The shares, which have dropped from a peak of 237p last January, closed 15p
lower yesterday at 97p after the group warned that it faced extremely
difficult trading conditions and said results for the third quarter 'have
continued to disappoint'.
Mr Hewitt's departure is understood to have followed a meeting of the
group's non-executive directors in late December after a number of investors
expressed concerns about the recent performance of the group and a lack of
confidence in its management.
Analysts, who were not surprised by the announcement, said Mr Hewitt's
position had become almost untenable following a string of disappointing
results, profit warnings and the departure of the group's previous chairman
and finance director.
Mr Hewitt, who joined the group in 1985 and had been the chief architect of
its rapid growth, was employed on a service contract and Mr Gordon Waddell,
chairman, said his compensation was 'the subject of negotiation'. Mr Waddell
will assume the responsibilities of chief executive until Mr Hewitt's
successor is appointed.
Yesterday he warned that second-half pre-tax profits would 'not measure up'
to market expectations. Analysts had been expecting second-half pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 6m.
The chairman said the restructuring programme announced at the interim stage
was in place but warned that the resulting estimated Pounds 5m annual cost
savings would not be felt until the 1994/95 financial year.
He blamed the disappointing third quarter performance on three separate
'one-off' technical problems with kilns at the group's Pontypool and Fawley
incineration plants, coupled with lower hazardous waste volumes and squeezed
margins at its southern waste services operations in Bedfordshire.
He said the strategic review is expected to take about 6 weeks and is being
undertaken 'to give us confidence that we are as well positioned as we can
be'.

FT  13 JAN 94 / ICI pulls out of Du Pont joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries has pulled out of IDAC, the Pounds 50m joint
venture in Germany with Du Pont, the US chemicals company, which was set up
in 1988 to enter the Pounds 650m European market for painting cars during
manufacture.
The venture, which Du Pont will continue alone, failed to reach the 20 per
cent market share for which ICI hoped. The price Du Pont is paying for ICI's
50 per cent stake is not being disclosed.
IDAC's annual sales are about DM200m (Pounds 77m) to 12 car factories, but
the squeeze on costs by manufacturers during the recession has damaged
profitability.
IDAC's competitive edge was supposed to be ICI's revolutionary car paint,
Aquabase, which uses water instead of volatile organic solvents to carry the
paint's pigment and resin. Solvent emissions from paint shops contribute to
acid rain as their constituent chemicals break down in sunlight. IDAC's
factory will keep its Aquabase licences.
ICI has now developed Aquabase technology to give it a technological lead in
car repair paints, a Pounds 2bn global market where the company claims to be
the world's fifth largest supplier and the biggest outside the US.
Mr John Hirst, chief executive of ICI Autocolor, said the company would now
concentrate on the development of its two strong industrial paint
businesses, environmentally friendly can coatings and specialised paints for
vehicle repair. It will also continue to milk its profitable cash cow of
Dulux decorative paints, which dominate the UK market for architectural
coatings.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Tory-run council faces damning auditor's report: Major
braced for fresh 'back to basics' attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government was last night bracing itself for fresh attacks
on its 'back to basics' initiative with the release today of a damaging
report on the running of Conservative-controlled Westminster City council.
The district auditor's report into allegations of misconduct by the flagship
Tory council during the 1980s over the sale of council houses will be
published only in summary form for legal reasons.
One minister with links to the council said he expected the auditor's
assessment - which has taken four years and cost about Pounds 1m - to be
'damning'. Other Conservative MPs suggested that that might be an
understatement.
As the cabinet prepared for its first meeting since the recent spate of
revelations and resignations, ministers began to clear some of the confusion
surrounding its call for a return to traditional values.
After a period of contradictory statements, ministers are finally speaking
from agreed briefing notes. Yesterday they sought to reinforce Mr Major's
insistence that the 'back to basics' strategy applied across the range of
the government's economic and social policies rather than to narrow
questions of personal morality.
But the prime minister will be told today by senior officials of the
Conservative backbench 1922 committee that they expect him to take a much
tougher line with members of the government whose personal behaviour could
tarnish its image.
Senior Labour spokesmen indicated their determination to use the Westminster
report to contrast the government's commitment to traditional values with
the behaviour of some Conservative politicians.
The decision not to publish the report in full brought a charge from Mr Jack
Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, that the auditor had been the subject
of 'bullying' by a former council leader. Speaking with the protection of
parliamentary privilege, Mr Straw said he understood the auditor had taken
the decision 'as a consequence of constant bullying by lawyers acting for
one of the respondents, Dame Shirley Porter'.
Despite the secrecy surrounding the conclusions of the investigation,
ministers said they would inevitably involve embarrassment for the
government.
Among other former officials who have been a focus of the inquiry is Mr
Barry Legg, the Conservative group's former chief whip. Mr Legg is now MP
for Milton Keynes South West.
The auditor has the power to recommend that the councillors involved should
be surcharged if he decides that the council's actions were unlawful.
Three quarters of people questioned in a poll for ITN's News At Ten poll
believed ministers who supported the 'back to basics' initiative should
resign if they commit adultery.

FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Remy Cointreau
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hermes International's forecast of a 21 per cent profit gain for 1993 and
Remy Cointreau's 24 per cent increase in interim net profits suggests the
French have kept their taste for the finer things in life, despite
recession. But that does not reflect the whole picture. The premium drinks
company has continued to face tough markets in northern Europe and Japan and
showed a more modest 9 per cent improvement at the operating level.
Remy has done well to win market share and has even started to reverse
Cointreau's dispiriting 10-year sales decline. But it was good export gains
in south-east Asia that chiefly enabled Remy to move forward. Remy's
patience in creating a strong distribution network in China is reaping
rewards and the company is now well-placed to push additional brands. The
other good news is that the champagne cycle seems to have bottomed, with
grape prices having fallen to FFr20.5 per kilo from FFr32 three years ago.
Due to the lags in the cycle, champagne producers are still suffering from
expensive grapes and cheap selling prices. But both cycles should now start
unwinding themselves, leading to a fair margin recovery by 1997.

FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: First Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After First Leisure's shares fell nearly 40 per cent between May and
November last year, the market could be forgiven for being wary about
yesterday's full-year results. In fact, though margins have fallen, they are
still more than respectable, ranging up to 42.6 per cent in bowling. Despite
a Pounds 67.5m write-down on property, gearing is only 13 per cent, making
First Leisure a picture of health compared with companies such as Rank.
Still, the company has had to make price concessions to keep admissions up
in discotheques. Without the benefit of substantial discounts from its beer
suppliers, margins would certainly have fallen yet more steeply.
A main worry is that bowling, which still accounts for 39 per cent of
operating profits and on which the company made its name, may simply not be
so fashionable any more. This is borne out both by the company's admission
that it may have pushed margins too hard at the height of the bowling boom
in 1992 and by its attempts to stimulate additional interest with trendy
extras in its bowling facilities, the latest being Sega games.
The decision to branch out more or less simultaneously into both bingo and
health clubs suggests the company is groping for new sources of growth. Both
can be adapted to the out-of-town formula which proved successful in
bowling, but bingo is a competitive market and health clubs are expensive to
maintain. While the jury remains out, First Leisure looks more comfortable
on a rating slightly above the market rather than at the 40 per cent premium
at which it peaked last year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP had flagged its intention to move on the petrochemicals business well in
advance. The company played a leading role in last year's failed attempts to
co-ordinate cuts in European ethylene production capacity, but had equally
made it clear that it would act unilaterally if necessary. The decision to
shut Baglan Bay's ethylene cracker looks sensible given the plant's high
production costs. Nor is BP ceding much to competitors by moving alone,
since the Baglan capacity has been effectively replaced by lower cost
production at Grangemouth. Other producers will have to make their own cuts
if they wish to edge back towards profitability.
Taking a Pounds 200m charge in its 1993 figures allows BP to do a good deal
more than simply close the Baglan cracker. It should finance sufficient
restructuring for the company to meet its 5 per cent rate of return target
for the chemicals business this year. It also usefully trims profits in
1993, when the company has done well, and gives it a fighting chance of
improving earnings this year, despite the current weakness in the crude oil
price.
That helps BP remain flexible about its dividend. Until the crude price fell
in December, the company had been expected to decide whether to start
increasing the payment in the first half of the year. Now it can choose
whether to argue that difficult upstream and downstream conditions require
caution, or that earnings have returned to a stable upward path which
permits a modest rise. Either way, a range of options looks badly needed in
conditions tougher than any conceived when Mr Bob Horton quit the chair 18
months ago.

FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Right rate for the jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
December's sharp fall in unemployment will doubtless encourage the UK
chancellor to err on the side of caution on interest rates, a point rammed
home by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury. Since the
sharp rise in UK equities since the budget has been fuelled by hopes of an
early cut in rates, yesterday's 42-point fall in the FT-SE 100 index is
understandable - although it seems perverse that shares should take fright
at recovery. The foreign exchange market got the message well before Mr
Nelson's comments, with sterling rising to its highest level against the
D-Mark since the ERM crisis of September 1992.
Sterling's strength may eventually pose a policy dilemma. The unemployment
figures show that manufacturers are still shedding labour. That may be a
secular trend beyond the control of government, but manufacturing output has
also lagged recovery. If industry looks in danger of being priced out of
export markets too, the pressure for corrective action would be great. But
that point is some way off. Sterling is still well below the D-Mark exchange
rate that prevailed before the ERM crisis, while its appreciation on a
trade-weighted basis is much less pronounced.
An early interest rate cut designed to hold sterling down could also
backfire. If international fund managers are buying sterling for the UK's
growth prospects, the pound might actually rise. That amounts to another
argument for caution on monetary policy, at least until tax increases start
to bite in April. How the economy will react at that point remains difficult
to predict. With employment growth concentrated in poorly-paid service
sector jobs, though, lower unemployment promises only a limited offsetting
benefit to personal disposable income.

FT  13 JAN 94 / French pledge on arms sales helps heal rift with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France moved to repair its strained relations with China yesterday,
announcing that it would authorise no further arms sales to Taiwan and that
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, would pay an official visit
to Beijing within the next few months.
In a joint statement issued by the French government and by Xinhua, the
official Chinese news agency, the two countries said they sought a 'total
normalisation of relations and the restoration of warm ties'. French
officials said the return to close political links would add impetus to
trade and investment and end discrimination against French companies seeking
contracts in China.
Relations between the two countries have been strained since the end of 1992
after a decision by France to sell 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft to
Taiwan in a deal worth an estimated Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) China
responded by closing the French consulate in Guangzhou, one of the strongest
actions taken by Beijing against a western nation.
Although the Mirage aircraft have not yet been delivered to Taiwan, the sale
is set to go ahead. 'Commitments made in the past will be honoured,' said Mr
Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. Similarly, a contract for six
frigates concluded with Taiwan in September 1991 will be unaffected.
The joint statement, however, reflected France's desire to reassure Beijing
about its future relations with Taiwan. 'France has confirmed that it
recognises the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole
legal government of China, and Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese
territory,' the statement said. 'In view of the concerns of the Chinese
side, the French government has undertaken not to authorise any French
company to participate in the arming of Taiwan.'
Yesterday's announcements also reflect France's desire to participate in
China's rapid economic expansion. Several French industrial groups, such as
PSA Peugeot-Citroen, already have substantial investments there. Other
companies, such as Aerospatiale, the aircraft manufacturer, are eager to
break into the Chinese market.
Such hopes will be encouraged by the strengthening of diplomatic ties. A
statement on Xinhua said that Beijing would 'welcome participation by French
companies in competition on the Chinese market on an equal footing'.
No date was set for the visit of Mr Balladur, but officials said the prime
minister would probably travel to Beijing in March.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein dashes hopes of early end to violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein yesterday dashed hopes of an early end to violence in Northern
Ireland by saying it would make no formal response to the Downing Street
Declaration until at least the end of February.
Mr Tom Hartley, the national chairman of the IRA's political wing, said in
Dublin a response would come only after Sinn Fein's so-called 'peace
commission' had completed a series of public debates and consultations on
the peace process in both parts of Ireland. This would take place over the
next six weeks.
The statement came as a visit to the province by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, coincided with a fresh upsurge in terrorist violence.
A woman soldier was shot and seriously injured in a republican area of north
Belfast. But troops returned fire, arresting two men and seizing a loaded
gun.
Separately, the IRA said it had 'made a joke' of the 'colossal sums' spent
by the government to fit police and army vehicles with updated
armour-piercing weaponry. This followed a rocket attack in east Belfast on
Tuesday night which left three policemen injured.
Mr Rifkind, who was meeting security chiefs and soldiers, used the visit to
hint that the number of troops there could be cut if the IRA responded
positively to the UK-Irish declaration.
'Obviously if there was peace in Northern Ireland it would have very
important implications for the security force presence which was needed,' Mr
Rifkind said.
Sinn Fein said the first public debate under its consultation process would
be held in Londonderry on January 28. It would be followed by three others
in the Republic up to February 19.
Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said 'numerous groups' had
requested meetings with the party, including Protestant organisations in
Northern Ireland.
This 'external consultation' as Sinn Fein calls it, is to take place in
parallel with a series of internal party debates.
Mr Doherty said that initial soundings within the party taken since the
declaration was published on December 15 suggested there was 'an element of
disappointment'. He added: 'But we wish to explore whether there is a
genuine opportunity for peace in this document.'
Mr Hartley confirmed that Mr Gerry Adams, the party president, had written
to both the British and Irish prime ministers for 'clarifications'. Downing
Street said yesterday it had not yet decided how to respond to Mr Adams'
letter.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Uncle Sam's super-highway: In a rapidly changing market, the
US is dismantling telecommunications regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is laying the foundations of a national information 'super-highway'
with a speed which is surprising even the roadbuilders - and which promises
to give the country a substantial global competitive edge.
The key factors behind it are a rush of new technology and the competitive
spirit of American capitalism. But Washington is also playing an important
part as it struggles to adapt the country's complex and outmoded regulatory
framework to the dawning 'information age'.
The speed of change in both the private sector and government policymaking
has been underlined by two significant developments in the first few days of
1994.
Last week MCI Communications, the innovative long-distance telephone group,
announced that it and various unnamed partners would spend Dollars 20bn over
the next six years, to improve MCI's existing communications network and to
start competing for business traffic against America's local telephone
monopolies, especially the seven 'Baby Bells' which dominate the sector.
MCI is by far the largest of several companies muscling into this market,
and it could present a particularly serious challenge to the local phone
businesses: MCI played a key role in an anti-trust court case which 10 years
ago forced American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to face competition in the
long-distance market and to spin off the Baby Bells as separate companies.
On Tuesday, Vice-President Al Gore, the administration's main figure on
high-technology issues, gave regulatory change a push forward in a speech
which outlined for the first time legislation being prepared by the White
House, which would establish a new, competitive framework for the various
communications industries.
'This administration,' he said, 'will not let existing regulatory structures
impede or distort the evolution of the communications industry.'
It was Mr Gore who coined the phrase 'information super-highway' many years
ago when he was a member of Congress urging government support for
high-speed data networks to link researchers at universities and government
laboratories throughout the country.
Now the term is used much more broadly, to mean a national system of
interlinked high-speed, high-capacity communications networks which can
deliver a large array of interactive consumer, business and educational
services, from movies-on-demand to medical X-ray images.
The US believes that quick deployment of an information super-highway will
give it an important competitive edge - for example, by improving industrial
efficiency and the quality of education. In his speech Mr Gore challenged
industry leaders to begin providing free access to the network for every
classroom, library and hospital.
The highway could also give a strong boost to America's already significant
exports of communications equipment and expertise. In 1992 it exported some
Dollars 7bn of telecommunications equipment and had a trade surplus of about
Dollars 1.2bn.
The government is happy to leave super-highway investment decisions to the
private sector. Technology is changing rapidly and no one can predict what
services consumers will want most. Fast-moving entrepreneurs will be best
able to react to these forces.
Nor does the White House wish to pick industrial 'winners' among the seven
industries all jostling for a piece of the multi-media pie: telephony, cable
television, broadcasting, computing, wireless communications, publishing and
even electricity utilities, which are wondering how to capitalise on the
power lines they have running into every building.
There is a general belief in both the federal government and the private
sector that winners and losers in this industrial revolution are best left
to marketplace competition, which is also regarded as the greatest spur to
network modernisation, and thus the creation of the 'super-highway'.
For example, Mr Gore pointed out that AT&amp;T had moved more rapidly to
introduce modern digital systems into the long-distance market after this
was thrown fully open to competition in 1984.
However, Washington does have two important roles. The first is to simplify
the complicated regulatory maze which restricts competition. The second is
to establish public policy goals to ensure reasonable access to the network
for all Americans.
The central problem is that the existing US regulatory system reflects a
world which is gradually dying: where the Baby Bells (as well as other
independent local phone companies) had a monopoly over local telephone
traffic. The monopoly was largely natural: in a world of scarce
telecommunications resources, there was little room for competing services.
It was also very cosy. Local regulators allowed the phone companies to make
a decent return on their investments, provided their prices remained
reasonable and they fulfilled an obligation to provide a 'universal service'
 -that is, enabling anyone to have a telephone service in their home at a
reasonable cost.
The phone companies have generally achieved this by charging business
customers high rates to subsidise artificially low residential rates.
At the same time, the immense financial muscle of the Baby Bells prompted
fears that they would use their monopoly telephone profits to compete
unfairly in other sectors. Because of this, the court settlement which spun
them off from AT&amp;T banned them from the long-distance telephone market,
telecommunications equipment manufacturing, and information services (though
this last ban was lifted by the courts two years ago).
Similar concerns mean that a 1984 act which regulates the cable television
industry bans all the regional telephone companies from owning and
delivering video programming in their local area, reinforcing the local
monopolies enjoyed by the cable companies.
Now, however, both the telephone and cable monopolies are crumbling. New
technology, and in particular the ability to transmit audio, visual and data
information in the same digital form, means that the neat distinctions
between the industries are blurring.
Entrepreneurial companies from each sector are moving into each other's
territory, though at every turn they find themselves battering against
regulatory barriers.
For example, MCI's new local service will initially be aimed only at
business customers seeking direct access to the long-distance market. This
is mainly because this market offers better profit prospects, but also
because all but four US states forbid competition in the local market for
normal telephone traffic. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI chief executive, is promising
a war to pry open this market.
Similarly, Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative of the Baby Bells, had
to take court action last year to win the right to compete against the cable
industry in its area. It successfully argued that the 1984 cable act was an
infringement of its constitutional rights to free speech.
Until recently, it looked as if such turf battles would continue for many
years, with each industry defending its monopoly rights, and its supporters
in Congress blocking efforts at regulatory reform.
However, over the past year a consensus has emerged in both the
communications industries and Washington that comprehensive legislation is
required quickly to cut through the many, often conflicting layers of
regulation and encourage competition. The shift stems particularly from a
series of takeover bids bringing together cable and telephone companies. The
biggest, a Dollars 22bn deal last autumn involving Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications, the largest cable company, was crucial for reducing
hostility between the two industries.
But the shift has also been helped by the Clinton administration. For while
President George Bush adopted a generally laisser-faire approach to
communications regulation, the Clinton-Gore team made the creation of an
information super-highway an important campaign pledge.
That said, the administration has not been quick to develop its own
communications policy and the bill it is promising will draw heavily on
legislation currently before Congress, the product of delicate compromises
between House of Representatives committee members.
The so-called Markey/Fields legislation would give new competitors -
including cable companies - the right to compete with local telephone
companies and use their facilities on a non-discriminatory basis to
interconnect with consumers. The legislation would override state laws
impeding this.
At the same time, the regional telephone companies would be free to set up
new video services in competition with cable. They would, however, still be
banned from buying local cable companies, so that customers would be able to
choose from at least two competing multi-media services.
On Tuesday, Mr Gore went a step further with a proposal that multi-media
companies be given the opportunity to adopt a special new status, freeing
them from many local, state and federal rules, in return for a commitment to
'open access' - that is, allowing all providers of programming to use their
networks at reasonable cost.
A second piece of legislation before Congress - also endorsed by the White
House - addresses long-standing complaints by the Baby Bells that it is
unfair for competitors such as MCI to invade their local territory (though
the Bells still control all but a tiny fraction of traffic), when they are
still barred from the long-distance market and equipment manufacturing. The
Brooks/Dingell bill would allow the Bell companies to apply for permission
to enter manufacturing after a one-year wait and the long-distance market
after five years.
But while the basic principles of legislation are now clear, and have been
given a powerful impetus by Mr Gore's embrace, some big battles loom as
Congress tries to flesh out the fine print. These details will have a
significant impact on companies' investment decisions and profits.
For example, the local telephone companies are concerned about the rules
governing the interconnection between their facilities and those of new
rivals. They complain that the Markey legislation goes too far in requiring
them to 'unbundle' their services - separating out the various features of
the telephone network and offering them for sale to the competition.
Complains Mr Ron Stowe, a representative in Washington of the Baby Bell
Pacific Telesis: 'It goes far beyond what other competitors have asked for
and, as a general rule, what might be described as essential services.'
The cable companies, for their part, do not want to be weighed down by the
stringent requirements imposed on the telephone companies to provide a
universal service.
A commitment to universal service is basic both to the Markey bill and the
White House's legislation. But two fundamental issues have yet to be
resolved.
First, how do you do define universal service in a multi-media age? The
Clinton administration is stressing the need to prevent the US becoming a
nation of 'information haves and have-nots', in which individuals are denied
access to essential information because of poverty or remote location.
So should universal service consist simply of a telephone line, or include a
more expensive basic package of other features - such as access to video
information?
Second, how do you fund universal service when the local telephone company
has lost the monopoly which buttressed its subsidies?
There is general agreement that a mechanism needs to be found to ensure that
all providers of essential services share equitably in the cost of
subsidies. And many industry figures argue that the subsidies should be
delivered direct to the customer - for example, through vouchers or credits
to their bill - rather than going to the communications company, as now.
So the Clinton administration has its work cut out if it is to get
legislation through Congress by the end of 1994, as it plans.
The players jostling for position in the information revolution have been
squabbling over turf for the past 10 years and are not about to stop now -
whatever the harmonious new-age noises they and the government are emitting.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Al Gore's big picture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A good politician must be able to gaze at the stars but keep his feet
planted firmly on the ground. US Vice-President Al Gore has managed to
achieve this difficult double trick in his plans for developing an advanced
communications infrastructure, which he outlined earlier this week.
Mr Gore's star-gazing involved expanding on his vision of a society where
all homes, offices, schools and other community bodies would be connected to
electronic 'super-highways'. Through these, they would have access to a wide
range of 'multi-media' services which could include information databases,
video-telephony and interactive computer games in addition to standard
telephony and television.
But the vice-president also kept his feet on the ground by making clear that
the bulk of the investment in networks, services and products would be
undertaken by private enterprise. He has largely abandoned earlier
suggestions that the state might be involved in constructing such networks.
The emphasis on competitive private enterprise is important. It provides the
best chance that the vision will be realised, as there is no prospect of
finding tens of billions of dollars from state coffers. It also means that
investment is likely to be focused on products and services that meet
genuine customer needs. A government-sponsored programme could easily have
been wasteful, resulting in the provision of services that nobody wanted.
Dynamic sectors
The telecommunications, cable television, entertainment and computer
industries already constitute some of the most dynamic sectors of the US
economy. The administration's determination to free them to compete
vigorously builds on that strength and should put them in an even better
position to perform well in world markets. The spate of multi-media mergers
over the past year - including Bell Atlantic's bid for TCI and the battle
for Paramount - is evidence of companies' enthusiasm to exploit such
opportunities.
The main thrust of Mr Gore's proposed legislative package is a bonfire of
the regulations which create artificial barriers between different parts of
the media sector. These stem from two main sources. First, the 1984 Cable
Act, which restricts telephone companies' ability to provide video services
over their networks. Second, the 'modified final judgment' which broke
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph into one long-distance company and seven
regional groups. As part of that ruling, the regional groups known as Baby
Bells, were not allowed to provide long-distance services or manufacture
equipment because of fears that they would abuse their local monopoly
positions to dominate these markets.
Monopoly concerns
Such restrictions may have been necessary in the interim to enable new
players to establish themselves in the cable and telecommunications markets.
But they currently serve to limit competition and hold back investment.
This does not mean that monopoly concerns can be dismissed, as the Baby
Bells remain dominant forces in their regions. The administration therefore
sensibly plans two main measures to ensure fair competition. First,
telephone companies will continue to be prohibited from taking over cable
groups within their regions. Second, network operators will have to act as
common carriers for the multi-media services supplied by their competitors.
Mr Gore also insists that all Americans should have access to the new
super-highways at affordable rates, regardless of their income or
geographical location. He is anxious to avoid creating a society of
'information haves and have-nots' and so plans to require service providers
to supply even those whose custom does not represent profitable business.
While the social advantages of this policy are clear, the administration
will need to be careful not to impose such hefty obligations that it deters
investment.
Overall, Mr Gore has set out an attractive platform which should put the US
in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities of a multi-media
future. The challenge for the rest of the world is to respond in kind.
Otherwise, it will find itself falling further and further behind.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Leading Article: The case for lower rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing, barring a miracle, would do more to lift the spirits of glum Tory
backbenchers than a sharp cut in short-term UK interest rates. The question
is whether a prudent chancellor of the exchequer could justify such a cut.
The answer is that he could.
The last interest rate cut - by half a percentage point - occurred in the
week before the November Budget. That rate of interest was judged right
against prospects at the time, including the Budget. Two questions arise,
the first whether subsequent news alters the judgment and the second whether
it was sound at the time.
In November, the Treasury thought real domestic demand would expand at an
annual rate of 2 1/2 per cent between the second half of 1993 and the first
half of 1994. Over 1994 as a whole both demand and real gross domestic
product would be up 2 1/2 per cent. It also forecast the increase in retail
prices, less mortgage interest, at 3 1/4 per cent in the year to the fourth
quarter of 1994.
Nothing learnt since then fundamentally compromises this view. The
underlying annual rate of earnings inflation has remained at 3 per cent for
several months. Growth rates of both broad and narrow money have been
accelerating, but not worryingly so. The increase in real GDP in the year to
the third quarter of 1993 was 2.1 per cent, little short of the forecast
rate for 1994. The exchange rate has been appreciating, though more against
the D-Mark than overall. Yesterday's trade-weighted effective exchange rate
was only 1.5 per cent higher than on Budget day.
More cautious
One bit of news that might make the Treasury more cautious is the reduction
of 137,900 in unemployment during the three months to December. This
suggests either that economic growth accelerated in the last quarter of 1993
or that the underlying trend rate of economic growth is lower than most
analysts had thought. Either way, the authorities might feel more cautious
about adopting a more expansionary policy.
On balance, however, a significant change in the judgment reached two months
ago would seem unnecessary. The question is rather whether it was sensible.
The most powerful argument for cutting short-term interest rates
substantially - that is, by at least one percentage point - is that economic
activity remains well below full capacity on any conceivable measure. With
growth in GDP since its cyclical trough running at an annual rate of about 2
per cent, the economy should also be quite as far below full capacity now as
it was in early 1992.
Sensible policy
The extent of the subsequent decline in unemployment argues for caution on
that point. Nevertheless, if the principal source of disinflationary
pressure is the gap between capacity and actual output, further reductions
in inflation would seem guaranteed. Since inflation is also within the
government's target range, the sensible policy would seem to be to return to
full capacity as swiftly as possible.
The classic mistakes in past policy have been either to overshoot, because
of an over-optimistic view of full employment or, as in 1987-88, to approach
full capacity too quickly. The tax increases due to go into effect over the
next three years and the personal debt overhang make the second risk less
convincing. This economy is unlikely to take off like Lord Lawson's rocket.
Overshooting may be a more serious, if longer-term, danger. It is impossible
to know at what point the underlying rate of inflation might turn up once
more. It is disturbing, for example, that annual earnings inflation, though
down to 2 1/4 per cent in services, is at 4 per cent in manufacturing, even
though the labour force fell by 126,000 in the year to the third quarter of
1993, while that in services rose by 198,000 over the same period.
For all that, the disinflationary pressures still at work do provide a
strong case for a more expansionary monetary policy. Admittedly, it would be
easier to be confident of that advice if institutional changes looked likely
to preclude an early return to faster wage inflation. Policy needs to be
more credible. If the desirable period of rapid growth is not to end in the
traditional inflationary outbreak, independence for the Bank of England
remains the right medicine.

Sir Alan Walters, erstwhile hardline monetarist adviser to Baroness Thatcher
when she was prime minister, pops up in the most surprising places.
His latest venture is to take on a directorship at a newish, high-powered
Zurich consultancy, Leutwiler und Partners, which has also recruited Arthur
Dunkel, the former Gatt secretary-general, as an associate.
The consultancy was set up a little over a year ago by Fritz Leutwiler,
retired president of the Swiss National Bank. Another tough monetarist,
Leutwiler is also a big Thatcher fan, having once betrayed the rather
un-Swiss emotion that 'remembering that I am a married man, I love her'.
'Strategic advice at a very senior level' is the idea behind the outfit,
according to vice-chairman Claude Hankes-Drielsma, so Walters has already
been involved, sitting on an economic policy advisory committee set up by
Leutwiler for the Kingdom of Jordan. Hankes-Drielsma, a former management
committee chairman of Price Waterhouse, says it was 'a natural progression'
for him to become a director.
Could Leutwiler und Partners be hoping to land a contract with Her Majesty's
Government, via Walters? 'Not that I am aware of,' Hankes-Drielsma responds
drily.
Whatever, transport economists clearly travel well.

Christopher Fell, a retired pharmacist and keen FT reader with a life-long
interest in basic economics, makes a helpful suggestion as to why the
current generation of Tory politicians may be getting into hot water over
illegitimate children; it is in fact the fault of the Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary.
Fell points out that the dictionary only carried entries for 'condom' and
'French letter' in the 1983 addendum of the 1973 edition. 'By that time most
ministers had finished their education and were in politics . . .' So John
Major's emphasis on education in his back to basics message has a private
morality spin after all.

Celebrities rush in where Nato fears to tread. Well, not all of them
perhaps. Alan Sealy, a British ex-marketing man who describes himself as an
'ordinary bloke', has managed to entice some stars to flock to Southwark
Cathedral on January 18 to fund-raise for Bosnia.
Sealy's ad hoc group Sarajevo Witness is staging what it calls a
'multi-faith event'. Southwark's Anglican bishop, Roy Williamson, will be
joined by his Roman Catholic counterpart, Charles Henderson, along with
Orthodox, Moslem and Jewish divines.
But the real crowd-pullers will be actress Juliet Stevenson - reading from
the diary of 11-year-old Zlata Filipovic, the so-called 'Anne Frank of
Sarajevo' - and punk virtuoso violinist Nigel Kennedy. Lesser lights include
Bosnian cellist Vedran Smailovic and television newsreader Zeinab Badawi.
But one celebrity has had to pull out. Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, the
former commander of the Cheshire regiment with the UN in Bosnia, whose
romantic relationship with a Swiss aid worker in Sarajevo caught the
headlines, has said he can't make it after all.

Talking of the EBRD, one man hoping to make a killing at the bank's annual
meeting in St Petersburg next April is Roger Garside, former public
relations chief of the London Stock Exchange. Garside and a couple of
cronies are sending themselves to Siberia for three months to scout out
promising investment opportunities, salt mines not excluded.
Working out of the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences in
Novosibirsk, they will prospect for investment opportunities all the way
from the Urals in the west to the Kamchatka peninsula. The region has the
highest ratio of untapped natural resources per inhabitant anywhere in the
world, according to Garside, who hopes to launch the first European
investment fund for Siberia. A man in a hurry, he wants to have a portfolio
of investment opportunities ready in time to show them off at the EBRD's St
Petersburg bash.
Another sign that the fashion for emerging markets is getting out of hand?

Time was when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development knew how
to throw a good party. But it sounds like this weekend's get-together of
EBRD top brass at an undisclosed destination on the English south coast will
not be a hoot.
Three months into the job, EBRD boss Jacques de Larosiere has concluded that
the problems bequeathed by his predecessor, Jacques Attali, are even more
severe than previously thought. Hence pay rises for most staff will be
limited to a maximum of 1 per cent this year and top-dog salaries will be
frozen. He also wants far more members of his staff to be based in eastern
Europe rather than London. Hands up volunteers for Novosibirsk?
But perhaps the cruellest blow is the closure of the EBRD's executive dining
room, which sounded like it deserved a Michelin star. Most days de Larosiere
eats in the staff canteen where he picks up useful tips by chatting up
younger members of staff. How long will that last?

Sir, Like other correspondents, I oppose the proposed Pounds 1m premium bond
prize.
Surely, the fair certainty of winning smaller and more frequent prizes under
the current system serves best to cater for the investor's mild gambling
psyche and need to have an acceptable alternative to the conventional method
of earning a return from a capital sum? The new proposal is strongly
gambling-orientated, offering not only an extremely remote chance of winning
but also a real financial disincentive through the loss of regular small
prizes ('interest').
I believe these distinctions reflect the different needs of entirely
separate segments of our investing com-munity.

Sir, There has been considerable criticism of the decision to increase
premium bond prizes to Pounds 1m and decrease the number of smaller prizes.
Perhaps of more concern are the reports that this decision was made on the
basis of 'gut feeling' by those responsible for the management of premium
bonds rather than on any market survey. If this is correct, it is a sad
indictment of the quality of management in what appears to be a substantial
business enterprise.

transport projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Manchester trams beat forecasts' (January 10) correctly
highlighted the benefits in combining the public and private sectors in
infrastructure investment. We wish Manchester continued success and are
adopting an identical approach here in the West Midlands.
The problem is a much more difficult one to solve than suggested since it
goes right to the heart of the way the government thinks and the way that
the public sector has been financed over the past 14 years.
The big projects currently suggested in the press are still a long, long way
from being brought to fruition, due to the requirement to inject an
unrealistically high level of private sector finance. If a partnership has
to be forged between the public and private sectors then a better
understanding of the risks and rewards must be achieved.
It is not the case that private sector finance can be substituted for what
should be properly spent by the public sector. A proper partnership is
essential.
This view comes from practical experience of attempts to persuade the
private sector and the government to invest in the light rail rapid transit
scheme for the West Midlands - Midland Metro. This scheme, which represents
excellent value for money, has passed the stiffest financial cost-benefit
analysis of any scheme submitted to the Department of Transport. The massive
benefits the project will give to the West Midlands conurbation far outweigh
the requirement for Department of Transport finance.
It is, however, prevented from proceeding due to the continual squeeze on
the public sector borrowing requirement. The partnership with the private
sector between Centro (the West Midlands passenger transport executive) and
the Altram consortium grouping of John Laing and Ansoldo Trasporti is
complete. The land for the scheme is being acquired. Significant risks have
been transferred to the private sector and a firm contract price agreed with
the consortium. We are able and willing to start immediately the government
gives the go-ahead.
When the public and private sectors can reach agreement, as we have done,
and are ready to start, the government has an excellent opportunity to
demonstrate that the 'private finance initiative' can be realistically
implemented.
We look forward to a quick, positive government decision in order that this
particular transport scheme can proceed.

they were a quintessential - and wholly legal - part of the British scene.
Then again, was Joe Rogaly perhaps implying that corruption and impropriety

<TEXT>
VALUE IN ETHICS AND ECONOMICS By Elizabeth Anderson Harvard University
Press.  Pounds 27.95/Dollars 41.95. 245 pages.
Capitalism has proved more efficient at generating wealth than Marxism or
any other economic system. But debate over its ethical foundations is not
dead. The latest contribution comes in this stimulating book from Elizabeth
Anderson, a philosopher at the University of Michigan.
Though not totally hostile to market economics, Anderson is anxious to
combat what she sees as a tendency for commercial values to invade areas of
human life where they do not belong. She opposes, for example, making money
out of surrogate motherhood, cost-benefit analysis of the environment and
privatisation of public services.
Commercialisation can degrade human beings by undermining their autonomy,
according to Anderson. This happens when people sell things such as their
freedom of action, perhaps via certain types of employment contracts, and
their ability to reproduce. Putting a price on too many aspects of life can
also restrict people's capacity to enjoy a meaningful existence by reducing
all considerations of value to mere utility.
At the heart of Anderson's book is an attack on the theory that people care
only about what is useful or pleasurable to themselves. This idea, known to
generations of economics students as the axiom of 'utility maximisation', is
the foundation upon which much classical economic theory is built.
Anderson rejects this proposition as too narrow an explanation of human
behaviour. Instead she offers a more complex theory, which acknowledges that
people value things not simply because they are useful or pleasurable but
for other reasons such as respect, love, admiration or awe.
She argues that this pluralism in the way we value things is central to the
richness of life. When an object's utility is the only consideration, then
the market is an appropriate institution for valuing it - but not when other
considerations such as respect or love come into play.
In fleshing out this thesis, Anderson distinguishes between things that can
be properly traded and those which, she believes, should only be given.
Examples of the latter category include children, trust, friendship and
sexual gratification. To buy and sell these, she argues, is to devalue them.
Equally, to treat the environment merely as an economic resource is to
ignore the fact that nature is valuable even when it has no practical use to
mankind.
Although Anderson's book is hard to read because of its philosophical
jargon, it has many strengths. Her pluralistic theory of value provides a
broader perspective on the limitations of the market than the traditional
leftwing complaint that capitalism leads to an unfair distribution of the
fruits of economic activity. Her argument that commercialisation can rob
human existence of much of its significance surely has merit.
The book's weaknesses appear when Anderson turns her attention from
philosophy to public policy. Her preference is for the state to draw the
boundary between what should be traded and what should not.
She is also opposed to the campaign begun in many countries in the 1980s to
roll back the frontiers of the state through privatisation. Instead of
privatisation, Anderson wants to see greater involvement for community
bodies, such as local government and school boards, which she believes would
allow people's needs to be determined through democratic debate. She thinks
it is more important for citizens to exercise their voices collectively
rather than as individuals picking and choosing suppliers of services. She
therefore objects to ideas such as education vouchers on the grounds that
they would undermine a community approach to schooling.
But such practical conclusions do not obviously follow from Anderson's
philosophical analysis. Just because the market is not perfect does not mean
that the state can remedy its defects.
For example, although people may be unwise to engage in practices such as
prostitution, Anderson does not give convincing reasons why it should be
prohibited by the state. Advocates of individual liberty have accepted that
freedom includes the freedom to make mistakes.
Similarly, Anderson is too quick to recommend that the state should ban
commercial surrogate motherhood on the grounds that it leads to manipulation
and exploitation of the genetic mother. If consistently applied, a policy of
banning every act that involves manipulation would lead, not only to the
criminalisation of most economic activity, but virtually of all politics.
This book would have benefited from exploring a wider range of options for
combating manipulation: it might, for example, be better for the state to
educate its citizens so they are better able to stand up for themselves than
to impose heavy-handed regulations.
A further reason for resisting the knee-jerk reaction of calling in the
state to sort out the limitations of the market is that the state has its
defects, too. Anderson recognises this, criticising the tendency for power
to become concentrated in remote centralised organisations. She believes the
answer to such defects is to decentralise power and make the state more
democratic. But, although democratic community organisations may be
preferable to a centralised state, it does not follow that they are in
general superior to the market.
Nevertheless, the book's weaknesses when it comes to public policy should
not detract from its philosophical strengths. It is possible to reach
different practical conclusions while accepting Anderson's overall theory of
value, which provides a useful contribution to debate about the proper scope
of the market.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Competitiveness and currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A booklet with the unpromising title Measuring International Price and Cost
Competitiveness by Philip Turner and Jozef Van't dack, and published by the
Bank for International Settlements in Basle, is the most revealing
international economic detective story I have seen in years.
It sheds some light on the upsurge in sterling. This has now recovered
nearly three-fifths of the ground it lost against the D-Mark at its lowest
point after leaving the ERM. But even for those of us who believe in taking
the exchange rate fully into consideration in monetary policy, this does not
establish a case for a unilateral UK interest rate cut.
The main pressures on sterling in 1992 did not come from uncompetitiveness
against the D-Mark or other continental currencies, but against the dollar.
But the other and even bigger pressure came from the market's perception
that the need to combat the domestic recession would make it impossible to
hold British short-term interest rates at anywhere near the very high levels
then prevailing in Germany.
The British economy now needs a period of above-trend growth to take up
slack. But the December labour market figures suggest that this is already
happening, and that not only the mainstream forecasts but even the official
estimates of recent production performance are understated. To cut UK
interest rates unilaterally would not only over-egg the domestic pudding,
but could look provocatively like beggar my neighbour.
The main messages emanating from the BIS concern, however, the D-Mark and
the dollar. There is a large query over German competitiveness, which was
once regarded as a yardstick for the rest of the world. Another conclusion
is that the US has had a fantastically easy ride in the international
economy and has no excuse for blaming the rest of the world for its own
social and economic problems.
The route to these conclusions is through an analysis of 'competitiveness'.
The word is sometimes used in ambitious and mind-boggling ways to express
every aspect of a country's economic and even moral performance. It is used
in the BIS study for the more quantifiable aspects of a country's price and
cost performance in international markets. As such it means the same as the
real exchange rate - that is the nominal rate, as it is quoted in the press,
adjusted for price and cost changes.
Estimating a real exchange rate or competitiveness index is not simple. The
first chart shows why there have been such radically different assessments
in the case of Germany. Judged by consumer prices or even export prices, the
German real exchange has been remarkably stable. But as the BIS points out,
world competition makes it difficult for manufacturers of traded products to
move very far from international going prices. The effects of high costs are
felt in pressures on margins, as shown by German corporate agonies.
The BIS regards the labour cost measure as the least unreliable; and it is
careful to count in not only pay, but all labour overheads. The fact that
competitiveness is now an issue is shown by the strenuous efforts of the
Bundesbank in its December monthly report to rebut the case for D-Mark
devaluation (yes, devaluation).
The origins of German uncompetitiveness go back to the boom of the late
1980s, aggravated by the overheating of the economy in the early stages of
unification. German inflation is now all but licked. A sign of the times is
the west German chemical workers' settlement, equivalent to an annualised
increase of 1 1/2 per cent - below the headline inflation consumer price
rise of 3.7 per cent, which has itself been swollen by tax increases. Even
more important, the agreement that long-term unemployment workers can be
hired at 90 per cent of basic pay rates, shows the first beginnings of a new
willingness to price the jobless into work, and to formalise the difference
between insiders and outsiders.
Nevertheless the result of past excesses is now built into the German cost
structure. Some other European countries which the BIS had reckoned to be
uncompetitive improved their position when the narrow ERM exploded. But this
left Germany all the more high and dry. The continuing depreciation of the
D-Mark against the yen has been the main alleviating force. But there has
been no depreciation against the dollar, taking the last four years
together, but simply a series of V shapes.
The French franc, like most of the currencies of the EU core, has stayed
close to the D-Mark. Indeed the franc has this winter passed the DM3.43
barrier and re-entered the old narrow ERM band. Nor have the monetary
results been the disaster that the opponents of shadowing the D-Mark had
hoped. Short-term interest rates, at around 6 per cent, are little more than
half a percentage point above the UK's, as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
reminds British visitors.
Moreover French costs are lower than Germany's at current exchange rates.
The BIS estimates that last October German unit labour costs were 70 per
cent above American ones, while French costs were 40 per cent higher,
British costs 25 per higher and Italian costs only 7 per cent above. Why
then has France lagged behind the UK in economic recovery? Partly because
the UK was able to make a sharp early start in reducing interest rates; and
partly because the pound became moderately undervalued. The UK could only
get away with its effective devaluation because the ERM departure was a
market event, unplanned and undesired.
The latest sterling upsurge suggests the tantalising possibility that the
pound may follow the franc in approaching its old ERM floor against the
D-Mark. Nevertheless, sterling is still 10 per cent down on its trade
weighted average, compared with August 1992, thanks to the appreciation of
the dollar and the yen.
That appreciation could have further to go. The clear message from all the
different BIS computations is that the dollar is still very cheap on any
comparison of labour costs or prices of internationally traded products.
This fact might increase the case for a concerted reduction in European
interest rates, perhaps timed to coincide with the much discussed next Fed
tightening. But attempts by European countries to gain or preserve
competitive advantages against each other should be avoided at all costs.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Finance not the key to Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BIJAN-DANIEL KHEZRI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, More financial aid is not better aid. While proposing that western
governments 'provide about 4 per cent of Russian gross national product
(Dollars 14bn) in quick-disbursing funds for socially oriented projects',
Jeffrey Sachs and Charles Wyplosz ('How the west should help Russian
reform', January 11) suggest a short-term treatment of symptoms rather than
a policy taking into account the structural obstacles blocking reforms in
the short as well as in the long term.
First, parliamentary appropriations will be difficult to obtain.
Recession-haunted western taxpayers are fed up with pumping billions of
dollars into non-existent macroeconomic structures, paying for western
policymakers' inability to develop a coherent co-operative strategy for
reform. The policy should consist, financial aid aside, of strong and
wide-ranging technical assistance in local institution-building (tax-system,
judiciary, banking, etc) trade and business training.
Professors Sachs and Wyplosz believe that 'Dollars 14bn is surely the most
important investment in Russia's democratic future and, thus, in western
security'; but Russia's dealings with ex-Soviet republics during the past
two years might well indicate that the Trojan horse of Russian expansionism,
threatening international security, is a battery of subtle ideology-fuelled
power politics manifested in trade and monetary policies, economically
suffocating its neighbours to death. The west's stability-enhancing support
should focus on the economic and, thus, political survival of Russia's
neighbours. A possible policy option might consist of providing incentives
to Russia, not politically to abuse energy and monetary monopolies.
A well-established class of corrupt entrepreneurs is building a state of its
own within Russia, controlling the wealth of the country, namely the natural
resources. It is manipulating the development of all entrepreneurial
activity, working partly hand in hand with the government and reducing the
country's tax revenue through systematic bribery - though creating some jobs
and filling some empty shelves. Under these circumstances, western reform
support should be strictly limited to technical assistance, excluding huge
financial injections.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Arts: Another crack at the 'Nutcracker' / Review of John
Neumeier's version of this difficult - albeit favourite - ballet at the
Opera Garnier, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nutcracker has been a problem ballet ever since the premiere in St
Petersburg 101 years ago. Almost every choreographer of note since Petipa's
day has had a go and none has been 100 per cent successful. Petipa himself
fell ill and handed over to Ivanov - Hawksmoor to Petipa's Christopher Wren.
The ballet's popularity has been due mainly to Tchaikovsky's music. The
difficulty has always been the scenario, drawn from a tale by Hoffmann with
results inept, ill-structured and largely senseless.
For its end of the year show, the Opera Garnier presented for the first time
in Paris John Neumeier's version, under the old name Casse-Noisette. First
seen at Frankfurt in 1971, this version makes a serious effort to put things
right. The first part is the best. The child Clara becomes the slightly
older Marie, celebrating her 12th birthday at home with a party to which her
envied older ballerina sister, Louise, has brought some of her friends from
the theatre. Among these are young Gunther, to whom Marie takes a fancy, and
also her ballet-master Drosselmeier.
There are children, but they are kept in the background. The main dancing is
done by the teenagers and principals with a bunch of strapping cadets -
chums of Marie's brother Franz. All this is greatly to the advantage of the
homely, domestic romps. Everything is clear. One does not feel like Ethel
Smyth, lured to Sadler's Wells in the early days to see Casse- Noisette and
overheard asking her companion, 'what are they doing and why are they doing
it?'.
When Marie steals back after the guests have gone to retrieve the nutcracker
she has been given, falls sleep and starts to dream, things do not go so
well. At this point in the score there begins a long, through-composed
sequence embodying at least three embryonic Lisztian symphonic poems,
culminating in the impressionist Snowflakes Waltz. Neumeier leaves out the
battle of toy-soldier and mice (difficult to set but a necessary musical
contrast). The marvellous slow three-four section, richly harmonised and
sumptuously scored, perfect evocation of a child's mounting wonderment, is
no longer a transition to the snow forest but a pas-de-deux for Marie and
Gunther, now revealed as a principal dancer.
Neumeier then borrows an interlude from The Sleeping Beauty as another pas
de deux - for Louise and Drosselmeier. No snow-forest, but an off-white
dance studio where Drosselmeier teaches while the music skirls and eddies
snowily - and where are the off-stage chorus?
Alexandre Benois (who at the end of his career designed a much-liked
Nutcracker for Festival Ballet) described the St Petersburg original staging
as 'hideous' in his diary. Some surviving photographs bear him out. The
final scene in the Land of Sweets is a designer-trap. What could be more
visually unappetising than enlarged confectionery? Jurgen Rose, who has
adapted his designs for the Opera stage, avoids the trap with a handsome but
restrained baroque-style background.
The famous character dances performed in front of it are perfect examples of
Tchaikovsky the melodist and colourist: no-one except Bizet and, to a lesser
extent, Delibes could approach him here. Neumeier treats them as vignettes
based on the titles of long-forgotten Petipa ballets - a little solemn and,
in the Chinese Dance so much admired by Stravinsky, a little slow.
The Valse des Fleurs is played before the divertissement, which brings it
too near the other waltz scene. As for the Grand Pas de Deux, the ultimate
expression in music and movement of the turned-out upward-thrusting,
imperious classical style, it suffers from there being too many pas-de-deux
in a ballet where one usually feels there are too few. Marie, coyly
simpering like Mother Simone in La Fille mal gardee, is persuaded to dance
the celesta variation while Louise is given an extra solo from The Sleeping
Beauty. Should not the whole, climactic sequence be danced exultantly in the
presence of the whole company, not as here for the sole benefit of Marie and
Drosselmeier?
The performance by the soloists - when I saw them, Elisabeth Maurin (Marie),
Elisabeth Platel (Louise), Patrick Dupond (Drosselmeier), Manuel Legris
(Gunther) - and by the corps was admirable. The music with Jonathan
Dorlington conducting the Orchestre Symphonique Francais, was given full
justice. For once the first-act dances were played with as much care as the
better-known ones in the second. The sound had a warmth and clarity which
were a joy to hear.
There is a further series of performances from January 19 to 28

Tonight David Dimbleby adopts the mantle of Tribune Of The People and takes
over the Day/Sissons chair at Question Time promising to ensure that
politicians answer the questions put to them by members of the public. Which
means that today's programme (10.20 BBC1) will be unique. We shall see.
BBC2 begins a magazine series, Big Science (8.00). Each half hour programme
will contain three items. Today's are the Big Bang, gene research, and the
cerebral activity behind the catching of a cricket ball.
What other comedian would dare take 'cogito ergo sum' and turn it into 'I'm

All New Alexei Sayle Show. (9.00 BBC2).
The final programme in Peter Taylor's States Of Terror series investigates
how Army intelligence and MI5 plant agents in Northern Ireland's terrorist
groups (9.30 BBC1).
In Trial And Error David Jessel investigates another alleged miscarriage of
justice: the case of Gary Mills and Tony Poole who were convicted in 1989 of
murder (9.00 C4).

FRIENDS (15) Elaine Proctor
THE NORTHERNERS (15) Alex Van Warmerdam
UNDERCOVER BLUES (12) Herbert Ross
PROVIDENCE (PG) Alain Resnais
STRANGER THAN PARADISE (15) Jim Jarmusch
What is history? For us living in the real world today, it is the sum of all
our yesterdays: the force that shaped the past and made the ingredients for
the present. But for those living in movies about the past, history is one
long tragicomic irony. We the audience know - they on screen do not - the
outcome of all those Great World Events being lived through.
This gives every historical movie a split personality. A film about the
Battle of Waterloo is not just about the Battle of Waterloo. It is about us
filmgoers looking down from Mount Hindsight on foolish old Wellington and
Napoleon, as they throw armies at each other in unaccountable ignorance of
the well-known outcome. The man in the boots does not know that he will
defeat the man in the funny hat, but we do. Result: diminution in dramatic
tension, compensated for by the luxurious pleasures of omniscience.
In Friends, written and directed by first-time film-maker Elaine Proctor,
1980s South Africa is limbering up for black liberation. Though full of
serendipitous life and insights, this is one of those films that has a
historical destination to reach and lets us know it.
The three ex-university girls of the title - one black, two white - must be
split apart by political events and then reunited. Aninka (Michele Burgers),
a working-class Afrikaner who weds an archaeologist, spends much of the
movie digging up the back garden with her hubby, exposing symbolic layers of
African history. Thoko (Dambisa Kente) is a goodhearted Zulu: a walking
advertisement for Black Is Beatific. And anti-apartheid terrorist Sophie
(Kerry Fox) - mad, bad and dangerous (but lovable) - dashes about the land
planting time-bombs in order to catalyse a future we in the audience already
know.
Even had we not read our newspapers, we could presage the one-nation
solidarity-out-of-trauma ending from this film's opening shot. The women sit
in a steam room in a symbolic feet-outwards triangle (or three-point star).
Their lives may be pointing in different ways, ah] but their heads and
hearts are so close. History will bring them together after a first,
rite-of-passage parting of the ways.
For the 'We Hate History In The Movies' lobby - of which I am an occasional
member - the divergence process proves more enjoyable than the obligatory
reunion under the skies of Mandela's dawn. Kerry Fox, who riveted attention
as the wacko grown-up heroine in An Angel At My Table, plays Sophie as if
auditioning for a production of the Marat/Sade. Straggly blonde hair,
blanched features, insomnia-shadowed eyes: this is the face of guilt and
derangement with which terrorists must pay for their felices culpae.
Yet her sacrificial courage, suggests the film, in fragmenting both her own
personality and her friendship bond with Thoko and Aninka helps hasten the
true healing process of the close. No omelettes without broken eggs; no
Utopias without broken laws.
The film is too programmatic and too contrivedly cross-sectional in its
distribution of main roles; also, too ready to use Sophie-style scare
tactics to shock us into enlightenment. (The prison scenes are the old
thump/wallop/bright lights stuff we know from a hundred Cry Freedoms). Nor
does Elaine Proctor, a South African-born graduate of our own National Film
School, know how to keep Thoko and Aninka's roles nourished while Sophie
runs off with the prime cuts of plot.
Yet Friends has life even in the midst of dramatic anorexia. The love-hate
vitality Proctor puts into Sophie also energises her picture of South Africa
as a land: all that sun-scorched rural beauty side by side with shellshocked
urban fragility. If visual nervous energy is the first quality a young
director should have - and it is - Miss Proctor's talents are well worth
keeping under surveillance.
African history plays a nimbler game of hide-and-seek in the Dutch comedy
The Northerners. The setting is a surreal one-street village in Holland, all
that survives of an unfinished housing development floating in a vast plain.
Now and then the action spills into a nearby wood where, inter alia, young
Thomas (Leonard Lucieer) prances about in black-face and leopard head-dress
pretending to be Patrice Lumumba (the time is the 1960s) and a runaway black
(Dary Some) hides out after escaping from a travelling Missionary
Exhibition.
If the setting is odd, the film is odd with knobs on. Writer-director Alex
Van Warmerdam seems to be spinning a fable about colonialism: more exactly,
about Civilisation versus the Bush. Out in the wood anarchic, savage,
magical things happen: from the postman's daily campfire, heating the kettle
with which to steam open the villagers' letters, to a lady in the lake, a
mad huntsman and a corpse under ice.
Back in the village, all is politeness, hypocrisy and net-curtain voyeurism.
The white man's burden of civilised Christian behaviour brings us everything
from clandestine adultery (butcher with lady clients in meat locker) to
religious delirium (dying housewife tended by a come-to-life St Francis
statue) to the two priests with their phut-phutting, black-smoking carnival
truck containing the great missionary roadshow.
The film is like a Jacques Tati comedy mixed up with bits of Coronation
Street. At one moment the action will freeze for a super-sitcom tableau of
neighbours in shock: the beehive hair styles lining the street to goggle at
the latest Miss Rape-Victim running out of the butcher's shop. At another
moment, social comedy spirals into the balletic-surreal as a nymph and swain
frolic underwater, or a vulture lands on a deathbed, or a boy walks the
village in ten-feet-tall disguise, using a pal as stilts.
The Northerners won a deserved Felix (or Euro-Oscar) as Young European Film
of the Year. Its wit, verve and nerve lie in its refusal to explain itself.
It could be an allegory; it could be a comedy of provincial manners; it
could be a homage to Tati. Then again it could be all three, thrown into the
Magimix and spun so fast, so deftly, that the audience is left happily
clutching at flavours as they fly past.
No such improving exercise in Undercover Blues. Here the ingredients thrown
into the blender get stuck in the blades and churned to pulp before we reach
reel two. Spy thriller, comedy, baby movie, New Orleans travelogue . . .
Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid are Mr and Mrs Ex-CIA Spy-person, plus
tiresome tot, and Herbert Ross (Funny Lady, The Goodbye Girl) directs the
fun-free shenanigans in which they become enmeshed. These include a Hispanic
mugger (Stanley Tucci), a lisping policeman (Larry Miller), an eye-rolling
Czech villainess (Fiona 'RSC' Shaw), a subplot about super-weapons, a - no,
don't go away, I am sparing you the worst.
The cited model for this rubbish was The Thin Man movies. But the PR people
cannot put that one over on me: I have seen the Thin Man movies. Instead of
K. Turner, D. Quaid and an underscripted infant, they had W. Powell, M. Loy
and a carefully scripted dog. And they had that all-important ingredient -
outstanding here by its absence - wit.
But there is always revival corner. This week it offers Alain Resnais's
Providence (1977) and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise (1984). The
Resnais is a comedy of ill manners, cracklingly scripted by David Mercer.
Sir John Gielgud and Sir Dirk Bogarde play father and son, putting their
fingers in the mains socket of life and exchanging literate, high-voltage
shrieks across the lawns of France. (Was this the first ever Euro-pudding?)
Jarmusch's film is his best in a downhill-ever-since career. Three loopy
young persons, two from New York, one from Hungary, wander the Eastern
seaboard looking for wisdom and serenity but finding only the nearest
American equivalents. Beautiful boredom; the poesy of banality; the
time-space continuum of the inner mind.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Arts: Good value with 'January Sales' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old art of revue has made a triumphant return to London's West End. Kit
and the Widow's January Sales will remind anyone old enough to remember
Pieces of Eight which starred Kenneth Williams and took off the old Tory
slogan - Don't let Labour ruin it - in the late 1950s.
As a two-man show, Kit and the Widow also owes a lot to the Flanders and
Swann style of At the Drop of a Hat. And here is the highest compliment of
all: January Sales does not fall far short of Beyond the Fringe, which was
the last major revue to appear in the London theatre, and that was in 1961.
By 'revue' I mean topical political, social and musical satire with a touch
of camp and nostalgia. Beyond the Fringe was a breakthrough because it poked
fun at the then conventional wisdom, But if you look back, it seems pretty
self-satisfied and conservative: very British and very Oxbridge.
January Sales has the same merits and defects. The political satire is
relatively mild. It treats the present government with affectionate ridicule
rather than contempt. There is a lot of undergraduate humour. One very
Flanders and Swann song has the refrain 'Bottomley, Bottomley, Bottomley,'
after the health secretary. Schoolboy jokes come in with the Church of
England getting its vicars in a twist and 'minor canons going off all over
the place' and science enters with a version of Noel Coward's old song as 'A
Womb with a View', including the latest developments on designer babies.
The sharpest political song again comes from Coward. Kit prances
magnificently round the stage as Lady Thatcher cursing that she could have
been so wrong about John Major - 'so bad about the boy'.
The harshest political line comes in the course of a song about the new
Germany: 'Stephen Sondheim - he may be Jewish, but his initials are great'.
The only weak song in the show, unfortunately much applauded, attacked the
French for wanting the Channel tunnel.
No such harshness is applied to the British. The song about the Queen and
her family is broadly on her side. John Major is never attacked directly and
John Smith is never mentioned. Yet in a British kind of way the satire is
effective. Poking fun at the government can be much more devastating than
ranting and raving.
Not everything is politics. January Sales has the best take-off of Sir
Andrew Lloyd Webber - whose Sunset Boulevard is playing next door - that you
are ever likely to see, bringing out the derivative nature of his music. Yet
since Kit and the Widow seem to be such nice people, it is kindly rather
than cruelly done.
The revue is down to run for only three weeks. That is absurd. The Widow
(Richard Sisson) is the thin one who plays the piano and is developing a
good line in diffident jokes. The fat one is Kit Hesketh-Harvey who does
most of the singing. Together they are a marvellous team.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Singapore finds quay to success - One of the
world's busiest container ports is a pioneer in its use of computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the dock lie 60,000 containers, stacked five high. In one of them is a
batch of bicycles en route from Taiwan to Finland. It needs to be found,
loaded on to a truck, taken to a quayside crane and put in a designated
place in the hold of a particular vessel, one among dozens in the port. All
this must happen in minutes.
Handling cargoes at Singapore, which rivals Hong Kong as the world's busiest
container port, is as complex as managing flights at an international
airport. A vessel arrives at and departs from the port on average every
three minutes. At any one time, 700 ships are in port.
The port is a pioneer in using technology in virtually every aspect of its
operations. More than 200 computer and wireless transmission systems monitor
traffic, designate berths and loading and unloading times, deal with customs
and paperwork, and book bunkering fuel.
'If we hadn't developed our technology then Singapore would no longer be
competing as a major port,' says Eric Lui, deputy director of information
systems at the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), the government body that
runs the port. 'Technology is vital to combat our land and labour shortage
problems, to keep down costs and, most importantly, to improve port
efficiency.'
Recently, the PSA has been concentrating its technological efforts on a
computer system that plans and directs all of the port's container-handling
operations.
The computer integrated terminal operations system (Citos) controls
container movement from the freight forwarding agent to the hold of the
ship. First, the agent keys into a computer system called Portnet, which
gives sailing times of vessels, length of delivery and space available.
Then, the agent keys in container contents, weight of goods and the ship
required.
Using another system called Tradenet the agent can obtain electronic customs
approvals and clear other official documents. Through Citos, the agent is
given a time to deliver the container to the port.
About 6,000 trucks - known in port language as 'prime movers' - enter or
leave Singapore port every 24 hours. The gates are fully automated. The PSA
says the average clearance time is 45 seconds.
'We give the agents transponders, which are fitted to the top of the
containers,' says Lui. 'The trans-ponders are used to register arrival at
the gate and transmit messages to a central computer. Cameras at the gates
read the container numbers, the driver flashes his ID against a magnetic
screen and at the same time the container is weighed.'
In less than a minute, the driver receives a computer readout detailing
where he should wait for a crane to unload his container. At the same time,
the central computer is flashing messages to display screens watched by
crane operators and dockside prime mover drivers, telling them where and
when to pick up the container, which ship to load it on to, and in what
sequence containers should be loaded.
Singapore is at the centre of the world's fastest-growing economic region,
and container traffic through the port is expanding by about 20 per cent
each year.
Twenty years ago, Singapore was handling 130,000 TEUs (twenty foot
equivalent units - the standard container measure) every year. In 1992, it
handled 7.56m TEUs; the figure for 1993 is estimated at nearly 9m TEUs, with
a further rise forecast to 15m TEUs by the turn of the century when the
first phase of a port expansion plan is completed.
The port serves as a regional hub, with feeder services sending goods from
Indonesia, India or Thailand for loading onto bigger 'mother ships'. An
estimated 70 per cent of the port's traffic is based on such transshipment
activities.
The PSA claims that technology gives it the edge in many areas. Singapore
can have vessels in and out of port more quickly than elsewhere, and
officials say the port can turn around a ship carrying 1,000 TEUs in less
than 12 hours.
Singapore's technology also brings cost advantages, says Lui. 'Because of
our serious labour shortage problems, the cost of workers in Singapore is
considerably higher than in Hong Kong, which can draw on a plentiful labour
supply from China. Yet through using technology, we calculate that the costs
to the port user here are half those in Hong Kong.'
In spite of the big expansion in port traffic, the PSA has been reducing its
workforce and now has about 2,300 employed in port handling activities. Lui
says Hong Kong has about 6,000 workers - partly because it has separate
terminals and is not one unified port.
The PSA does face problems. Other ports in the region, such as Malaysia,
have big ambitions and can offer a cheaper service to shippers. Lui also
admits that technology cannot cope with everything: experts are still
wrestling with how to make full use of spare capacity on dockside prime
movers.
Nevertheless, Singapore seems confident about its future. The government
plans to partly privatise the port, probably this year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / People: Courtney to take the credit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Courtney, former finance director of Rank Organisation and The Boots
Company, has become non-executive chairman of Hull-based Cattle's Holdings,
one of the few quoted financial companies to specialise in weekly
home-collected credit.
Courtney, 61, takes over from Roy Waudby, 65, who has headed the company for
more than a decade and was on the board when founder Joseph Cattle floated
the company over 30 years ago.
Cattle's, like its bigger rival Provident Financial, has grown from being a
Northern check trading business involving thousands of agents who collect
weekly instalments from individual homes, into a consumer financial services
company. Since it bought Compass Credit from Standard Chartered three years
ago its shares have more than trebled and the company is now capitalised at
Pounds 190m.
Cattle's chief executive Eddie Cran, 42, who joined the group at the time of
the Compass acquisition, says he had wanted a non-executive chairman who was
a finance man. Courtney says he was attracted by the enthusiasm of Cran whom
he describes as 'quite a performer'.
Since resigning from Boots in April 1990, Courtney has spent a lot of his
time helping sort out Throgmorton Trust, an investment trust which lost its
way in the 1980s. He expects to go non-executive shortly.
Although Courtney, a Yorkshireman by birth, is rather coy about who put his
name forward for the Cattle's job, he seems to have found favour with the
Yorkshire business mafia. In June he was made non-executive chairman of the
Bradford-based Yorkshire Building Society.

previous role for London operations.
Richard Stone, the fourth candidate for the Coopers' chair, will not be part
of the team, but remains head of the firm's corporate finance practice.
Roger Davis, head of audit, accounting and advisory practice, is supported
by an executive partner, Ed Smith. Vic Luck replaces Malcolm Coster as head
of management consultancy. Peter Wyman becomes head of tax practice, with
Paul Boorman as his executive partner in charge of internal matters in the

FT  13 JAN 94 / People: Alan Yarrow moves up at KB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank which before Christmas failed to find an
external candidate to head the bank and promoted two existing staff to the
posts of joint chief executive of investment banking, has further
complicated the management structure by moving Alan Yarrow (right) to become
managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities.
The task of Sir Nicholas Redmayne, one of the two chief executives who was
previously md of the securities side, is now 'to look at the strategy side
outside of the day-to-day developments, leaving a gap on the securities side
into which I fit,' says Yarrow, who at 42 is 13 years Redmayne's junior.
However, David Clementi, the other chief executive, remains head of the
corporate finance department as well.
Yarrow contends that, despite the uncertainties over management direction
last year, KB has made considerable strides in integrating its services to
appeal to international clients, mustering 'a lot of the strengths that we
were too modest to shout about'. He also acknowledges that 'the (very
buoyant) markets have bailed us out to some extent'.
Yarrow joined Grieveson Grant in 1972, and was made a partner nine years
later. In 1989 he became head of institutional sales at KB, which had
acquired Grieveson in the mid 1980s, before being made head of global equity
sales and distribution last year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Software scheme may mean final goodbye to Mr
Chips - Plans for a 'community learning utility' taking multimedia into
Britain's classrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember Involve me and I learn
Benjamin Franklin's injunction was the tag for a lecture at the Royal
Society of Arts in London last night on the prospects for a 'community
learning utility' taking multimedia into classrooms across the country.
The idea behind the scheme is simple: establish a national, not-for-profit
utility with a bank of curriculum-related software, and deliver it to
participating schools and colleges on a pay-as-you-use basis.
The scheme is the brainchild of Alan Benjamin, a former director of
corporate communications at ICL, the UK computer comnpany owned by Japan's
Fujitsu, and a member of the board of the Docklands Development Corporation.
He has monitored the birth of community learning utilities (Clus) in the US.
Nine states now have a learning utility: the scope of their networks ranges
from a handful of schools in some states to around 50 in Florida, Utah and
Arizona.
Utah's utility dates back to the late 1980s. Within schools, local area
networks make it cheap to run programs from one 'server'; and free local
telecom calls give classroom communication at no extra charge.
'The concept of the learning utility is first and foremost an idea about how
to enrich and reconstruct education and empower educators,' said Benjamin.
'It is only secondly a technological system'.
He said there were already 6,500 educational software programs in the UK,
but 'the updating and enhancement of software is better organised and less
expensive to achieve at a central point than at many locations. The utility
will also be a source of user support and trouble shooting'.
A demonstration will take place in London at Southwark's South Bank
Technopark in March, with software and personnel from the US utilities.
Benjamin hopes it will prompt the establishment of the first community
utility in the UK, possibly this summer.
The vision is of classrooms equipped with up to 30 workstations connected to
a 'classroom storage level device', which would be used by the teacher to
put together appropriate material for lessons from the utility's resources.
Transmission could be at off-peak hours to cut telecom costs, with lesson
planning and research done in advance.
Who will pioneer the utilities, and how will they be financed? Benjamin
believes the pioneering role would be ideal for training and enterprise
councils, the local private-sector run bodies in England and Wales, which
are keen to become more than deliverers of statutory government training
programmes. 'A Tec could provide the standards, some of the programmes, the
training framework and some of the finance of the partnership.'
Schools would have to find much of the funding from their budgets, taking
advantage of their new financial autonomy.
Shortage of trained teachers is also a challenge. Benjamin envisages a new
career for 'educational technologists', with degree courses in the subject.
If Benjamin's Clus take off, Mr Chips and his blackboard could soon be
museum pieces.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Citizen brings simple colour to the home
computer market / A look at a new low-cost printer that is easy to use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Citizen, the Japanese watch and electronics equipment manufacturer,
yesterday announced the first colour computer printer designed to be sold in
volume through retail outlets to non-expert users.
The recommended UK retail price is Pounds 189, excluding VAT, but the street
price is expected to be closer to Pounds 129.
Edward Huggins, Citizen Europe's marketing director, says it was impossible
to produce an electromechanical printer at lower cost and make a
satisfactory profit.
The printer, the Citizen ABC, is designed as a simple-to-use first machine
for home users. It is based on 24-pin dot matrix technology, offers letter
quality fonts and prints text and graphics in colour.
Its chief advantage, according to Huggins, is the ease with which it can be
connected to a computer and set up for use by computing novices. Even
low-cost printers today are targeted chiefly at the business market, and
Huggins's words will strike a chord with anyone who has found themselves
unscrewing parts of their newly-purchased printer to flip mysterious
switches deep within its interior, or wrestling with printer driver
software.
The ABC printer does away with control panels; instructions for assembling
and connecting the equipment are supplied on a floppy disk that accompanies
the machine and there are only three control buttons. Citizen says the
average first-time user can be up and running within five minutes of opening
the box.
The machine has been designed for retail sales and Citizen has developed a
five-minute demonstration using CD-Rom to do away with the need for
dedicated sales staff.
The company claims to be the European leader in dot matrix printers offering
optional colour. The ABC is part of its strategy to dominate the low-price
end of the market. It also aims to extend the life of dot matrix technology,
which is fast giving way in business to laser jet and ink jet printing.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: Cadbury risks causing indigestion in
boardrooms - Michael Lawrence explains that the report's good intentions are
being translated too bureaucratically
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last year I made just two public speeches as chairman of the 100
Group of Finance Directors. Yet they have been referred to so often that
many might believe we had conducted a public campaign.
My statements reflected the increasing concern of our members, who are
mainly the finance directors of the FTSE-100 companies, at the direction of
the corporate governance debate and the development of financial reporting
in the UK.
My first speech was concerned with the way in which the Cadbury Report on
the financial aspects of corporate governance was being applied. To counter
some notable corporate failings, Cadbury was concerned with enhancing the
role of non-executive directors, and with higher disclosure standards in
reporting to shareholders.
It is not surprising that there were specific proposals requiring boards to
explain in more detail the internal controls in operation in companies and
to confirm they were 'going concerns'.
The basic thrust of Cadbury is to be commended. What is less useful is that
the committee, as a non-statutory or formally recognised enforcement agency,
had little ability to oversee the implementation of its proposals. It
vaguely left it to 'the accountancy profession and preparers of accounts' to
produce the necessary guidance, although there is no such recognised group.
Equally, a subject such as internal control involves considerations that are
much wider than Cadbury's original terms and in which the accountancy
profession is not readily recognised as having the relevant expertise.
Examples include the attitude of companies to environmental issues and the
control of waste output or of health and safety procedures.
What therefore started life with good intentions has been increasingly taken
over by self-appointed committees which have been able to operate without
adequate control or oversight. As members of all the committees, the 100
Group has been able to see at first hand the over-elaboration taking place,
and the lack of co-ordination - especially between the accounting and the
auditing guidelines.
In addition, because of the informal nature of the whole process, other
pressure groups and bodies began to suggest elaborations of Cadbury, such as
the definition of 'independent' as applied to non-executive directors.
All this has come at a time when boards were already having to grapple with
some fairly radical changes to financial reporting, such as revised
accounting standards, new disclosure formats, a more prescriptive approach
to interim reporting, and efforts by auditors to expand their role whilst
limiting their liability.
One of the reasons I believe that my speech on what I have called 'corporate
overload' attracts so much continuing comment is that it strikes a chord in
many boardrooms. It has been publicly supported by the Confederation of
British Industry, while the need for pacing change has been acknowledged by
government.
It has also been misrepresented in the press as an undue sensitivity by
finance directors to the challenge of future reform. Our basic criticism was
not the development of proper standards of corporate governance, but of
achievable implementation.
A major concern must be to question fundamentally whether the essentially
bureaucratic nature of the disclosure proposals, illustrated by the mountain
of committee and paper-work that is being produced in Cadbury's name, will
lead to the desired objective.
The problem is that sound companies will produce the information required in
a meaningful way but at quite a high cost in management time and audit fees,
whilst those which intend to abuse the system will not be deterred.
Substance has to be distinguished from form.
The required enforcers of the Cadbury recommendations, the London Stock
Exchange and the major investing institutions, have not been represented on
the committees devising the accounting and auditing guidelines being
produced. We believe that Cadbury could, and can, be discredited if the
proposals are not carefully considered and a substantial body of support
developed to forge the way ahead.
We are pleased with the response that we received to our concerns. Sir Ron
Dearing, the out-going chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, called
together those principally responsible for the disclosure proposals and has
sought to ensure that adequate consultation takes place before
implementation. We still believe that some real questioning of the
underlying value of the proposals needs to take place.
The 100 Group actively endorsed a proposed disclosure recommendation in
company annual reports: the operating and financial review. We believe that
more effective corporate governance will be achieved if the boards of listed
companies are required to produce a structured discussion of their financial
results, and of other matters such as Treasury operations.
A statement to shareholders covering financial matters generally, as
contrasted with specific statements on internal control and going concern
alone, seems to us to be a much more valuable approach. Although it may be
criticised as too imprecise, it gives a clear duty to the board to explain
results, and to highlight any areas of potential vulnerability for the
future.
The issue which our other main public statement addresses is the
inter-relationship of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the
International Accounting Standards Committee. A quarter of the FTSE-100
companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and are therefore
required to conform to Securities and Exchange Commission accounting and
disclosure requirements for foreign registrants.
Unless the UK accounting and securities bodies put their weight behind the
development of truly international standards, and we persuade the US
authorities to do likewise, then inevitably the corporate world will
eventually adopt US standards.
The need to gain access the US capital market is very important to large
companies, but we do not wish the potential competitive and cost
disadvantages of producing accounts in several different forms. Moreover, US
standards do not always cater for our different circumstances and, in any
event, are far from perfect as they reflect a substantial history of
American commercial and legal experience.
This issue may seem abstract, but it is likely to have some immediate
effects. For example, we have worked closely with the ASB over the last two
years to develop a sensible approach to accounting for goodwill.
Most large companies, particularly in the service industries, find neither
the immediate write-off of merger premiums nor the alternative of its
subsequent amortisation to be sensible proposals. Whilst they represent
current UK accounting practice, they do not produce balance sheets that
reflect economic reality and can impede takeovers that are otherwise
commercially sensible.
Amortisation produces a double charge against earnings as most companies
will spend money to maintain and enhance goodwill whilst writing it off.
Despite this, my view is that larger UK companies will not support the
alternative of 'ceiling tests' now being considered to avoid amortisation of
goodwill unless there is evidence that other countries will follow.
I believe that developing converging standards across boundaries will be a
major debate during 1994. In setting standards we need to consider the 'art
of the possible' and seek to achieve international consensus.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Car groups gamble on
playing the right card - Ford and GM's latest financial ventures may just be
the first step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE WORTHINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's launch of the Ford Barclaycard was a direct response to the
arrival of the GM Card from Vauxhall in October: both bear witness to the
fiercely competitive nature of the world car market. Overcapacity is forcing
manufacturers to concentrate on how to retain the loyalty of existing
customers, while seeking to add whatever incremental sales they can.
The initiatives are of interest beyond the car industry not least because
they offer contrasting perspectives on branding.
The Ford Barclaycard, for instance, brings together two of the best-known
brands in the UK. Ford is the market leader for new cars and its share of
the UK car registrations market was 21.7 per cent for the first 11 months of
1993. Similarly, Barclaycard is the market leader in the UK credit card
market with some 8.9m cards on issue out of a total of 27m bank and building
society credit cards in the country.
By contrast, the GM Card from Vauxhall, issued by HFC Bank, brings together
two lesser-known brands, one indeed largely unfamiliar to UK consumers.
General Motors' branding policy has run counter to Ford in that, outside the
US, it has employed sub-brands reflecting its approach to different markets.
Examples include Vauxhall in the UK, Opel in Germany and Holden in
Australia. To build upon the success of the card in the US, while trading on
the local brand, the GM Card from Vauxhall attempts to promote both brands,
as well as laying the groundwork for future ventures such as perhaps a GM
Card from Opel.
In the US, GM's card was issued by Household International, whose subsidiary
in the UK is known as HFC Bank. In spite of its 150 personal banking centres
HFC is not a well-known financial services brand, and hence most of the
advertising has prominently featured the GM brand and played down HFC's
involvement.
Of course, it could be argued that, in the GM and HFC case at least, both
partners know who is calling the shots and whose brand will prevail, while
for Ford and Barclaycard it is more a battle of the giants to see who gets
top billing. It could yet end in tears.
For both cards, heavy promotional activity is essential. If they do not get
their critical mass of cardholders in the first year, it is unlikely that
they will do so subsequently. Switching between credit card issuers is not
common among UK consumers, with most credit cards perceived as part of the
package of financial services that individuals take from their primary
account, be that a bank or building society. With 27m cards on issue already
and credit scoring procedures rigorous in the attempt to combat fraud, the
UK credit card market is already pretty saturated.
The GM Card is available from mid-January and the Ford Barclaycard from
April 1 1994. GM's target is thought to be at least half a million cards
while the Ford Barclaycard is designed to add a quarter of a million cards
to the existing portfolio.
Other car manufacturers - Audi, Peugeot Citroen and Rover, for instance -
are unlikely to allow these card schemes to take business from them, and
other goods and services suppliers may also enter the added-value credit
card market. There is only room in the market for limited numbers of
rebate-based credit cards, as the very fact that the rebates are based on
usage encourages the cardholder to concentrate spending on one card only.
How, then, will those who choose not to enter this market (or who fail in
their attempt) seek to compete with the rebates being built up by
cardholders seemingly loyal to their chosen credit card sponsor? Will any of
them be bold enough to follow the example of some of the grocery multiples
such as Tesco and accept for redemption the coupons (rebates) offered by
competitors?
In such a scenario, proof of rebate earned could be accepted in some
proportion by a competitor and used as a spoiling tactic against those
relying on card-based loyalty. Such tactics would, however, not necessarily
invalidate the strategy behind the new added-value credit cards.
What GM and Ford are doing is coming to terms with the three Rs of survival
in the 1990s: Retention of existing customers, Recruitment wherever possible
of new customers, and Relationship-building with all customers. The new
credit cards will aid retention and recruitment, but equally importantly
they provide the means to circumvent the independent dealer network and
hence build relationships between manufacturer and customer.
A credit card application is a perfect opportunity for the card sponsor to
understand more about the potential customer. to understand more about each
other. In addition, the car manufacturers will presumably want to go beyond
selling their products to financing the sale and supplying insurance and
warranty products.
In this way, not only are GM and Ford after the profitability that comes
from a credit card, but they are seeking to gain ground from the more
traditional financial institutions.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Show your customers
you care - Phone numbers on products not only deal with complaints, they can
build brand loyalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens when a damaging rumour about your product gains circulation?
Van den Berghs discovered the answer when an entirely false story appeared
on television, and then in a Jewish newspaper in the UK, that Flora, the
spread, contained pig fat.
Concerned consumers had an immediate way of checking the story: a customer
service telephone number, which had for some time been a standard feature on
Flora packs and which meant the company was easily contactable. As calls
flooded in, operators were able to reassure consumers that Flora is, indeed,
pig-fat free. The telephone number was seen as an important factor in
defusing the situation.
The Flora experience is recounted by Robert Leiderman, whose consultancy,
the L&amp;R group, guided Van den Berghs' implementation of its telephone
service in 1990. It was an early example in the UK of what has become known
as a 'careline' - the slightly twee term used to describe telephone lines
that offer consumers the chance to seek information, make suggestions or
complain about products.
Telephone numbers on product packs, or at the point where services are
delivered, are still relatively rare in the UK. By contrast, a recent L&amp;R
survey found that 83 per cent of branded goods carry a telephone number in
the US, where carelines have been operating for some years. In France the
figure is 30 per cent, in Germany 15 per cent, but in the UK just 8 per
cent.
The benefits of a careline do not just become obvious in a crisis, or when
dissatisfied customers need to let off steam, argues Leiderman. He sees
direct telephone contact with consumers as a valuable marketing tool,
building brand loyalty and boosting consumer confidence. The L&amp;R survey
found that manufacturers used the lines to build a customer profile and
assemble a database of regular users, as well as gauging reaction to new
products and collecting ideas.
Nor is application of the concept restricted to packaged goods. Burger King,
the Grand Metropolitan hamburger chain, displays its careline number on
posters in its restaurants, on receipts and on take-away bags. Comments from
consumers have led to the introduction of a breakfast menu, non-fizzy drinks
with children's meals, the continuation of a non-meat burger, and trials in
the sale of merchandising such as sweatshirts and baseball caps.
Before Burger King's careline was introduced customer complaints were
handled by letter in 'a very laborious, ineffective and costly manner',
Pauline Gallagher, the company's UK customer care manager, told a marketing
conference organised by IBC Financial Focus in London recently. Complaints
were not logged and ideas were lost. 'Our customers were talking - giving us
valuable information - but we were not listening,' she said.
Now, all information from calls is keyed into a computer and analysed.
Problems with suppliers can be pinpointed - indeed suppliers pay a nominal
amount towards the cost of dealing with calls where a quality problem has
led to complaints. The careline would also provide an early warning system
if the company was, for example, a victim of product tampering or poor
hygiene in one of its restaurants.
John Gardner, managing director of VG, the UK chain of over 600 independent
grocers, provides a rare example of a careline for own-label products.
For VG it is a way of inspiring trust and confidence in the company's
own-label range, as well as providing a channel for customer feedback.
Information from customers has helped in updating products by, for example,
eliminating some food additives.
As Gardner points out, 'carelines are not for the timid or faint-hearted', a
point reinforced by the experiences of Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, the
joint venture between Cadbury-Schweppes and Coca-Cola formed in 1987.
Steve Harris, head of Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages' quality assurance in
the UK, has seen the number of complaints from consumers double since 1992,
when a careline number started appearing on products as part of a Total
Quality programme. He is nevertheless philosophical: 'We are making it
easier for consumers to tell us if they are dissatisfied.'
Operators at Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes, who received three months' training
before the scheme started, take a total of about 5,000 calls a week on 10
telephone lines. About half of the calls are hoaxes or nuisance calls, many
from children.
Harris also warns that careline providers 'must be prepared for some very
nasty calls. There are some weird people out there and if you are on the
receiving end it can be very stressful'. Counsellors are brought in from
time to time to talk to the operators, says Harris.
Out of the genuine calls, 10 per cent are complaints and the rest are
enquiries about, for example, ingredients and calories contained in
products, or company facts and figures requested by school children or
students doing projects.
Summarising the benefits, Harris says the service helps build brand loyalty,
provides early warning of any product quality problem and could, in future,
be used to track promotions and chart levels of customer satisfaction.
However, not all of those introducing carelines have thought out their
strategies as thoroughly, and many are unable to evaluate the service they
provide, warns Robert Leiderman.
L&amp;R's survey found that declared objectives are not always carried through
in the operation of the lines. For example, while half of the careline
providers cited helping to build a database of regular users as a potential
benefit of the service, less than 15 per cent of US carelines ask for the
caller's name and address. In France the figure was 14 per cent, and none
bother in Germany. In the UK it was substantially higher at 45 per cent.
Carelines only work if objectives are clear and evaluation procedures are
laid down at the outset of the project. 'Some manufacturers are taking to
carelines as a 'follow the leader' reaction to what is happening in the
marketplace. The danger is that companies will venture into carelines
without the level of commitment required to make them work,' says Leiderman.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Drop in jobless beats forecasts: Government believes fall
shows success of labour market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
December's drop of almost 47,000 to 2,766,000 in the seasonally adjusted
jobless total was higher than even the most optimistic of forecasts; the
average expectation had been 20,000.
The drop was the ninth monthly fall in 1993, and the fourth consecutive
decrease. The November figure was also revised to show a larger fall -
39,000 compared with 36,000 - than had previously been announced. The
average decline in the three months to December is 46,000.
The unexpectedly speedy fall in unemployment appears to give weight to
government arguments that the labour market reforms of the 1980s have
encouraged employers to be more willing to take on new workers. Mr David
Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'The UK with its flexible, de-regulated
labour market is showing Europe that economic growth can feed through into
more jobs and falling unemployment.'
Many of the jobs being created are part-time, with Department of Employment
figures showing that the number of part-timers increased over the year to
September 1993, while those in full-time employment fell. The proportion of
the workforce in part-time employment in September 1993 was 28 per cent,
compared with 21 per cent in 1983.
After seasonal adjustments, 341,600 joined the unemployment count in
December, down from a revised 341,800 in November. The number of people who
left the register was 376,400, down from 377,200 in the previous month.
The encouraging trend in headline unemployment was backed up by other
encouraging jobs statistics. Figures for the total workforce in employment
in September were revised upwards by 5,000 to 25,005,000, representing a
third quarter rise of 91,000.
The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose by 4,500 last month to
145,400, on a seasonally adjusted basis, reaching the highest level since
October 1990. Vacancies have been rising by an average of 6,000 per month
over the last three months. New vacancies totalled 202,900, the highest
number for 3 1/2 years.
The service sector is still the main engine for job growth, with the
manufacturing sector shedding a further 7,000 jobs in November. However the
decline is slowing.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Truck sales set to surge again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK commercial vehicle industry has entered 1994 increasingly confident
that recovery from its steepest post-war recession is well under way.
This is despite a further market drop last year to one of the lowest levels
since records began, and an 11.29 per cent year-on-year fall in the small-
sales month of December. Registrations last month fell to 10,783 from a
year-ago 12,155. But that was regarded as a 'blip' not indicative of
underlying trends.
Industry leaders say the 2.5 per cent fall in total new commercial vehicle
registrations last year disguises strong second-half growth led by the heavy
trucks sector. Van sector recovery remains hesitant.
Truck registrations jumped by 15.78 per cent last year to 36,350. This was
from 31,398, the lowest level for the sector on record and less than half
peak levels reached in 1989. Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf
Trucks, said that registrations in last year's second half were 30 per cent
higher than in the same 1992 period.
Truck market leader Iveco Ford and Leyland Daf are therefore forecasting
further growth to up to 43,000 units this year. 'It could be even higher
depending on the actual rate of economic growth,' according to Mr Gill.
The collapse and rebirth of Leyland Daf truck and van operations at the
start of the year has led to Iveco Ford emerging as the clear truck market
leader, with a 22.34 per cent share of the market for trucks over 3.5 tonnes
last year. However, Leyland Daf has begun recovering ground and finished the
year some 6.5 percentage points behind.
The market share taken by imports rose sharply as a result of the temporary
market vacuum left by Leyland Daf, and the collapse of truck markets in
Continental Europe which led manufacturers to 'target' the UK. In unit terms
truck imports jumped by nearly one-half, with Scania of Sweden recording a
nearly 60 per cent sales jump.
In the panel vans sector, dominated by the Ford Transit, Leyland Daf Vans
has begun a recovery. Its market share plunged into single figures during
the receivership, but it recovered to take an 11.17 per cent share for the
year, reaching just over 18 per cent in December.

FT  13 JAN 94 / NatWest confirms 4,000 staff to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of the contraction in the financial services sector came
yesterday as National Westminster Bank confirmed that it expects to lose
about 4,000 jobs this year.
The bank's UK branch network will bear the brunt of the losses, with a
forecasted fall in staff numbers of 3,400. Other cuts will be in support
areas.
Unions expect further job losses to be announced today by other financial
institutions.
On Monday, Barclays announced 3,000 job losses during the next two years -
in a new round of staff cuts.
The Bifu banking union accused the banks of releasing details of their
job-cutting programmes ahead of expected announcements of large profits.
Mr Alan Ainsworth, Bifu assistant secretary, said: 'Big profits seem to be
no bar to cuts in staff, more branch closures and a worse service to the
customer.
'It seems that no matter what the question, NatWest's answer is always
another round of job cuts.' Mr Ainsworth blamed the cuts partly on a desire
among the banks to bring their cost-income ratios down to rates more
comparable with building societies.
NatWest Staff Association is hopeful that there need be no compulsory
redundancies in the branch network.
Mr Stuart Chandler, head of personnel at NatWest, yesterday said that the
bank was committed to reducing job numbers through natural wastage. He said
the use of technology had had an important impact on activities such as
traditional back office processing.
In 1993 4,000 job losses were announced - but only 3,000 jobs were cut. Only
270 of these were compulsory.
Mr Chandler also highlighted the 1,600 new jobs which NatWest plans to
create during the year, in activities such as NatWest Markets, where 200 UK
jobs will be created, and in card processing. NatWest employs about 92,000
staff.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Halifax finds increase in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices last year rose in every region of the UK except three, a survey
by Halifax building society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, indicated
yesterday.
The figures comparing the final three months of last year with the last
quarter of 1992 showed that prices rose across much of southern and eastern
England, some of the areas worst affected by the recession. Prices rose most
sharply last year in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The only regions where prices declined further were in greater London where
prices fell 0.6 per cent and the north of England where prices fell 0.1 per
cent. House prices in the West Midlands were static.
All other regions showed an increase in annual prices since the end of 1992
in spite of falls in many regions during the final three months of last
year, said the society.
Halifax said yesterday: 'Across the UK as a whole the picture is reasonably
flat with prices rising on average by 1.2 per cent between December 1992 and
December last year.' The society expects average prices to rise by 5 per
cent over the next 12 months.
It added that the gap between house prices in the north and south of the
country had narrowed considerably during the recession.
Prices in greater London were now only 1.4 times those in Yorkshire and
Humberside compared with 2.8 times in 1988, the building society added.
Meanwhile Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, said that
house prices in the final three months of last year were 2.9 per cent higher
than during the final quarter of 1992.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Rise in average earnings stays at 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying annual increase in average earnings remained at 3 per cent in
the year to November for the third successive month. But most analysts
believe pay awards have bottomed out and will start rising gradually in
1994.
The rates of earnings increase between manufacturing and services continued
to diverge in November, with manufacturing increases falling slightly to 4
per cent from 4.25 per cent in October, and the service-sector rise at 2.25
per cent.
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, said the
divergence was explained by the effects of the government-imposed squeeze on
public-sector pay, but also by the fact that most new jobs in the private
sector are low-paid and part-time.
The earnings figure, although more than twice the level of inflation, gives
no indication of an imminent increase in pay pressure, and the actual
increase in average earnings at 2.8 per cent was below the underlying rate.
However Mr David Walton, senior UK economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'We are
approaching the trough in average earnings growth. It is typical, as
unemployment starts to fall, to get some upward pressure on pay.'
The latest pay settlement report from the Industrial Relations Services pay
databank also predicts some upturn. The report said: 'As profit margins
become more buoyant during the upturn and employees find their disposable
income severely squeezed by higher taxes, significant pressure is likely to
be exerted to keep pay rises ahead of inflation.'
The IRS report found that the average settlement level in November was 2 per
cent for the fourth consecutive month. A quarter of pay deals in the three
months to November were worth less than 1.5 per cent.
However, some of the most recent pay deals do indicate a slight upward
shift. In the southern and south-eastern regions of the Road Haulage
Association, a pay award of about 3 per cent has been agreed from January
after a pay freeze the previous year. Sony Manufacturing has also increased
pay by 3 per cent.
The quite large discrepancy between the increase in average earnings at 3
per cent and the rise in average settlements at 2 per cent is explained
partly by overtime and bonuses. But pay analysts say the biggest factor is
the continuing decline in relatively low paid employment in manufacturing,
which pushes up the average level of earnings in most companies.

FT  13 JAN 94 / London's economy 'reviving steadily'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's economy is reviving steadily, with strong improvements in business
confidence and domestic and export trade, according to a report published
yesterday.
But the report suggests that the capital's problems are not over. According
to the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which interviewed 300 London
companies employing 250,000 people, jobs will continue to be shed in the
early part of this year, particularly in the service sector.
The survey, carried out in the fourth quarter of last year, found that
investment plans had been revised sharply upwards for the next 12 months
with a particular improvement in manufacturing exports.
The chamber says the survey has strengthened hopes for a sustained recovery
in the capital. It says London's financial services sector continued to
grow, with new jobs created.
Business confidence measured in terms of expected profits remains high for
service companies, with the second highest figure recorded since 1988.
Manufacturing shows a similar situation.
The chamber says that while the outlook for jobs remains uncertain, the
slowdown in redundancies has continued.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Government rules out early cut in base rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday ruled out an early cut in British bank base rates
from the 5.5 per cent level set just before the November 30 Budget.
Speaking after yesterday morning's monthly monetary discussions between the
Treasury and Bank of England, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary of the
Treasury, said there would be 'no change for the time being' in UK interest
rates.
In an interview with Channel Four's House to House programme, Mr Nelson said
the government was 'content with the present monetary stance'.
There had been a very significant cut in rates during the past year, he
said. That had been of great benefit to industry and would be of 'tremendous
benefit' in the next few months to people whose mortgage rates are changed
annually. The present level of interest rates was satisfactory in terms of
continuing to bear down on inflation. A rate cut was 'unlikely'.
Yesterday's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Eddie
George, the Bank governor, and their senior officials lasted less than an
hour. The Treasury's monthly monetary report, prepared for the discussions,
said the latest monthly indicators painted a picture of further economic
recovery and subdued inflation in Britain.
It also noted that inflation expectations had fallen since the December
report. UK producer price inflation remains low while short-term price
expectations as reported by the Confederation of British Industry are at
their lowest recorded level. However, the task of the chancellor and Bank
governor was to look into the future as well. Assessing the path of the
economy is more difficult because of the big tax increases planned for
April.
Officials at the Bank and the Treasury are concerned that the tax increases
due in April could put a break on economic growth.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Pounds 10m fire was 'waiting to happen'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fire which engulfed the Allied Colloids chemical plant at Low Moor,
Bradford, was 'waiting to happen,' a Health and Safety Executive official
said yesterday.
No-one died in the blaze in July 1992, but more than 30 people were taken to
hospital. The blaze cost the company at least Pounds 10m.
The fire could have been prevented if two incompatible chemicals, which
formed a highly flamable explosive mixture, had not been stored together,
the Health and Safety Executive said. 'This was a major fire which was
waiting to happen given the circumstances,' HSE area director Ms Norma
Collins said, launching a report on the blaze.
She said the company 'had stored incompatible chemical substances together,
chemicals which should never be stored together because of their dangerous
properties'.
She added: 'It is deplorable that the cause of the fire was well known
throughout the industry and there had been previous advice and guidance. The
company's management systems left a lot to be desired in relation to safe
operating procedures.
'We have to ensure that arrangements for dealing with emergencies of this
nature are adequate.'
The company said it had taken on board all the lessons and was implementing
safety procedures, and new warehouses were being built.
Allied Colloids was fined Pounds 100,000 and ordered to pay Pounds 62,000 in
costs at subsequent court hearings for breaching health and safety laws.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Labour left tries to oust Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour left wingers are targeting Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in
a re-emergence of the guerrilla war between the party's traditionalist and
modernising factions.
They want to see him replaced by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, who topped last year's shadow cabinet poll.
The first sign of this initiative to shift Mr Brown may come early next
month when a strong challenge to Mr Peter Mandelson, a key Brown ally, is
expected for the secretaryship of the party's backbench Treasury committee.
Some MPs say there has been a rush of colleagues signing up for membership
of this normally obscure body in order to qualify to vote in elections for
officers on February 1.
Internecine rivalry between traditionalists and modernisers has flared up
repeatedly under Mr John Smith's leadership, but it has been overshadowed by
the government's problems.
The Labour left suffered a big blow in November when Mr Peter Hain, MP for
Neath, south Wales, lost his position as Tribune Group secretary.
Mr Brown's star has waned markedly over the past year with Mr Tony Blair,
shadow home secretary, overtaking him as heir apparent to Mr Smith. His
showing in last year's elections for the National Executive Committee and
the shadow cabinet was down from a year earlier.
The left has little direct influence over the allocation of shadow cabinet
portfolios, which are in Mr Smith's gift. Nonetheless, a continued
deterioration in Mr Brown's performance in this year's polls would increase
pressure on the Labour leader to move his shadow chancellor.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Dearing rejects union claim about growth in workload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief national curriculum adviser,
yesterday rejected claims by a union leader that teachers' workloads would
be excessive if his curriculum report was implemented.
It was Sir Ron's most outspoken support so far for the government's attempts
to ensure that this year's national curriculum tests in England and Wales
take place. Last year, the three main teachers' unions boycotted them.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
yesterday called for this year's tests to be abandoned. He said: 'Sir Ron
tacitly admits that the workload remains excessive.'
Mr McAvoy claimed that Sir Ron's comment that he wanted to reduce
administrative work was 'a clear admission that the national tests as they
are now bring with them additional workload which Sir Ron wishes and intends
to remove'.
But Sir Ron's response to Mr McAvoy was 'No. Emphatically no. I don't agree
with that.'
Sir Ron, who was speaking at an educational technology conference, said his
comments had referred only to the 'tick-lists' which teachers must compile
as part of continuing assessment for the national curriculum, not to the
end-of-year tests.
He added: 'On the tests, I've already recommended a halving of their length.
I would say to Mr McAvoy, that in the view of Her Majesty's inspectors, who
are paid to give an independent view, the assessment arrangements of the
national curriculum have a vital role in raising expectations of teachers,
pupils and parents.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / BP to shut loss-making Welsh ethylene plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP is to shut its loss-making ethylene plant at Baglan Bay, West Glamorgan,
with the loss of 600 jobs. The cost will be included in an exceptional
charge of Pounds 200m in the group's fourth quarter results.
BP has lost 'tens of millions of pounds' in ethylene manufacture at Baglan
Bay in each of the last two years. It cut output by almost half last summer
but that was 'not sufficient', said Mr Stephen Pettit, chief executive of
BP's petrochemicals division.
Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, said the closure was
forced by overcapacity of the product and the European recession. Operations
to treat gasoline and make ethyl benzene will also close.
Of the jobs lost, 350 work for BP employees and 250 for contractors. The
plant, one of BP Chemicals' four main UK manufacturing sites, will still
employ 510 staff and contractors after the ethylene cracker shuts at the end
of March.
Baglan Bay's cracker was commissioned in 1972 and used to employ more than
2,000. It is still the second largest private-sector employer in West
Glamorgan, after British Steel.
Its closure comes against a background of chronic European over-capacity in
ethylene, which is used in the manufacture of plastics and solvents. A
Europe-wide plan to help companies cut at least 1.5m tonnes of capacity
foundered on December 17. Mr Pettit said the Baglan Bay plant, which has a
capacity of 335,000 tonnes a year, is too small and uses the expensive
naphtha technique for making ethylene.
It accounts for about one fifth of BP Chemicals' ethylene manufacturing
capacity. Production will be increased at BP's plant at Grangemouth, Fife.
The closure will take Pounds 17m a year out of the local economy which BP
has been spending on contracts and supplies. 'This is devastating news for
the area,' said Mr Norman Thomas, chairman of West Glamorgan's economic
development committee.
The 600 job cuts follow 200 other redundancies in West Glamorgan in the past
few weeks. In March, 370 jobs will go at JR Freeman, the Port Talbot cigar
manufacturers.
In recent years BP has contracted out services such as rigging, scaffolding
and insulation, and 250 out of 400 contracting jobs will be lost over the
next year. BP will spend Pounds 3m on a job creation programme.
The county council criticised the government for downgrading the region in
its review of assisted areas last summer.
Mr Vernon Davies, deputy leader, said: 'The difficulties that BP have been
facing are well documented and today's announcement should not have come as
a surprise. But last year's decision was still made, in spite of our
warnings, to reduce the assistance.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Court decision on Thorp today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenpeace, the pressure group, expects to be told in the High Court today
that it has won permission to seek judicial review of the government's
decision to grant a licence to the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing
plant at Sellafield.
Its application for a review will not be contested by British Nuclear Fuels,
the plant's owner, or by the government, BNF's shareholder.
The terms of the licence, announced by the government before Christmas, say
BNF can begin operating the plant from January 17. The 500-metre-long plant,
which is designed to extract re-usable uranium and plutonium from used
nuclear fuel, will then become radioactive.
Greenpeace said yesterday that if a review is granted, it will take place in
early February. It will not ask for a delay in Thorp's operation until after
a review. It says BNF will be occupied with preliminary tests until mid
February.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Chemicals jobs forecast to fall by 9,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 28bn-a-year UK chemicals industry will shed more than 9,000 jobs
during 1994 as companies struggle to compete with foreign suppliers,
according to forecasts from the Chemical Industries Association yesterday.
Output, investment and exports will nevertheless rise as the UK leads the
rest of Europe to recovery.
Productivity growth in the UK will be 'very positive', said the association.
It forecasts a 3 per cent jobs fall and a rise in output of 2.5 per cent.
An increasing proportion of production will be exported, and the trade
surplus is likely to rise from Pounds 3.8bn to 'over Pounds 4bn', said Mr
Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI and chairman of the association's
Economic Appraisal Committee.
The forecasts are strongly affected by trends in the pharmaceutical sector,
which accounts for 30 per cent of UK chemicals production.
Excluding pharmaceuticals, growth in chemicals production will rise from 1
per cent in 1993 to 2 per cent this year, said Mr Freeman.
The UK and France will be the only two large countries in western Europe
which will raise investment. UK investment will show a sharp turnaround from
1993, when it fell by 10 per cent, to register an increase of 5 per cent
this year.
However, the Continent will show a much sharper change in investment
strategy with, for example, western Germany improving from last year's 21
per cent cut in investment to a 2 per cent fall in 1994.
The figures were given at the annual business outlook conference held by the
association.
At the same conference, the association's director-general, Mr John Cox,
said that the successful implementation of the Uruguay round of Gatt talks
'should be worth an additional Pounds 1bn per annum for the chemical
industry by the end of the decade'.
However, Mr Clive Thompson, vice-president of operations and supply at Arco
Chemical Europe, warned that 'there are few bright signs of competitiveness
in the (European) chemicals industry'.
He said that although growth would probably return, it was unlikely to be
fast enough to sustain historic levels of research, development and capital
programmes.
Three sectors are forecast to remain under heavy pressure: organic chemicals
 -mostly petrochemicals - fibres and fertilisers.

FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Fishing fleet gets smaller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The size of the UK fishing fleet is dwindling, and scenes like the one above
at Newhaven, East Sussex, are becoming less common. Now the Sea Fish
Industry Authority, the statutory body which promotes the industry, is
saying that the country is losing its capacity to build and repair fishing
vessels, threatening the competitiveness of the fleet, Alison Maitland
writes.
It should be building three times more big fishing boats a year to prevent
the fleet ageing, the authority says in a report published today. But only
37 yards built fishing boats in 1992 compared with 68 in 1987.
Yards undertaking repairs fell by 12 per cent in the same period. Employment
in construction and repairs dropped by 37 per cent overall, while more than
half the workforce left the industry in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
'The trend is worrying because the UK fleet is, on average, already fairly
old and current rates of new building and withdrawals are not enough to stop
it ageing further,' said Mr Peter Chaplin, chief executive of the
Edinburgh-based authority. 'Unless we reverse the trend,' he added, 'our
fleet will continue to age at the same time as our European neighbours are
taking steps to modernise.'
The average age of boats over 10m is now 22 1/2 years, the report says.
Britain should be building about 76 boats of this size a year, while
withdrawing 190 old vessels a year to meet the 19 per cent reduction in
fleet capacity required under European Union rules. The report says that too
many boats under 10m are being built.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Future of Independent newspapers remains in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the future of Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent
and Independent on Sunday, last night appeared to be reaching a critical
stage - but the final outcome was far from clear.
An offer, at least in indicative terms, for just under 30 per cent of the
company has been received by Mr Ian Hay Davison, Newspaper Publishing
chairman, from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland.
At the same time, talks between a consortium of existing shareholders and
founders are continuing with three national newspaper groups including
Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph.
There is a widespread view at The Independent that Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
the principal founder of the paper, which has suffered a serious circulation
fall in recent months, is particularly keen to reach an agreement with MGN.
In this scenario, existing shareholders El Pais and La Repubblica of Spain
would increase their stake to 51 per cent, MGN would take 40 per cent. The
rest would be held by founders and staff with rumours of an indicative share
price of Pounds 2 - valuing the company at Pounds 40m.
It is believed however that MGN, which is interested in a stake in the
Independent, has not yet agreed anything, even in principle. The
left-of-centre newspaper group has not seen detailed financial figures for
Newspaper Publishing and has not yet submitted an indicative share offer
price.
If a Pounds 2 deal is done, a share price valuing the company at around half
last year's revenue of Pounds 81m could become controversial.
Some analysts suggest that, in spite of losing Pounds 486,000 last year,
Newspaper Publishing could still be worth considerably more than half its
annual revenues in a depressed year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Anger at delay for health debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government sparked pandemonium in the Commons last night by postponing a
Labour-led National Health Service debate, which was scheduled for today, in
order to make further progress on the non-domestic rating bill.
The move was announced by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader. It prompted
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, to accuse the government of
being 'gutless'. She said Mr Newton had not even bothered to offer any
justification for the decision.
Mr Newton said the government would introduce a timetable measure to ensure
the bill's remaining stages were dealt with today.
The move took the edge off Labour celebrations of its first success of the
year in its procedural 'trench warfare' campaign against the government.
Ministers had abandoned their original plans to rush through the bill, which
sets business rates for the coming financial year. Mr Jack Straw, shadow
environment secretary, described this retreat as 'extraordinary'.
The government secured a majority of 74 to defeat a Labour attempt to deny
the bill a second reading. The bill was given a second reading by a majority
of 187.

</HEADLINE>

The Labour party said yesterday that it had received leaked documents
showing that ministers planned to reduce airport security as part of their
drive to relax regulations which are a burden to business.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said he had received a
Department of Trade and Industry document which criticised the effect on the
aviation business of an 'overly belt-and-braces approach' by security staff.
DTI officials said Labour's claim was 'scaremongering'.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Headteachers 'snub inner cities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inner city secondary schools are having difficulty attracting headteachers,
a survey by Oxford Brookes University reveals today.
The finding adds to fears of an inner city 'cycle' of social deprivation and
demoralised teachers, raised by Ofsted, the education watchdog, in a report
published last year. Mr John Howson, the author of the Oxford Brookes
survey, said 25 per cent of headships advertised in England and Wales last
year had to be re-advertised. In Tower Hamlets, all nine vacancies had to be
readvertised.
Inner city schools also find it difficult to retain headteachers, according
to Oxford Brookes. Over the last 10 years, nine of the 12 inner London
boroughs have replaced more than 80 per cent of their secondary
headteachers, with Hackney replacing all of them.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of
Headteachers, said the results were not surprising. It demonstrated the
increased pressures on inner city schools since exam league tables and the
Ofsted inspection service had been introduced.

Five Labour party members face expulsion next week over claims that they
campaigned for rebel former MPs during the last general election.
The five lecturers and union officials, all from Coventry, will be
questioned over claims that they supported Mr Dave Nellist - the former
Coventry South East MP, who was expelled before the 1992 general election
for his alleged links with Militant - and Mr John Hughes, the former
Coventry North East MP, who was de-selected.
Both stood against the official Labour candidates.
The five have described the events leading up to their suspension as 'the
biggest purge of its type for decades'. A quarter of Coventry's membership
was suspended after the election and 127 members were investigated.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Labour urges stronger SIB role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night joined calls for the government to abandon self-regulation
in the financial services industry in favour of a system of direct
regulation by the Securities and Investments Board, David Owen writes.
In remarks released before last night's debate on insider dealing, Mr
Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, said the cost of continuing
with a flawed system could not be justified. Self-regulation was a burden on
the industry which had to be paid for by the public.
Mr Darling said the government's silence on the need for a regulatory
overhaul was 'astonishing'.
He said the 'revelation' that up to 500,000 people may have been mis-sold
personal pensions 'should have sent shock waves through the government'.
Effective regulation was not a burden - 'it should be welcomed as a way of
guaranteeing confidence on the part of the public, which would in turn allow
the industry to develop and expand'.
He added: 'What is needed is direct regulation by the SIB with
responsibility to parliament. There is no point in limping on with the
present system when it is increasingly obvious that it is only a matter of
time before a complete overhaul is needed.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Political Notebook: Back to the 'basics' drawing board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midsummer madness in January. That was the most optimistic gloss one cabinet
minister could put on the latest furore buffeting Mr John Major. Back to the
bad old days was the more realistic assessment of another colleague.
The odds are that if the government keeps its nerve, the present storm will
blow itself out eventually. But it could rage for some time yet.
A damaging auditor's report on the activities of Westminster City Council
will reinforce the impression that the Conservative party is frequently
indifferent to the traditional values it is now preaching. Downing Street
may well have underestimated the political fall-out.
Lord Howe's appearance yesterday at the Scott inquiry and Mr Major's
evidence to the same body next week will refocus media attention on
Whitehall's less-than-honest handling of arms sales to Iraq.
The tabloid press is determined to keep up the pressure on those ministers
and Tory MPs who, like many of us, have the odd skeleton in the cupboard.
The prime minister may insist that he is not in the business of witch-hunts
 -but witch-hunts sell newspapers.
However absurd have been some (but not all) of the revelations of the past
few days, few in the government doubt the cumulative damage inflicted on Mr
Major. Downing Street has exercised little or no control over events.
No-one, it seems, knows how to run a damage-limitation operation.
So even in the minds of his friends Mr Major emerges once again as an
irresolute leader, a victim rather than a master of events. The old cliche
that the prime minister is 'on probation' has resurfaced in the bars of
Westminster.
His cabinet colleagues have not won any prizes either.
Like the rent-a-quotes on the backbenches, ministers have clamoured for
spots on radio and television to offer their personal and differing
interpretations of what Mr Major means by 'back to basics'.
And for all the prime minister's insistence that his campaign is about
education, law and order and the economy rather than sexual behaviour, the
friends in the cabinet of the moral majority have made the most noise. But
the buck stops at No 10. If his cabinet is undisciplined, it is the prime
minister's job to restore order. He cannot ignore the need for his ministers
to speak with one voice. Nor can he avoid a more detailed explanation of the
moral dimensions of 'back to basics'.
That in itself should not be difficult. Cabinet ministers are at last using
'line-to-take' notes to ensure that they say roughly the same thing when
explaining the policy.
The note omits any detailed exposition of the stance ministers should adopt
towards adultery. But it does not take much imagination to explain that
distinguishing between right and wrong stretches some way beyond the sexual
behaviour of MPs. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is expected to do
the job in a speech tomorrow.
Mr Major's problem, though, is one of credibility. Sections of the
Conservative press have decided that whatever he does or says, he is not up
to his job. His enemies on the Tory backbenches speak of him with contempt.
There is an air of resignation in the defences offered by his friends.
The opinion polls reinforce the gloom. Even before the latest furore the
Conservatives' standing was consistently below 30 per cent and Mr Major's
own rating the worst of any post-war prime minister.
The fragile reawakening of self-confidence apparent in the closing weeks of
last year has been stifled. The current unease could be turned to panic by
tax rises in April followed by dismal Conservative performances in the local
and European elections.
Some on the backbenches are already saying that if the government's share of
the vote does not climb above 30 per cent then the prime minister must pack
his bags.
Mr Major cannot be written off. The economy is on his side at last. That
counts. If he can restore a grip, the appeal of 'back to basics' might yet
confound the cynicism of the metropolitan intelligentsia. He is a more
resilient politician than his critics allow.
Most of the bookmakers think it is even money that Mr Major will lead the
Conservatives into the next general election. One or two think his chances
are slightly worse. As of now, most of his colleagues are not offering much
better odds.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Aslef wins 30% pay rise for Channel train drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British train drivers who operate Channel tunnel services are to receive pay
rises of about 30 per cent.
Their union, Aslef, sees the deal as a model for agreements with new train
operating companies after rail privatisation begins on April 1.
Average annual salaries will rise to Pounds 25,000 under flexi-ble
agreements based on performance-related pay reached by Aslef with
Railfreight Distribution and European Passenger Services, which are
subsidiaries of British Rail. Basic pay for the 55 drivers will be Pounds
20,800 a year.
The drivers will be moving an estimated 30m passengers and 15m tons of
freight a year through the tunnel in 18-coach trains. About 40 trains an
hour will use the tunnel, rising to a maximum of 60.
'We are going to negotiate the best deals we can for our members and ensure
their terms and conditions are protected,' Mr Lew Adams, the new general
secretary of Aslef, said yesterday.
The drivers involved will have to speak some French and operate three
rulebooks. More than 600 from all over Britain have applied for the jobs -
the drivers will be the best paid in the industry, and get more than their
French colleagues.
In return for substantially higher earnings and as generous sick pay and
holidays, the drivers will have to work more flexibly with no restrictive
practices or overtime.
Hours are to be calculated on an annual rather than a weekly basis to fit
new working patterns. The drivers will work a basic 1,700 hours a year, and
a further 200 at management's discretion. Working rosters will vary between
six and 11 hours a day.
Mr Adams stressed that his union was still opposed to BR privatisation, but
had 'no alternative but to meet the new owners and managers of the train
operating companies'. He added: 'They will seek to maximise their position
but this must not be to the detriment of our conditions.'
Traditionally known for its obstructiveness, the union under Mr Adams is in
the mood to co-operate with innovation in return for higher pay.
'We are not going to stick our heads in the sand and then get a kick up the
backside,' said Mr Adams. 'We are a modern union preparing for the next
century.
'Though we are not a push-over, we are prepared to get results. That is the
way to do business. When our union was formed in 1880 we had to deal with
123 separate rail companies, so having to cope with 41 will be no problem.'
BR has written to all the rail unions to tell them national pay bargaining
will end with privatisation. Aslef's leaders believe they will be able to
negotiate attractive deals at depot level.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Anger over curb on council report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday blamed the decision not to publish a report into
alleged electoral manipulation by Conservative-controlled Westminster City
Council on 'bullying' by lawyers acting for Dame Shirley Porter, the
council's former leader.
The government yesterday rejected Labour's calls for publication of the
report. Mr John Magill, the district auditor, announced earlier this week
that his full report, due for release today, would not be published 'for
legal reasons'.
Circulation will be restricted to 12 ratepayers who triggered the inquiry
and about 30 respondents. Other interested parties will receive asummary.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour environment spokesman, contrasted the suppression with
the full publication of district auditors' reports into alleged misuse of
funds by Labour-controlled councils.
Mr Straw said the government should table the report in the Commons to allow
discussion and comment under the protection of parliamentary privilege.
Mr David Curry, local government minister, said publication by the
government would be a misuse of ministerial powers which would amount to
putting pressure on the auditor.
The government is braced for bad news from the report, which will focus on
allegations that the council sold flats in marginal wards to Tory supporters
for political reasons.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Duncan 'ducks' Commons probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Duncan, the Conser-vative MP under attack over his purchase of a
former council house, was said to have decided to 'duck and run' when the
issue was raised in the Commons last night.
Mr Duncan resigned last week as a minister's parliamentary assistant after
the disclosure that he had lent money to a neighbour, Mr Harry Ball-Wilson,
to buy his house from Westminster City Council at a discount, and that Mr
Duncan had then bought the house from him.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday expressed
'astonishment' that Mr Duncan, MP for Rutland and Melton, was not in his
place in the Commons, although he had been given notice that the matter was
to be raised. Mr Straw questioned whether it had been right for the
council's 'subsidy' to have been passed on to Mr Duncan when he acquired the
property.
The answer, he said, was dependent on the circumstances in which Mr Duncan
agreed to lend Mr Ball-Wilson, the statutory purchaser, most of the purchase
price.
He also called for an inquiry to establish whether the property should have
been subject to business rates because it had been used as campaign
headquarters for Mr John Major in the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.
Westminster City Council is 'seeking an informal interview' with Mr Duncan
to clarify allegations that he had been using one of his two houses in
Gayfere Street, Westminster, for business purposes. 'If there has been a
material change of use (from domestic to business premises) then we would
want to investigate,' it said.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Liability hampers coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospective purchasers of coal mines are warning the government that
privatisation of the industry is being severely hampered by requirements
that the new owners of mines must take on historic liabilities for
subsidence.
The liabilities could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. In 1992-93
alone British Coal paid Pounds 46m for subsidence damage.
Potential purchasers say that past liabilities may outweigh the likely
business benefits of mining coal in some of the five areas for sale.
The liabilities issue is adding to the problems of a difficult
privatisation, with large companies such as Hanson and RTZ showing scant
interest, and smaller companies that are considering bids warning that there
are limits to what they can offer for a business with an uncertain future.
Potential buyers are pushing for a redrafting of the coal industry bill. It
is likely to get a second reading soon in readiness for royal assent in
July.
Prospective purchasers argue that the liabilities should be taken on by the
Coal Authority which will be established to license pits and supervise the
industry.
The coal industry bill introduces the concept of an area of responsibility
through which the 'responsible' party will be either the holder of the
licence to mine if it occurs in his or her area of responsibility or, in all
other cases, the Coal Authority. Prospective buyers are concerned about the
definition of the word 'area'.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that requiring coal
operators to assume responsibility for all subsidence liabilities would
simplify the process for people claiming for damages against subsidence.

The liabilities could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. In 1992-93
alone British Coal paid Pounds 46m for subsidence damage.
Potential purchasers say that past liabilities may outweigh the likely

requirements remain intact.
The liabilities issue is adding to the problems of a difficult
privatisation, with large companies such as Hanson and RTZ showing scant
interest, and smaller companies that are considering bids warning that there
are limits to what they can offer for a business with an uncertain future.
Potential buyers are pushing for a redrafting of the coal industry bill
which spells out that the new owners will assume liabilities irrespective of
when the damage was caused.
The bill is likely to be given a second reading within the next month and
possibly early next week in readiness for royal assent in July.
Prospective purchasers argue that the liabilities should be taken on by the
Coal Authority which will be established to license pits and supervise the
industry.
The coal industry bill introduces the concept of an area of responsibility
through which the 'responsible' party will be either the holder of the
licence to mine if it occurs in his or her area of responsibility or, in all
other cases, the Coal Authority. Prospective buyers are concerned about the
definition of the word 'area'.
The liability also extends to water pollution which can become problematic
after a mine is closed. Similar rules apply, although they appear to be less
clear-cut than those applying to subsidence.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that requiring coal
operators to assume responsibility for all subsidence liabilities would
simplify the process for people claiming for damages against subsidence.
Although the Labour party may baulk at taking up a cause aimed at easing the
privatisation the government will come under pressure from its backbenchers
to re-assess its stance.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Howe weighs in against Scott on side of the mandarins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Howe's attack on the handling of the arms-to-Iraq inquiry was being
interpreted last night as part of a growing Whitehall whispering campaign
against the inquiry's chairman, Lord Justice Scott.
A leading administrative and constitutional lawyer said the former foreign
secretary was repeating views expressed recently by civil service mandarins
unhappy with the way they were treated by the judge and the inquiry's
counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale QC.
There was some sympathy from lawyers for the view that the rights of
witnesses before such inquiries are not properly safeguarded.
They pointed out that if the government had chosen to set up a statutory
inquiry giving witnesses the right to be represented by counsel and to
cross-examine other witnesses, the process would have become much more like
a trial. 'The questioning would have been much more searching and the
procedure much more adversarial,' said one QC. 'There's no saying they
(civil servants) would have liked such an inquiry any better.'
The government had rejected the option of a statutory inquiry in favour of
the informal procedure used by Lord Justice Scott, so it was ironic that
civil servants and ex-ministers were now complaining about their treatment,
he added. Businessmen had been making similar complaints about Department of
Trade and Industry inquiries for many years.
The Fayed brothers have lodged a complaint against Britain at the European
Commission on Human Rights alleging they were effectively found guilty of
crimes by the DTI inspectors' report on the 1985 takeover of House of Fraser
stores group without having had the right to a fair trial.
'The fault lies with successive governments for failing to establish due
process for tribunals of inquiry,' the QC said. 'Ministers and ex-ministers
are now getting a taste of their own medicine.'
Given that the government specifically rejected a statutory inquiry, Lord
Howe's remarks were wide of the mark, other lawyers said. The procedure
under which the Scott inquiry was set up gives the judge wide discretion as
to the way he conducts proceedings.
'It's not a requirement of administrative law that witnesses should be
represented by lawyers.' said Mr David Pannick QC.
'The only obligation of natural justice placed on chairmen of such inquiries
was to act fairly,' he added.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Brandreth business details demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday tabled a parliamentary question seeking details of the
liquidation of Unicorn Heritage, a tourism company formerly run by Mr Gyles
Brandreth, Conservative MP for Chester.
Mr Tom Pendry, shadow tourism minister, said he was 'determined to get to
the bottom' of the 1990 liquidation of Unicorn, which led the Treasury to
write-off a Pounds 200,000 English Tourist Board grant.
Mr Brandreth, who denies any impropriety, has rejected calls for his
resignation as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Brandreth said he was considering legal action over reports of the
collapse of Unicorn Heritage. His refusal to quit was supported by Downing
Street, which said the decision to write off the grant was taken by the
Treasury in line with a recommendation from the National Heritage
Department, which is responsible for the tourist board.
A senior government official said the decision was taken after consultation
with Cork Gully, the liquidator, which said there was no possibility that
the grant could be repaid.
Downing Street stressed that both the initial recommendation and the
decision to write off the grant were taken by officials without the
involvement of ministers.
Mr Pendry has tabled a question to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage
secretary. He said: 'His department is responsible for the English Tourist
Board, and if there has been any impropriety then they will have to face the
music as well.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Cazenove man to head exchange: New chairman says market has
'no divine right to exist'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at stockbrokers Cazenove, and
newly-appointed chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has identified
competition as the main challenge facing the City's central marketplace.
'The main challenge is the competitive element,' he said. 'We are all quite
clear that, politically, competition is the name of the game and I have no
quarrel with that as long as it is fair competition.'
The stock exchange yesterday confirmed that Mr Kemp-Welch will become its
chairman on July 14, following the retirement of Sir Andrew Hugh Smith.
The exchange faces potential competition from companies such as Tradepoint,
set up by a group of former exchange employees, and Reuters Instinet, which
has already gained about 1 per cent of the business formerly transacted on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Unlike the exchange, they are not registered investment exchanges and, as
designated service providers, are subject to less rigorous regulation.
'The stock exchange has no divine right to exist,' Mr Kemp-Welch said. 'It
will only be dominant if it is efficient and cost effective.'
He said that the exchange had much to learn from the US-based Nasdaq, which
has become the world's second most active exchange after only 20 years. 'The
lesson of Nasdaq is what can be achieved from a standing start if you can
provide that efficient, cheap marketplace,' he said.
Mr Kemp-Welch declined to elaborate on any plans to further reduce costs at
the exchange and said that Sir Andrew deserved 'full marks' for having
already achieved significant cost reductions. 'But there is always scope for
further curbing costs,' he said.
He said that another major task would be to ensure that the exchange's Seaq
International system for trading international securities maintained its
role as the dominant exchange for cross-border investment activities.
He said that bringing Seaq into line with new European Union rules would be
an important task.
Mr Kemp-Welch will retire from Cazenove at the end of April. In addition to
his role at Cazenove, he has been a non-executive director of the exchange
and of several other companies including Savoy Hotel.
He will become part of the new senior management team with Mr Michael
Lawrence, the finance director of Prudential, who becomes chief executive on
February 1.
'In an ideal world, the job will require one half-day each week. I will give
it as much time as it needs,' Mr Kemp-Welch said. 'That could turn out to be
a six or seven day a week job, but not all of every day.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Transatlantic group wins contract to run Doncaster prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fourth company entered Britain's expanding prison services market
yesterday when Premier Prison Services (PPS) was awarded the contract to
manage the new Doncaster jail.
PPS is a joint venture between Serco, a British facilities management
company, and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a US private prison operator
and part of the Wackenhut security group.
Doncaster, the first new town-centre prison built this century, will open by
July and PPS's five-year management contract is worth Pounds 66m. It will be
the most complex prison yet run by the private sector, with convicted and
remand prisoners, young offenders and category A high-security cases among
its 771 inmates.
PPS intends to bring a range of US-style, high-technology security
techniques to its management. Electronic systems will be used to monitor
prisoners, seal off sections of the building in the event of disturbances,
and check on visitors.
The systems will help the company maintain tight staffing levels,
particularly in support services, and its successful bid is based on a
weekly cost per prisoner place of Pounds 295 - low by all standards. The
cost at the new privately managed Blakenhurst prison in Hereford and
Worcester is Pounds 310, one of the lowest.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, said the PPS bid
combined security with positive prisoner programmes. The company intends to
provide 12 hours of purposeful activity for prisoners daily and introduce
anti-bullying initiatives.
Doncaster's governor will be Mr Kevin Rogers, who joined the prison service
as an officer in 1964. He was until recently head of custody at Parkhurst
prison on the Isle of Wight.
PPS joins Group 4, Securicor and UK Detention Services - a consortium of
John Mowlem, Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and Corrections Corporation of
America - in the prison management and escort services market.
Serco provides management of support services to industry and government
agencies including the Royal Aerospace Establishment, Fylingdales ballistic
missile early warning station in North Yorkshire and the National Health
Service.
Wackenhut operates as a security company in about 40 countries and its
wholly owned subsidiary Wackenhut Corrections Corporation manages prisons in
the US and Australia.
The new Doncaster prison will have about 350 staff and PPS plans a
recruitment job fair in the town.
Dr George Gray, chairman of Serco and of PPS, said industrial relations at
Doncaster were likely to be modelled on the Serco pattern. The company
managed a number of sensitive activities and had lost no time through
industrial disputes. He expected a staff council to be established to
represent employees.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Gold bars out - but turkeys stay in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold bars may be out, but paying employees in antiques and turkeys remains
an option for companies attempting to minimise employees' tax bills, a
leading firm of accountants said yesterday.
Ms Leslie Ferrar, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said draft
legislation in the finance bill issued this week had failed to clamp down as
far as many practitioners had feared.
Only employees who receive assets that are capable of being sold on a
recognised investment exchange or are provided in a way that they are
convertible into cash are covered. Rules for other payments, which commonly
include Christmas gifts to employees and incentives to sales staff such as
televisions and food hampers, are not covered by the bill.
The effect will be to allow payments on many in-kind payments to remain
untaxed until the next return is filed, rather than become subject
immediately to pay-as-you-earn.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Lloyd's offer is rejected by Merrett Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of nearly 2,000 loss-making Merrett Names at Lloyd's yesterday said
they were unable to accept a settlement offer designed to bring an end to
legal action involving 17,000 of the individual members whose capital
supports the insurance market.
The Merrett Names, whose losses relate to the 1985 underwriting year, are
one of the three biggest groups of lossmakers at the market, which has been
rocked by losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.
Two other groups - the Gooda Walker and Feltrim Names - will meet next week
to discuss their position on the offer, which Names must decide to accept or
reject by February 14.
Mr John Mays, deputy chairman of the Merrett Names' Association, described
the settlement document as 'one-sided' and the offer a 'small pittance'. He
said the group would continue its legal fight 'both for justice and to
change the culture of Lloyd's'.
Names wishing to accept the deal must resign from the association.
The settlement, which was announced last month, offers Merrett Names only
Pounds 44.07m in compensation while losses incurred to date exceed Pounds
135m.
The association expects losses eventually to reach Pounds 765.06m and said
the deal was worth less than 6p in the pound to its members.
Merrett syndicate 418, which has now ceased to underwrite, is unable to
close its accounts for the 1985 year because of uncertainty over the scale
of liability claims, many of which are from US asbestosis and pollution
cases.
Mr Ken Lavery, chairman, told an association meeting that 673 of the 925
Merrett Names, responding to a survey conducted by the association, would
either reject or were inclined to reject the settlement offer.
He added that only 164 of those replying leaned towards an acceptance of the
Lloyd's deal.
However, opinion at yesterday's meeting, which was attended by more than 300
Names, appeared to be more balanced. In a short debate four Names spoke in
favour of the settlement compared with two against.
Following angry scenes at the meeting, the association's leaders said they
were unlikely to insist on a rule requiring resigning members to pay to the
association a fee equivalent to 6 per cent of their 'line' - the amount of
premiums they underwrote - on syndicate 418.
Mr Charles Baron, a committee member, said: 'This meeting has shown how
divided we all are. Whatever the figures are that have been mentioned here,
I can't see myself sending you a writ to collect it.'
The group's legal action against agents and auditors is expected to come to
court early next year.
Separately, Merrett Names were urged to lend their support to a call by
action group leaders to hold a further extraordinary general meeting aimed
at overturning changes to Lloyd's voting rules which were introduced last
month.
Lloyd's wants to move from a one-member-one-vote system towards one in which
voting power would be proportionate to the amount of capital Names' commit.
The action groups claim the rules will give Names active in 1994 - including
new corporate members - power to call levies on individual Names in relation
to losses incurred in 1993 and prior years.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Staff at LWT to collect shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff at London Weekend Television, the ITV company in the throes of a
hostile takeover bid from Granada, are finally to benefit from a management
share scheme that made millionaires out of the top group of LWT executives.
All 640 full-time and contract staff employed on November 1 1991 and still
with the company, will be told tomorrow that they will collectively receive
shares worth around Pounds 2m.
Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of LWT and a multi-millionaire as a result of
the management share scheme, wrote to the other 52 beneficiaries in
September seeking voluntary contributions.
The members of the scheme, who collectively put up Pounds 3m to buy
management shares as a result of a restructuring, were asked to donate
between 5p and 14p a share, depending on the size of their stakes. It is
believed that all members of LWT management agreed to make a donation for
the rest of the staff.
There have been delays created by negotiations with the Inland Revenue over
tax arrangements covering the share issue.
At one stage it was being suggested that staff would be taxed on the shares,
although the managers had already paid tax.
It has now been agreed that the staff will not have to pay tax on the shares
as long as they hold them for five years.
The deal could end a feeling of bitterness at the ITV company between staff
and management.
More than 550 staff have signed a petition calling for a proportion of the
profits from the share scheme to go to them.

Mexican official mediators and peasant rebels last night were about to begin
talks to end a 12-day-old uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the
government news agency Notimex said. It reported that the two sides would
start talks 'very probably in the next few hours'.
This arose after a government envoy, Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, had met Roman
Catholic leaders from southern Mexico.
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday ordered an immediate unilateral
ceasefire in the conflict areas in the southern state of Chiapas. He did so
after the army had claimed to have regained control of the former rebel
strongholds. Mr Salinas offered an amnesty to rebels who had acted under
duress or from desperation, and who now accept peace.
He hoped the decision would be 'the first step to save lives and find new
ways of conciliation'. He indicated that the government would respond to the
social demands of the local population.
The rebellion in Chiapas by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, which
began on January 1, has already cost more than 100 lives.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Killing dents hopes of left in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-wing politician who leads the opinion
polls for Brazil's presidential election, due in November, is facing his
first test in what threatens to be a dirty campaign, following the death
last week of a Sao Paulo union leader.
Mr Osvaldo Cruz Junior was shot four times in the back by a colleague in
what seemed to be a personal argument about a plan by Mr Cruz to scale back
the unions. But right-wing politicians and Brazil's media, largely
controlled by figures of the centre and the right, have alleged a political
motive for the killing and are using it to attack Mr da Silva, known
popularly as Lula.
The allegations stem from criticisms by Mr Cruz in November last of Brazil's
largest union grouping, the CUT, which is the main backer of Lula's Workers
Party (PT).
Mr Cruz had claimed that CUT unions gave financial and other support to
Lula's 1989 presidential campaign and to PT candidates in local elections in
1992. At the time, such support was illegal, but widely practised. Mr Cruz
provided no proof and his allegations were strongly denied by the PT.
Lula's opponents alleged Mr Cruz was killed to stop him making more damaging
revelations about links between the CUT and the PT. TV Globo, the country's
most popular television network, has changed its policy of ignoring Lula -
despite his strong lead in the polls - and has focused on the case in detail
his week.
The right-wing Senator Espiridiao Amin, from the southern state of Santa
Catarina, has used the controversy to call again for a special Congressional
inquiry into the CUT and its funding. Such a probe, blocked because of its
political sensitivity, now looks likely to go ahead, possibly this week.
Mr Amin, like the mayor of Sao Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf, is a member of the
Progress and Reform Party. The mayor, with 12 per cent in the presidential
polls, is the closest rival to Lula, who had about 30 per cent just before
Christmas.
An inquiry could be embarrassing for Lula and the PT. It is expected to last
six months and would coincide with the official start of the presidential
campaign in June. An investigation could also end the PT's so-called
'monoply of morality', which it has enjoyed since corruption allegations
started to taint other Brazilian political parties last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation by government auditors has uncovered cases of gross
maladministration and possible corruption at Argentina's Health and Social
Action Ministry.
The Auditor General's office has found that some 40-50 per cent of the
ministry's Dollars 957.3m (Pounds 651m) 1993 budget was not spent. Some
2,000 authorisations for cash payments are missing.
More than 80 per cent of the budget for the elderly had not been spent. Mr
Alberto Mazza, health and social action minister, rejected the findings,
saying they only covered the January-October period.
The auditor's investigation, leaked to the media yesterday, coincides with
demands that the government improve its chaotic social policies at a time
when unemployment and social tension are rising as a result of its economic
reforms.
The government's social services budget rose 4 per cent this year to Dollars
25.63bn, but execution of spending programmes is widely agreed to be
disorganised and wasteful.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the powerful economy minister, now seems intent on using
disarray at the Health and Social Action Ministry to extend his control over
social policy. As local governments now carried out most social spending, he
would set up a 'system of punishment and rewards. Those working well would
be given more federal resources.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Democrats join come-clean calls: White House fears of an
erosion of credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While President Bill Clinton has been quaffing Pilsner with Czech President
Vaclav Havel in Europe, controversy over his investments in Arkansas in the
1980s has continued to ferment, threatening to damage his credit with the US
public.
The controversy is over whether a bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan
organisation used its funds to prop up Mr and Mrs Clinton's investments in
an Ozark mountain property venture known as Whitewater or to pay Mr
Clinton's campaign debts from his 1984 race for the state governorship.
Mr and Mrs Clinton made the Dollars 68,900 investment in 1978, in
partnership with Mr James McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas
savings and loan entity. The Clintons say they lost all their money.
Republican critics want an investigation of whether Mr Clinton as governor
intervened to delay the shutdown of Madison, which failed in 1989 at a cost
to taxpayers of around Dollars 50m. They also want to examine suggestions
that Madison money was improperly channelled to Whitewater and to Mr
Clinton's 1984 campaign fund.
Mr McDougal denies that the Clintons benefited in any way from his handling
of Madison, and notes that he was acquitted in 1990 of fraud charges brought
by a Republican-appointed prosecutor.
Adding to interest in the case, the Clintons' Whitewater files were handled
by Mr Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide
last year.
Despite the intense Republican pressure, neither the Whitewater controversy
nor allegations last month by two Arkansas state troopers about Mr Clinton's
sex life as governor appear to have damaged his popularity.
A Washington Post-ABC poll published yesterday showed that 59 per cent of
those questioned approved of the job Mr Clinton is doing as president, with
36 per cent disapproving - a rather better rating than the same survey's
finding in December, before both sets of allegations boiled over.
Another poll published by USA Today and CNN showed Mr Clinton's approval
rating holding steady at 54 per cent, and 72 per cent said Whitewater had
had no effect on their opinion.
Nevertheless, White House advisers fear a steady erosion of Mr Clinton's
credibility, with both polls showing a decline in the number of people
believing in his honesty and integrity.
The White House strategy for dealing with the Whitewater charges, which were
also raised during the 1992 presidential election campaign, had been to
stonewall. As Mr Clinton put it: 'I didn't do anything wrong. I made an
investment and lost money. I then spent more money to document that we'd
lost money. All the federal investigators in the world that have looked into
this, not a single soul has alleged that I've done anything wrong.'
The White House and attorney-general Janet Reno had tried to deflect calls
for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter, arguing
that anyone she named would be viewed as no more independent from her than
the career justice department official now in charge of the investigation.
But the move became inevitable after nine Democratic senators joined a
chorus of Republicans in urging the president to ask for a special counsel.
Mr Clinton said in a television interview in Prague that he had given all
the information he had to the Justice Department, but 'then people said
'Well, that's not enough' . . . So I think we have to evaluate that and see
where we are.'
Besides reccommending that he ask Ms Reno to appoint an independent counsel
some White House officials are understood to be urging Mr Clinton to make
public all the documents he has handed over to the justice department.
Because they were the object of a subpoena, the documents are currently
secret.
Ms Reno would have to name the counsel herself, since the law passed in the
wake of the Watergate scandal 20 years ago providing for a special counsel
to be named by a judicial panel lapsed last year.
Whatever Mr Clinton does, he can scarcely win. Keeping the Whitewater
documents sealed fuels his political enemies and feeds speculation that he
might have something to hide. Publishing them will just create a flurry of
further news reports.
But with senior members of his own party, such as Senators Pat Moynihan and
Bill Bradley, urging him to ask for a special counsel, Mr Clinton can no
longer complain that the furore is just partisan politics - an argument that
has carried less weight all along because the Republican attack has been led
by the eminently moderate Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, rather than the
party's more rabid tub-thumpers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in energy costs - reflecting lower world oil prices - led to a
decline in US producer prices for finished goods last month, the third fall
in the past six months, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent between November and December, indicating
that underlying inflationary pressures remain moderate at the wholesale
level.
For 1993 as a whole, producer prices rose 0.2 per cent, against 1.6 per cent
in 1992. Core producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last year, the smallest
increase since the index was first calculated in 1974.
The index for 'intermediate' goods, which gives advance warning of likely
trends in prices for finished goods, was also subdued, falling 0.2 per cent
last month and rising by 1 per cent during 1993.
Most analysts expect inflationary pressures to remain modest this year.
Merrill Lynch, the New York investment house, yesterday predicted producer
prices would rise by about 1 per cent this year.
However JP Morgan, the New York bank, struck a cautious note, warning that
'idle capacity is close to levels associated with rising inflation in the
past.'

The suspension of military action came after the army had claimed to have

The rebellion in Chiapas by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, which

to a re-shuffle of the national cabinet after the hard-line interior
minister, Mr Patrocinio Gon-zalez, was forced to resign.
In a televised speech to the nation, the president said the army would only
respond if attacked. He hoped the decision would be 'the first step to save
lives and find new ways of conciliation'. He indicated that the government
would respond to the social demands of the local population.
The defence ministry said civil authorities had regained control of the
towns which had been seized by rebels. The army yesterday opened roads to
the conflict areas which had been sealed.

Amoco Chemicals of the US, one of the world's largest petrochemicals
manufacturers, is to build a MDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 307m) plant in Malaysia
to produce purified terephthalic acid, a basic ingredient for making
polyester, reports Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur.
The plant, to be built in the state of Pahang on the east coast of
peninsular Malaysia, will have an initial production capacity of 500,000
tonnes of PTA.
The Malaysian government has been encouraging investors to move away from
areas around Kuala Lumpur and the island of Penang off the west coast and go
to parts of the country where there are plentiful supplies of workers.
The state of Pahang has already established itself as a centre for
Malaysia's fast expanding petrochemicals industry.
Amoco has been investing heavily in the east Asia region and already has
manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China. Amoco is
also considering new ventures in Singapore and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
Kia Motors, the second-placed South Korean carmaker, is to begin selling
cars in the US next month in the first step towards building a
coast-to-coast US franchise by the end of 1995.
South Korean carmakers are rapidly expanding domestic production capacity
and developing a growing presence in export markets, particularly in Europe
and North America.
Kia's production capacity has risen from 60,000 units a year 10 years ago to
650,000. This is due to rise to 1.25m units by 1997, supported by a Dollars
7.75bn (Pounds 5.23bn) investment programme in 1993-1997.
The company, in which Ford of the US and Mazda of Japan hold stakes of 10
and 8 per cent respectively, has previously supplied small cars to Ford
(formerly the Festiva and now the Aspire) for distribution under the Ford
badge in the US.
It is now setting out to build its own independent franchise in North
America, however, with the launch next month of its Kia Sephia small family
car.
It plans to add a small four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle, the Kia
Sportage, in the autumn. This will be followed by the introduction of an
executive saloon range in 1996.
Kia will be the second Korean carmaker to establish its own franchise in the
US, one of the most competitive car markets in the world.
It is following Hyundai, which launched its cars in North America in 1986
and enjoyed wildly fluctuating fortunes, with sales rising to 264,000 units
by 1988 but falling to only 109,000 vehicles in the US in each of the last
two years.
Mr Greg Warner, executive vice-president of Kia Motors America and former
chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor America, said that Kia was aiming
to carve out a presence in the US by selling on low prices.
It was aiming directly at taking market share from the small cars sold by
Japanese producers in the US.
Japanese carmakers have been forced to raise prices more rapidly than
domestic US producers because of the appreciation of the yen.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Aluminium flood unites US and EU
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and EU this week agreed to take common approaches in dealing with the
flood of Russian aluminium exports, now depressing prices to record low
levels, and to act together in pressing Japan to improve its Uruguay Round
tariff cuts.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the crisis in the aluminium
industry had been discussed 'at the highest levels' during President Bill
Clinton's stop in Brussels on Monday. It will also be broached with
President Boris Yeltsin, when Mr Clinton gets to Russia this week.
US, Russian and EU officials next week will meet in Brussels representatives
of other aluminium-producing nations - Australia, Norway and Canada - for a
third round of talks to seek a solution. Aluminium prices have plunged from
Dollars 1 to 47 cents a pound.
Mr Kantor said a voluntary restraint agreement was 'certainly one instrument
we would consider'. Others have suggested price floors or export licensing.
The representative, who accompanied the president to Brussels, also said he
and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, had agreed to work together to
induce Tokyo to improve its market access offers, in the Uruguay Round, on
copper, wood, leather, shoes and financial services.
In a briefing yesterday Mr Kantor said he would not back away from the US-EC
negotiating 'framework' deal reached at the Tokyo summit, which called for
'measurable results and objective criteria' to measure progress in reducing
Japan's trade deficit. This is 'the heart' of the framework pact, he said,
'the sharp departure this (US) administration made from others in terms of
how we believe we can reach effective agreements with the Japanese
government'.
He seemed sympathetic to the problems faced by the Japanese government,
which is preoccupied by political reforms. But he will urge that government
to view steps taken to open its markets as part of the reforms necessary to
boost Japan's recovery.
'The US, Japan and the EU have the opportunity to build markets and expand
trade - they have corresponding responsibilities,' Mr Kantor said.
On other matters, he added:
The chief US textile negotiator, Ms Jennifer Hillman, has left for China for
talks to begin on Saturday, two days before the US is due to cut China's
textile and apparel quotas for alleged quota cheating.
A study, to be released next week by the US and EU, will recommend 'a
balance of opportunities' for opening their telecommunications markets to
imports.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: European drugs market stagnant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's drugs market continued to stagnate during the first 10 months of
last year, following healthcare reforms in Italy and Germany.
The value of the seven largest markets fell, in dollar terms, from Dollars
43bn (Pounds 28.8bn) during the 10 months to October 1992, to only Dollars
37.9bn for the equivalent period last year. Net of exchange rates, the seven
markets registered no growth, according to figures compiled by IMS
International, the specialist market research company.
Germany remained the market most severely hit. Pharmacy drugs sales fell 10
per cent at constant exchange rates, down from Dollars 12.25bn to Dollars
10.4bn following the Seehofer reforms introduced in January last year. The
Italian market also fell as sales dropped from Dollars 9.33bn to Dollars 7bn
(down 3 per cent in lira terms).
The British, Spanish and Dutch markets continued to demonstrate double-digit
growth in local currencies. Sales in the UK fell from Dollars 4.6bn to
Dollars 4.2bn in dollar terms, but increased 10 per cent in sterling.
Spanish sales also fell in dollar terms, down from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars
3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency terms. The Dutch market
increased from Dollars 1.26bn to Dollars 1.33bn, a rise of 11 per cent in
local currency.
The French and Belgian markets continued to grow, though more slowly than
other markets. Pharmacy sales in France dropped from Dollars 10.1bn to
Dollars 9.9bn, but increased 6 per cent in franc terms. The Belgian market
was static at Dollars 1.2bn, but rose in local currencies by 5 per cent.
Some important therapeutic areas registered zero or negative growth. Sales
of cardiovascular drugs dropped from Dollars 9.7bn to Dollars 8.4bn, a
decline of 3 per cent in local currencies. This was mostly because of a
decline in prescribing patented ace-inhibitors and cholesterol-lowering
drugs in Germany.
Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments - mostly H2-antagonists for
ulcers - were static in local currency terms, but fell from Dollars 7.3bn to
Dollars 6.4bn. Musculo-skeletal drugs - mostly anti-arthritic compounds -
registered a 5 per cent decline in local currencies, down from Dollars 2.6bn
to Dollars 2bn. Blood agents also recorded a fall, down 3 per cent from
Dollars 2bn to Dollars 1.7bn.
No therapeutic area registered double-digit growth. Central nervous system
treatments increased sales by only 2 per cent, while respiratory drugs -
mostly for asthma - were up only 3 per cent. The fastest growing sector was
anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals - up 5 per cent in local
currencies.

Etra, one of the four consortia racing to meet Saturday's pre-qualification
deadline for bids to run Italy's second mobile telecommunications network,
has made a surprise decision to join forces with a leading rival, reports
Haig Simonian from Milan.
The Etra group, predominantly comprising subsidiaries of the state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals holding company, is merging with Unitel, a rival made
up of Fiat, Fininvest and Vodafone of the UK. The move comes amid hectic
last-minute preparations for the January 15 deadline. The list of companies
deemed to have met the qualification criteria should be released by the end
of January, and the winning candidate is expected to be announced by the end
of April.
Italy's is one of Europe's fastest-growing mobile telephone markets, with
more than 1.1m subscribers to the existing network, run by the
state-controlled Sip telecommunications monopoly.
Mobile telecommunications in Italy have caught on fast since being
inaugurated in 1985, and the market is now the third biggest in Europe after
the UK and Germany.

FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Free-trade threat to a real market -
Changing fortunes of a Paraguay frontier town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So deep runs the despondency among the merchants of Ciudad del Este, a
Paraguayan town close to the frontiers with Brazil and Argentina, that they
are hoping for deliverance at the hands of Argentinian tourists.
Fortunes were once made in Ciudad del Este by selling vast quantities of
duty-free goods to Brazilians. These days, though, Brazilians have little
money to spend. At the same time, competition for their business is keener
than ever.
Traders are now hoping that some of the hundreds of thousands of Argentinian
tourists expected to take their holidays in southern Brazil over the coming
three months will drop by Ciudad del Este on their way home.
Desperate traders hope they could raise their sales, if only by about 1 per
cent, should 100,000 Argentinians visit Ciudad del Este this summer.
The duty-free business turns over surprisingly large amounts of money. Mr
Guillermo Campuzano, the mayor, claims Ciudad del Este will do Dollars
5bn-Dollars 7bn worth of business this year, although shopkeepers regard
that as too optimistic. The trade is one of Paraguay's most important
sources of revenue and creator of jobs.
Busy, chaotic and filthy, Ciudad del Este only comes alive when the first
shops open and streetsellers begin unpacking their wares ready for the first
busload of shoppers.
Orange plastic sheeting stretched across the pavements softens the harsh
sunlight. Makeshift stalls offer an infinity of goods: women's underwear,
toys, fishing rods, sunglasses, batteries, tool sets. Hawkers peddle
anything from Chinese-made battery-powered shavers to perfume of doubtful
provenance.
The shops and shopping centres - owned mainly by Arab and Chinese traders -
sell American cigarettes and trainers, Japanese video cameras, Persian
carpets, English china, Scotch whisky, and Swiss Army knives.
Ciudad del Este and the nearby Brazilian city of Foz do Iguacu have become
twin cities. Buses shuttle between them every five or ten minutes. Many of
Ciudad del Este's wealthier merchants live in Foz.
Everything in Ciudad del Este is much cheaper than in Argentina or Brazil
because Paraguay has low taxes and import duties and because smuggling and
tax evasion are rife.
Traders depend on Brazilians for 95 per cent of their sales. Specialist
Brazilian magazines list goods, prices and the shops where they are
available. Travel agents sell 'shopping packages'. Charter buses travel in
convoys on the long return journey to avoid ambushes by highway robbers.
Most of the shoppers are small-time Brazilian smugglers know as 'ants'. One
woman said 'I only buy cheap junk. You know toys, radios, things like that.'
But the ants' clients are getting poorer and poorer as Brazil's economic
problems deepen. Mr Hussein Teiyen, the Lebanese-born president of the
chamber of commerce, says sales have halved to Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m per
day since 1990. 'There are more sellers than buyers,' he says. 'There are
50,000 people in the city selling. But there are not 50,000 people coming
here to buy.'
Furthermore, Paraguay's rudimentary economy is in the throes of free market
restructuring. The unemployed drift to Ciudad del Este in search of either a
job or, more frequently, a living of sorts as a street-seller.
Another problem is a crackdown on tax evasion by the new government of
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. This has already led to the replacement of 80
per cent of Ciudad del Este's customs officers.
Under General Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay for 35 years,
corruption and contraband were an integral part of the political system. But
Mr Campuzano admits that 'a culture of 35 years, where the abnormal was
normal, means it is very difficult to change mentality in a few years'.
The prospect of advancing hordes of Argentine shoppers, made wealthy by
rapid growth and an over-valued currency, is electrifying Ciudad del Este.
Merchants say Argentinians are both wealthier and more discriminating
shoppers than Brazilians, preferring higher-priced wares such as perfumes
and silk scarves.
Trade liberalisation is probably Ciudad del Este's most serious long-term
threat. Mercosur, the planned South American common market linking
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay is meant to come into force in 1995
and will require members to levy a common external tariff and remove
internal trade barriers.
Traders say trade liberalisation in Argentina and Brazil has already forced
them to cut margins. Ciudad del Este is such an important revenue source
that Paraguay is thinking of making the city a free trade zone after 1995.
It may not take much to wreck Ciudad del Este, as can be seen by nipping
into Argentina. Traders in the nearby town of Puerto Iguazu, a smaller rival
of Ciudad del Este, were ruined by the strong exchange rate introduced by
the government of President Carlos Menem. The hordes of shoppers have gone,
the hotels lie empty and shops are boarded up.

   TASHKENT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of five nations have agreed on steps to prevent the Aral Sea in
central Asia, one of the world's worst ecological disasters, from shrinking
further, Reuter reports from Tashkent.
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan set up a
joint fund and permanent committee to try to save the sea and improve the
health of people around it, officials said yesterday after meeting in the
Uzbek city of Nukus.
The Aral was once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake, but irrigation
has sapped rivers and reduced it to a quarter of its size. As the sea
shrivels, it leaves behind a sandy desert mixed with fertiliser toxins.
Storms whip up toxic dust and deposit it as far as Pakistan, scientists say.
The health of people living in the sea's basin has deteriorated sharply.
Some scientists say 80 per cent of the women and children in the area suffer
from anaemia. Infant mortality rates have soared and life expectancy has
plunged.
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, all former Soviet
republics, pledged to pay 1 per cent of their 1994 budgets into the fund,
said an official. Because of its financial crisis, Tajikistan was excused
from contributing.
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said he would accept a limit on the water
taken from the upper reaches of central Asia's two great rivers, the Amu
Darya and Syr Darya, which feed the Aral Sea.
The US and the World Bank will give Kazakhstan Dollars 62m to help it
protect its environment as it moves to drill oil in the Northern Caspian
Sea, Kazakhstan's ecology minister said yesterday.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Beirut share offer 142% subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DAMASCUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The share offering to found Solidere, the company being created to rebuild
central Beirut, was 142 per cent subscribed, the company said yesterday.
Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Arab investors bid Dollars 926m (Pounds
621m) for the offering, designed to raise Dollars 650m.
Some Dollars 600m was raised from Lebanese citizens, who will be given
preference in the final allocation of shares.
Until a secondary market in Solidere shares opens (due next month), Lebanese
citizens will hold more than 94 per cent of the company's founding equity.
Mr Nasser al-Shamaa, general secretary of Solidere's founding board, said
the response a 'clear statement of faith by the Lebanese in the future of
their country and its capital'. The Solidere launch 'may be the largest
public share offering in the Middle East'.
The 10-week offer which closed on Monday represented the sale of 35 per cent
of Solidere's equity. The remainder, worth around Dollars 1.7bn, were shares
distributed to property owners in downtown Beirut in exchange for land
rights.
The company said tender documents for the first contracts to rebuild
Beirut's former banking and commercial centre had largely been prepared; the
first bids will be invited within weeks.
Solidere plans to redevelop 1.6m square metres of land in central Beirut
over the next six years. Its board hopes to have the nucleus of a working
commercial centre open within two years.
Beirut is enjoying a building boom, but little has been done to tackle the
city-centre devastation left by 17 years of civil war.
The response from Lebanese investors will be particularly pleasing to Mr
Rafik Hariri, the billionaire businessman-turned-prime minister, who
designed Solidere expressly to attract private Lebanese capital back into
the country.
Company officials said they had received about 10,000 applications from
Lebanese investors in Beirut on Monday alone, and the response to the
Solidere offering is the biggest single injection yet of private capital
into Lebanon's rebuilding project.
The final allocation of shares is expected to take up to 10 days to
complete, with priority going to Lebanese property owners in Beirut,
Lebanese nationals, government agencies,
Lebanese expatriates and other Arab investors in that order. Some Dollars
276m will therefore be returned to Arab investors, mostly in the Gulf
states.
Investors in Saudi Arabia subscribed for more than Dollars 200m-worth of
shares alone, according to bankers in Riyadh, who said the shares were
likely to command a premium over their Dollars 100 issue price when
secondary trading begins.
Lebanese officials hope the market in Solidere shares will provide the basis
for reviving the stock market in Beirut, which closed in 1983 during the
civil war.
Mr Hariri himself subscribed for Dollars 125m-worth of shares - some 7 per
cent of Solidere's overall capital and just below the statutory maximum
holding of 10 per cent. He has said he will donate all dividends from the
shares to his charitable foundation.
However, the offering has met strong opposition from militant Islamic groups
in Lebanon. In December, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader
of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah, denounced the Solidere launch as 'religiously
forbidden' since property owners in central Beirut had been 'forced' to
relinquish their rights to the company.
Some landowners in Beirut have also complained that a proposed court to test
the legality of Solidere's plans was never actually set up.
A committee has been formed to try to amend Solidere's founding regulations.

FT  13 JAN 94 / IMF persuades French Africa to go for growth: The CFA bloc's
devaluation will ensure the adjustment needed for revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 13 French-speaking countries of west and central Africa finally bit the
bullet on Tuesday night and agreed to depreciate their common currency, the
CFA franc, by 50 per cent against the French franc to pull their economies
out of deep recession.
Described by an economist as the 'most foretold and least well prepared
devaluation in economic history', it came after two days of often
acrimonious wrangling between African leaders and the International Monetary
Fund, abetted by France, in Dakar, the Senegalese capital.
It is the first parity change since 1948 for the CFA (Communaute Financiere
Africaine) franc, which is now worth one French centime. The distant Comores
Islands in the Indian Ocean have devalued their CFA franc by one third.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director who was in Dakar to press for
devaluation, said in Paris yesterday that at the outset many of the African
leaders thought they were being asked to make 'a leap into the void without
a parachute', but were subsequently convinced that devaluation would promote
'a dash for growth', with the accompanying aid provided by the IMF, World
Bank and France. The IMF chief expressed confidence in the CFA franc's new
parity, whose change would produce the external adjustment necessary to the
franc zone's revival.
France said it would continue to guarantee the convertibility of CFA francs
which, along with fostering regional integration, is the aim of the franc
zone. In a joint statement, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur also said France 'will not fail to show its solidarity with
its (CFA) partners' by, for instance, forgiving FFr25bn (Pounds 2.87bn)
worth of their debts to it.
The Balladur government denies it imposed devaluation on the CFA countries,
acknowledging only that in its tougher financial attitude abroad as well as
at home it had recently made clear to CFA countries that they could no
longer expect France to top up their budgets, unless they reached agreements
with the IMF. But this is a pro-forma distinction, since Paris knew well the
IMF's strong preference for CFA devaluation.
The package of measures to support the devaluation includes:
The IMF will provide aid worth *something in here (HP) *
Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.01bn-Pounds 1.14bn) over the next
three or four years, Mr Camdessus said. This would initially take the form
of standby credits because, being quicker to negotiate, they would more
rapidly unlock other credit possibilities and pave the way to possible debt
rescheduling. But thereafter the 10 poorest CFA countries would be able to
draw on the IMF's 'enhanced structural adjustment facility' at a 0.5 per
cent rate of interest repayable over 10 years.
To soften the impact of higher prices for imported staples, particularly on
the poorest, the IMF would approve subsidies on some basic goods like bread,
vegetable oil, rice or even petrol out of the CFA countries' budget revenues
which were expected to rise, Mr Camdessus said. The World Bank will step up
its lending, partic-ularly to education and health.
For the 10 poorest CFA countries, France is to forgive all of the FFr6.6bn
of bilateral aid debt which it did not cancel in 1989. Paris is also
cancelling half, or FFr18.4bn, of the aid debt that the four relatively
richer countries - Gabon, Cameroon, Congo and Ivory Coast - owe it. In
addition, France is to set up a FFr300m 'special development fund', to which
it hopes the European Union and World Bank will contribute and with which
Paris intends to help the urban poor in CFA countries.
'We hope that other creditor governments in the Paris Club (which deals with
the rescheduling of official debt) will give CFA countries the best terms,'
said a French official yesterday.
Clearly, France is willing to pay a price to keep the franc zone going. The
cost to the Bank of France of converting CFA francs into French ones on
demand is minimal, because the arrangement is backed by the requirement that
CFA countries keep 65 per cent of their hard currency reserves with the
French central bank. The Bank of France pays market rates on these deposits
and charges market rates on any CFA borrowings. Nor is cancelling the debt
of the 10 poorest countries a big sacrifice; it might never have been
recovered.
But the much larger cancelled debt of the four richer countries might one
day have been repaid. France's private sector will also pay a price. 'The
shock wave of the CFA devaluation for French investors could reach FFr10bn
this year,' complained the head of the Council of French Investors in Africa
in a letter yesterday to Mr Balladur.
Yet such sacrifices are small beer compared to the 40 per cent drop in real
per capita income suffered by the inhabitants of the franc zone since the
mid-1980s. A World Bank report prepared for the Dakar meeting comments that
'the only other region of the world experiencing an economic decline of
comparable magnitude is the former Soviet Union'.
While in 1970-85 output and exports grew faster and inflation was lower in
the CFA zone than in the rest of Africa, the trends reversed dramatically
thereafter. Internally, CFA governments continued to spend too much on their
public sectors and civil servants, while externally the terms of their trade
worsened with their currency tied to a French franc itself trying to hold
fast to the D-Mark.
The World Bank and IMF have privately pointed to the 'silent crisis' caused
by the increasing over-valuation of the currency.
By the end of the decade, average government and manufacturing wages
relative to average incomes, in Senegal for example, were three to six times
higher than in Indonesia or Ghana.
Last year Mr Ishrait Husain, chief economist in the World Bank's Africa
department, published a study in which he compared the economic performance
of the CFA countries with 14 countries which have pursued structural
adjustment in the 1980s.
Between 1986 and 1991 the appreciation of the CFA franc and subsequent
losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average
of 0.2 per cent a year. But GDP in the other 14 African countries which the
Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over
the same period.
The losses were not evenly shared, however. The gainers were civil servants
and students whose salaries and grants consumed an increasing majority of
CFA governments' dwindling budgets. The losers were the rural masses whose
incomes from agricultural production dwindled while access to primary
education and health remained low.
The World Bank and IMF say the devaluation was needed to sharpen the
incentives for exporters and raise the incomes of poor farmers. But, in the
short-term, the immediate sharp rise in import prices will aggravate rising
labour unrest among civil servants and urban dwellers in West and Central
African states, many of whom already have trouble meeting wage bills because
of falling tax revenues.
Cameroon's civil service has already been paralysed for a month by a strike
over a 50 per cent wage cut announced last November.
Some 55,000 secondary school teachers have been on strike since the end of
November and many state hospitals are closed or maintaining only emergency
cover. Magistrates went on strike at the beginning of the year.
Further north, in landlocked Niger, the government closed Niamey university
last Friday after students hurling stones and petrol bombs fought riot
police.
The students' grants have not been paid for eight months. In January 1993
the university cancelled teaching for the academic year because of lack of
funds.
The contrast with the tendency for neighbouring anglophone countries to
devalue frequently has been felt in both exports and imports. Cheap imports
from Nigeria have flooded into the CFA zone, while Ghanaian pineapples have
edged those of the Ivory Coast out of the European market.
'Devaluation will bring instantaneous benefits to the Ivory Coast,' says Mr
Cheikh Ibrahim Fall of the African Development Bank in Abidjan. 'Exports
revenues will increase, farmers' incomes will rise and the government will
have more cash to pay its domestic debt. . . But I am not convinced of the
long-term benefits, if devaluation is not accompanied by other reforms.'
Mr Camdessus sees signs of a new seriousness to reform and to integrate the
CFA zone, particularly in the African leaders' pledge in Dakar to meet every
six months to review their imminent IMF agreements.
'The CFA zone has been just a monetary arrangement. Now we may see some
genuine economic convergence within it.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Investment for Vietnam

<TEXT>
Vietnam approved foreign investment projects worth Dollars 2.86bn (Pounds
1.9bn) last year, a rise of 47 per cent over 1992, the government media said
yesterday.
The ruling Communist party has been liberalising the economy for the past
five years, and the country has attracted numerous foreign companies from
Asia and further afield.
Investment approvals amount to Dollars 7.5bn since 1987; Taiwan, prominent
in the clothing industry, is the biggest investor with Dollars 1.5bn of
projects approved so far.
Doing business in Vietnam has proved difficult, however, and the total value
of projects actually implemented is only about Dollars 2bn, with oil
exploration accounting for much of the money spent.
Investors complain about bureaucracy, corruption and the poor state of
Vietnam's transport and communications.
They are also concerned about the inadequacy of the legal system, although
the government is attempting to alleviate this problem by enacting the sort
of new legislation needed to regulate a market economy.
The national assembly recently passed laws on bankruptcy, the establishment
of economic tribunals to adjudicate in commercial disputes, and for
environmental protection.
The liberalisation of the economy has created strains among party leaders,
with some calling for faster reforms and others lamenting the greed and
corruption rampant in the new Vietnam.
A special party conference next week is expected to discuss economic reform
and the party's future.

FT  13 JAN 94 / The LDP's stand-in refuses to lie down: Former premier
Toshiki Kaifu is refusing to toe the party line by opposing reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fondest memories of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the former Japanese prime
minister, are hanging in his office: a photograph of a shared joke with then
President George Bush; an apparently attentive Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher taking in the thoughts of Toshiki; and an audience in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People.
For a man dubbed the 'relief pitcher' by his colleagues in the Liberal
Democratic party, who saw him as a very temporary stand-in from a weak
faction, Mr Kaifu's influence has lingered in the Japanese parliament, soon
to reconsider electoral reform bills that echo proposals he made in 1991.
Mr Kaifu, 63, was also expected to disappear quickly into the relative
obscurity from which he had been plucked when the LDP needed a 'clean
politician' to lead the party after a spate of scandals and a miserable
election in 1989. Instead, he remains in the spotlight, having crossed the
party line by refusing to vote against the reform bills, which he said 'must
be passed this month or they may never be passed'.
After apologising repeatedly for returning late to his office, Mr Kaifu
explained that he had come from a meeting of LDP faction heads and former
prime ministers which agreed that the party should restart debate on
electoral reforms. Since falling into opposition last year, the LDP has
repeatedly refused to discuss procedure with government, customary in
Japanese consensus politics, and boycotted a sitting to extend the present
session of parliament.
'I told my colleagues that this sort of behaviour is not good for our public
image. We have to get involved in the debate. We should be setting the
agenda, but at present, we are always on the defensive and it does not look
good,' Mr Kaifu said.
Defections from the LDP over the past year have changed the character of the
party. Many reformers with whom Mr Kaifu feels most comfortable have joined
new parties, leaving a conservative core yet to appreciate the depth of
change in Japanese politics and determined to preserve a system of factional
patronage that is prone to corruption.
The party appointed a reformer, Mr Yohei Kono, as leader in an attempt to
improve its image, but faction leaders have undermined his authority. Mr
Kono is forced to give embarrassingly vague answers in public because his
script is jointly written by about four powerful figures in the backroom who
are often unable to agree on the wording.
Mr Kaifu hints that the introduction of reforms and another general election
could set the scene for him to leave the LDP, of which he is proud for its
'commitment to free markets and democracy'. He foresees continuing
instability that will test old loyalties and provide new opportunities for a
proven leader.
His own sudden exit from the leadership, which came when he ignored the
advice of the backroom and pushed ahead with reform, contributed to public
contempt for the LDP. Unless the party is more open, he says, it will face
continuing unpopularity and defections of MPs to newer parties.
'I understand how the influence of the backroom works. My administration was
brought down that way. They moved against me. I understand the pressures on
Mr Kono,' he said. 'I keep telling people to be more open, but I guess that
they regard me as a bit of nuisance.'
His influence is limited by his membership of the smallest faction, though
his good scores in opinion polls and the general recognition that he tried
to reform Japanese politics mean that younger LDP members like to associate
with him, hopeful that his prestige will rub off on them.
Before a general election last July, he chaired a 184-member political
reform committee, which LDP parliamentarians rushed to join, keen to
convince voters that they, too, were 'reformers'. However, the party lost
office for the first time in 38 years and a seven-party coalition government
was formed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
Mr Kaifu suggests that Japanese prime ministerial style is changing, as his
term as leader showed the public preference for straight answers, rather
than the bewildering sentence structures employed by his predecessors. He
has an affinity with Mr Hosokawa, who also scores well in opinion polls and
is a straight talker, but has a fragile power base.
'There are serious problems in the coalition government, but they haven't
changed policies. The socialists (Social Democratic party) have always had a
strange foreign policy. They said North Korea was good and South Korea was
wrong. But the foreign policy hasn't been altered since the coalition
arrived. It's still the LDP policy.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Japanese unions demand 6% rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade unions yesterday demanded pay rises of 5-6 per cent, saying
they would stimulate growth and pull Japan out of its recession.
The call by Rengo, the Japanese trade union confederation, contrasts with a
proposed pay freeze by Nikkeiren, the employers' federation.
Last year wage increases averaged 3.89 per cent.
Mr Akira Yamagishi, Rengo chairman, criticised the employers' proposal at an
executive committee meeting in Tokyo yesterday. He said it would further
depress consumption.
Mr Yamagishi blamed management for bringing about the asset inflation which
artificially boosted the Japanese economy. The Nikkeiren's proposal showed a
lack of responsibility on the part of employers and reflected an extremely
anti-social attitude that was difficult to accept, he said.
Nikkeiren yesterday published a report calling for a cap on wages in order
to preserve jobs which, it said, should be the top priority. Japanese wage
levels were among the highest in the world and if wages rose even further,
Japan's international competitiveness would decline, leading to an
acceleration of the 'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, the report said.
Mr Yamagishi, however, said Japanese companies had sufficient internal
revenues to meet wage increases of 5-6 per cent. According to Rengo, Japan's
top 50 corporations have internal revenues of Y12,000bn (Pounds 71.5bn).
Rengo also called for an emergency declaration by management and labour to
tackle the deteriorating employment environment. It said more confrontation
could be expected between labour and management.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Cost of 'peace dividend' is lost jobs, says ILO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a 'peace dividend' for jobs by converting defence industries to
civilian manufacturing have proved depressingly wide of the mark, according
to the International Labour Organisation.
In a report to its metal trades committee, now meeting in Geneva, the United
Nations agency says the most striking part of the long-awaited peace
dividend after the fall of communism has been massive job losses in the
armaments industries on both sides of the old Iron Curtain.
The US, the world's biggest arms producer, has made redundant 400,000 mostly
well-paid and skilled workers over the past three years. Roughly the same
number have lost their jobs in the former Soviet Union. In both cases the
number is expected to treble over the next three years, the ILO warns.
In France and Germany, employment in defence industries is set to shrink by
up to a quarter. Smaller arms producers such as Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Slovakia have also registered big job losses. 'Each direct job
that is lost may lead to the loss of two or three indirect jobs in other
sectors,' the ILO report notes.
Far from finding equivalent jobs in the civilian industry, most of those
made redundant share the fate of former steel and car workers in facing
long-term unemployment, unstable jobs and reduced incomes.
'In the US, the major difficulty is that many of those affected are too
skilled, too specialised, overpaid and too old (many between 40 and 60) to
find new jobs,' the report says.
This marks a painful contrast with estimates made before the Berlin Wall
came down in November 1989 of net job gains from defence conversion. One UN
study forecast a ratio of at least two jobs created for every one lost.
Converting arms manufacture to civilian production will mean 'hardships and
problems of adjustment' whatever the strategy adopted, the ILO says.
However, most of the successes so far have had 'a helping hand from
governments'.
US experience suggests the ingredients for success include far-sighted
planning by management in co-operation with the workforce and public
authorities, economic incentives to develop new products and retool
factories, and retraining of management and workers.
Conversion assistance is expensive. The US will have to earmark some Dollars
20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) for this purpose over the next five years, the ILO
says. In the former socialist countries, it argues, the key to successful
conversion lies in privatisation, accompanied by greater incentives for
workers and managers to produce for the civilian economy.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Balladur reignites education war: French school finance
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's historic tug-of-war between public and private education is about
to be played out again in the streets of Paris, with a big protest planned
for Sunday against the government's school finance reform.
The only thing that will keep the number of demonstrators below the minimum
100,000 forecast by the interior ministry would be a decision by the
country's constitutional council today or tomorrow to annul the reform, in
response to the Socialist challenge that it unconstitutionally favours
private (largely Roman Catholic) schools over public ones.
By removing a 144-year-old limit on state funding of private school
infrastructure late last year, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has
re-ignited his country's ancient guerre scolaire.
This has ended his period of calm cohabitation with President Francois
Mitterrand who has taken up rhetorical cudgels in defence of state
education, and also drawn more muted tactical criticism from his fellow
Gaullist and presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, and even some senior
clerics such as the Archbishop of Lyon.
Mr Balladur seems to have underestimated two factors giving fresh
sensitivity to French educational policy. One is the seemingly endless rise
in unemployment, which has made parents more worried than ever about any
reduction in the resources deployed to prepare their children for a job. The
other is that the desire of some Moslem immigrants for their daughters to
wear traditional 'chador' scarves has seemed to many French to place their
country's secular education system into question.
In his new year's attempt to balance his reform with promises of more money
for public schools, Mr Balladur is now trying to defuse what in the past has
provide a political minefield - with repeated violent clashes in 1968, 1984
and 1986 over school and university reform.
But he is unlikely to back-pedal entirely, even in the face of a flat Non
from the constitutional court, given the pressure on him to redeem his
coalition's election pledge to rationalise the remaining anomalies in French
school finance.
The most distinctive feature of modern French education is the deal which
the French state struck with the Roman Catholic church in 1959. This
appeared to end their long war, which saw the state first triumph over the
church in the French revolution, then readmit some church schools in the
1850s, only to 'laicise' thoroughly education by the start of this century.
To enlist the church's help in educating the 1950s baby boom, however, the
de Gaulle government agreed to pay all the salaries and operating costs of
any church school which signed a contract with the state commiting them to a
syllabus and examination system set by the government. Such 'contract'
Catholic schools must admit children of any religion. They can make
reference to their religious philosophy, but must not impose it.
Buoyed by this injection of state money - which brings basic monthly fees
down to FFr30 (Pounds 3.50) for a primary school in the rural Vendee and to
FFr150 for an urban technical school - 'contract' Catholic schools have
blossomed. There are 9,500 of them, teaching some 2m, or 17 per cent, of the
nation's children, and are particularly strong in the west, north and
south-east.
They hardly exist in Alsace, which missed out on the late 19th century
'laicisation' by being under German occupation and when it rejoined France
in 1918 was allowed to keep its 1850s-style tolerance of religious education
in public schools.
Left unsettled, though, has been the issue of who pays for the schools'
bricks and mortar. The 1850 law of a conservative education minister, Comte
Frederic de Falloux - which the Balladur government has just amended -
allowed local authorities to fund up to 10 per cent of regular private
schools' infrastructure.
However, full public funding was permitted for work on private technical
schools in 1919 and for private agricultural schools in 1984. The latter
concession is politically awkward for Mr Michel Rocard, who is now the
Socialist party leader but who was agriculture minister in 1984.
The Balladur government, and particularly Mr Francois Bayrou, the education
minister and his UDF party which is especially attached to decentralisation,
says the funding anomaly between private regular and specialist schools
should be corrected and that local authorities should be able to use their
money as they see fit. A government-commissioned report stated last month
that half the country's private schools were in urgent need of repairs,
whose cost it put in the range of FFr3.5bn-FFr5.3bn.
However, in a time of budget squeeze, the Socialist opposition says this
money will only come at the expense of public schools. Mr Henri Emmanuelli,
a former Socialist president of the National Assembly, conjures up the worst
of French fears by saying it will all lead 'to a British-style situation,
with more and more delapidated public schools in a segregated, two-speed
educational system'.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They call it the Big Hole in Bonn: the huge building site on the banks of
the Rhine where a whole new complex of parliamentary offices is being built,
in spite of the German government's plans to move lock, stock and barrel to
Berlin by the turn of the century.
Now it seems to be not just a big hole, but more of a bottomless pit.
The entire foundations of the DM800m (Pounds 312m) complex have been
devastated by the floods which swept the banks of the Rhine over Christmas.
According to reports confirmed by the construction ministry, the flood
waters actually raised the floor of the building by 70 centimetres, and
caused ominous cracks to appear in much of the concrete piling.
The Bundestag's budget committee yesterday called a halt to the building
programme, and questioned why it was allowed to go ahead at all.
Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the luckless construction minister responsible for
the move to Berlin, has sacked her chief building inspector for failing to
keep her informed, but now faces calls for her resignation.
All this has come on the eve of vital negotiations between Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the leaders of all the main political parties, and the mayors of Bonn
and Berlin, to decide precisely when and how the great move should take
place.
At their summit meeting tomorrow they also have to settle the most important
question of all: how much the move will cost. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, who is desperate to contain a swelling budget deficit, told a
party meeting on Tuesday that the costs of moving must be kept to DM20bn -
compared with earlier unofficial estimates of up to DM30bn. His critics
think him hopelessly optimistic.
Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the Social Democrats in the
Bundestag and a fierce opponent of Berlin, called for a 10-year delay in the
move, saying the figures had been 'massaged'.
Yet any lingering hopes entertained by the vociferous Bonn lobby to delay
the switch of capital have been sorely undermined by the force of the flood
waters on the Rhine.
A spanking new office complex, with a swimming pool, sports hall, and an
underground garage for 1,200 cars, would have been a great temptation for
the members of the Bundestag to stay put beside the Rhine. If the project
has to be abandoned, they may be all too happy to move to the Spree as soon
as possible.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Portugal talks up the role of EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, yesterday said he
hoped the newly-formed European monetary institute would help persuade
Germany to cut interest rates more quickly to boost European economic
growth.
His comments are likely to increase German fears that the Frankfurt-based
EMI could interfere with the statutory independence of the Bundesbank.
In remarks plainly directed above all at Germany, Mr Cavaco Silva criticised
'national egoism' in economic policy. He said the EMI would require 'a
commitment for everyone to pursue a community monetary policy'.
He added: 'I have some expectations for the work of the EMI. Before, it was
quite clear that monetary policy co-ordination was not strong. I hope from
now on it will not just be a question of adapting to the decisions of the
Bundesbank. The 12 members of the European Union - all of them - will have a
say in monetary policy.'
Decision-making power will remain formally in the hands of national central
banks during stage two of the move to economic and monetary union, which
began on January 1. However, Mr Cavaco Silva said the EMI, which had its
first meeting on Tuesday, would have to play more than just an advisory
role.
'Europe is more than just the Bundesbank,' he said.
His remarks yesterday put Portugal firmly on the side of countries such as
France, Italy, Spain and Belgium which want the EMI to play a more active
role.
Mr Cavaco Silva also said Europe needed a single currency to accompany the
internal market. However, he admitted it was now unlikely that monetary
union could take place before 1999, compared with the earliest date
prescribed in the Maastricht treaty of 1997.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a key aide of Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
yesterday failed to become speaker of the upper house of parliament by a few
votes, as regional leaders snubbed the head of state by giving almost equal
support to an ultra-nationalist factory director.
Mr Shumeiko sought to woo the regional leaders who sit in the Federation
Council by promising them more powers, as well as a shift in economic
policy, and less interference from the president.
But Mr Pyotr Romanov, manager of a Siberian oil refinery who stressed his
patriotism and the importance of state power, picked up 79 votes against Mr
Shumeiko's 81. According to a colleague from St Petersburg, Mr Romanov is a
member of the Russian National Assembly, a right-wing organisation headed by
a hardline KGB general.
The victor in a repeat vote needs to obtain support of at least half the
171-strong Federation Council. The election of Mr Shumeiko, a first deputy
prime minister and close associate of Mr Yeltsin, would confirm the upper
chamber, or Federation Council, as the more co-operative of the two
parliamentary chambers.
Fresh squabbling broke out yesterday among deputies of the lower chamber,
the State Duma, even though it was not in session, when Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, leader of the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, insisted
that he should become speaker. A meeting of faction leaders broke up after
members representing Russia's Choice, Russian Unity, Accord, and Women of
Russia walked out in protest over his attempt to renege on a deal to give
the job to a candidate from the women's party.
They later reconvened to try to pick a speaker, with all factions agreeing
to block his Liberal Democratic party should Mr Zhirinovsky try to take over
proceedings without their agreement.
Mr Shumeiko, who got himself elected to the Federation Council from the
Russian-speaking enclave of Kaliningrad, had earlier proposed that if the
State Duma blocked legislation, the new Federation Council could take on new
functions - say approving the budget - not foreseen for it by the
constitution.
He also promised a vigorous defence of the interests of Russia's restless
regions. He suggested the abolition of the system of presidential
representatives in the regions, who he said duplicated the functions of the
governors.
Mr Shumeiko reiterated plans for a shift in economic policy 'which would
turn our face to producers'. This shift in priorities, away from those
desired by radical reformers such as the deputy prime minister, Mr Yegor
Gaidar, has already been set out by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister.
Meanwhile, Democratic Russia, the anti-communist movement that has been an
important source of support for Mr Yeltsin, yesterday warned that it would
go into opposition against him if he removed radical reformers from the
government, as expected in a reshuffle next week.

President Bill Clinton said yesterday it was 'no longer a question of
whether' Nato would acquire new members in eastern Europe 'but of when and
how'.
The Partnership for Peace adopted by the Nato summit this week was 'not a
permanent holding group', he said after bilateral meetings in Prague with
the leaders of the Visegrad countries - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary
and Slovakia - which are generally considered to head the queue for Nato
membership.
But Mr Clinton - who early today arrived in Moscow after a stopover in Kiev
 -told the Visegrad leaders that while he saw 'a clear link' between the
partnership and eventual accession to the alliance, he had advanced 'no
promises, no criteria and no timetable', and had not, according to a White
House official, raised the question of 'explicit security guarantees'.
In their public remarks the Visegrad leaders did not dissent from the
president's views. President Lech Walesa of Poland said he had found the
session 'most gratifying', while President Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic welcomed the partnership as 'a good departure in the Nato quest for
a new identity' and promised his country would work 'quickly and
energetically' to prove itself 'worthy of membership'.
But he added that while 'it is not possible or desirable to isolate Russia,
we are independent states who decide our own affiliations and policies'.
Mr Clinton still felt it necessary to sweeten the pill of any disappointment
by offering a modest programme of economic assistance to the four.
This, a White House official conceded, involved 'more know-how than money',
though it included some concrete proposals. Chief among them is an increase
from Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) per project to Dollars 200m in the cover
provided by the US Overseas Private Insurance Corporation. The US will also
set up a Dollars 30m programme drawn from existing funds, designed to bring
together US and east European organisations engaged in education, legal and
social reform.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Court told of Vatican bribes channel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decisive role of the Vatican bank in channelling alleged bribes in
Italy's political corruption scandal was admitted in court yesterday by one
of the most important intermediaries involved.
Mr Luigi Bisignani, the former head of external relations at the big
Ferruzzi industrial group, admitted he had used the Istituto per le Opere di
Religione (IOR), the Vatican bank, to transfer massive payments from the
company to secret accounts outside Italy.
The IOR achieved public notoriety in the early 1980s when it was implicated
in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, the Milanese bank run by Roberto Calvi.
Calvi was later found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London.
The payments by Ferruzzi were allegedly made to obtain the support of
politicians for the dissolution of the ill-fated Enimont chemicals joint
venture between Ferruzzi's Montedison industrial arm and the state-owned Eni
energy group.
The 'Enimont affair', in which Ferruzzi allegedly paid a total of about
L150bn (Pounds 59m) in kickbacks, has become one of the most important
strands in the two-year corruption probe. The scandals have cut a swathe
through the Italian political and business establishment and drawn in most
of the country's leading parties.
Making his first public appearance since giving himself up last week, Mr
Bisignani, a former journalist with contacts in the Christian Democrat party
and the Vatican, said he had acted on the instructions of Mr Raul Gardini,
the former head of Ferruzzi who committed suicide last year. Mr Bisignani
was speaking from the witness box at the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a
Milanese financier arrested last year as part of the corruption
investigations. Mr Cusani, associated with both Mr Gardini and senior
members of the Socialist party, allegedly acted as a go-between for Ferruzzi
and politicians.
The trial, which opened late last year, is the first big prosecution in the
corruption affair.
Mr Bisignani admitted he had received about L4bn for his efforts to put Mr
Gardini in contact with the IOR. The bank does not normally take outside
deposits. Milan magistrates are trying to ascertain whether part of the
alleged kickbacks ended up in the hands of the large number of
intermediaries, such as Mr Bisignani, who were allegedly involved in the
transactions.
Milan magistrates leading the investigations flew to Luxembourg for
information on alleged transfers from Ferruzzi. Mr Cusani admitted that two
of the Luxembourg accounts identified as having received L52bn in Ferruzzi
money were in his name. While the Milan case, the first in a series of
trials, is expected to last several months, Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former
top Ferruzzi executive arrested on Tuesday, was interrogated by Naples
magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks in the drugs industry.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Ciampi seeks to run caretaker cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday sought a
strong mandate from parliament to run a caretaker administration in the
run-up to early elections.
The former governor of the Bank of Italy made the plea to avoid a
destabilising power vacuum in a speech opening the debate on the
no-confidence motion presented before Christmas by Mr Marco Panella, the
Radical leader.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had been expected to announce a date for
elections in his address at the end of last year, but he delayed doing so in
order to allow parliament to give its verdict on the Ciampi government. A
hard core of Christian Democrats, the main backers of the Ciampi government,
has backed the no-confidence motion in an effort to prolong the life of the
present parliament.
The debate was suspended last night and will resume today. Although the
outcome remained uncertain, it seemed unlikely that the Christian Democrats
would succeed in prolonging parliament until European parliamentary
elections in June. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League,
announced he would be withdrawing his party's deputies and senators from the
legislature.
The League's withdrawal underlined the fact that the current legislature,
elected in April 1992, had reached the end of its natural life, according to
Mr Bossi. This, coupled with the hostility of the former Communist party,
the Democratic Left (PDS), to prolonging the present parliament, will put
strong pressure on President Scalfaro to call elections for early April at
the latest.
Mr Ciampi avoided announcing his resignation, but he made it clear he had
completed the limited objectives of his original mandate when he agreed to
be prime minister in April last year.
In a carefully worded speech, Mr Ciampi appeared anxious to ensure the
no-confidence motion was defeated, while at the same time making sure that
all his options were kept open.
His supporters said it was important to defeat the no-confidence motion as
this would give him more authority to run a caretaker government. Mr Ciampi
himself made frequent reference in his speech to the need to maintain
Italy's international credibility. While saying his government had no power
to influence parliament on early elections, he nevertheless warned the
politicians of the dangers of creating a political vacuum.
The purpose of those wishing to prolong the present parliament is two-fold:
to allow time for a hopelessly divided Christian Democrat party to reform
and to exploit as long as possible parliamentary privileges that help
protect deputies from prosecution for corruption. One in six members risks
prosecution on corruption charges.
However, the four-party coalition has never had a majority larger than 16
votes and it looked unlikely last night all would back the Panella
no-confidence motion. As an alternative, some Christian Democrats talked of
presenting a counter-vote in the form of a confidence motion.
Mr Ciampi may today go to President Scalfaro and discuss whether or not to
resign.
There would then follow up to two days of talks between President Scalfaro
and political leaders prior to an announcement on how long the present
parliamentary session would last.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Kiev offered missile-debt swap
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A key factor in clinching the deal due to be signed tomorrow between the US,
Russia and Ukraine on the return of Ukraine's warheads to Russia was the
promise by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, to supply
Ukraine with oil and gas below world prices, senior US officials said.
The Russians have also offered to wipe out at least part of Ukraine's energy
debt to Moscow. However, the deal is already causing controversy within
Russia and Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk confirmed last night after meeting
President Bill Clinton, who had made a stopover visit in Kiev, that he would
go to Moscow to sign the deal. Officials had earlier in the week suggested
he would not initial a full agreement because of insufficient consensus on
details.
Mr Kravchuk was upbeat on prospects that parliament would back him on the
missile issue. He said: 'I hope the parliament will see present-day
realities, see the essence of this agreement and the wishes of the three
states. When they understand this they will support the agreement.'
A senior official of Gasprom, the Russian monopoly gas producer, yesterday
said that if a gas-for-weapons swap and an agreement on debt forgiveness had
been agreed 'at the highest level', Gasprom would have to be compensated,
and the state had no resources to do that. Ukraine owes the Russians
Rbs1,000bn for gas supplies, one-third of their total debt to Moscow.
Mr Kravchuk's willingness to sign the nuclear missile accord, even at the
price of strong domestic opposition, has demonstrated Russia's growing
influence over its Slav neighbour, now racked by hyperinflation, falling
production and energy shortages.
The promise of lower oil and gas prices has also been used to get agreement
between Russia and Belarus on economic union between the two states.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday met Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarus head of
state, but the official communique issued after the meeting made no mention
of the agreement signed in principle last week by the two countries' prime
ministers and central bankers.

<TEXT>
West German annual inflation averaged 4.2 per cent in 1993, the highest rate
since 1982, the federal statistics office said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Bonn.
Announcing a slight upward revision in provisional figures, the office said
consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in December from the previous month to
give a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent.
The annual average rate of 4.2 per cent compared with 4 per cent in 1992. It
was the highest since 1982, when prices rose 5.3 per cent.
Although the final December figures were fractionally higher than the
preliminary data, economists said inflation had peaked and would fall
steadily throughout 1994.
Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said he
saw the figure falling to 2.7 per cent by the end of the year.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Stockholm tries to bridge gap over Danish link:
Environmental wrangles in cabinet are delaying one of Europe's biggest
infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's centre-right government will today make a renewed attempt to break
a deadlock that is holding up the start of work on building a bridge and
tunnel link across the Oresund to Denmark - one of Europe's biggest
infrastructure projects.
A wrangle over environmental objections to the link has caused some
embarrassment to Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, destabilising his
minority coalition and undercutting his enthusiastic commitment to tying
Sweden closer to the European mainstream. It has also aroused irritation in
Denmark which is keen to get on with the project.
Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party, the Liberal and Christian Democrat
coalition partners and the opposition Social Democrats are all backing the
link, which was first agreed in a treaty signed by Stockholm and Copenhagen
in 1991. It is seen as a vital parallel project to Sweden's application to
join the European Union, which is also due to be decided this year.
But the Centre party, the fourth member of the governing coalition, has dug
its heels in against the project on environmental grounds, and claims to
have the support of almost half the population. Their concerns are that the
main bridge section will impede salt water flows into the Baltic which are
vital to the health of the already heavily polluted sea. They also argue
that exhaust emissions on the bridge will break Danish and Swedish
commitments made at the Rio environmental summit not to increase levels of
such pollutants.
The 17km combined road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the
southern Swedish city of Malmo has the strong support of Swedish industry
and unions. Like the political parties, they see the bridge/tunnel - the
first fixed link between Sweden and the European mainland - as a valuable
boost to the economy.
The Swedish side particularly has already gone to painstaking lengths,
including expensive redesigns of the bridge, to minimise the environmental
impact. But Mr Bildt has so far failed to overcome the objections of the
Centre party, whose leader, Mr Olof Johansson, is environment minister.
What Mr Bildt is struggling to achieve is a political compromise that allows
the government to give the final green light to the Oresund link, without
prompting the Centre party to quit the coalition. In his favour is the
undisguised unwillingness of Mr Johansson and his colleagues to be forced
into such a position.
Some formulation allowing the Centre party to dissent from customary
unanimous cabinet decisions may provide a way out. But there was little sign
yesterday that such a compromise was in sight, and Mr Johansson indicated
that another postponement of a final decision was likely.
The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the link is due to
invite construction tenders early this year. On the Danish side, work on
some of the approach roads and site clearances has already begun. The total
cost, including associated construction on the Danish and Swedish sides, is
around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.68bn) to be paid back in rail fees and
vehicle tolls.
Supporters say the link will transform the Copenhagen and Malmo areas and
will have beneficial effects for both nation's economies.
The combined Copenhagen-Malmo region has a population of 2.3m, making it the
20th largest urban concentration in Europe and the eighth largest in terms
of purchasing power - giving much greater critical economic mass than the
two can muster separately.
The Oresund link will cut travel times between the two city centres from a
minimum 90 minutes at present to around 30 minutes. For Swedish industry
particularly, the rail link will offer much faster transit times for freight
that otherwise goes by ferry - halving the time it takes to move freight by
rail from Malmo to Hamburg, for example.
'It will also provide an integrated labour market in eastern Denmark and
southern Sweden. You can have commuter trains using the bridge,' says Mr
Lars Kritz of the Federation of Swedish Industries. 'That must be good for
industry and trade.'

<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a key aide of Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
yesterday failed to become speaker of the upper house of parliament by a few
votes, as regional leaders snubbed the head of state by giving almost equal
support to an ultra-nationalist factory director.
Mr Shumeiko sought to woo the regional leaders who sit in the Federation
Council by promising them more powers, as well as a shift in economic
policy, and less interference from the president.
But Mr Pyotr Romanov, manager of a Siberian oil refinery who stressed his
patriotism and the importance of state power, picked up 79 votes against Mr
Shumeiko's 81. According to a colleague from St Petersburg, Mr Romanov is a
member of the Russian National Assembly, a right-wing organisation headed by
a hardline KGB general.
The victor in a repeat vote needs to obtain support of at least half the
171-strong Federation Council.
The election of Mr Shumeiko, a first deputy prime minister and close
associate of Mr Yeltsin, would confirm the upper chamber, or Federation
Council, as the more co-operative of the two parliamentary chambers.
Fresh squabbling broke out yesterday among deputies of the lower chamber,
the State Duma, even though it was not in session, when Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, leader of the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, insisted
that he should become speaker.
A meeting of faction leaders broke up after members representing Russia's
Choice, Russian Unity, Accord, and Women of Russia walked out in protest
over his attempt to renege on a deal to give the job to a candidate from the
women's party.
They later reconvened to try to pick a speaker, with all factions agreeing
to block his Liberal Democratic party should Mr Zhirinovsky try to take over
proceedings without their agreement.
Mr Shumeiko, who got himself elected to the Federation Council from the
Russian-speaking enclave of Kaliningrad, had earlier proposed that if the
State Duma blocked legislation, the new Federation Council could take on new
functions - say approving the budget - not foreseen for it by the
constitution.
He also promised a vigorous defence of the interests of Russia's restless
regions. He suggested the abolition of the system of presidential
representatives in the regions, who he said duplicated the functions of the
governors, and proposed that powerful regional groupings, such as the
Siberian Agreement, a loose association of provinces in Siberia, be enlisted
to help draft legislation favourable to the regions.
Complaining that 'the western-style liberal social order could turn out to
be alien to Russia', Mr Shumeiko reiterated plans for a shift in economic
policy 'which would turn our face to producers'. This shift in priorities,
away from those desired by radical reformers such as the deputy prime
minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, has already been set out by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister.
Reformers argue that it is not possible genuinely to stabilise output unless
enterprises are made more efficient by greater financial discipline and
inflation is sharply reduced. But many regional officials, brought up to
value industrial output targets in the old communist era, favour a more
traditional approach, especially since they would have to deal directly with
the open joblessness, rather than hidden unemployment, that would follow
more radical policies.
Meanwhile, Democratic Russia, the anti-communist movement that has been an
important and consistent source of support for Mr Yeltsin, yesterday warned
that it would go into opposition against him if he removed radical reformers
from the government, as expected in a reshuffle due next week. They
complained specifically about plans to keep Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, a
conservative closely affiliated to the communist-oriented Agrarian party, as
first deputy prime minister responsible for agriculture.

A preliminary study of air strikes against Serb targets in the United
Nations effort to feed besieged Moslem enclaves in Bosnia was ordered
yesterday by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the new head of UN peacekeeping forces in former
Yugoslavia, will today visit Belgrade as part of a mission to investigate
the prospects for opening the airport in Tuzla, the biggest government
enclave, and facilitating the rotation of some 300 Canadian peacekeepers
stranded in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
At the close of a two-day Nato summit, the 16 member countries issued a
joint declaration warning all three warring parties - but the Serbs in
particular - that the use of air strikes remained an option.
Those impeding UN operations in Srebrenica and Tuzla had to realise that
'force is available' to support relief efforts, said Mr John Major, UK prime
minister.
Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, he refused, however, to give a
firm guarantee that Nato would use force to assist the relief effort in
Bosnia. He stressed that UN commanders on the ground would have to give the
go-ahead first.
But in a familiar response, Bosnian Serb leaders scoffed at the renewed Nato
threats. Political and military leaders this week repeated their vehement
refusal to allow the opening of Tuzla airport, which UN relief workers say
would be an important life-line to the desperate city.
Serb chieftains indicated, however, that they would allow the relief of the
Canadians in Srebrenica.
They have called a session of their 'parliament' for Monday to decide
whether to adopt a new platform to put forward at partition talks, due to be
held in Geneva on January 18.
While Serb leaders dismissed the Nato communique as a 'storm in a teacup',
the response in Sarajevo was also lukewarm. A Bosnian radio commentary
appeared to warn against false hopes. It said the stepped-up of threats
should not be taken seriously, describing the show of Nato air strength over
Bosnia's skies as a 'spectacle'.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Brussels set to block aid for Klockner mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is preparing to block subsidies from the city-state
of Bremen to Klockner-Werke's steel mill, a move which could plunge the
region even deeper into recession.
Brussels has just received the German government's response to a request for
more details about last November's sale of the steel mill. Sources yesterday
described the reply as 'absolutely unsatisfactory'.
The Commission is likely to open a formal state aid inquiry within the next
10 days into the city-state's plan to inject DM200m (Pounds 78m) of cash
into the mill. It is then almost certain to outlaw the subsidy, which was
aimed at maintaining the loss-making mill's annual crude steel production of
3m tonnes.
Private German steelmakers had expressed outrage at the November deal, under
which Klockner-Werke agreed to sell 75 per cent of the mill for a symbolic
DM1 to a consortium led by the city-state. Only this week, Mr Brian Moffat,
British Steel chairman, warned that the rescue would make a mockery of the
European Union's call for capacity cuts and subsidy limits.
One source said: 'It would be absurd to allow a state aid here, when we have
been actively pursuing cases against other companies.'
The collapse of the deal would be a bitter blow for Bremen, which, after
Saarland, is the state with the highest rate of unemployment in west
Germany. The steel mill and the shipyard, which depends on the mill, are its
biggest employers.
Klockner would probably not suffer directly, although it would have to seek
an alternative buyer. It could turn to Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's
two largest steelmakers, and Usinor-Sacilor of France. Their rival offer,
under which most of the plant would be closed, was rejected in November.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Howe attacks conduct of Iraq arms inquiry: Scott dismisses
as ludicrous accusation that he was 'detective' and 'inquisitor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, DAVID OWEN and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The validity of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry was brought into question
yesterday in a spirited public attack by Lord Howe, the former foreign
secretary.
Appearing as a witness, Lord Howe criticised the conduct of the inquiry in a
lengthy statement, and issued a veiled threat that Lord Justice Scott's
eventual recommendations would be considered invalid by officials and
ministers.
He accused Lord Justice Scott of acting as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate
and judge'. In particular, Lord Howe said he was concerned that witnesses
did not have the right to be represented by counsel or to cross-examine
other witnesses.
Lord Justice Scott described Lord Howe's criticisms as ludicrous and
insisted that no official or minister had complained to the inquiry.
Downing Street emphasised last night that Lord Howe was speaking for himself
and not the government. Lord Justice Scott had to decide on procedures once
the decision on the form of the inquiry had been taken.
However, Lord Howe insisted he had consulted officials and ministers and
said they supported his stand. It also emerged last night that his views are
shared by senior Foreign Office and Downing Street officials. It is not
clear if his attack will undermine the inquiry's conclusions.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to make an immediate statement reaffirming his confidence in Lord
Justice Scott.
Mr Smith said Lord Howe's attack was a 'deliberate and clearly premeditated
attempt' to undermine the findings of the inquiry 'only four days before the
prime minister is due to give evidence'.
Earlier Lord Howe had claimed to be speaking largely on behalf of what he
called his former 'flock' at the Foreign Office - officials, ministers, and
intelligence officers.
He said the Scott inquiry had not fully complied with the 'cardinal
principles' for conducting a public inquiry in a fair way.
'Many of those who are looking at these proceedings from outside are bound
to be less enthusiastic to accept conclusions in so far as the cardinal
principles have not been complied with,' Lord Howe said.
The 'principles' referred to by Lord Howe are guidelines for the conduct of
public inquiries laid down by the Salmon royal commission report of 1965.
The commission was set up after strong criticism of Lord Denning's inquiry
into the Profumo affair. It recommended that witnesses should be allowed to
be represented by counsel.
Downing Street would not be drawn on whether the procedures adopted by Lord
Justice Scott were right or wrong. Mr Major would have a better idea of this
after he appears next Monday.
It pointed out that if Lord Justice Scott's investigations had taken the
form of a tribunal of inquiry, the matter would have been sub judice and
subject to reporting restrictions.
In a statement read out by the secretary to the inquiry, Mr Christopher
Muttukumaru, Lord Justice Scott said the inquiry's procedures were
'established with a view to ensuring its efficient conduct while paying full
regard to the need to safeguard the interests of individuals'.
He pointed out that witnesses were allowed to ask for legal assistance and
would be given every opportunity to respond to personal criticism of their
conduct before the final report.
Later, Lord Justice Scott received a vote of confidence from Lord Armstrong
of Ilminster, former head of the civil service, who said he was sure the
judge was conducting the inquiry with 'judicial fairness.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Rail sell-off threatens to limit scope of discount fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail passengers travelling on cut-price tickets may find themselves paying
more for their journeys or facing a reduced service if present plans for
discount fares after privatisation are adopted.
The full impact of the government's approach to discount fares emerged
yesterday after publication by Transport 2000, a pressure group, of details
of a leaked internal British Rail document. It described promises that rail
companies would honour each other's tickets as 'a bit of a con'.
The companies that take over BR's operations will not be obliged to accept
discounted tickets issued by other companies, Transport 2000 said. It
claimed that eight out of 10 rail tickets sold are discounted Apex, Saver or
Supersaver tickets, although BR said it estimated that at most half of rail
tickets, excluding season tickets, were discounted.
Travellers who buy a discounted return fare might find themselves unable to
take the first train home, because it is run by a rival company, or be
forced to buy another ticket, Transport 2000 said.
'Customers might turn up at the station to find they cannot catch the next
three trains as they are run by another company,' said Mr Barry Doe, a
travel consultant. 'I don't think the public will tolerate that.'
The office of franchise director, which is in charge of selling off BR's
routes, said there had never been any intention to compel the rail operators
to recognise each other's discount fares, although they will be expected to
accept full-fare and season tickets.
Forcing rail companies to accept discount tickets by 'central Diktat' would
undermine the process of privatisation and stifle innovation on fares, it
added. But it does expect the rail operators to reach mutual agreements to
recognise each other's tickets as a way of increasing business.
The leaked BR document, written by Mr Michael Beswick, a senior manager,
said: 'Anyone with knowledge of the BR fares structure will regard
interavailability - being confined to full-fare tickets - as a bit of a con.
It is however probably an income-maximising option for the railway
industry.' BR confirmed that the document was genuine.
Mr Stephen Joseph, Transport 2000 director, said: 'This paper shows that
some of our worst fears about rail privatisation are coming true. Many
travellers will face backdoor fare increases or will be barred from using
some trains. The rail sell-off will make the complex fare structure even
more confusing for passengers.'
A traveller paying Pounds 59 for a Supersaver ticket from London to Glasgow
would have to return with the same railway company or pay a total of Pounds
126 to travel. Transport 2000 plans to ask ministers to have operators agree
cheap fares for every route.
Sea Containers, a shipping company that has expressed an interest in bidding
for the rail franchises, said it expected rail companies to negotiate deals
to accept each other's tickets. 'We would want to develop the principle of
allowing pensioners and others to travel more cheaply off-peak. The future
depends on getting as many people to travel as possible.'

FT  13 JAN 94 / Clinton to face probe into funds allegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US attorney-general Ms Janet Reno yesterday said she would seek a special
counsel to investigate President Bill Clinton's involvement with a bankrupt
Arkansas savings and loan institution in the 1980s. The move came at the
request of Mr Clinton following mounting political pressure on the
president.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, a senior White House counsellor, said there were
no credible allegations of wrongdoing by the president or Mrs Hillary
Clinton, but 'this controversy is becoming too much of a distraction'.
Complaining of a 'barrage of innuendo, political posturing and irresponsible
accusations', Mr Stephanopoulos said the appointment of a special counsel
was not justified by the facts and set a bad precedent.
Nevertheless, he said, no one at the White House wanted the controversy over
Mr Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development, an Ozark Mountains
property venture, to interfere with the White House agenda.
White House officials had hoped to deflect the mounting controversy over
Whitewater by turning over all their documents to a Justice Department
investigator.
But senators from the president's own Democratic party have this week joined
his Republican opponents in demanding the appointment of a special counsel,
undercutting the White House's attempts to fend off the controversy as mere
political feuding.
by calling for a Senate select committee similar to those which investigated
the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals.
foreign policy image.
The controversy springs from Mr and Mrs Clinton's investment in Whitewater
in partnership with Mr James McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty, an
Arkansas thrift.
Republicans say that Madison, which failed in 1989 at a cost of about
Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) to the government, was loosely supervised because
of Mr McDougal's political connections and may have channelled money
improperly to Whitewater and to Mr Clinton's election funds.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Jobless rate declines to under 10%: Sterling rises as
Treasury rules out cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's steadily improving economic outlook received a further boost
yesterday with news that unemployment in December fell below 10 per cent of
the workforce for the first time since July 1992.
But the greater than expected fall in unemployment was coupled with comments
from Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, that there would
be 'no change for the time being in interest rates'. This triggered a sharp
rise in sterling and a steep fall in equity prices.
The pound rose over 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark, bursting through the
DM2.60 barrier, to close in London at DM2.6072, and added a cent against the
dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.5013. In New York sterling finished at
DM2.6032 and Dollars 1.5035. Fading hopes of an early base rate cut from the
present level of 5.5 per cent along with falls in worldwide equity markets,
depressed the London stock market with the FT-SE 100 index closing 41.8 down
at 3372.0.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell 46,800 to 2,766,000 in December, or
9.8 per cent of the workforce. November's decline was also revised upwards
by 3,000 to 39,000. Unemployment has now declined for four consecutive
months, and dropped 226,000 since it peaked in January 1993. On an
unadjusted basis, December's unemployment total rose 13,000 to 2,783,000.
Figures for unfilled vacancies at job centres rose 4,500 to 145,400 in
December. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the downward trend
was now firmly established, although he felt the overall total was still
'unacceptably high'.
The only weak point in the jobs figures was the manufacturing sector, where
employment fell by 7,000 in December and the amount of overtime worked
dropped to 8.11m hours per week, the lowest figure since record started to
be kept in 1976.
The good news on the jobless front overshadowed big redundancies announced
by National Westminster Bank, which said it was cutting another 4,200 jobs
in 1994, and British Petroleum which is closing its chemicals plant at
Baglan Bay in South Wales with the loss of 600 jobs.
The employment figures were the latest encouraging statistics to be
discussed at the monthly monetary meeting held yesterday between Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England.
The Treasury's monthly monetary report, published yesterday for the meeting,
pointed to subdued inflationary pressures - a view confirmed by statistics
showing a 3 per cent annual increase in average earnings in November,
unchanged from the October rise and a 25 year low.
According to Mr Hunt, the UK has the 'prospect of a long period of
sustainable non-inflationary growth'. However, Ms Ann Clwyd, Labour's
employment spokesperson, said: 'With the real level of unemployment above
four million, the government is using discredited statistics to con the
public that it has the economy under control.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British train drivers who will operate Channel tunnel services are to
receive pay rises of around 30 per cent. Average annual salaries will rise
to Pounds 25,000 under flexible agreements based on performance-related pay
reached by rail union Aslef with Railfreight Distribution and European
Passenger Services, currently subsidiaries of British Rail.
Aslef sees the deal as a model for agreements with new train operating
companies after rail privatisation begins on April 1.

growth

<TEXT>
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch state-owned telecommunications and
postal company which is due to be privatised this year, said profits growth
in 1993 was at least equal to the rates of increase seen in recent years.
Mr Wim Dik, chairman, gave no absolute figures but his remarks, contained in
a new year address to management, suggest that profit rose by several
percentage points last year. In 1992, net profit was up 3.4 per cent at Fl
1.66bn (Dollars 850m), following increases of 2.2 per cent in 1991 and 6.4
per cent in 1990.
Mr Dik said turnover broke through the Fl 17bn mark for the first time in
1993. This implies a rise of at least 8.8 per cent from net turnover of Fl
15.6bn in 1992. The improvements in sales and profits were recorded in both
telecommunications and postal services.
The company's postal arm is one of only two postal operations in Europe to
record a profit, along with that of the UK.
The flotation will probably take place in the spring.

<TEXT>
Greece's socialist government is about to approve a 1994 pay increase for
state workers of 5 per cent in January and 5 per cent in July, Labour
Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos said yesterday, Reuter reports from Athens.
He expected the government to finalise its decision tomorrow.
The pay rise, averaging 7-8 per cent over the year, would be adjusted in
January 1995 if the government failed to cut inflation to under 10 per cent
by December. Inflation was 12.1 per cent year-on-year at the end of 1993.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commission struggles to hold ring on animal welfare in EU:
An issue that deeply divides member states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four British men were recently challenged by a vegan author to spend a week
living like battery hens in return for a payment of Pounds 10,000. They were
required to squat in a scaled-up cage with no toilet facilities living off
rice and beans.
The fact that they lasted only 18 hours before giving up was heralded as a
triumph by some of Britain's more radical animal welfare campaigners.
Farmers were scathing: 'How the hell can you compare feelings of a human
being with those of a hen?' said one livestock producer.
There has been a big public response to the British campaign by the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. But, like other national
governments in the European Union, the British cannot make changes to
legislation on animal welfare without the sanction of Brussels.
Rules governing the treatment of farm animals which include journey time
limits and the size of battery hen cages are set in Europe. But the European
Commission is deeply divided between countries in the north and south.
'The trouble is, there is little tradition of animal welfare in countries
like Italy and Spain,' said one Commission official. Public pressure groups
pushing for improved conditions for animals are also not so well established
in these countries.
The gulf between different EU countries was evident last month when the
Commission tried to get agreement on new rules governing the transport of
live animals.
Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark insisted on an eight-hour time limit on
shipment of animals before they must be rested, fed and watered. The UK
wanted to impose a 15-hour limit which is applied on its domestic transit,
while southern member countries wanted no limits at all.
The result is that existing rules allowing a 24-hour journey without a break
remain in place and the Commission has agreed to open further consultations
with scientists.
Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, told a recent meeting of a
pan-European animal welfare lobby that the well-being of animals was a
political priority for him. 'But it's a complex question which touches on
many different interests which are not always reconcilable.'
These different interests were illustrated by the public outrage in the UK
recently when the RSPCA released undercover videos showing conditions in
some Spanish abattoirs where sheep were not being adequately stunned before
slaughter. Although European Union rules are in place, the Spanish
government has told the Commission it is difficult getting workers on the
ground to apply them.
UK farmers argue that Britain has some of the highest standards in the world
for the treatment of farm animals. But animal welfare issues raise the
public's ire more than almost any other controversy.
The British government has been receiving 1,000 letters a day from people
concerned about the transport of live lambs to the Continent following the
RSPCA's high- profile advertising campaign. Newspaper advertisements show
lambs crushed into lorries with no food and water and the caption: 'Before
they're roasted in garlic and rosemary they're soaked in urine and
excrement.'
The Commission's resources for policing infringements of animal welfare
rules itself are stretched. It has only 20 inspectors for checking on
abattoirs and conditions of animals in transit and must rely on a great deal
of co-operation from local authorities.
Exporters have not been won over on the issue of transport, however. Mr
David Parker who runs the British Association of Sheep Exporters, calls the
RSPCA's campaign 'highly emotive and entirely unobjective'.
He has reported it to the Advertising Standards Authority for
misrepresenting conditions among sheep on cross-channel journeys. He says
the trucks shown in the newspaper pictures are not export lorries and the
photos are not dated to show when the transport was taking place.
Mr Parker believes the emphasis put on time limits is misleading as the most
traumatic thing for the animals is unloading and loading them. 'Trials have
shown that, as long as they are handled well, it is far better to move sheep
in one go rather than unload them into a strange building and give them food
and water,' he said.
Growing demand by continental slaughter houses has meant increasing exports
of live British lambs in recent years and almost 3m will make the crossing
this year.
Although it is more expensive to ship live sheep, prices are high enough to
make the journey worthwhile. Mr Parker said that an eight-hour limit would
add about another Pounds 1 to the cost of transporting each animal but the
trade would still be financially viable.
However, if an eight-hour limit were imposed, the trucking of sheep from
Scotland to the West Country would be affected and the extra costs could be
enough to put some slaughterhouses out of business.
Some countries have suggested that responsibility for forming legislation on
the handling of animals should be devolved to a national level. But the
Commission has staunchly refused. 'There is no question of giving up these
issues to member states - it would allow for unfair competition,' said one
official.
So Europe is stuck with its unwieldy decision-making process which
frustrates the hopes of thousands of campaigners. But the Commission has
managed to push through rules stipulating that hens in battery cages should
have slightly more space from 1995.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Conde stands by rescue plan drawn up by JP Morgan:
'Banesto's situation did not require any emergency action'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde, the former president of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank,
yesterday criticised the Spanish authorities for imposing a new management
on the bank, and claimed he had been restoring it to financial health.
In his first public statement since he was ousted two weeks ago, Mr Conde
told a press conference he believed a rescue plan which he had presented to
the Bank of Spain days before the intervention would have been successful.
He still believed the plan developed with the advice of JP Morgan, the US
bank, 'was the best solution for Banesto, for its shareholders, and for the
domestic financial sector'.
But Mr Conde said he did not intend to take legal action against the
authorities. He would merely lodge a routine appeal against the
intervention. He had decided against legal action because he wanted to
respect the image of Spain and of its banking supervisors.
'Banesto's situation on December 28 did not require any emergency action,
particularly from the point of view of its liquidity and its solvency,' Mr
Conde said. He added that the bank did not require any write-down of equity
under the plan that he had presented to the authorities.
The intervention followed an inspection by the Bank of Spain which
identified a potential Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) over-valuation of its
Pta7,000bn assets. Banesto and JP Morgan estimated the over-valuation at
Pta372bn.
Mr Conde disputed in detail the estimate by the Bank of Spain that Banesto's
loan portfolio was over-valued by Pta223bn. Banesto and JP Morgan estimated
the loan over-valuation at at Pta166bn.
Mr Conde said that the loans had been examined and were in the process of
being provisioned for. 'Our plan was exhaustively analysed by JP Morgan
which estimated that our projected balance sheet was sensible and
reasonable,' he said.
Mr Conde rejected outright the Bank of Spain's estimate of a Pta66bn pension
fund shortfall saying that an earlier inspection by the Bank of Spain in
December 1992 had put the shortfall at Pta30bn and it had given eight years
to make provisions for it.
He also said that a Pta81bn over-valuation estimated by the inspectors last
September for Banesto's industrial holding company was unwarranted as there
were no legal or accounting rules that called on the bank to provide for
such assets.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Russia's MPs impose chaos on order: Leyla Boulton looks on,
bemused, as parliament opens in Moscow to a medley of decisions about
decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is a disgrace,' muttered Mr Sergei Kovalyov, a leader of Russia's
Choice, the radical reform bloc set up by leading reformist ministers.
'This is a joke,' fumed Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, as the morning
session of Russia's first multi-party parliament dissolved into four hours
of chaotic argument over whether to take a break.
President Boris Yeltsin's new legislature was suspiciously like the
disgraced Soviet-era parliament - unruly. But yesterday it was democracy in
action.
'It's the beginning of democracy, of something like a parliament. The west
had 200 to 300 years to develop democracy while we have had just a few,'
said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the reformist Yabloko bloc. 'This is
not a joke.'
Meanwhile, stung by accusations that he represents a serious threat to
democracy, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, tried hard
to project an image of respectability, but finally gave up and began
shouting.
To the applause of his Liberal Democrats, the second largest group in
parliament after Russia's Choice, Mr Zhirinovsky ordered the chamber to stop
trying to remove Mr Georgy Lukava - a member of his party who by virtue of
being the oldest deputy was serving as temporary speaker.' We'll go away and
discuss the new speaker until midnight or six in the morning if necessary,'
he cried at the top of his voice. 'But he won't go away until a legally
elected speaker comes to take his place.'
But Mr Zhirinovsky's help was not enough to stop the 68-year-old academic in
military uniform from sinking into the parliamentary quicksand. Error
followed error and Mr Lukava finally agreed to share his job with senior
citizens from the other factions.
Not that the parliament is short of experienced deputies, with the chamber
reading like a Who's Who from its two predecessors. Most prominent was Mr
Anatoly Lukyanov, speaker of the Soviet parliament accused of masterminding
the 1991 coup against Mr Gorbachev. As Mr Lukava floundered away, many saw
Mr Lukyanov as an ideal speaker, for all his past sins.
But after two years in jail and with possible charges still pending after
the failure of the coup trial to come to any conclusions, he looked tired
and fragile and said he had no desire to return to the speaker's chair.
Meanwhile, the shadow of Mr Zhirinovsky and his likely alliance with the
Communists, Agrarians, and ultra-nationalists, had the pro-democracy forces
on high alert, resorting to every filibuster they could think of to
influence events.
As the Liberal Democrats tried to hurry along procedural votes, Russia's
Choice first threatened to walk out and then refused to register its
deputies, successfully depriving the assembly of a quorum and ensuring that
the logistics of the new parliament were as chaotic as its first
deliberations.

FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Disease hits Geest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disease in Costa Rica and market oversupply forced banana group Geest to
issue a profits warning. The shares plummeted on the news, closing 87 down
at 276p. Analysts, concerned at not being warned of the potential damage to
profits of the disease at a round of meetings with the group in December,
rushed to chop profits forecasts.
Strauss Turnbull, which was expecting profits of Pounds 12m, has reduced its
forecast to a Pounds 4m loss. However, some food specialists said the low
share price could encourage a bid, possibly from one of Geest's US admirers.
The profits warning also hit Fyffes, although the stock recovered to close 5
off at 100p.
Television group LWT Holdings receded 23 to 673p as it continued to throw up
barriers to the recent bid by Granada. It predicted a rise of more than 40
per cent in its 1993 profits and expected to pay a final dividend of 14p a
share.
However, one leading securities house is today advising clients to accept
the offer, arguing that Granada will not raise it and there are significant
benefits for LWT shareholders. Granada declined 8 to 572p.
Other perceived television takeover targets Yorkshire Tyne Tees TV and
Anglia moved forward 7 to 188p and 5 to 479p respectively.
Bank shares, among the market's best performers last year as institutions
focused on the benefits that would accrue from falling interest rates and
their impact on the economy, tumbled yesterday in the wake of bearish notes
from two stockbroking houses.
Hoare Govett was said to have wrought the biggest damage, telling its
clients that the sector was 'fully valued on all measures', and weightings
should be 'selectively reduced'. Robert Fleming Securities was also said to
have been advising a bearish stance.
Hoare told clients to use strength in the run-up to February's full year
figures to reduce weightings in HSBC, National Westminster and the Scottish
banks, but remained bullish on long term dividend prospects at TSB and
Barclays.
Lloyds dropped 17 to 620p, Barclays 12 to 597p, NatWest 13 to 597p and HSBC
10 to 916p. Standard Chartered fell 30 to 1179p. There was heavy trading in
TSB, scheduled to announce preliminary figures tomorrow, and the shares
slipped 9 to 250p on turnover of 9.4m.
Eurotunnel fell sharply after surprising the market with a pricing structure
in line with rival ferry operators, against expectations that the Channel
tunnel operator would announce a more competitive pricing structure. The
shares tumbled 17 to 608p, though the poor market trend was said to have
played a part in the slide.
Eurotunnel's pricing structure cheered investors in ferry operator P&amp;O. The
stock was up 12 at best before relinquishing the rise in the poor market
trend to end a net 3 lighter at 630p. Volume was 2.7m.
BAT Industries weakened 17 to 538p after US house Morgan Stanley joined a
downbeat mood surrounding the tobacco to insurance group, downgrading the
stock and lowering its 1993 forecast to Pounds 1.84bn from Pounds 1.88bn.
Reuters Holdings closed 9 higher at 1872p, with NatWest Securities marking
out the company as its favoured stock in the sector. The rise built on sharp
gains last week following talk that Reed International was lining up a bid
for the group. Reed fell 17 to 882p.
Mining group RTZ appreciated 6 to 853p as chart analysts at agency broker
James Capel predicted that the shares could reach 900p soon.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks benefited from US buying on Monday night.
Gains were eroded in late trading, leaving Glaxo just 2 up at 682p, Wellcome
8 ahead at 696p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' a penny harder at 407p.
British Gas declined 4 1/2 to 347 1/2 p as the market fretted about the
company's dividend potential. Adding to the stock's discomfiture was a
cautious note from Hoare Govett, the company's stockbroker.
Courtaulds Textiles climbed 8 to 517p after the group announced that it had
agreed to buy a French weaver and lace manufacturer.
Magellan Industries plummeted 44 to 168p after the swimwear and lingerie
group reported that production problems had hit 1993 sales.
Merchant banks attracted flurries of strong support, with most stocks
advancing to all-time highs as turnover in the stock market and from new
issues continued at record levels.
Hambros forged ahead 15 to equal the stock's peak of 403p, while Kleinwort
Benson, which topped the 1993 mergers and acquisitions league table, moved
up 11 to 607p and threatened its pre-October 1987 high of 615p. Singer &amp;
Friedlander was 3 1/2 firmer at 92p.
Good results from Stakis saw the shares advance 4 to 75p. NatWest Securities
has pencilled in a forecast of Pounds 18m for 1994. The same broker advised
caution ahead of Rank Organisation's results, expected tomorrow. The shares
surrendered 20 to 993p.
Storehouse jumped on the news of a 13 per cent increase in trade in the six
weeks up to Christmas, against analysts' expectations of around 7 per cent.
However, the shares fell back to finish 3 down on balance at 239p as
analysts digested the detail of the statement and worries were expressed
about slightly weaker margins.
Laura Ashley's announcement on trading was better received and the shares
put on 7 at 85p.
Hillsdown Holdings was lifted by its trading statement, the shares gaining 7
at 178p.
Chemical distribution group Ellis &amp; Everard improved 4 to 245p as Hoare
Govett published a buy recommendation and upgraded its 1994 and 1995
forecasts.

FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big share placing in GUS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large placing in Great Universal Stores saw the group recording its
highest ever daily share turnover. Smith New Court was believed to have
bought a line of 13m shares for an undisclosed price from one institution
and placed them at 610p. Dealers said the shares were sold to a number of
institutions. At the end of yesterday's session the stock had retreated 6 to
620p with turnover reaching 19m.
Initially, analysts were worried that the seller was the Wolfson Foundation,
the charitable body that controlled the group until its recent share
restructuring, and which still holds an 8.6 per cent stake.
Any such move could have affected how GUS dealt with its large cash pile -
estimated at Pounds 1.7bn for the year to March 1994. There have been hopes
that the company will launch a share buy-back scheme.

FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground as base rate hopes
cool - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A postponement of hopes for the next long predicted reduction in domestic
interest rates cut into stock market confidence in London yesterday.
Although selling was modest, the FT-SE 100 Index fell by nearly 27 points,
wiping out much of the gain achieved on Friday afternoon and brushing aside
the record close on Wall Street overnight.
A firm opening, on the back of Wall Street's 44-point advance, was soon
unpicked by a dull futures market. Share prices slid away, with the less
confident tone on interest rate prospects reflected in a firm undertone in
sterling. Although the stock market had largely resigned itself to waiting
until spring for a base rate cut, the latest data on UK housing starts,
consumer credit and overseas trade have suggested that stronger economic
growth will set the background to this morning's meeting between Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of
the Bank of England.
Also suggesting increasing confidence, and therefore reduced pressures for a
base rate cut, were several surveys of business opinion, including a view
from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US based business information group, that UK
businesses are seeking higher prices. At least one equity strategist raised
the market's fears that domestic interest rates could be under upward
pressures soon.
There was little relief for the market as New York opened the new session
with a fall of 10 Dow points and London's stock index futures remained
discouraging. Traders commented that the institutions were no longer
switching into second line stocks, but merely trimming holdings in Footsie
shares.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,413.8, with a net fall of 26.8.
The second line sector shared in the malaise of the blue chips, leaving the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index down 12.2 at 3,889.2. Non-Footsie business remained
high, making up around 65 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total of 882.8m
shares traded. In the previous session, 849.1m shares through the Seaq
electronic network returned a retail business worth of Pounds 1.75bn.
Equity strategists were inclined to underplay the implications of the latest
economic statistics and commentaries. At Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage
house, Mr Robin Aspinall commented that 'businesses always want to put up
prices', and denied that the rise in consumer credit indicated rapidly
rising borrowing.
There were also signs that the big securities houses were beginning to hold
back equity investment as they positioned themselves ahead of the auction of
government bonds expected at the end of the week.
Retail issues, still awaiting convincing news on the Christmas sales period,
lacked support and some high street banks were also easier ahead of the
sector reporting season, which is about to open.
With base rate hopes now taking back seat, the market's second hope for a
further advance rests on the prospects for the annual reporting season from
British companies. The best share performances over 1993 came from the
financial sector, with merchant banks, lending banks and properties showing
the strongest gains. Strong valuations of shares in these sectors have left
them highly dependent upon good profits news. But merchant banks, which have
benefited from the strength of securities markets, came in for renewed
buying yesterday.

FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fading hopes of a cut in UK interest rates brought about a heavy sell-off in
the derivatives sector, pulling the underlying cash market lower, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index had been expected to come
in strongly following the buoyant overnight performance of Wall Street.
However, with a growing feeling that the much anticipated reduction in UK
interest rates was unlikely in the near term, institutions needed few
incentives to turn sellers.
Having opened at 3,455, around 8 points below Monday's closing level, the
March contract tumbled further, with a number of equity sell programmes said
to have served to increase selling of the future.
Bargain hunting, together with anticipation of a higher Wall Street, reduced
earlier losses and saw March move forward early in the afternoon for the
first time in the session. But those hopes proved unfounded when Wall Street
retreated at the opening, once again causing a slide in the contract.
The March future often traded at a discount during the session and it closed
at the day's lowest point of 3,426, a three-point discount to its fair value
premium of around 13 points. Volume was 13,356 at the close.
Strong trading in the FT-SE 100 option boosted total turnover in the sector
to 40,776 lots, against a previous 33,868 dealt. The volume in the FT-SE 100
option was 17,134, up from Monday's 9,131. Ladbroke was the most active
among the stock options as a total of 3,520 contracts were traded, the
single biggest trade being in the May 200 calls and puts.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities start new year in
strong mood - Foreigners have led the buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year which looked set to be overshadowed by political and economic
uncertainty has started with fireworks in Brazil, where the main stock
exchanges have gained some 20 per cent in US dollar terms since the start of
the year.
Aggressive foreign buying, especially from the US, has led to sharp price
rises in a market which is thinly traded and illiquid by international
standards.
Although many in Brazil say that prices will go higher, some foreign
observers appear to be turning cautious, especially after the market climbed
more than 85 per cent in dollar terms last year.
'The market is concentrating almost wholly on the good news and to some
extent has lost touch with reality,' according to Mr Stephen Rose of the
eponymous London-based brokerage.
Sao Paulo, the country's largest exchange, and its smaller rival in Rio de
Janeiro rose 15.4 per cent and 18.5 per cent respectively in US dollar terms
in the first week of January alone. In terms of cruzeiros reais, the
inflation plagued local currency, the gains were about 30 per cent.
The buying has continued this week, and yesterday Sao Paulo's Bovespa index
of the 54 most active shares finished 602 points higher at 50,141.
Popular stocks such as Petrobra, the government controlled petroleum
monopoly, have led the charge, gaining nearly 40 per cent in dollar terms in
just five trading days.
Foreign money started to flow into Brazil last year and has accelerated in
the first weeks of this year. According to unoffical estimates, up to
one-third of last week's heavy average daily volume of Dollars 170m came
from foreign buying, which includes non-resident Brazilians.
Mr Robert Barclay, president of Baring Securities Brasil, estimates that
foreign holdings have increased from about Dollars 3bn to Dollars 10bn in
the last 12 months, of which only part has been due to the market's rise.
'We originally thought 1994 was going to be a bad year because of the
overall uncertainty and tax rises. But the market is now looking ahead to
what could happen in 1995 and beyond,' he says.
On short term fundementals the Brazilian market looks unattractive. An
already weak government runs the risk of becoming a lame duck ahead of
presidential and congressional elections in November. Inflation, which
passed 2,500 per cent last year, looks set to break the psychologically
important 40 per cent a month mark this month.
A 'shock' anti-inflation package announced last month by Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, introduced a number of tax rises
which the private sector complained would hamper economic recovery. As a
result, growth this year has been pencilled in by private sector analysts at
between nil and 3 per cent.
But according to the optimists, whose views have gained prominence in the
local media since the new year, the bulk of Mr Cardoso's shock plan looks
increasingly likely to be approved by congress. If so, a new currency anchor
 -called the URV or unit of real value - will be introduced which, once
linked to the US dollar, could lead to a sharp fall in cruzeiro inflation.
And, the optimists add, Mr Cardoso's plan would lead to a balanced
government budget and possible approval from the International Monetary Fund
of a debt renegotiation with Brazil's commercial creditors. Under such
conditions, the argument runs, market valuations would be revalued upwards
from their present low levels of about 65 to 70 per cent of book values.
These types of 'if' scenarios are alluring in Brazil. As the only major
Latin American economy yet to stabilise its economy, and with a GDP roughly
twice that of Mexico, a successful economic turnround could be spectacular.
'Undoubtedly some people are buying simply out of fear of being left
behind,' according to one observer.
But many remain unconvinced and argue that betting on Mr Cardoso's plan
appears extremely risky given the murky underworld of Brazil's politics.
Further, some analysts add, the market remains volatile and lacks long term
investors to give it stable direction. As a result, last week's gains can be
this week's losses.
'We are telling people to be very cautious and to remember Brazil can go
down extremely fast too,' says Mr Rose.

Mexican equities had recovered most of Monday's substantial losses by
yesterday's close as concern about the recent spate of rebel activity began
to abate.
The IPC index was quoted 95.45 points, or 3.9 per cent, up at 2,554.56 -
this followed a 6.3 per cent drop during the previous session, which was the
biggest one-day percentage fall since October 1989.
Some 146.6m shares were traded and advances outstripped declines by 84 to
22.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall back as
investors take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Profit-taking saw US share prices ease off from their record highs yesterday
as financial markets awaited this week's important inflation news, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.20 at 3,850.31.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index retreated 1.14 to 474.13.
The American SE composite, which languished while other indices rallied on
Monday, firmed 0.59 to 479.37, and the Nasdaq composite finished 1.17 off at
785.52. New York SE trading volume was heavy at 305.5m shares, while falls
led rises by 1,144 to 994.
After posting gains for six consecutive days and setting new record highs
for four of these, no-one was surprised yesterday when profit-taking led to
early declines in share prices. Monday's big 45-point Dow gain was achieved
because of growing confidence among investors about the outlook for the
economy, and their decision to respond to that brighter economic picture by
buying stocks of companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic
cycle.
Share prices were also aided, as they have been since the start of 1994, by
large inflows of institutional funds as money managers sought to put cash
collected in the new year to work in the market.
Yesterday's profit-taking was not as widespread as might have been expected
after such a strong run, which explains why the day's losses were relatively
minimal. Although at one point during the afternoon the Dow was down almost
20 points, there was never any threat of a big sell-off, and S&amp;P and Nasdaq
stocks held their own relatively well.
Analysts noted that investors were unwilling to sell shares before the
release today and tomorrow of the December inflation data. The numbers are
expected to be bullish for bonds and equities, and investors were
understandably wary yesterday about selling ahead of a further rally in
stocks.
Auto shares remained in demand but ended below the session's highs. Chrysler
added Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 59 1/2, Ford Motor Dollars 1 at Dollars 68 1/4
and General Motors Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 59 3/8.
Westinghouse Electric eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 14 after the company
unveiled details of its previously announced restructuring plan, which
includes write-downs, lay-offs and charges against earnings.
Toys 'R' Us put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 3/4 in heavy trading after
revealing plans for a Dollars 1bn share buy-back operation and announcing
that it would open 114 new stores in 1994.
International Paper dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 73 in spite of reporting
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 100m, an improvement on the Dollars 87m
income before special items reported a year earlier.
Canada
Toronto ended slightly easier after a day of busy profit-taking in most
sectors which offset strength in the precious metals group. Traders were not
surprised by the market's softer tone after its torrid pace in recent days.
The TSE 300 index ended 5.8 off at 4,447.4 and declines led rises by 403 to
388 after volume of 81.8m shares. Golds rose 2 per cent but metals and
minerals fell 1.68 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris finishes off best but
still at record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the continent's bourses searched for incentives yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS went ever higher, although the CAC-40 index finished off the day's
best level of 2,349.20, adding 14.08 to a record 2,331.33.
Turnover was FFr8.8bn.
The pricing of Eurotunnel's fare structure had little effect on the share
price by the close, ending just 25 centimes up at FFr55.00, although they
had earlier fallen back to FFr52.25 as some investors took the view that the
fare range was higher than anticipated.
In contrast Michelin gathered FFr10.90 to FFr240.00 following its
announcement after the close of trading on Monday that it was launching a
FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue.
James Capel came out strongly following the news, removing the company from
its sell list and upgrading it to hold, adding that there was scope 'for
sentiment to improve as automotive shares move back into favour'.
In contrast to Monday's firm upward run, trading in FRANKFURT was
unimpressive and the DAX index moved throughtout the session in a narrow 11
point range.
The DAX index closed down 5.04 at 2,228.75. Turnover was DM10bn.
There was little immediate reaction among investors to west German GDP data
for 1993, which showed the worst performance for nearly 50 years, as the
figures had been widely expected.
Metallgesellschaft recouped most of Monday's losses, closing up DM16 at
DM236, while Schering added DM40 to DM1,170 on news that it was to increase
production of one of its products in the US.
Chemical stocks were generally unmoved by a positive wage deal in the west
German sector: Basf put on DM3.60 to DM304.50.
MILAN built on early gains to end four sessions of losses as positions were
covered ahead of the end of the monthly account on Friday. The Comit index
added 13.28 to 602.13, although the mood remained fragile ahead of today's
parliamentary vote of confidence.
Montedison added L23.90 to L928.70 in huge volume of 51.2m shares - three
times the trade of any other share - amid technical covering after the end
of its rights issue. Ferruzzi put on L111 or 7.4 per cent in volume of 5.4m
shares.
Bargain hunting after recent losses lifted industrials. Fiat added L144 to
L4,297 and Pirelli put on L51 to L2,053. Olivetti rose L87 to L2,053 on
renewed hopes that it will win Italy's second cellular telephone license.
ZURICH pulled higher after a weak opening, in further reaction to Monday's
correction, and the SMI index added 10.7 to 3,026.6.
Foreign selling left SMH SFr37 lower at SFr949 while SBC put on SFr18 to
SFr513 as it caught up with recent rises elsewhere in the sector.
Zurich Insurance shed SFr14 to SFr1,558 and Winterthur was SFr11 higher at
SFr859 after one Zurich bank recommended that Winterthur had more potential
for a short term advance than did Zurich.
AMSTERDAM drifted aimlessly although there was a good performance out of DSM
which has been lagging behind other stocks recently.
The chemical groups stock added Fl 2.90 to Fl 110.50, while Akzo improved
just 30 cents to Fl 207.90 on news of the European Commissions approval of
its merger with Nobel.
The AOE index dipped just 0.41 to 424.01.
MADRID surged 1.6 per cent higher to a record close after a brisk day's
trading. The general index rose 5.36 to 3333.39.
The climb was attributed to high liquidity and the calming effect of
comments by Banesto's former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, which gave most
benefit to banking issues.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya added Pta80 to Pta3,095 and Banco Central Hispano put
on Pta85 to Pta3,245.
WARSAW overcame Monday's hesitant mood and the WIG index pushed 1.9 per cent
ahead to a record high as selling slowed down ahead of year-end earnings
reports.
The index rose 272 to 13,558 in turnover of 1,500bn zloties.
ISTANBUL finished at a record high for the fourth straight day in spite of
heavy mid-session profit-taking after an early rally.
The composite index ended 209.43 at a provisional 25,656.6 after a day's
high of 26,788.83.

<TEXT>
Profit-taking by financial institutions and corporations eroded most of the
morning's gains, but the Nikkei average still closed moderately higher,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index, which had gained 1.8 per cent on Monday, added 41.81 at
18,485.25. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 0.45 at
1,500.84, its first decline in nine trading days. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index put on 2.34 at 1,246.50.
The Nikkei rose to a high of 18,671.67 in early trading on continued buying
by foreign investors and arbitrageurs. However, corporate investors realised
gains on holdings to improve profits at the March year-end book closing. The
index dipped to a low of 18,373.04 in the early afternoon.
Traders said selling pressure around the mid-18,000 level remained heavy,
while a fall in the futures market also triggered index-linked selling. But
foreign buying, especially in public works related stocks, helped to counter
the falls.
Volume totalled 446m shares, against Monday's 470m. Rises led declines by
621 to 417, with 135 issues unchanged.
Some banks fell on selling by corporate investors of long term holdings.
Industrial Bank of Japan shed Y40 to Y2,870 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to
Y1,800. However, hopes of a reduction in the securities transaction tax
supported brokers. Nomura Securities rose Y20 to Y2,010 and Nikko Securities
Y20 to Y1,190.
Electric cable and wire companies declined, with Fujikura losing Y3 to Y872.
However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y802,000.
Reports that car makers may start restructuring operations by sharing parts
encouraged investors: Isuzu Motors advanced Y26 to Y423 and Suzuki Motor Y50
to Y1,170.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 106.47 to 20,384.75 in volume of 55.7m
shares. Nintendo rose Y310 to Y7,490.
Roundup
Some of the region's markets fell back sharply after recent gains, but
Karachi and Bangkok went higher.
KUALA LUMPUR plunged nearly 5.6 per cent after Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former
finance minister and leading political figure, commented that the market had
risen too steeply in recent weeks.
The composite index fell 67.20 to 1,139.55 in volume of 566m shares.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London noted that Mr Zainuddin's remarks
were to the point as there had been far too much speculation recently,
particularly in the few days between Christmas and the new year. He expected
the market to consolidate around the 1,000 level.
In SINGAPORE, where Malaysian OTC shares account for more than 60 per cent
of trade, the market slid 3.1 per cent as it paid heed to Mr Zainuddin's
warning. Investors also responded to a rise in interest rates. The Straits
Times Industrials index fell 76.16 to 2,348.20.
HONG KONG dropped sharply but ended above lows as rumours of banks adopting
an even tighter mortgage lending policy sparked profit-taking. The Hang Seng
index fell 211.13 or 1.9 per cent, to 11,155.81, having hit a day's low of
11,072.28. Turnover was HKDollars 7.7bn.
HSBC Holdings, which fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 108, was the most
actively traded stock.
Hongkong Land lost 60 cents to HKDollars 26.40, in spite of an early jump on
the launch of a Dollars 300m convertible bond issue and a nearly 50 per cent
revaluation of its assets at the end of 1993.
TAIWAN shed 1.6 per cent on profit-taking after its bull run and the recent
tightening of liquidity in the money market, which has sent short-term
interest rates soaring.
The weighted index opened higher and peaked at 6,392 before turning down to
finish 103.44 lower at 6,240.39. Turnover was heavy at TDollars 119.29bn.
SEOUL traded higher in a day of low volume on the back of renewed strong
interest in expensive blue chip manufacturings and an absence of selling by
the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund. The composite stock index added
7.98 to 881.02.
MANILA retreated as investors continued to take profits. The composite index
lost 70.17 or 2.2 per cent to 3,089.39. Turnover was 2.2bn pesos.
AUSTRALIA was firmer but a turnaround in the futures market took the local
bourse off its post-1987 crash high set earlier in the day. The All
Ordinaries index added 8.1 to 2,206.7, but down from an intra-day high of
2,216.5. Turnover was ADollars 541.3m.
BANGKOK reversed the losses of Monday and put on nearly 4 per cent. The SET
index gained 59.78 to 1,605.06 in turnover down to some Bt20bn, after last
week's levels of around Bt40bn.
KARACHI set a record high on the last day of the account. The KSE index rose
33.14 to 2,348.46 with financial and energy stocks seeing sharp gains on
heavy buying by institutions. BOMBAY turned cautious as market makers
worried that they could be pressured into complying with the regulator's
order banning forward trade. The BSE 30-share index closed 41.46 down at
3,780.10.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sterling nudges DM2.60
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling remained in the spotlight yesterday, ahead of the monthly monetary
meeting today between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, and Mr
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, writes Gillian Tett.
Before the new year, many were speculating whether the authorities would use
the opportunity to cut UK interest rates. But strong economic news seems to
have reduced this possibility, thereby fuelling sterling's recent strength.
Ironically the upward pressure on the pound has led some analysts to wonder
whether the chancellor might yet be prodded into action.
Meanwhile, sterling strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday, as the German
unit lost ground against most currencies.
The key question currently absorbing the markets is whether the pound will
be able to breach the DM2.60 barrier. After drifting upwards in recent
weeks, the British currency yesterday nudged towards this barrier, touching
DM2.5981, up from yesterday's close of DM2.5883.
But though the rise provoked a wave of excitement in the markets, sterling
later fell back, finally closing  1/2 pfennig up on the day at DM2.5944.
With the German economy still showing no sign of emerging from recession,
the D-Mark is expected to remain weak against sterling in the near future,
dealers said.
Gloom about the German economy was again underlined yesterday by the
publication of figures showing that West German GDP had fallen by 1.9 per
cent last year, compared to 1.6 per cent growth in 1992.
On the sterling side, however, opinion is more mixed about the British
currency's potential.
Although the market now believes that the British recovery is under way,
there are doubts about its pace, with traders looking anxiously to the
release of a new batch of UK economic data later this week. Earnings
figures, due to be published today, will be watched carefully for signs of
an upturn in wage pressure. The consensus is for annual earnings growth of 3
per cent, unchanged from October.
As the pound nudged higher yesterday, rumours circulated that the Bank of
England had briefly intervened in the Far Eastern markets to stem the rise.
'It is not inconceivable that the Bank of England would discretely intervene
to restrain sterling,' said Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank.
As usual, however, the rumours were unconfirmed and most dealers doubt that
interest rate cuts will occur before the end of February or beginning of
March. This view is apparently shared by the futures market, which yesterday
traded about five basis points lower for the March contract, at 94.65, and
about seven basis points down for the June contract, at 94.79. At this
level, dealers are pricing three-month and six-month money at 5.35 and 5.21
per cent respectively.
Nevertheless, as Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, points
out, the fact that sterling is nudging at the DM2.60 barrier does create
fresh pressure for a rate cut, particularly from British exporters.
'If sterling soars through DM2.60, the market will look for a DM2.65 level
very fast and this will put added pressure on Mr Clarke to cut rates
earlier,' he said.
Meanwhile, with American investors feeling increasingly positive about the
British economy's prospects for recovery, Mr Cocker believes that the pound
will continue to maintain its firm tone against the dollar, in spite of the
dollar's recent strengthening.
The pound yesterday closed at Dollars 1.4981, up from the previous day's
Dollars 1.4955.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's attempt to convince the money markets that a
German rate cut would not occur soon met with more scepticism yesterday, as
the poor German GDP data fuelled expectations about an early reduction.
The D-Mark yesterday declined against the dollar, which closed at DM1.7398
compared to DM1.7308 the previous day. In New York it finished trading at
DM1.7418.
With the dollar now having recouped most of the losses that occurred after
the release of weaker than expected US employment data on Friday, the
American currency is expected to renew its attempt on the 1993 high of
DM1.7485 in the next few days, dealers said.
The D-Mark also weakened over the day against the French franc, in spite of
staging a brief rally in the morning. It was at FFr3.401 at the end of
London trading, compared with yesterday's close of FFr3.410.
With the Italian parliament due to debate a no confidence motion today, the
lira softened yesterday against most currencies, with the exception of the
weak D-Mark. It finished at L978.4 against the D-Mark, compared to a
previous close of L983.4.
Sentiment towards the lira is expected to remain nervous in the coming days,
in spite of the Italian currency's recent bull run.
However, if the political turmoil is contained, the lira's potential for
further rises remains good, dealers said, with many predicting that the
Italian lira will join the Swedish krone as one of this year's best
performers. The Bank of England yesterday predicted a shortage of Pounds
1.55bn in its money market operations, and later revised this up to Pounds
1.65bn. It bought Pounds 1.1bn of bills at 5 3/8 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK potato board moves to head
off revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Potato Marketing Board moved yesterday to head off a revolt by
growers who want its 60-year-old marketing scheme wound up immediately
rather than waiting for abolition by the government in 1997.
Some producers, particularly in Scotland, are angry that the board has
accepted government proposals for a slimmed-down role for the next three
years.
They want the board to hold a poll of producers on its future, arguing that
it has already abandoned its main function by ending intervention buying of
surplus potatoes and making production quotas more flexible.
'There may be growers who don't like the changes and who call for a poll to
revoke the scheme,' said Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, the board's chief executive.
'The danger is that the baby might be thrown out with the bathwater.'
Unveiling proposals for a cut in the levy on growers from Pounds 86 a
hectare to Pounds 48, or Pounds 1 a tonne, he argued that funding for the
board's remaining activities of research, promotion and providing market
information was vital to the industry.
As an example, research on nitrogen application could save growers Pounds
600,000 immediately and up to Pounds 2m a year in the longer term through
lower fertiliser costs. Work on irrigation could bring Pounds 1.4m in annual
savings through more efficient use of water, while developments in the
control of powdery scab disease could save growers Pounds 500,000 a year.
'If the board is spending Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m of growers' money a year,
the government are spending about Pounds 4m on potato and related research,'
he said.
'If the industry is not prepared to fund research itself, the government
will look very seriously at its funding. There's a lot at risk.'
Mr Fairbairn said the board also had to promote consumption of fresh
potatoes. The rise in potato consumption of 5-6 per cent in Britain last
year was fuelled by growth in the processed market.
If potato consumption in the UK fell to the levels in the US, 'we'd need
only 100,000 hectares instead of the present 150,000 hectares to meet what
the market requires', said Mr Fairbairn. 'There's a real interest for
growers to invest to keep potatoes competitive against the social trend
towards other forms of food, particularly imported rice and pasta.'
The board today embarks on a series of 14 meetings with growers around the
country to explain how the modified marketing scheme will operate.
Growers will be able to plant up to 5 per cent more or fewer potatoes than
their quota limit without penalty, only producers with 1 hectare or more of
potatoes will need to register, licensing of potato merchants will end and
the size of the board will be reduced from 23 members to 15.
The board's staff is being cut from 280 to 160.
The government plans to review the scheme before its intended abolition in
1997.
Mr John Heading, the board's chairman, said a survey last summer showed
three-quarters of growers wanted the potato scheme to continue. He aimed to
ensure 'that in three years' time the minister of agriculture looks at us in
a favourable light'.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, is asking the European
Commission to allow farmers hit by flooding more time to harvest sugar beet
and potatoes on land that is due to enter set-aside on January 15. Under
current rules, no harvesting can take place on set-aside land and farmers
would have to abandon their crops.

The year-long merger negotiations between New York's metals exchange, Comex,
and its big energy market, Nymex, are progressing, with a vote of the two
memberships on the merger plan expected in early March.
Comex members last week agreed to defer electing a new Board of Governors
until the merger talks are completed, an action interpreted by many in the
futures industry as a vote of confidence in the merger plan.
Since Nymex first suggested taking over the smaller exchange last April with
a Dollars 20m bid negotiators have had to overcome historical antagonism
between the memberships of the two exchanges, and sentiment that Comex's
record year in 1993 might reduce the urgency of a merger for the smaller
exchange.
Comex's board of governors will vote on a formal merger package presented by
Nymex on January 19. If the plan passes the board, members of both exchanges
will be asked to approve the merger.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME sustains turnover growth
for seventh year in succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange, the world's largest terminal market for physical
metal, continued its turnover growth for the seventh successive year in
1993. And its financial strength enabled the exchange to refund Pounds 2m of
the contract levy money paid by clearing members.
Mr David King, chief executive, pointed out that turnover on the LME had
grown five-fold in the past six years, 'reflecting the growing confidence of
the metals industry in the exchange as a genuine hedging medium for their
activities.'
In volume terms the LME's futures and options turnover last year increased
by nearly 43 per cent, from 24.74m lots to 35.29m ('lots' are 25 tonnes for
metals other than aluminium alloy, where each lot is 20 tonnes, nickel, six
tonnes, and tin, five tonnes).
Mr King estimated that turnover increased to Dollars 1,000bn from Dollars
700bn in 1992. He said LME brokers probably had 'a comfortable 1993' but
their margins and commissions represented only 'a sliver' of the turnover.
Commission incomes are based on the gross value of contracts so brokers
suffered when metals prices were low, as was the case last year.
On prospects for 1994, Mr King said: 'The accountant in me says we must look
for a year of consolidation' - more or less the same comment he has made at
the begining of each of the past four years.
Copper's futures turnover showed the biggest gain last year, more than
doubling from 7.3m to 14.9m lots. Turnover in aluminium was up from 8.23m to
10m lots, aluminium alloy, the newest contract, from 7,343 to 111,450 lots,
lead from 976,000 to 1.02m lots, nickel from 1.44m to 2.12m lots, tin from
525,244 to 613,952 lots and zinc from 4m to 4.17m lots. Option turnover rose
by 5.2 per cent from 2.2m to 2.3m lots.
The London Commodity Exchange, which trades chiefly in agricultural futures,
last week reported 'a healthy increase' of 26 per cent in its turnover for
1993 to 3.59m futures and options lots.
The biggest futures gain was cocoa's 33.52 per cent, while options turnover
on that contract more than doubled. Coffee futures trade was up only 5.82
per cent but coffee options business leapt 152 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Divisions remain over tropical
timber accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fourth round of talks aimed at negotiating a successor accord to the 1983
International Tropical Timber Agreement opened in Geneva this week, with
producing and consuming countries still divided over the scope and financing
of the new pact. The present agreement, which has 50 members, expires at the
end of March.
Producer nations argue that temperate as well as tropical timber should be
subject to the conservation disciplines of the new accord, which calls for
all tropical timber exports to come from sustainably managed forests by the
year 2000. They are also seeking extra financial aid to meet this goal.
The two sides are said to have made 'some progress' during last November's
meeting in Japan of the International Tropical Timber Council, which
administers the 1983 pact. The Geneva talks, under the auspices of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, are due to end on
January 21 but may be extended for a third week.
Mr Wisber Loeis of Indonesia, who chairs the negotiations, has proposed a
compromise under which the future accord would essentially be limited to
tropical timber but all member nations would espouse the Year 2000
Objective. The US, Australia and Japan, among temperate timber producers,
have already done so.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caution urged on Indian cotton
exports after harvest setback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Indian textile ministry has urged the federal government not to make any
further release of cotton for export because of a setback to this season's
crop in the three north Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The
resulting fall in expected supplies has triggered a surge in prices.
At the beginning of the 1993-94 (September-August) cotton season, when the
forecast for the crop was 13.5m bales of 170kg each, the government released
an export quota of 500,000 bales. But the Cotton Corporation of India, a
government procurement agency, which recently surveyed the crop, now says
that total production in the current year is not likely to be more than 13m
bales.
A pest attack has reduced the standing crop in the north Indian states by an
estimated 450,000 bales, according to Mr RK Khattar, president of the
Eastern India Textile Mills Association. There has also been some loss in
Madhya Pradesh, where the harvest is now expected to yield only 1.15m bales,
compared with an earlier projection of 1.2m bales. Mr Khattar said he would
not be surprised if India ended up with a crop as low as 12.7m bales.
Last year, India produced 13.5m bales and its exports amounted to nearly
1.5m. According to industry officials, the current prices of Punjab J-34,
Maharashtra H-4 and Shankar-4, the three benchmark grades of Indian cotton,
are 34 per cent to 41 per cent higher compared with the corresponding period
of the previous season.
While there has been panic buying by the textile mills, EITMA complains that
'merchants have cornered nearly 25 per cent of the crop that has come to
market'. It has told the government that 'except for the actual users no one
should be allowed to hold stocks of cotton'.
As cotton prices are running 35 to 90 per cent higher than the official
support prices set for the current season, depending on the grades, the
government has advised the CCI to go slow with its purchasing operation.
The Indian textile industry which boasts the world's second largest number
of operating spindles, at 28m, is expected to consume some 12.5m bales of
cotton in the current season, compared with about 12m last year.
After making provision for non-mill consumption and the exports that have
already been sanctioned, the next cotton season is likely to open with
stocks of less than 3m bales, down from 3.3m at the start of this season,
according to the textile ministry. The 1994-95 opening stocks will be just
about enough to take care of the industry's fibre requirement for the first
three months.
Though the Indian cotton season begins in September, the crop arrivals do
not start gaining momentum until the middle of October.
With a firm estimate of the 1993-94 crop not be available till March, any
further setbacks will force India to import cotton, industry officials warn.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian group finds more oil
and gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has proven reserves of over 25m
barrels of oil and gas in the Niger delta, a rare boost for the corporations
which faces mounting debts to contractors, arrears in payments for
exploration and production, and big losses on its downstream operations.
The state company's own operator, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company has
found nine hydrocarbons levels at the Oziengbe south field, five km from
Koko in Delta state, in one of the few onshore concessions that is 100 per
cent owned by NPDC. The find takes NPDC's proven reserves to 169m barrels.
The company has one small oil field in production at Apura, a joint venture
with British Gas, but the rest of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels daily quota is
produced by NNPC's minority joint venture partners who are all international
oil companies, except Dubri Oil, the only indigenous private sector producer
in Africa.
The Nigerian government last year signed a series of exploration and
production contracts for deep water concessions that shifted all the initial
costs of developing fields to the oil majors as part of its drive to
increase proven oil reserves from 20bn to 25bn barrels by the end of the
decade.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long gilts weaken as inflation and supply
worries resurface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation and supply worries depressed the UK government bond market
yesterday, pushing prices down by between half and three-quarters of a point
at the long end.
The release of a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group,
yesterday caused jitters by indicating a sharp increase in the number of
managing directors who expect to raise prices in order to restore profit
margins.
'The news rather spooked the gilt market,' said Mr Kit Juckes, bond analyst
at S. G. Warburg Securities, adding that the survey had led to some
consternation over whether inflation would edge up again.
On the supply front, the gilt market expects the Bank of England to announce
its next gilt auction soon, with dealers predicting that the new stock will
be a long-dated one.
A low wage settlement for Germany's chemical industry workers gave a firm
boost to the German government bond market yesterday, although the market
later drifted down to close a touch lower on the day.
The chemical industry union agreed to a 2 per cent pay rise for 1994. 'This
is the first of the main wage settlements and it looks quite good  - if we
continue in this vein it will be good for inflation prospects,' said one
bund dealer.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 101.12 and traded in a range of
100.99 to 101.26 before ending at around 101.04.
Italian government bonds opened on a weak note following Monday's slide in
prices, but bounced back up to end the day nearly half a point higher.
Dealers said a rise in German government bond prices prompted the recovery
in Italian bonds. The Italian market was weak on Monday due to political
uncertainties and dismay over the delay in the long-awaited interest rate
cut. The Liffe March futures contract settled up 0.43 at 117.53.
Traders said the market would be focusing on the political situation today
with Mr Carlo Ciampi, the prime minister, expected to face a vote of
no-confidence in parliament.
Among the other high-yielding markets, Spain saw strong buying interest from
foreign investors and ended the day higher. The release of unemployment
figures showing a slight increase in the jobless rate at 17.5 per cent in
December, against 17.4 per cent the previous month, had little impact on the
market, dealers said, as they were roughly in line with expectations.
Japanese government bond prices declined on the back of new supply in the
four-year area and receding hopes for an imminent rate cut.
The stock market's recent strength has led bond market participants to push
back their hopes of an easing by the Bank of Japan, dealers said.
New supply in the four-year area did not help market sentiment yesterday.
The Finance Ministry auctioned Y735.7bn of 2.2 per cent four-year bonds at
an average price of 99.79 to yield 2.257 per cent. However, dealers said the
auction did not go particularly well.
The key March futures contract, which closed at 118.30 on Monday, opened
yesterday at 118.00 and traded in a range from 117.99 to 118.38 before
closing at 118.06.
US Treasury prices edged higher across the board in light trading yesterday
as dealers and investors awaited the week's inflation data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  3/16 at 100
1/4 , to yield 6.226 per cent. The two-year note barely moved all day, and
was up just  1/32 at 100 11/32 , yielding 4.049 per cent.
In the absence of important economic news, trading was subdued throughout
the day, although there was some mid-afternoon selling following news of
strong department store sales. Demand from municipal authorities, however,
helped prices recover later in the day.
Otherwise, the market's attention was clearly focused on the December
inflation data, which are due out today and tomorrow.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Yen feature protects
convertible Fuji paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SFr40m convertible note issue for Fuji Electronics contains a feature to
protect investors against rises in the value of the yen.
Yamaichi Bank (Switzerland), the lead manager, has introduced a formula for
adjusting the exchange rate to be used when converting the Swiss franc
nominal value of the notes into Fuji's yen denominated shares.
The formula is related to the feature introduced three years ago by Yamaichi
in response to declining Japanese share prices. This provided for the
downward revision of the conversion price on equity related bond issues.
It established a so-called setting date, usually two years after the issue,
at which the conversion price could be revised downward if the company's
shares had declined by a specified amount.
Under the new feature, for Japanese issuers, the upward revision of the yen
exchange rate will also take place on the setting date, but only if the
conversion price is revised downward at that time and if the yen exchange
rate is higher than it was at the time of the bond's issue (the so-called
constant rate).
For other issuers, the upward revision of the currency exchange rate would
take place independently of any downward revision of the conversion price.
Yamaichi intends that the maximum potential exchange rate adjustment should
be less than 10 per cent. In the Fuji case, it is 9.3 per cent. The
potential conversion price adjustments are normally less than 20 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Bonds: EIB in record L1,000bn deal as Eurolira
sector expands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flood of fresh debt in the Eurobond market shows no sign of abating as
new issues emerged across a wide range of currencies yesterday.
The Eurolira bond market continued its rapid expansion, as the European
Investment Bank launched the largest ever deal in a single tranche. Issuance
in the sector is running at a record level: as well as the EIB's L1,000bn
deal, Bayerische Landesbank launched a German-targeted L300bn issue
yesterday, following a deal by Bayerische Vereinsbank on Monday. This brings
the total amount of new issues so far this year to L3,300bn, compared with
L18,000bn for the whole of last year. Although the newly liberalised market
is beginning to appear overloaded, the injection of liquidity into the
market is helping to attract more institutional participants.
'L1,000bn is the typical size of an Italian government bond issue,' said Mr
Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano. He reported
strong sales to fund managers in the UK, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia
and Benelux countries. However, retail investors also participated in the
deal, he added. The L1,000bn EIB deal is part of its total lending programme
of L5,000bn to Italy this year.
The issue was priced to yield 88 basis points below the gross yield of the
five-year Italian government bond. Although this appears aggressive, it
compares favourably with the pricing of other recent Eurobonds, such as last
week's Eurofima deal. Some investors prefer to buy Eurobonds rather than
government bonds because foreign investors are still having problems
reclaiming withholding tax on Italian government bonds.
In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Finland launched DM2bn of seven-year
bonds via Dresdner Bank. The bonds, which are due to be priced today with an
expected yield spread of 21-23 basis points over the benchmark bund, are the
first non-bank D-Mark straight bonds this year and met with good demand from
domestic and foreign investors, syndicate officials said.
Investors were especially attracted by the seven-year maturity, where there
has been a dearth of supply in recent weeks. 'There's been a lot of supply
in the five and 10-year sector - much of it not yet placed - but in the
seven-year area there's very little paper,' said one syndicate manager.
Another official said that the maturity should compensate for the pricing of
the bonds, which he said was on the tight side. German buyers were reported
to be especially attracted by the yield pick-up of some 11 basis points over
domestic paper.
The DM1bn issue of 10-year bonds by WestLB Finance via Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale were rather harder to place in Germany, yielding
about 10 basis points below domestic bonds. Moreover, the 10-year sector is
saturated with recent bank bond issues. 'The trouble is that issuers want to
take advantage of low long yields, but investors want to buy short-dated
paper to play what's left of the interest-rate easing,' said a Frankfurt
syndicate official. The bonds ended at the recommended reoffer price of
99.80.
The Ecu sector came back to life with the first new issue this year -
Ecu225m of seven-year bonds for Eurofima. Despite its relatively tight
pricing, it met with strong retail demand. According to an official with
lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation, the deal quickly broke syndicate and
the yield tightened to around 19 basis points below the relevant Ecu OAT
from a launch spread of 17 basis points below.
Separately, Italy's Y300bn global offering was priced yesterday at the tight
end of the indicated range, at 41 basis points over the seven-year JGB
yield.
By the end of the day, the deal had tightened to 40 basis points over the
curve, while the price dropped slightly from a fixed reoffer level of 99.98,
to close at 99.88 in a weakening market.
The Japanese equity-warrant sector saw three deals totalling Dollars 500m,
which met with solid demand from continental Europe.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: First price manipulation charges
filed by CFTC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has made its first-ever financial
futures price manipulation filing, charging two former floor traders with
depressing US Treasury bond prices by a full point for their own profit
during 31 minutes of trading in October 1992.
Both former traders are currently subject to criminal indictments by the US
Attorney's office in Chicago and both have already been expelled from CBOT
membership and fined Dollars 2.25m.
The CFTC complaint is the first to address the subject of price manipulation
during the incident, a potentially embarrassing issue which the CBOT was
careful to sidestep in its actions against the traders.
The CFTC found that the two ordered the sale of 13,000 bond futures and the
purchase of 31,000 put options, for a face value of Dollars 4.4bn. At this
point exchange security guards intervened.
The two had less than Dollars 30,000 in trading capital between them and one
had been an exchange member for just one day.
One former trader netted a profit of Dollars 1.5m which was impounded by the
CBOT. The other's positions resulted in Dollars 8.5m of losses which were
absorbed by L. B. Stern, the Chicago firm that guaranteed his account.

Isda has been active since 1985 promoting trade and regulatory issues

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pizza Hut heads for New Delhi
middle classes / A look at the latest entrant to be permitted to join the
Indian fast-food market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First it was burgers, then fried chicken, and now pizzas, as the Indian
government continues to attract international fast-food companies to the
country's newly-liberalised markets.
Pizza Hut International, a subsidiary of the US food and drink conglomerate
PepsiCo, has been given permission to establish a 100 per cent-owned company
in India, which will set up a chain of pizza restaurants with an investment
of some Dollars 40m spread over seven years.
The approval follows the clearance in November of a similar Dollars 40m
proposal from Kentucky Fried Chicken, another PepsiCo subsidiary, to extend
the world's largest chicken restaurant system of 9,000 restaurants in 68
countries to India.
Earlier last year, McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, received
permission to set up shop in India.
Meanwhile, Burger King, the second-largest fast food chain in the US, has
been exploring, the Indian market, but has yet to finalise its plans for
India, which may include a local partner.
The American fast-food giants, which have successfully expanded their chains
of outlets to new markets in China and Russia, are confident that India,
with its burgeoning middle class, provides excellent potential for the food
industry.
A detailed feasibility study by Burger King has illustrated that India is a
more suitable market for fast foods than China.
This explains PepsiCo's decision to make New Delhi the venue of its largest
restaurant yet - a 600-seater flagship store that will house both Pizza Hut
and Kentucky Fried Chicken under one roof.
The company says the decision to combine the chicken and pizza outlets is
the result of market research, which showed that Indians preferred a variety
of foods to be served in a restaurant, and that single-fare outlets would
not do well in the Indian market, where large families eating out prefer
multi-cuisine restaurants.
This is best illustrated by Nirula's, a Delhi-based fast food chain which
offers a range of foods and cuisines, from burgers and pizza to kebabs and
curries.
Nirula's has contributed substantially to introducing middle-class Indians
to western-style 'junk' foods. The family-owned company would rather not
disclose its turnover, but an indication of its size is that it serves over
40,000 customers each day through its 11 outlets in Delhi, and has three
busy restaurants in Nepal and one in Muscat.
Nirula's has held its ground to competition from foreign entrants such as
Wimpy's, the UK chain, which enter-ed India through a local Indian partner
several years ago, but has had difficulty break-ing into the market.
'The Indian market is extremely tempting but there are very real problems
here, and the foreign chains have no idea what the odds against them are,'
says a successful Indian restaurateur.
One hurdle for foreign chains is the unavailability of some western
ingredients, and religious taboos on others.
McDonald's and Burger King earn a large chunk of their revenue from beef and
pork burgers, which would not find favour with Indian clients, who prefer
goat or lamb if they eat meat.
Kentucky Fried is not too happy about the quality of chicken and fat for
frying in the local market. And Pizza Hut will have to set up its own
factory for a steady supply of Mozarella cheese.
Indian wheat is too soft for pizza bases, and so hard wheat will have to be
grown or imported. And specialised kitchen equipment will also be subject to
government licensing.
'Our main problem is to set up a supply chain for pizza toppings, chicken,
fat and wheat,' said a PepsiCo executive. Both subsidiaries will need until
at least September to launch their chains.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Acer, Taiwan's largest personal computer maker, said parent net profits
nearly doubled to an estimated TDollars 1.08bn (USDollars 41m) last year
from TDollars 56m in 1992, Reuter reports from Taipei.
Parent company sales climbed to an estimated TDollars 19.36bn from TDollars
12.24bn Acer said in a statement.
Sales for the entire Acer group rose 67 per cent to TDollars 50bn last year
and group net profits reached a record TDollars 2bn. the company said
without giving group profits for 1992.
Mr Philip Peng, Acer's vice-president, attributed the surge in parent sales
and profits to the introduction of a system under which key computer parts
are exported to overseas factories where final assembly of computers is
carried out.
Profits were also boosted as Acer's joint venture making dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chips with Texas Instruments started to make money, Mr
Peng said.
Acer's operations in the US and Europe suffered a loss of about TDollars
800m last year but broke even in the fourth quarter.
The parent company obtained TDollars 500m in earnings from land disposals in
1993, compared with TDollars 580m in 1992.
Peng said Acer had set sales targets of TDollars 20bn for the parent company
and TDollars 62.5bn for the group this year.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chicago Board of Trade to miss
talks on Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade, in an apparent escalation of its dispute with
Reuters, the UK-based information company, plans to stay away from talks
this week on the future of Globex, the electronic futures trading system
developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CBOT and Reuters.
The CBOT's absence has heightened speculation that Globex will be
reorganised in April without the participation of the world's busiest
futures exchange.
Globex officials say the development increases the chances of offshore
exchanges, notably Liffe in London, joining the system. These exchanges have
been unwilling to join the system because it is managed by rival exchanges.
Representatives from Reuters, Matif, the Paris futures exchange which is
already a member of Globex, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will open
negotiations on a new management format for Globex tomorrow. Both the CME
and Reuters have proposed models for a new agreement.
Although the CBOT is a partner with the CME in the joint venture that
manages Globex, it has been ambivalent about the project, which it sees as
competing with its mainstream business of open outcry futures trading.
The CBOT has contributed less than 3 per cent of volume to the system in
recent months, and has increasingly challenged Globex's viability. Mr Pat
Arbor, CBOT chairman, has described Globex as inefficient and expensive. He
has said CBOT was making contingency plans for the time when it was no
longer part of Globex.
Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters' director of transaction products, in a letter to
Mr Arbor, has asked CBOT to agree to extend the hours it lists its products
on Globex, and to abandon plans for Project A, a CBOT daytime trading system
seen as a rival to Globex.
Mr Arbor responded that the CBOT should not be subject to such
preconditions. 'We simply are not in a position to cave in to new demands
that would be disadvantageous our members,' he said in a statement.
An exchange spokesman confirmed the CBOT would not attend the meetings,
saying 'we've been disinvited'.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman who is also chairman of the Globex joint
venture and who holds the tie breaking vote in any disputes with the CBOT,
said the CME and the Matif were in agreement on a Globex structure that
would resemble 'a single global exchange,' with Reuters providing services
to the system.
Reuters is proposing to staunch Globex's losses by signing up more exchanges
to provide products on the system. It currently has leases on 346 terminals
around the world.
However, many agreements expire in June, and their renewal is in doubt
unless the system can be made more attractive.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: ANA proposes marketing links
with BA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan's largest carrier, has approached British
Airways with a series of marketing proposals to help strengthen its
international operations.
But BA has so far not responded to ANA's proposals to enter into ticket code
sharing agreements, although the two carriers are discussing co-operation on
frequent flier programmes.
BA yesterday said it did not comment on speculation about partnerships and
alliances, but industry sources said that the UK carrier had been receiving
approaches as frequently as one a week by airlines wanting to join the trend
towards globalisation.
They suggested the ANA initiative, made towards the end of last year, may be
just one such approach. BA is understood to have taken no decision nor
discussed internally the ANA approach.
Before the latest approach to BA, the Japanese carrier had held discussions
two years ago with another UK carrier, British Midland, over possible
marketing co-operation.
ANA's proposals to BA include a limited code-sharing agreement between
London and Tokyo, and a wider plan involving ANA code-sharing with BA
throughout Europe.
Mr Yuzuru Masumoto, senior vice-president, legal affairs, also said the two
airlines could negotiate sharing data, engineering facilities and flight
crew.
ANA was keen to conclude a deal as soon as possible, said Mr Taiji Kameyama,
senior vice-president, commercial affairs. The Japanese airline is also
negotiating with other groups, including Asian, European and trans-Pacific
carriers.
'It's difficult to find the ideal partner. The best trans-Pacific carrier is
not always on good terms with the best European,' explained Mr Kameyama.
In Europe, All Nippon Airways said it is also talking to members of the
failed Alcazar alliance, which involved Scandinavian Airlines System,
Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines.
ANA already holds a small stake in Austrian Airlines.

<TEXT>
Itochu, a leading Japanese trading house, at the end of March will liquidate
Itochu Finance, a finance subsidiary set up during the late 1980s as a
vehicle to invest funds in financial markets. The company will book an
extraordinary loss of Y28bn (Dollars 249m) for the current year to March.
Many Japanese companies, which invested in the stock market during the asset
'bubble' of the late 1980s, have suffered heavy losses following the plunge
in Japanese share prices in 1990.
Other leading trading houses, including Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Marubeni,
have started to write off loss-making finance units. Of the Y28bn, Itochu
booked Y9.8bn in extraordinary losses at the end of the first half in
September.
Itochu said it would raise funds by selling assets to cover part of the
liquidation losses. However, it now expects an after-tax profit of Y2bn for
the year, rather than the previously forecast Y6bn.
Itochu Finance's total liabilities exceeded its total assets by Y3.1bn at
the end of August as losses from its financial investments mounted to
Y15.6bn. The parent company plans to liquidate the balance of tokkin, or
specified money trusts and other fund trusts at the unit.

<TEXT>
Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, said the proposed flotation
of its US unit is likely to be postponed until there is a sustained
improvement in US energy markets, writes Nikki Tait.
No formal decision has yet been made, but the timing looks doubtful. 'At
this stage, I would have to say it probably won't go ahead as planned at the
end of January, but it could well do later on in the year,' said one
executive.
In December, Bridge announced plans to offer 38.57 per cent of Bridge Oil
(USA) to investors via a public issue of 4m shares of common stock. The
company said the likely delay to the issue does not affect its plans to
acquire a package of US production and exploration properties from Santa Fe
Energy Resources.

tonnes a year of thermal coal in Queensland's Bowen basin after winning a
tender for a newly-released exploration area there, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney.
Savage will be an equal partner in the venture, alongside Mitsui Mining, the
Japanese coal producer, and a consortium of Korean companies, including
Hyosung Corporation, Yukong, Dongbu Corporation and the Korea Mining

Savage hopes a mine will begin production in seven to 10 years and be able

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York creditors to sell
61% Abitibi stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olympia &amp; York's creditors have offered public investors the controlling
stake formerly held by the failed property developer in Abitibi-Price, the
Canadian newsprint producer.
A&amp;G Resources, a company formed by 32 O&amp;Y lenders, said yesterday it planned
to raise CDollars 886m (USDollars 674m) from the sale of a 61 per cent stake
in Abitibi.
The 54.5m shares will be sold for CDollars 16.25 a share, payable in three
instalments to October 1995. The offer is being made worldwide, except the
US, where shares will be privately placed.
O&amp;Y pledged the shares to a group of banks, led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corp and Credit Lyonnais, as the main collateral for a USDollars
2.5bn loan advanced in the late 1980s.
The banks gained the right to sell the shares as part of O&amp;Y's restructuring
last year. They still control a 70 per cent stake in Gulf Canada Resources,
a Calgary-based energy group, which was also pledged by O&amp;Y as security for
the USDollars 2.5bn loan.
However, barring a sharp rise in the oil price, the banks are unlikely to
recoup anywhere near the full value of the loan.
The decision to sell the Abitibi stake has been prompted by a sharp rise in
share prices of forest-products companies as evidence mounts that the long
slide in pulp and paper prices may be ending.
Mr Ron Lloyd, director of syndication at RBC Dominion Securities, which is
co-leading the offer, said yesterday 'there is a significant demand for
paper stocks'. Abitibi shares closed at CDollars 16 1/4 on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday, up from CDollars 16.
Abitibi is one of the world's biggest newsprint and uncoated groundwood
paper producers. Mr Bernd Koken, chairman, said yesterday the sale would not
affect the company's day-to-day operations or longer-term strategies.
Abitibi is the latest of several Canadian forest-products companies in which
a large stake has been spun off to the public by a troubled controlling
shareholder.
Toronto's Bronfman family last year sold their interest in MacMillan
Bloedel, the west coast pulp and paper producer, while Stone Container of
Chicago recently reduced its stake in Montreal-based Stone-Consolidated.

International Paper, the diversified US paper, packaging and wood products
company, reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents a
share, up 15 per cent from Dollars 87m, or 71 cents, before extraordinary
charges in the fourth quarter a year ago.
The earnings advance came on strong performances by the company's forest
products and specialty products businesses. However, sales for the quarter
were flat, at Dollars 3.4bn.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said the results continued to be deflated by weak
worldwide price levels in most paper and packaging products. Excluding
special items, International Paper had earnings of Dollars 314m, or Dollars
2.54 a share, for the full fiscal year 1993, down from Dollars 405m, or
Dollars 3.34, in 1992.

<TEXT>
Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, has formed an
alliance with Remsen Partners, the property financing group, that will
provide funds for the US commercial property market.
Remsen will arrange mortgages on commercial property funded by Smith Barney
which the brokerage firm will sell as mortgage-backed securities to
investors. The two partners said yesterday they had put together more than
Dollars 100m in mortgage loans, and expected the venture to generate as much
as Dollars 1bn in financing before the end of the year.
For Smith Barney, which is owned by Travelers, the insurance and financial
services group, the aim of the alliance is to lift its presence in the large
US mortgage-backed securities market by linking up with Remsen's network of
property owners and mortgage bankers. Last year, Smith Barney was ranked
15th among underwriters of mortgage deals in the US, even though the firm
was the second largest brokerage house in the US.
The appeal of the alliance to Remsen is fast access to Smith Barney's
capital and the ability to win business on the back of the brokerage firm's
name.

The Mexican government plans to sell Dollars 520m of its stock in Telefonos
de Mexico (Telmex), the monopoly telephone company, through a convertible
bond.
Nacional Financiera, the state development bank, said it would begin the
paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mexican
equivalent next week. The offering is equivalent to 1.53 per cent of Telmex
stock.
The convertible bond offering will be managed by Merrill Lynch. In the past,
Goldman Sachs has managed the government's offerings of Telmex stock.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance, said the money would go into
the government's special contingency fund of reserves. He denied reports
that the offering had been timed to finance spending in the troubled state
of Chiapas, where there was a violent uprising last week.
Mr Ortiz said the government sold the other 3 per cent of Telmex that it
holds between September and December last year in the open market, for about
Dollars 1bn.

Toys R Us, the biggest US toy retailer, yesterday announced it would open 45
new toy stores in the US and 70 stores overseas this year.
It has also signed franchise agreements covering Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
emirates, and is to buy back up to Dollars 1bn worth of its shares over the
next several years.
The shares rose by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 yesterday. Analysts said
the store-opening programme was in line with expectations and the share
buy-back plan would have a relatively small impact on earnings per share.
Toys R Us has 581 stores in the US and 234 overseas, so the number of
overseas stores will increase proportionally much more than the number of
domestic stores.
Part of the plan consists of signing franchise agreements which will bring
the Toys R Us name to markets that would not otherwise have been entered for
many years.
Two agreements have been signed: one with an unnamed Saudi Arabian company
for toy stores in Saudi Arabia, and another with Al Futtain Sons, a company
based in the United Arab Emirates, for stores in the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain,
Oman and Kuwait.

<TEXT>
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, reported a loss of Dollars
16.7m, or 20 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, as the US company was
battered by the continued deterioration in prices for primary aluminium and
for aluminium sheet used for beverage cans.
The loss is a reversal of the fourth quarter of 1992, when Alcoa earned
Dollars 49m, or 57 cents a share, before an extraordinary accounting charge.
Including a previously-announced extraordinary charge of Dollars 70.2m, or
80 cents a share, which was taken to cover the cost of severance for 1,600
employees and the closure of some manufacturing operations, Alcoa's loss
totalled Dollars 86.9m, or Dollars 1 a share, in the quarter.
The company's sales fell to Dollars 2.3bn in the quarter, from Dollars 2.5bn
in the fourth quarter a year ago.
For the full year, Alcoa had earnings of Dollars 79.3m or 88 cents a share
before special charges, compared with Dollars 196.3m, or Dollars 2.27 a
share before extraordinary charges in 1992.
Full-year sales were Dollars 9.1bn, slightly below the previous year's
Dollars 9.5bn.
Alcoa had remained profitable through the third quarter while other
aluminium companies were suffering losses.
The company said that it had succeeded in trimming costs, but that the
decline in costs had not kept pace with the precipitous decline in aluminium
prices.

Atlantic Richfield (Arco) is to take a charge of Dollars 450m after tax to

The charge, which is to be included in fourth-quarter figures for 1993,

charge to reshape the bulk of its US operations.
It covers severance costs from shedding 1,300 jobs, as well as the
write-down of some oil and gas properties which the company plans to sell.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mercedes gloomy on truck sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Recession has forced west German hauliers to de-register between 10 and 15
per cent of their truck fleets, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, head of
Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicles division.
This unused capacity will have to be absorbed before the group can expect to
increase sales of new vehicles in its home market, where it claims 52 per
cent of the heavy trucks business.
Forecasting unchanged turnover for 1994 after a decline of almost 6 per cent
to DM25.3bn (Dollars 14.7bn) last year, Mr Gottschalk said he saw no real
prospects for recovery in Europe, with the exception of the UK, which had
become the European Union's economic 'locomotive'.
Some improvement might be seen in France towards the end of the year, he
said, but there was no chance of better sales in Italy or markets like
Spain, where deliveries had plunged by up to 50 per cent.
The company could not expect to increase sales volumes in Germany this year,
although output from its Dusseldorf works would be bolstered by a recent
order for 8,700 vans for the Bundespost postal service.
Private sector hauliers had de-registered trucks to save insurance and road
taxes, after building up their fleets in preparation for the single European
market which came into force a year ago, and then being hit by recession.
Liberalisation of European transport policy had further sharpened
competition. 'It all helps to explain the trough we are in,' Mr Gottschalk
said.
Reviewing 1993, when group deliveries fell 22 per cent in the EU and 7 per
cent worldwide to 255,000 trucks, vans and buses, he said output from the
group's west European plants had been cut 26 per cent to prevent an
unmanageable build-up of stocks.
By contrast, unit sales at Freightliner, the US subsidiary, had increased 37
per cent to 45,000 units.
Mr Gottschalk promised a complete renewal of the group's product range,
which will absorb most of the current DM6bn five-year capital investment
programme, and a sharpened offensive in developing markets.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Toys R Us to buy back Dollars
1bn of shares and open 115 new stores

<TEXT>
Toys R Us, the biggest US toy retailer, yesterday announced it would open 45
new toy stores in the US and 70 stores overseas this year in what it
described as its biggest expansion programme yet.
It has also signed franchise agreements to move into Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf emirates, and is to buy back up to Dollars 1bn worth of its shares over
the next several years.
The shares, however, rose by a modest Dollars  1/2 to 38 7/8 yesterday
morning. Analysts said the store-opening programme was in line with
expectations and the share buy-back plan would have a relatively small
impact on earnings per share.
Toys R Us has 581 stores in the US and 234 overseas, so the number of
overseas stores will increase proportionally much more this year than the
number of domestic stores.
Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman, said he saw 'a tremendous opportunity' for
Toys R Us to build world market share over the next few years, and the
company planned to exploit the opportunity.
Part of the plan consists of signing franchise agreements which will bring
the Toys R Us name to markets that would not otherwise have been entered for
many years.
Two agreements have been signed: one with an unnamed Saudi Arabian company
for toy stores in Saudi Arabia, and another with Al Futtain Sons, a company
based in the United Arab Emirates, for the operation of stores in the UAE,
Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait.
Mr Lazarus said that in spite of the expansion plans - which one analyst
estimated would result in total capital spending of about Dollars 650m this
year - the company was generating substantial excess cash flow. The share
repurchase plan had therefore been adopted to increase shareholder value.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: McCain arbitration hearing opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An arbitrator has begun hearing evidence in the Canadian province of New
Brunswick to determine the future of McCain Foods, the international
potato-chip and frozen-food processor which has been riven by a row among
McCain family shareholders.
The closed hearing is the culmination of a long feud between Harrison and
Wallace McCain, the two brothers who are McCain Foods' joint chief
executives and between them control two-thirds of its shares.
The arbitration, including an appeals mechanism to which both sides have
agreed, is expected to be completed by the end of April.
The dispute has dragged on for more than three years since Mr Wallace McCain
defied his brother by appointing his son Michael as head of McCain's US
operations.
Wallace has also proposed splitting the company along geographic lines, with
his branch of the family controlling the North American and Australian
operations, and Harrison taking over the European side. Harrison and other
board members insist the company should remain one unit.

Conran Stores, which operates the US branch of the Habitat chain founded by
Sir Terence Conran in the UK, is seeking protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
The company's 14 home furnishings stores, which operate in the US under the
Habitat name, were attempting to find a buyer, but it seemed unlikely they
would continue in their existing form.
Conran Stores is owned by a group of US investors headed by Mr Marvin Traub,
a former chairman of the Bloomingdale's department store group. They bought
the loss-making company from Storehouse, the UK retailing group, in 1992.
Mr Traub's company had tried to revive the chain, but said that the
'difficult and very competitive retail environment and the continuing
general economic decline which had severely affected Conran's during prior
years proved too high a hurdle to overcome.'
Discussions were being held with several parties, but if these proved
unsuccessful the company would 'take appropriate action to maximise
recoveries from a prompt disposition of its assets'.

Morgan Stanley Derivative Products has initial capital of Dollars 150m in

Several banks and securities firms have set up separately capitalised
derivatives units to compete with top-rated banks. The over-the-counter

<TEXT>
Oracle, the US computer database software company, is emerging as a leader
in software for interactive television (I-TV) services.
Today it plans to announce an alliance with Bell Atlantic, the US regional
telephone company, to offer jointly the first commercial I-TV service in the
US.
While several US companies have begun experimental trials of I-TV, Bell
Atlantic and Oracle say they will establish the first commercial US I-TV
service in Washington DC, starting in March. Oracle will provide new
multimedia database software and systems integration services.
The two companies also announced long-term plans to market jointly
interactive information technology to telecommunications and cable-TV
companies.
The Oracle software will manage multimedia databases containing thousands of
films for 'movies on demand' services as well as video, audio and text for
on-line shopping and information services.
Bell Atlantic has been one of the most aggressive 'Baby Bells' in moving
towards interactive information services. Last October, it announced plans
to merge with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable-TV company.
Oracle's new multimedia database software is designed to run on a variety of
computers. Bell Atlantic will run it on a parallel supercomputer developed
by nCube, of California.
In the UK, British Telecom has adopted a similar configuration of Oracle
software and an nCube supercomputer for a test of interactive television
being conducted at its Martlesham laboratories.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Credit Agricole sees static
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Agricole, the network of agricultural co-operative banks which is one
of the largest forces in French banking, expects to report static net
profits of about FFr5.2bn (Dollars 881m) for 1993.
Mr Lucien Douroux, who took over as chairman last year when Mr Philippe
Jaffre left to head the Elf Aquitaine oil group, said in an interview with
Les Echos newspaper that the bank had produced a very good performance in a
difficult economic climate.
The French banks have had a tough time for the past two years, due to the
sluggish state of the credit market and the impact of the economic recession
on their corporate loans and property holdings. Some banks have plunged into
the red. Others have suffered sharp falls in profits.
Credit Agricole has remained relatively resilient against this grim
scenario. It saw net profits rise by 6 per cent to FFr5.2bn in 1993 from
FFr4.9bn in 1992. Mr Douroux said cuts in French interest rates had a
moderate impact on the bank's 1993 results, but should have a positive
effect this year.
Hermes, one of the best known names in French luxury goods, managed to
increase net profits by an estimated 21 per cent to FFr200m last year, in
spite of the difficulties in the luxury market.
The company, which is still controlled by the Hermes family, had previously
predicted more modest growth in profits to FFr180m in 1993 from FFr165.2m in
1992.
However, Hermes yesterday forecast that the final level of growth would be
higher as its export sales had been particularly good during the year. It
experienced strong growth in silks, leather goods and clothing, but saw
sales fall in perfume and tableware.
The luxury goods industry has for the past three years been badly affected
by the global economic recession. However, Hermes, which operates at the
very top of the market, has emerged unscathed.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: French spectacles group seeks
fresh investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chauvin, the French spectacles manufacturer, plans to raise capital by
bringing in institutional investors in order to finance expansion.
Mr Bernard Chauvin, whose family owns 80 per cent of the company, said he
hoped to attract institutional investment to accelerate Chauvin's
development and to reduce debts.
Chauvin recently bought the spectacles division of Smith &amp; Nephew in the UK
and has taken control of Ankerpharm, a spectacles manufacturer in eastern
Germany.
Ankerpharm made had sales of FFr140m (Dollars 24m) last year and the old
Smith &amp; Nephew business mustered turnover of FFr65m.
Mr Chauvin said the two companies were not as profitable as Chauvin, but
that both had great potential.
Chauvin, which has invested heavily in expanding its French research and
development facilities by ploughing FFr80m into the construction of a new
research centre at Montpellier, saw net profits fall to an estimated FFr30m
last year from FFr38m in 1992.
Mr Chauvin said he expected acquisitions to contribute to a sharp increase
in turnover this year, with sales rising to about FFr580m against an
estimated FFr345m for 1993.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Spirit of glasnost loses its
charm / A look at the implications of the CSA wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic appears to be losing some of its enthusiasm for foreign
investors. After the recent bitter dispute between the Czech government and
Volkswagen over cuts in VW's investment for its Skoda joint venture, Prague
is now embroiled in a growing row with Air France, the French flag carrier,
which acquired a minority stake in the former Czechoslovak national airline
CSA two years ago.
When the partnership was formed in June 1992 with Air France and the
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) taking a stake of
nearly 40 per cent in CSA, it was part of the Czech government's strategy of
encouraging foreign investment to improve the competitive position of its
national airline. This was at a time when other east European countries were
seeking western partners and equipment for their flag carriers.
Air France and the Caisse des Depots, the French state financial
institution, paid Dollars 30m for almost 20 per cent of CSA's share capital
with Air France providing training and other services to the Czech airline.
The EBRD paid Dollars 30m for a similar stake in CSA, while the Czech state
retained 49 per cent and the rest went to small shareholders.
For CSA, the partnership was to provide an opening to new western markets as
well as western expertise to modernise the airline. For Air France, the
investment was part of its efforts to expand its international alliances,
strengthen its global network and provide it with a platform for expansion
in what was then seen as a fast growing east European air transport market.
However, the relationship between CSA and Air France has turned sour as the
Czech airline has plunged deeper into the red, with expected losses of
Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 41m) for 1993, while Air France is facing financial and
labour problems at home.
The two sides are locked in bitter negotiations as the Czech government
complained it had expected better and more collaboration from Air France.
Last Saturday, it wrote a letter to the French airline outlining what it
considered were the Czech carrier's problems and suggested that it would be
best for Air France to sell back its share.
Air France insisted it did not want to withdraw from CSA which it regards as
a long-term investment. Instead, Air France and the EBRD are seeking a
capital injection of about Kcs746m from the Czech government for what they
argue was an overvaluation of the airline during the 1992 deal.
This followed an independent audit by consultants Ernst and Young called for
by Mr Bernard Attali, the former chairman of Air France who resigned last
year when he failed to secure the backing of the French government for a
sweeping restructuring programme for the French carrier.
In return for injecting fresh money into the airline, the Czech government
has been seeking to increase its control of CSA. But the government's stance
appears to point to a broader change of mood about the role of foreign
investors in large Czech companies.
CSA confirmed this week that the government wanted to reduce the power of
foreign shareholders on CSA's management board, by forcing changes in the
powers of the general assembly and of the airline's board of directors. But
these changes, which would give the Czech government a majority voice on all
important decisions in the company, are being resisted by Air France.
The row has led to the sacking of Mr Jiri Fiker as CSA president, and the
resignation of Mr Georges Vejdovsky, one of the Air France representatives
on the CSA board.
Air France, which is still hoping to reach a compromise solution with the
Czech government, agreed to Mr Vejdovsky's resignation as a conciliatory
gesture. It has agreed in principle to a Czech proposal to reduce the number
of representatives on the airline's board from 15 to 10 members. But it has
insisted on retaining a blocking vote on important board decisions.
The Czech government holds a majority of seats on the board but requires the
vote of its foreign partners on all important issues.
CSA's managers have been left in the dark as to the government's long-term
intentions. Although the government claims it has two other airlines and
financial institutions lined up in the wings to take over from Air France,
one CSA official said: 'We were very surprised by the government's
proposals. I don't know if Mr Strasky (the transport minister) knows of any
managers who can turn the company around. We are also looking for some
answers.'
CSA's financial problems are the result of a combination of factors
including an ageing fleet, costly leases on new Airbus aircraft contracted
before 1992, a surplus of employees and unprofitable routes. This comes with
increasingly tough international competition.
The Czech government has complained of unfair competition by western
European airlines. Last week, it decided unilaterally to reduce by a third
the number of flights by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines between Prague and
Amsterdam provoking protests from the Dutch government and KLM.
The plight of CSA has raised the question whether the Czech Republic and
other east European countries need their own flag carriers. One alternative
is to set up in eastern Europe an airline partnership combining several
national carriers similar to the Scandinavian Airlines System group.

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Conde criticises Bank for
intervention in Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde, the former president of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank,
yesterday criticised the Spanish authorities for imposing a new management
on the bank, and claimed he had been restoring it to financial health.
In his first public statement since he was ousted two weeks ago, Mr Conde
told a press conference that he believed a rescue plan which he had
presented to the Bank of Spain days before the intervention would have been
successful.
Separately, it was learned that the Bank of Spain tried to persuade Mr Conde
to sell his personal 4.5 per cent stake in Banesto, Spain's fourth largest
bank, just days before dismissing him and his board.
At a meeting with Mr Conde on December 22, the Bank's deputy governor, Mr
Miguel Martin, is understood to have asked Mr Conde if he would sell his
stake in the bank but did not name a buyer.
The Central Bank declined to comment on the conversation but it indicates
that the authorities may have been trying to arrange a quieter departure
from Banesto before a run on deposits and the suspension of its stock
triggered the Central Bank's official intervention on December 28.
Mr Conde yesterday evaded questions about pressure to sell his stock.
Without referring to any particular meeting, he intimated that 'out of
loyalty' to other shareholders, he had had occasion to refuse to sell his
shares in Banesto.
Mr Conde said he still believed that the plan developed with the advice of
J. P. Morgan, the US bank, 'was the best solution for Banesto, for its
shareholders, and the domestic financial sector'.
However, Mr Conde said he did not intend to take legal action against the
authorities, although he had been advised that he had grounds to do so. He
would merely lodge a routine appeal against the intervention.
Mr Conde said he had decided against legal action because he wanted to
respect the image of Spain and of its banking supervisors.
'Banesto's situation on December 28, did not require any emergency action,
particularly from the point of view of its liquidity and its solvency,' Mr
Conde said.
He added that the bank, under the plan that he had presented to the
authorities, did not require any write-down of equity.
The intervention followed an inspection by the Bank of Spain which
identified a potential Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) over-valuation of its
Pta7,000bn assets. Banesto and J. P. Morgan estimated the over-valuation at
Pta372bn.
Mr Conde disputed in detail the estimate by the Bank of Spain that Banesto's
loan portfolio was over-valued by Pta223bn. Banesto and J. P. Morgan
estimated the loan over-valuation at Pta166bn.
Mr Conde said the loans had been examined and were in the process of being
provisioned for. 'Our plan was exhaustively analysed by J. P. Morgan which
estimated that our projected balance sheet was sensible and reasonable,' Mr
Conde said.
Mr Conde rejected outright the Bank of Spain's estimate of a Pta66bn pension
fund shortfall saying that a prior inspection by the Bank of Spain in
December 1992 had put the shortfall at Pta30bn and had been given eight
years to make provisions for it.
He said that a Pta81bn over-valuation estimated by the inspectors last
September for Banesto's industrial holding company was unwarranted as there
were no legal or accounting rules that called on the bank to provide for
such assets.

The Czech government has stepped up pressure on Air France to sell its
minority stake in CSA to regain control of the cash-strapped Czech national
carrier.
Czech government sources yesterday said financial institutions and two other
airlines had shown interest in CSA. CSA said Czech investors were interested
in buying Air France's stake.
CSA said a letter had been sent to Air France last Saturday asking the
French carrier to sell its stake to Czech subjects. But Air France, which
jointly with the Caisse des Depots, the French state financial institution,
paid Dollars 30m for almost 20 per cent of CSA in 1992, yesterday insisted
it wanted to remain a shareholder in CSA. It said it regarded CSA as a
long-term investment.
Although the Czech government has made it clear it considers the withdrawal
of Air France from CSA as its preferred solution for the Czech airline,
negotiations with the French company and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which holds nearly 20 per cent in
CSA, are continuing.
The trial of strength between the two sides rests on Czech demands for
greater control on the airline's board which Air France is resisting.
The Czech government is seeking to modify the June 1992 agreement with CSA's
foreign partners, especially the rule on majority votes for important
decisions at board level. Although the Czech government has a majority of
members on the board, important decisions require the vote of the foreign
partners.
Air France and EBRD have asked for a refund from the Czech government
because they claim the airline was overvalued by about Kcs746m (Dollars 25m)
at the time of the deal two years ago. The French demands appear to have
prompted the Czech government to seek to strengthen its control of the
airline in return for injecting fresh funds in CSA, which is expected to
lose Kcs1.2bn in 1993. However, there have been growing suggestions that the
Czech government is examining the role of foreign investors in large Czech
companies.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cementone at 13p premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cementone, the specialist paints and building chemicals
manufacturer, began trading yesterday at a higher than expected premium
following its reversal into Multitrust, writes Tim Burt.
The shares, placed at 73p, opened at 87p - exceeding analysts expectations
of a premium of about 8p. They closed at 86p.
About 1m shares changed hands, representing about 10 per cent of the share
capital not retained by either UB International, Cementone's former holding
company owned by Mr Vijay Mallya, or Multitrust.
Multitrust acquired the business from UB for Pounds 9m which accepted 12.32m
shares as payment, of which it agreed to retain 7.45m shares, a stake of
about 34 per cent. The balance was placed with institutions.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Debenham Tewson ahead 77%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debenham Tewson &amp; Chin-nocks, the property advisory company, yesterday
announced a 77 per cent increase to Pounds 1.65m in pre-tax profits for the
six months to end-October.
The outcome, up from Pounds 936,000 last time, was struck on turnover of
Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 17.5m) and reflected a marked recovery in the property
investment market and the successful integration of Bernard Thorpe, the
chartered surveyor.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman, said the results were achieved 'despite the fact
that the recovery in the property market is patchy and that we operate in a
very competitive environment.'
Bernard Thorpe has now been 'totally integrated', following the completion
of the merger in February 1993. The enlarged group retains debt of
approximately Pounds 4m, but the merger has created synergies for the
companies' London offices and has enabled expansion into regional property
markets.
The group has experienced a sharp increase in its fund management business,
which now manages a Pounds 5bn portfolio, and acted as agent for property
transactions worth Pounds 600m in the first half. It is also building up a
European network, and now has representative offices in all EU member
countries, except Italy.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.49p (1.81p); the interim dividend is 1.5p
(1.2p).

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Quality Care Homes advances 64%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapid expansion continued at Quality Care Homes, the Darlington-based
nursing home operator, and pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 rose
64 per cent to Pounds 3m, against Pounds 1.84m last time which was struck
after an exceptional charge of Pounds 152,000.
Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said that trading in the current year had been
good so far but the rate of earnings growth would be affected by the number
of new homes opening and a rising interest charge.
During the year capital expenditure totalled Pounds 6m, compared to
operating cash flow of Pounds 3.48m, and gearing rose from 15 per cent to 29
per cent. With capital expenditure likely to reach Pounds 8m in 1993-94,
gearing could top 50 per cent by the year end if further equity is not
raised.
Last year QCH increased its beds from 540 to 799, in 16 nursing homes. Six
home openings should take the beds total to 1,193 by the end of the current
financial year. The average cost per bed was Pounds 18,500, up 6 per cent,
but each bed is valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 27,100.
Turnover rose 40 per cent to Pounds 8.67m (Pounds 6.2m) although prices of
beds were held at 1992 rates in spite of rising costs. The impact of the new
Community Care Act on occupancy rates was small, with a rate of 96.2 per
cent compared with 98.4 per cent in 1992-93.
Operating profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 2.29m), partly
thanks to the absence of the exceptional charge which related to the
flotation in July 1992. Net interest fell Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 155,000,
with Pounds 124,000 (Pounds 69,000) of interest capitalised.
After a lower tax rate of 22.5 per cent (30.1 per cent) earnings per share,
excluding the exceptional charge, rose 49 per cent to 17.5p (11.8p).
A final proposed dividend of 3p gives a total of 4.5p, up 12.5 per cent on
the indicated dividend for 1992-93.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Geest shares slide on loss warning -
Outbreak of black sigatoka disease hits Costa Rican production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geest shares fell sharply yesterday after it warned that an attack of a
fungal disease on its banana plantations in Costa Rica would push it into
the red for 1993.
The company will incur an exceptional charge of Pounds 8.9m to cover the
costs of fighting the disease. The shares closed at 276p, down 87p on the
day.
Mr David Sugden, chief executive of the fresh produce and prepared food
group, said the company had had to cut down almost 30 per cent of the stems
on its 3,000 hectares of plantation after an outbreak of black sigatoka
disease. Its Costa Rican production, normally 7.5m to 8m boxes of bananas a
year, was between 2.5m and 3m boxes down.
The news took the market by surprise. Sigatoka is a routine hazard for
banana growers in Latin America and is normally controlled by spraying.
However, Mr Sugden said that the weather patterns in the rainy season at the
end of last year had led to a loss of control over the disease in Costa
Rica.
In addition, delays in changing the European banana imports regime hit
banana prices in the second half of last year.
The quota of so-called dollar bananas, grown in Latin America more cheaply
than in the West Indies, was set at 1m tonnes for the final five months of
the year.
The resulting oversupply to Europe had 'severely depressed returns to our
producing partners in the Windward Islands,' said Geest, the sole exporter
and shipper of Windward Island bananas.
Geest will also make a further Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge for
rationalisation of its UK fresh produce wholesale business.
Last year Geest's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 20.4m on
turnover of Pounds 625m. Bananas account for about a third of group
turnover. Analysts, who were expecting profits of about Pounds 10m, now
expect a loss of about Pounds 5m or 9p a share.
Geest intends to maintain its dividend at 8.1p.
Mr Sugden said that in the past three years the company had invested Pounds
120m on its strategy of becoming a big European supplier of both dollar and
West Indian bananas.
He criticised the European Union's offer during the Gatt negotiations last
month to lift the quota for dollar bananas by a further 100,000 tonnes this
year, and a further 100,000 tonnes next year. 'The political decision to
increase the dollar quota has done the market no favours,' he said
yesterday.
In Dublin, Fyffes, the other main banana distributor in the UK market, said
that it 'has to date noticed no changes in trading conditions or price
levels' resulting from new quota offers made in the final stages of the Gatt
negotiations.
Fyffes also said that black sigatoka disease had not had any effect on the
company, which over the past three years has been building up supplies from
Guatemala and Honduras. Unlike Geest, Fyffes has no plantations of its own
in central America, buying instead from independent producers on contract.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Russian vodka deal for IDV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Distillers &amp; Vintners, Grand Metropolitan's drinks division,
has secured exclusive distribution rights for Stolichnaya Russian vodka in
the US and Mexico from PepsiCo.
The deal, terms of which have not been disclosed, gives IDV swift, if
partial, compensation for the loss of Absolut, the Swedish-owned vodka
brand. It signals a period of intense competition in the market.
Distribution rights for Absolut, which IDV built into the leading imported
premium vodka in the US with annual sales of about 3m cases, are being
transferred next month to Seagram, the North American drinks group.
Vin &amp; Sprit, Absolut's owner, is believed to have made the switch because of
growing doubts about its future development alongside IDV's Smirnoff - the
world's best-selling vodka - and Popov brands.
Analysts estimated the move would cost IDV about Pounds 40m a year in lost
profits, though the company has been compensated for the premature end to
its contract which had been due to run until September.
Stolichnaya is the second largest imported premium vodka in the US with
sales, according to Impact International, the industry monitor, of about 1m
cases a year.
Several other brands of Russian vodka - Stolichnaya Cristall, Russkaya,
Priviet, and the flavoured products, Limonaya, Pertsovka and Okhotnichaya -
are included in the deal, which is subject to approval by US regulatory
authorities.
PepsiCo has held the US rights for Stolichnaya from Russia's
Sojuzplodoimport since 1973 and will continue to do so on IDV's behalf at
least until December 2000.
The brands will be handled in the US by Carillon Importers, an IDV
subsidiary, and in Mexico by Premium Brands.

company fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Saracen Fund Managers, a new company set up by a former director of Scottish
Amicable, has issued a pathfinder prospectus for an investment trust
specialising in smaller companies.
Saracen Value Trust aims to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for
subscription, sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney Securities.
The fund will be invested in smaller companies from the FT-SE SmallCap Index
(excluding investment trusts), selected on a value basis, with the aim of
achieving long term capital growth.
Mr Jim Fisher, managing director and co-owner (with IAF Group) of Saracen
Fund Managers, managed the Amicable Smaller Enterprise Trust from launch in
March 1992 until September 1993.
Saracen said the trust was being launched now because smaller companies were
expected to do well with the economy moving out of recession and low and
stable inflation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two more insurers have warned of future cuts in with-profits policy bonus
levels, while maintaining pay-outs at similar levels this year.
Commercial Union has cut pay-outs for shorter term with-profits policies,
but announced a special 5 per cent reversionary bonus for longer term
policies taken out before January 1 1975. A 25 year endowment, taken out by
a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, maturing this month, would be worth
Pounds 65,599, up 4.2 per cent from last year. A 10-year policy pays Pounds
6,807, down 5 per cent.
Guardian Royal Exchange, which pulled out of the with-profits endowment
market in 1992, continues to be among the lowest payers on existing
with-profits policies.
It has held annual bonuses at last year's level, while raising terminal
bonuses for policies of over 15 years. Its pay-out on a 25-year policy is
Pounds 44,379, up 0.7 per cent from last year, while the 10-year pay-out is
down 1.4 per cent at Pounds 4,952.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stakis recovers with Pounds 10.4m -
Restructuring completed: 'we're just a normal boring company now'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, confirmed its recovery in 1993 by
making pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m against a loss of Pounds 47.4m last
time, when the figure was hit by an exceptional provision of Pounds 47.7m.
After two years of restructuring, asset sales and a capital injection, the
Glasgow-based group is now 'a normal company, boring even,' said Mr David
Michels, chief executive.
Thanks to last year's Pounds 28m rights issue and the sale of the nursing
homes, debt fell to Pounds 117m at the October 3 year-end against Pounds
197m, cutting gearing from 77 per cent to 46 per cent.
Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said the results owed 'little to the market
and virtually everything to the group's own endeavours.'
Operating profits on continuing businesses increased by Pounds 6m to Pounds
25.6m.
Hotels increased operating profit by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 19.6m and
achieved an average occupancy rate of 69 per cent. Room rates hardened
slightly.
The company now has 31 hotels following its purchase of a hotel in York for
Pounds 5m.
Casinos increased operating profit by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 10.9m. Business
was slightly up, particularly in casinos south of Leeds, and the division
enjoyed the benefit of tighter management. Three casinos were acquired in
the Midlands.
Turnover on continuing businesses was Pounds 130.8m in the 53 week period
(Pounds 124m for 52 weeks).
Discontinued businesses had turnover of Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 30m).
Earnings per share came out at 2.81p (losses of 17.38p).
There is a recommended final dividend of 0.55p. The interim dividend was
restored during the year at 0.45p, making a total of 1p (0.45p).
COMMENT
Stakis is now a well-run company. The profit increase is impressive given
that it had little help from the economic upturn, as shown by the modest
turnover growth in the 53 weeks. Since the year end hotel room rates and
occupancy have been rising slightly, and the casinos had a good first
quarter. After attracting a disproportionate amount of media attention for
its troubles Stakis says it wants to be boring. But it would be a pity if
that meant passing up opportunities among the many hotels now on the market.
Analysts are looking for Pounds 17m pre-tax profit in 1994, putting the
shares on a prospective multiple of about 18, and for Pounds 21m next year.
The share price, up 4p to 75p yesterday, already reflects much of the
stock's recovery.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Extension for Queens Moat petition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dennis Woodhams, a dissident Queens Moat Houses shareholder, and the
company were yesterday given a further 14 days to present evidence to the
Companies Court to back a petition he issued last November under S459 of the
Companies Act.
Mr Woodhams complained that shareholders had been given insufficient
information and this was prejudicing the interests of some shareholders.
In an affidavit Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive of QMH, said the petition
was premature as the group could not give shareholders detailed information
until it had agreed terms of its planned Pounds 1.3bn debt refinancing.
QMH regards Mr Woodhams as a needless diversion running up legal costs.
The court ordered a full hearing of the petition without delay, although
this is not expected to take place for a few months.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: VHE matches its flotation forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VHE Holdings yesterday reported profits of Pounds 1.77m for the six months
to September 30 - in line with expectations at the specialist contractor's
flotation in that month.
The shares, placed at 115p, rose 11p yesterday to 135p.
The Barnsley-based group specialises in environmental land regeneration,
mainly for local authorities and construction companies, and civil
engineering.
Mr Brian Waldron. chairman, said current trading remains 'very profitable
although traditionally the winter is our quieter period'. Since the
flotation, new work totalling some Pounds 6.5m had been secured with tender
enquiries continuing at 'record levels'.
The pre-tax outcome - which compared with profits of Pounds 1.5m last time -
came on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 9.46m).
Cash balances at the period-end amounted to Pounds 5m with interest
receivable of Pounds 157,000 comparing with payable of Pounds 7,000.
A maiden interim dividend of 1.1p is payable from earnings of 3.9p (3.3p)

FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tribune cuts deficit to IPounds
463,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tribune Newspapers, the Dublin-based printing and publishing group, returned
to profit at the operating level in the year to June 30.
Operating profit amounted to IPounds 56,000 (Pounds 54,085), including a
contribution of IPounds 12,000 from Tribune Publications. Charges of IPounds
519,000 (IPounds 259,000) emanating from the group's substantial debt
burden, however, resulted in a reduced pre-tax deficit of IPounds 463,000
(IPounds 1.15m).
Taking in IPounds 526,000 from the acquisition, turnover was ahead at
IPounds 6.43m (IPounds 6.29m). Losses per share narrowed from 43.84p to
16.2p.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: PSIT advances 38% to Pounds 5.38m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSIT, the property investor formerly known as Property Security Investment
Trust, yesterday announced a 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 5.38m for the six months to end-September.
The company said that its main investment activities progressed
satisfactorily. 'Values have improved as the yield on property compares more
favourably with other forms of investment and there are now signs of
increasing rental enquiries,' it said.
Part of the company's land in Florida, which was required for a new highway,
was compulsorily acquired which would help release the full potential of the
site. The extension to the District shopping centre in Australia had been
formally opened and was now making a good contribution to income.
Total rents increased from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 10.1m, while interest costs
fell from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 4.56m.
Earnings per share rose from 2.13p to 2.99p. The interim dividend goes up
from 1.5p to 1.75p.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Howden fan integration prompts 11p share
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Howden Group rose 11p to 96p yesterday after the Glasgow-based
engineering company said it had successfully integrated two large fan
companies bought last year in an attempt to diversify from large-scale
contracting work.
The group spent Pounds 40m on acquiring Novenco, a Danish maker of
industrial fans, and Buffalo Forge, a US fan and air-handling business,
following heavy losses on a Danish tunnelling contract which caused a crash
in Howden's share price in 1990.
The group said yesterday: 'The initial benefits obtained from the
reorganisation of our European and North American fan companies is
encouraging and a firm foundation for future growth has now been put in
place.'
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.05m to Pounds 9.45m in the six
months to October 31, although the previous figure was reduced by an
exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m - the final loss on the Danish contract.
Turnover increased from Pounds 156.2m to Pounds 170.5m. Earnings rose to
2.2p (1.8p); the interim dividend is 0.82p (0.75p).
Mr Johnny Johnsen, chief executive, said rationalisation of the fans
business had gone extremely well, with 650 jobs having been shed in North
America, the UK and Denmark. Another 200 jobs would go at Wirth, the group's
lossmaking German drilling equipment subsidiary.
These cost reductions, coupled with excellent order prospects for the rest
of the year, were expected to return Wirth to profitability next year.
The board said it believed that further progress will be made in the second
half, although it was still cautious about the rate at which the group's
various world markets would recover from recession.
COMMENT
The share price rise reflected market relief that Howden's strategy seems to
be working out as promised. The group claims a dominant position in fans
and, having trimmed costs, should benefit from any upturn in its main
markets. Wirth seems poised to win significant orders in east Asia. The 22
per cent recovery in earnings will not be maintained at the year-end, when
earnings will be diluted by the 62m new shares issued last year, but a 10
per cent advance seems feasible. On forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m,
the shares are on a prospective multiple of 15, or a 13 per cent discount to
the market. Having survived the Danish debacle, Howden is unlikely to do
anything rash and at this level looks a reasonably priced recovery play.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: All-round rise puts Jacques Vert at Pounds
0.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An all-round improvement with the retail division returning to profits was
behind an increase from Pounds 186,000 to Pounds 833,000 in interim pre-tax
profits at Jacques Vert, the women's wear supplier.
Mr Alan Green and Mr Jack Cynamon, joint chairman, said that spring/summer
orders for its Jacques Vert and Jacques Vert Plus labels were at record
levels.
Turnover for the six months to October 30 was higher at Pounds 21.2m,
against Pounds 19.5m, which included Pounds 1.08m from discontinued
activities.
A property revaluation resulted in a charge above the line of Pounds
400,000. There was, however, a Pounds 255,000 turnround in exceptional
items. Last year there was a charge on activities to be discontinued of
Pounds 215,000 against a credit this time of Pounds 40,000, the result of
Pounds 130,000 loss on disposal offset by a previous year provision of
Pounds 170,000.
Borrowings were halved from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.7m. Interest charges
fell to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 273,000). The company said it was the second
year there had been a significant fall. Two years ago net debt stood at
Pounds 6.1m.
After a tax charge of Pounds 381,000, against a credit of Pounds 200,000,
earnings per share were 4.8p (4.2p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.5p
(1p).

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Elonex sets up software alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elonex, the privately-owned UK personal computer manufacturer, has formed a
strategic alliance with Next, the US software company led by Mr Steven Jobs,
founder of Apple Computer.
It has agreed to market in Europe a range of specially built pcs pre-loaded
with Next's NextStep software. NextStep is designed to make it easier for
software developers and commercial companies to write business software.
The new Elonex pcs were developed at its California research and development
centre in conjunction with Next engineers. They will cost typically from
Pounds 2,775 to Pounds 5,555 ex VAT.
The aim of the joint venture is to create a volume market for NextStep in
Europe. The two companies hope to sell about 20,000 systems across Europe
this year, chiefly in the financial services, legal services and
telecommunications markets.
Next already has a number of alliances with pc manufacturers in the US
including Dell, the third largest US pc maker, but none in Europe until now.
Mr Israel Wetrin, Elonex founder, said the deal would open doors for both
companies: 'NextStep has huge cost-saving potential because it allows
developers to build complex applications quickly,' he said.
NextStep is recognised as pioneering the trend towards 'object oriented'
software development in which software modules can be clicked together like
plastic bricks and used time and again.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Titaghur turns to New York in listing quest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Titaghur, the long-established jute manufacturer which lost its London
listing in 1990, has turned to New York-based Nasdaq, where it hopes to be
listed in the spring.
The company, which runs jute mills in India, incurred lower losses of Pounds
4.2m in the year ended March 1993, against Pounds 4.8m, taking its
accumulated deficit to a little more than Pounds 61m.
Mr Reg Brealey, the chairman who was acquitted of charges of insider dealing
in 1991, said in his statement to shareholders that most of the trading loss
could be attributed to the last six months of trading and was 'due to a
shortage of raw materials and a massive increase in their cost over the
harvest purchase price'.
A Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) bond linked with the listing was currently under
negotiation in New York, he said. The money would be used, among other
things, to pay for storage facilities at Greenock and Glasgow to supply
customers in the UK and Europe and to pay off Pounds 2m of capital loans.
The shares, worth Pounds 16.88 at their peak in 1989, were trading in London
on a matched bargain basis at 24p yesterday.
The company is expecting 'significant improvements' in its trading position.
It has installed new management in the mills and reduced its labour force to
18,000 by not replacing 2,000 workers who had reached retirement age. It has
agreed with the unions a deal to reduce the number of workers per tonne of
jute from nearly 50 to 40, which could lead to the loss of a further 2,200
jobs.
The annual meeting takes place in London on January 31.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Production problems hit Magellan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production problems at Magellan Industries yesterday forced the lingerie and
swimwear manufacturer to issue a profits warning which sent the share price
tumbling 44p to 168p.
The company said it had been unable to meet demand from retailers, including
its main customer Marks and Spencer, because it had failed to recruit enough
workers for its Midlands and south coast factories and had encountered
problems with some raw material supplies.
Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said sales in the year to December 31
were 12.5 per cent below expectations in spite of strong demand.
'This frustrating situation has inevitably had a very significant impact on
profitability because of the high operational gearing of the business,' he
added.
The profits warning is a blow for the company, formerly known as Celestion
Industries, which only returned to the black in 1992 following extensive
restructuring. In September, it reported first-half 1993 pre-tax losses of
Pounds 174,000 (restated Pounds 93,000).
Mr Ryder said Magellan was embarking on 'radical action' to recruit more
workers and to streamline its management structure.
He also forecast stronger sales in 1994 after changes to improve
productivity and overcome supply problems.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Watson &amp; Philip plans store expansion after
21% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watson &amp; Philip, the retail and wholesale food group, plans to expand its
convenience store chain by at least 50 units this year, in a further move
away from its wholesaling roots.
The announcement came as W&amp;P reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits for the year to October 29, from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 12.5m. The
shares leapt 33p to 343p.
The company has gone through several changes in the last year aimed at
repositioning it as primarily a retailer rather than a wholesaler.
Most important was the Pounds 21m acquisition of the Circle K chain last
February.
Circle K's advanced systems were extended into Allday, W&amp;P's existing
convenience store business, and both groups integrated into a reorganised
distribution network.
In October, W&amp;P sub-contracted its Spar and VG supply business to four other
wholesalers in a deal worth Pounds 21m over six years.
The company hopes to add 50 stores to its 316-strong chain by the end of
October, as well as 15 franchise stores, and may increase the expansion rate
to 80 stores next year.
Group turnover increased from Pounds 492m to Pounds 573.9m, thanks largely
to a 36-week contribution from Circle K.
Retail sales more than doubled to Pounds 154.7m, with profits increasing
more than four-fold to Pounds 4.6m.
Turnover at the food service division, which supplies hotels, restaurants
and institutions, increased 3 per cent to Pounds 81m, but profits more than
doubled to Pounds 1.5m as the gross margin benefited from a move out of fast
food supply.
However, profits fell 30 per cent at the cash and carry business to Pounds
2.2m on sales down 8.5 per cent.
Earnings increased 20 per cent to 26p per share, and the proposed final
dividend is 9.9p, lifting the total 7.5 per cent to 14.3p.
COMMENT
The market's enthusiastic response to the news from W&amp;P may be justified.
The company sees a gap in the market for well-run and well-positioned
convenience stores, providing for top-up purchases between superstore
visits, and backed by similar systems and distribution networks to grocery
multiples. The impressive performance of Circle K since its acquisition
appears to support that claim. Convenience store expansion should also make
problems in the cash and carry chain, whose small-business customers have
been decimated by recession and the expansion of multiples and discounters,
an irrelevance. Forecasts of Pounds 14.5m for 1994 put the shares on a
prospective p/e of 12, and at a prospective yield of 5.5 per cent they look
attractive.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse and Laura Ashley sales increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence that retailers enjoyed a good Christmas came yesterday from
Storehouse, which announced a 13 per cent sales increase on the year before,
and Laura Ashley, which said sales were up 18 per cent.
Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive of Storehouse, said its BHS, Mothercare
and Blazer chains all achieved strong sales increases in the six weeks to
Christmas, leading to an overall like-for-like increase - excluding the
effect of store openings and closures - of 13 per cent. Sales in BHS's
Christmas shop, of children's clothing and of lingerie were particularly
strong.
But he admitted gross margins were down slightly as a result of 'additional
promotional activity', although 'profitability over the period was fully in
line with expectations'.
The like-for-like sales increase for the year to date was now ahead of the 5
per cent reported in November, he added.
Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer and manufacturer, said
like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland for the eight weeks to Christmas
were up 17.6 per cent. Like-for-like sales in North America increased 17.5
per cent. Continental European sales however, were down 2.5 per cent.
Mr Jim Maxmin, chief executive, said the UK rise was in line with
expectations, and achieved with little discounting. The increase in North
America was flattered by a poor performance in 1992, but provided evidence
of 'substantial recovery' in the business.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Savills benefits from return of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savills, the estate agent and surveyor, revealed the benefits of a further
recovery in confidence in London's commercial property market when it
announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.19m, against Pounds 163,000.
Turnover for the six months to October 31 rose 20 per cent to Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 11.9m), with improved performances from all core businesses.
Mr George Inge, chairman, said the most noticeable improvements had been in
the London residential business and in commercial investment, where there
was 'more optimism now than there has been for several years'.
Savills is holding Pounds 5m in cash and is looking for opportunities to
expand. One area of focus is likely to be property financing. It set up
Savills Finance Holdings in August, which should be profitable in its first
year. Mr Inge described it as an area of great potential.
Operating profit from commercial property more than doubled to Pounds
568,000 (Pounds 250,000), while agricultural and residential property
contributed Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 176,000 loss).
Group earnings per share was 2.1p (0.03p) and the directors announced an
interim dividend of 0.75p.

FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports expects 19% lift to Pounds
20.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alpha Airports Group, which is coming to the market later this month,
yesterday forecast a 19 per cent rise in operating profits for the year to
January 31.
The airport services division of Forte said in its pathfinder prospectus
that operating profits would reach Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 17.3m) on turnover
of Pounds 423.1m (Pounds 404.5m).
Alpha's business is divided almost equally between catering for airlines and
retail trading at airports. It expects profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds
13.1m) from the catering side on turnover of Pounds 210.1m (Pounds 197.5m).
The retail side's turnover is expected to be Pounds 213m (Pounds 207m) with
operating profits of Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.2m).
Half the shares are expected to be taken up by institutions with a further
25 per cent going to retail buyers and Forte retaining the remaining 25 per
cent. Market capitalisation is expected to be about Pounds 200m.
Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said the flotation was a further step in the
implementation of its strategy of concentration on the core hotel and
restaurant businesses.
Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive of Alpha, said that the flotation would
give it a springboard for development just as its markets were beginning to
rise. BAA is forecasting a growth rate of 4.5 per cent a year for UK
passengers until at least 2005.
Alpha also announced the appointment of Mr Rodney Galpin as non-executive
chairman. Mr Galpin, was chairman and chief executive of Standard Chartered
from 1988 to 1993.
UBS are sponsors to the flotation.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Severe cuts at Westinghouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Westinghouse, the stricken US conglomerate, announced wide-ranging charges
and lay-offs in an attempt to put behind it a disastrous foray into
financial services during the 1980s.
The company surprised the stock market with the severity of its measures,
which include pre-tax charges totalling Dollars 750m (Pounds 504m), a
planned cut of 6,000 in its workforce over the next two years and halving
its dividend.
It also announced plans to issue Dollars 500m of new capital in the first
half to bolster its flagging balance sheet.
The charges have pushed the company's capitalisation base down to Dollars
1bn compared to Dollars 2.2bn before.
Yesterday's news was the first sign of the drastic surgery promised by Mr
Michael Jordan, the former senior PepsiCo director who was brought in six
months ago to revive the ailing group.
Westinghouse, whose biggest businesses span power generation, broadcasting
and defence, suffered losses put at more than Dollars 5bn after ploughing
money into building junk bond and commercial property operations in the
late-1980s.
Contributing to the charges announced yesterday was Dollars 350m to cover
restructuring costs and the lay-off of 3,400 staff. The world-wide headcount
will come down to around 48,000 by attrition, Westinghouse said.
Also, restructuring and writedowns of businesses which the company plans to
sell will cost Dollars 215m, and it has put aside Dollars 185m to cover the
settlement of legal disputes and environmental clean-up costs.
Westinghouse also adopted a more conservative approach to accounting for
pension liabilities, wiping a further Dollars 255m off its shrunken capital
base.
This has prompted the company to plan an issue of Dollars 500m of preference
shares, which will be converted into ordinary shares at some time in the
future.
Referring to the headway Westinghouse has made in disposing of loans and
other assets over the past year, Mr Jordan said: 'We are essentially out of
the financial services business.' He added that the group's debt had fallen
by Dollars 3.2bn during 1993, to an estimated Dollars 5.2bn at the end of
the year.
Mr Jordan's actions were cautiously welcomed by analysts, who said Mr Jones
had yet to set out his plans for the future.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Tiphook agrees to sell container business for maximum of
Pounds 757m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the debt-laden UK transport leasing group, has agreed to sell its
container business for a maximum of Pounds 757m - Pounds 73m below the
Pounds 830m price it agreed in November with the buyer, Transamerica, the US
financial services group.
The proceeds could be further reduced by between Pounds 38m and Pounds 48m,
which will be placed in an escrow account and be subject to further claims
by Transamerica under the disposal agreement.
This means that Tiphook should receive a minimum of Pounds 709m for the
container business, the group's largest asset. Although significantly less
than initially announced, the consideration is still above earlier market
expectations and should substantially reduce Tiphook's debts of about Pounds
1.1bn. Tiphook's shares last night closed 6p down at 66p.
Tiphook said that the detailed terms of the contract were being negotiated
and would be finalised 'as soon as possible'. However, the group said it was
confident that 'this is the final price'.
The proceeds will be enough to pay off Tiphook's total secured debt of
Pounds 480m owed to the group's banks, which are led by National Westminster
and Commerzbank of Germany. However, unsecured US bondholders, who have lent
Tiphook Dollars 700m, are in a more exposed position. The US bonds were last
night trading at just over a 10 per cent discount to face value.
Bond market experts believe Tiphook could still be deluged by litigation
from bondholders, claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions
about the company's prospects. Tiphook's debt was downgraded to so-called
junk-bond status within months of issue last year.
Tiphook believes it will be able to service its remaining debt by retaining
the group's other activities - including its fleet of 25,037 truck trailers,
the biggest in Europe.
The group said a circular on the containers disposal, which must be approved
by shareholders and certain providers of finance, would be sent out as soon
as practicable. Results for the six months to October 31 will be announced
then.
The results are likely to be poor. Tiphook yesterday emphasised that it was
experiencing pressures on margins in most of its markets, although
December's monthly fleet utilisation figures were stable.

FT  12 JAN 94 / LWT forecast strengthens defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television yesterday unveiled the heart of its defence
against the hostile takeover bid by the Granada group - a pre-tax profit
estimate of Pounds 43.8m for 1993. The better-than-expected figure
representing a 43 per cent increase on 1992 was backed up by pro forma
earnings per share of 28.4p, a rise of 50.3 per cent.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), promised that growth
would continue - the company has increased its pre-tax profits from Pounds
16.2m in 1990.
'Television is a good business and that's why Gerry Robinson (the Granada
chief executive) wants to get into it,' Sir Christopher said. 'They are a
recovery stock, they are a conglomerate and they are a highly geared
business.' Sir Christopher likened Granada to a heavyweight boxer. 'But all
the weight is round the belt and round the bum,' he said.
Granada, poured scorn on 'another unconvincing document which fails to rebut
the value and logic of Granada's offer'. But the profit estimates, including
an increase in trading margins from 17.9 per cent to 28.2 per cent - nearly
40 per cent in the case of the LWT Broadcasting - increased pressure on
Granada to improve its offer.
Granada, which has interests ranging from television and rental to leisure,
industrial catering and computer services, will tomorrow extend its deadline
for acceptances to February 4, the last possible date. The terms presently
stand at six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares, valuing LWT at
around Pounds 700m with a 528p cash alternative.
Mr Neil Blackley, analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, said the LWT
estimate was good. 'I think it really puts the ball into Granada's court.
They have got to increase their offer,' he said.
Granada is thought to be considering improving two aspects of the deal -
paying a final dividend to LWT shareholders and increasing the cash
alternative.
Yesterday Granada closed at 572p, down 8p, with LWT down 2p at 673p.
LWT, which tried and failed to set up a tactical takeover with
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, has not ruled out the possibility of another deal.
However, yesterday Granada asked if LWT had bid enough to compete in the new
deregulated ITV, why had it entered discussions with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
'The fact is that LWT has acknowledged the need for scale, but its own
strategy for achieving it has failed,' Mr Robinson said.

FT  12 JAN 94 / British Steel doubts mettle of Brussels deal: Chairman Brian
Moffat tells Andrew Baxter that the subsidy issue is not yet dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the stream of molten rhetoric flowing from British Steel's
headquarters in London this week, Mr Brian Moffat ought to add the title of
blast furnace No. 1 to that of chairman and chief executive.
It is nearly four weeks since European Union industry ministers agreed a
package of deals aimed at resolving disputes over subsidies for state-owned
steel-makers in Germany, Italy and Spain, and Mr Moffat is still
disappointed and concerned.
'We've had strong words in the past from ministers about subsidies. We've
got to ensure this time that the words mean something,' he says.
Disagreements over continuing state aid could delay or even put paid to much
needed capacity cuts, he warns, and slow the rise in prices in continental
Europe. As for the planned privatisation of Ilva, the loss-making Italian
producer, he asks whether it will be a privatisation 'the way you and I know
it, or will it be an Italian farce?'
Mr Moffat is right to be concerned about the Brussels deal, which will lead
to 5m tonnes of capacity cuts by subsidised producers. The deal was meant to
clear the way for non-aided companies to offer capacity cuts totalling 25m
tonnes, making a total of 30m, although many in the industry say the real
cuts will total 20m tonnes, about an eighth of the industry's effective
capacity. This, in turn, would underpin the industry's ability to raise
prices and return to profit. Europe's steelmakers lost Pounds 3bn in 1992,
and probably more last year.
'The key question for British Steel is whether they believe, and are right
to believe, that the subsidy issue is over,' says Mr Jeremy Fletcher, an
independent steel consultant.
Already there are clear signs that the subsidy issue is not dead, even if
the cases covered in the Brussels agreement do finally prove to have been
resolved. Mr Moffat is particularly upset about a plan backed by the city
state of Bremen which would rescue its Klockner-Werke steel mill. He wants
the Commission to smooth the way for a rival deal in which Bremen's
hot-rolled capacity would be shut down.
The Bremen issue is important because non-aided flat products producers view
it as a test case, and are unlikely to offer capacity cuts if the city
consortium's deal goes ahead.
But Mr Moffat stresses that he is not desperate. British Steel is the lowest
cost producer in Europe, he says, and will continue cutting costs
remorselessly to maintain its lead - although the focus of the efficiency
drive has switched from manpower to operational factors.
It is one of the few European producers to be trading profitably - it had
pre-tax profits of Pounds 27m in the first half of 1993/4. It also 'calls
the tune' in its home market, with a share of about 56 per cent, which Mr
Moffat sees as a significant advantage over German producers whose home
patch is often a 'battleground' between rivals.
Mr Philip Hampton, finance director, adds that: 'It's not a terminal case
even if the problem of continuing state aid is never settled, provided you
have a good cost advantage, which we happen to have at British Steel, and
provided you are not faced with a big capital investment, which we do not
face for a number of years.'
British Steel may need to use these strengths to weather any short-term
difficulties caused by fall-out from the Brussels deal, and take advantage
of the long-term implications. Continental steel prices are rising, giving
hope that the worst of the recession is over. But producers' reluctance to
make capacity cuts could slow this, says Mr Moffat.
Analysts such as Mr Fletcher believe British Steel could face stronger
competition in the UK, where steel demand is picking up faster than the
Continent. 'Once the Channel tunnel is open, there is no way Usinor-Sacilor
will not flex its muscles in the UK,' he says of the French producer.
Mr Moffat is more concerned, though, about any increase in imports from
central and eastern Europe, now subject to a 'gentlemen's agreement' which
took much of the heat out of a trade dispute early last year. 'If I was one
of those players and saw subsidies blatantly continuing in Europe, why
should I be responsible?' he says.
Overall, it will be difficult to make good returns from steel in Europe,
says Mr Hampton. Returns will be 'pretty dependent on south-east Asian,
Chinese and other export markets'.
This suggests a long-term message for British Steel. Mr Moffat is pledged to
enhance revenue at the company, which means cutting costs, increasing sales
or both. 'Europe will always be a priority,' he says, 'but strategically
you've got to look to grow the company somewhere else. There are growth
prospects in other places, and I guess we are looking.' Mr Moffat will not
be drawn further, but it would be a surprise if Asia, and particularly
China, was not in his sights.
Paradoxically, British Steel could be a long-term beneficiary of the
resentment in the steel industry following the Brussels agreement. The
non-aided German companies were exasperated by it, says Mr Fletcher, in
particular the agreement on subsidies and new capacity at Ekostahl in
eastern Germany. By the year 2000, there could be a single German producer,
or at most two, he says.
Mr Moffat is strongly in favour of mergers in the industry, because he
believes this is the best way to rationalise capacity. Fringe players should
be taken over by larger groups, or should merge with each other, and the
Commission should encourage the process, he says. 'Fewer players means
greater discipline, and a degree of transparency which is not there today,'
he says.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Squabble over metals group rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank has accused one of the largest domestic creditors to the
troubled Metallgesellschaft group of jeopardising plans to restore the
Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group to financial health.
The extraordinary public recriminations were triggered by a statement from
Mr Manfred Bodin, chief executive of the Norddeutsche Landesbank, who
denounced components of a DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.23bn) refinancing package which
must obtain a seal of approval from creditor banks by 5pm today.
Mr Bodin, whose bank is owed DM240m by the ailing group, condemned the
'dictatorial' way in which the rescue package was presented to bankers as an
'all or nothing' solution last week.
He declared his reluctance to see Metallgesellschaft disappear but said
NordLB would not shy away from taking responsibility for driving the group
into bankruptcy if those responsible for conducting talks with the company
did not listen to alternative proposals.
The statement from the house bank to the state of Lower Saxony, one of the
largest domestic creditors to the Metallgesellschaft group, prompted a
furious response from Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank which is
chairing the committee representing the 100-plus creditor banks. Deutsche is
the largest creditor to Metallgesellschaft as well as a major shareholder.
Deutsche said that NordLB's behaviour was 'extremely unprofessional',
endangering attempts to put Metallgesellschaft back on a sound footing. It
said that Mr Bodin's comments were 'in part unqualified' and was surprised
by them as NordLB had belonged to the committee of creditors from the start.
Mr Bodin's criticism of the refinancing package is understood to be shared
by other bank creditors, especially foreign banks with a comparatively small
exposure. The discontent among bankers focuses as much on the 'take it or
leave it' presentation of the proposals as on the details.
It is thought unlikely however opposition to the proposals will drive
Metallgesellschaft into bankruptcy. Bankers calculate that they will get far
less money back under full-scale bankruptcy than under the stringent
refinancing proposals.

FT  12 JAN 94 / US backs open competition among multimedia groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, CALIFORNIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration yesterday offered telecommunications and information
companies a new and simpler regulatory structure in exchange for their help
in building an 'information superhighway' to which every hospital, library
and classroom would have access.
Vice-president Al Gore, in a speech trumpeted by the White House for weeks,
threw the administration's weight behind open competition in the emerging
field of multimedia information services between telephone and cable
television companies.
He promised to introduce legislation to encourage private sector investment
in a new 'information infrastructure' while ensuring 'universal access' for
all Americans to the new services that are expected to develop.
'This administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or
distort the evolution of the communications industry,' Mr Gore told
communications and entertainment company executives in Los Angeles.
Mr Gore endorsed the principles of legislation already proposed in Congress
that would ease the restrictions imposed by the 1982 court judgment which
broke up the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly into 'Baby Bell' companies providing
local telephone services and a separate AT&amp;T offering long-distance
services.
Separate bills would allow the seven Bell companies, which since the
court-imposed break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly have operated under tight
restrictions, to start manufacturing telecommunications equipment and
provide long-distance telephone services. Some of the restrictions on
cross-ownership between the telephone and cable television industry sectors
would be repealed.
To achieve 'regulatory symmetry', the administration will propose
regulations that give communications companies greater freedom if they are
willing to guarantee 'non-discriminatory access' to their networks for all
service providers. This so-called 'Title 7' provision would allow companies
offering telephone, television and other services to operate under a unified
code, avoiding conflicts between current regulations which contain separate
rules for cable providers and telephone service providers. No companies
would currently qualify for Title 7's terms, White House officials said.
The plan would transfer regulatory power from the courts to the Federal
Communications Commission and Justice Department.
'Our legislative package will contain provisions designed to ensure that
each telephone carrier's networks will be readily accessible to other

FT  12 JAN 94 / NatWest poised to shed up to 4,000 jobs, say unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is today expected to become the second high street
bank this week to announce large-scale job cuts.
The announcement, after the 3,000 job losses over two years announced by
Barclays Bank on Monday, will take some of the shine off the monthly
unemployment figures due out today.
National Westminster refused to comment on its job reduction plans and said
any announcement would be made to staff first.
Unions believe the cuts will be larger than those at Barclays and may be as
high as the 4,000 that NatWest announced in February 1993.
The bank did, however, say it was committed to avoiding compulsory
redundancies if possible.
The official jobless total dropped 36,100 to 2,815,900 in November, the
eighth monthly fall last year, leading to government optimism for an
economic revival in 1994.
Falling jobless totals, however, have not reflected the shake-out in the
finance industry, which, according to the Banking, Insurance and Finance
Union, has led to the loss of 100,000 jobs in the past four years.
The union said 3,000 banking and building society branches had closed last
year - 2,000 of them bank branches. It said: 'We feel it is completely the
wrong way for the industry to go because it is alienating the customers.
'Staff are being pushed into accepting performance-related pay rises, often
geared to the sale of products such as insurance policies and pensions, and
leading to customer mistrust.'
The Barclays announcement took total job losses in its five-year programme
to 21,000 up to 1996. It believes there is still scope for voluntary
redundancies, but unions fear that the banks may be running out of other
avenues for job reductions.
National Westminster still has 2,500 branches, more than any of its high
street rivals, but it has been cutting staff in the past three years.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Yeltsin's foes unite in parliament's first session:
Ultra-nationalists set to work with Communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia's new parliament got off to an acrimonious start yesterday with
wrangling between Russia's Choice and an emerging alliance of Communists and
ultra-nationalists.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, addressing the State Duma, or
lower chamber, promised he would gear economic policy towards boosting
industrial output and attacked radical reformers for trying to rush market
reforms.
'The government will not allow ill-considered leaps forward and unreasonable
shock actions,' he said.
Mr Chernomyrdin's comments, underline the fact that he will have a large say
in cabinet changes which are likely to diminish the influence of radical
reformers in the government.
After hours of procedural wrangling, the Duma decided on the number of
deputies needed to register an official faction. Factions are allowed to
speak in every debate and have a say in the membership of parliamentary
committees.
The maiden session confirmed expectations that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, the Communists and
Communist-orientated Agrarians, will be capable of working together when the
need arises. Between them, they can command at least 211 seats out of a
total of 444 (six are still to be filled), giving them the dominant position
in the parliament and in some instances the ability to command an overall
majority.
But the Duma session gave some heart to Russia's Choice, the radical
reformists. With the support of 96 deputies, they form the largest single
group in the Duma, which could equip them in alliance with other pro-reform
parties to block decisions they oppose or deprive a parliamentary session of
a quorum.
Deputies are to reconvene tomorrow after devoting today to more
consultations on whom they will elect as speaker and as heads of
parliamentary committees.
The rouble fell against hard currencies for the second day running, ending
the day at 1,293 against the dollar, only six up on the record low of 1,299
to the dollar. Analysts said that it reflected fears of instability in the
government, rumours of the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance
minister, and a high demand for hard currency to buy imported goods before
new import duties are imposed on March 1.
Figures published by the Makroekon-link Institute, part of the State
Statistics Committee, claimed that GDP would continue to contract this year,
by about 5 per cent from 1993. It said that the gap between rich and poor
would increase further, and that 35 per cent of the Russian population would
earn below the official poverty level.
The institute claimed the fall in production and living standards in Russia
last year had been steeper than admitted by the economics ministry. The
institute said that GDP slumped in 1993 by 12 per cent on 1992, and by 29
per cent on 1991, with national income down 13 per cent and production down
16 per cent on 1992.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Geest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems there is a surplus of skins as well as bananas. Not only has Geest
been hit by a severe outbreak of black siratoga fungus in its Costa Rican
plantations, it is also suffering grievously from another pest in the form
of those seemingly well-meaning people in the European Commission. These not
only arranged last year's European banana market liberalisation in such a
way as to cause a glut of bananas in the final quarter, undermining the
profitability of Geest's cosy arrangements with the Windward Islands. They
also had the temerity to compound the over-supply by offering to increase
the quotas of Latin American countries in order to secure a Gatt deal in
December.
Sadly, Geest cannot count on the kind of public furore which has French
farmers burning English lamb carcasses. Liberalisation of banana imports is
generally good for UK consumers anyway. But yesterday's profits warning
raises the question of whether Geest could have handled an admittedly
difficult situation better. Its large investment in Costa Rica reduces its
flexibility compared with Fyffes, which is importing from both Guatemala and
Honduras.
Fyffes' risk from black siratoga is relatively smaller and it can shop
around more easily for export licences if these are required under the Gatt
deal. It does not help Geest's case that this is its third profits warning
in 18 months.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several new highs for Wall Street in recent days support the idea that the
long uptrend in equities is still intact. Still, investors in the US were
rather left behind in 1993, when the S&amp;P composite index rose by only 7.1
per cent. Other markets where interest rates were falling, or growth was
strong, fared much better. Now that the US recovery is gathering pace, and
the output gap is being closed, the threat of higher interest rates looms.
The potential for liquidity flows out of shares and back into cash is the
most serious threat from rising short rates. Mutual fund flows of
individuals' savings have offset the heavy supply of new issues over the
past two years as companies have re-financed the leveraged buy-outs of the
1980s. Recently, however, there have been signs that the new issue market is
beginning to weaken. American individuals also now hold the highest
proportion of their financial assets in equities since 1972. While the
secular trend towards lower inflation may have changed the basis for asset
allocation, these are signs of a maturing bull market. Besides, if rising
soft commodity prices are any guide, it is too early to declare inflation
dead.
Further rises in equities will have to be driven by strong earnings
increases, particularly if modestly higher inflation and bond yields reduce
the sustainable rating of equities. Higher earnings are in prospect, but
with export markets still weak and US markets fiercely competitive, the
potential for pleasant surprises, and thus strong performance, is strictly
limited.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even though Granada's predatory intentions were well flagged, LWT appeared
wrong-footed when hostilities erupted. The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees flirtation
proved an unwelcome diversion. But LWT has now wisely reverted to
emphasising its fine trading record. Yesterday's forecast of a 43 per cent
increase in 1993 profits enhances its management's reputation and bolsters
the case for independence. Yet LWT's shareholders will be little swayed by
sentiment. The bid still revolves around what constitutes a fair offer
price.
The prospects for an independent LWT are undoubtedly attractive. But they do
not appear sufficiently racy to justify LWT's current rating in the absence
of a bid. Independent forecasters do not expect much of a bounce in
television advertising revenue. There is also diminishing scope for LWT to
cut costs now it has boosted its trading margin to 28.2 per cent. It is
tempting to believe media assets may be worth even more if further industry
liberalisation follows. Then again, comparable US broadcasting stocks do not
trade on higher ratings despite their deregulated market.
If LWT's management is convinced Granada's offer is too cheap, they could
always make a higher bid themselves. The management already owns 10 per cent
of the shares. Cash is currently cheap to borrow. Granted, not too many UK
banks are likely to lend money to a leveraged buy-out boasting so few
tangible assets. But US banks or venture capitalists would better appreciate
the attractions of LWT's cash stream; especially so if LWT could secure an
equity injection from a media industry partner.

Eurotunnel has good reasons for setting its prices at the higher end of
expectations. Due to the late arrival of rolling stock, its trains will run
at only half the specified length during the early months of operation. With
capacity thus constrained - and the razzmatazz surrounding the official
opening bound to drum up business - Le Shuttle is unlikely to be starved of
passengers this summer. Once the novelty wears off and capacity is increased
to the planned level, though, special discounts and promotions will start to
creep in. That will put downward pressure on passenger yields even if the
pricing structure announced yesterday is kept in place.
Whether yields will fall in real terms thereafter remains unanswered. The
ferry operators have no incentive to enter a price war with Eurotunnel,
partly because fares on the Dover to Calais route determine the prices they
can charge elsewhere. Driving Eurotunnel out of business would simply mean
that someone else would operate the tunnel, presumably without the burden of
massive interest payments. The new operator would then be able to set prices
at a level the ferries simply could not match.
Eurotunnel's high fixed costs will be a strong incentive for it to run at
full capacity, even if that means being flexible on prices. But without a
clearer picture of demand for Le Shuttle's services, the future path of
pricing is impossible to predict. The traffic forecasts in Eurotunnel's
rights issue document, expected before passenger services start in May, will
make for interesting reading.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine's peril
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday night in Brussels President Bill Clinton announced an agreement
between the US, Russia and Ukraine on removal of all former Soviet nuclear
missiles from Ukrainian territory.
Celebration would be premature. The past two years have seen a series of
agreements in principle to the same effect, and Ukrainian officials have
already warned that this latest one is not yet in final form. Last year the
Rada, Ukraine's parliament, ratified the Lisbon protocol (associating
Ukraine with the US-Soviet 'Start I') treaty only in an incomplete form, and
even then hedged it about with improbable conditions. President Leonid
Kravchuk has said he will wait for a new Rada to be elected in March before
putting the new agreement to the vote.
Until now western leaders have shown little patience with Ukraine's
democratic procedures. Mr Clinton on Tuesday at least broke with that
tradition, expressing his confidence in Mr Kravchuk and remarking that
'executives often have to sell to their legislative branches what they know
is in the national interest of their country'. The west seems also to have
realised that Ukraine's demands for financial compensation and security
guarantees, even if over-optimistic, are not wholly unreasonable.
Yet Ukrainians would be foolish indeed if they imagined that the
independence and integrity of their new state can be effectively secured
either by nuclear weapons or by carefully worded western guarantees, or
indeed by western financial aid. Such things can only be complements to any
nation's security. The first prerequisite is a united people, confident of
its national identity and generating the resources to defend it.
Two years ago, when Ukraine became independent by the free choice of more
than 90 per cent of its voters, cutting across ethnic and regional
divisions, that kind of security seemed within reach. Most of the 11m ethnic
Russians in the country were happy to become Ukrainian citizens, believing
this the route to prosperity.
Mr Kravchuk has sought to maintain this somewhat adventitious national unity
by avoiding painful economic decisions. But this policy has had precisely
the opposite effect. There is hyperinflation, together with steeply falling
production and acute energy shortages. Ukraine's economic predicament is now
such that many of its inhabitants see Russia as an oasis of golden riches -
not least in Crimea where candidates in this week's presidential election
are vying with each other in pro-Russian rhetoric.
Ukraine's desperate need, apparently not perceived by its rulers, is for
genuine economic reform. Without this, it may soon have to choose between a
return to Russian hegemony, the secession of Crimea and possibly other
Russified regions, or a downward spiral of ethnic conflict such as has
already made a mockery of independence in several other ex-Soviet republics.

Hands up all those who thought 1993 was just as nasty, brutish and short as
1992. You were wrong, at least according to Dentsu, the Japanese advertising
giant.
It says the 'keyword' for 1993 was actually 'taking care' - though surely
that's two words? Anyway, Dentsu's gurus reckon that last year Japanese
getting and spending was dominated by 'being satisfied with yourself and
your world, not being self-centred'.
The taking care meant greater concern for 'nurturing your body',
'unwinding', 'cultivating bonds' (personal as opposed to financial),
'discovering connections' and going for 'quality at home' and 'convenience
close at hand'.
Dentsu's reasoning in this instance is based upon the list of 42 types of
'hit product' which went down well in Japan in 1993. But don't hold your
breath; the list is a rather disappointing collection, including mineral
water, dental mouthwash, carrot drinks, fashion sportswear, beer,
deodorants, aerosol foot sprays and anything to do with Jurassic Park.
Given that two of the other hits were 'power stones' and leather bracelets -
both worn as lucky charms - consumers seem to have spent at least some of
their time, as usual, in taking care to get ripped off.

The London Evening Standard clearly relishes the Tory party's current moral
squirming. Yesterday it carried a conventional advertisement for Qantas,
which by the final edition had been replaced by a 'reader offer' advertising
a two-night stay and 'gastronomic dining' at a French hotel, the Chateau
Tilques.
On the same page was a large feature on Tory MP David Ashby, who has
admitted sharing a bed at the same chateau with a male friend. Stewart
Steven, the paper's editor, says the juxtaposition was 'not entirely
coincidental. Our readers read about this wonderful hotel where our MPs go,
and they can now sample it themselves'.

If Eurotunnel's financial success hinges on accurate financial forecastes,
then the omens are grim. The owners of the tunnel clearly underestimated the
turn-out for yesterday's press conference announcing fares for Le Shuttle.
Journalists and camera crews were squeezed into a small suite at London's
Hyde Park Intercontinental Hotel, forcing one sweating participant to ask
whether the cramped conditions were intended as a foretaste of the tunnel
itself. Commercial director Christopher Garnett said no, shuttle trains
would be air-conditioned.
But never mind overcrowding, even the timetable was a little slack.
Garnett's slide presentation started in reverse order. The first (or rather
last) slide to appear on the screen? 'We are ready . . .'

John Major is not alone in having problems with his 'Back to Basics' policy.
Reg Brealey, probably best known for being the first Briton acquitted of
insider dealing, faces a similar problem.
Brealey says that he, not Major, first thought up 'Back to Basics' as a
motto for his latest venture - giving disadvantaged youngsters a fresh start
in life by sending them on a training scheme on west Scotland's Knoydart
peninsula. After being knocked into shape, Brealey's young chaps will enjoy
a spot of Far Eastern travel, plus the chance of a bit of work experience in
one of the Indian jute mills run by Brealey's Titaghur group. Titaghur
bought a big chunk of Knoydart last year.
In his annual report Brealey says he can undercut the official cost of
youngsters in care by 50 per cent. As he still has to win the hearts and
minds of the 53 residents of Knoydart - some seem a mite unwilling to
welcome underprivileged teenagers into their backyard - that is neither here
nor there.
Brealey acknowledges that Titaghur's shareholders, who have been without a
proper share quote for more than three years, may question the wisdom of his
latest diversification, though he solicits their patience.
Meanwhile, he hopes Titaghur's shares will soon be listed on Nasdaq.
Yesterday, no one at Nasdaq's London office had heard of Titaghur.

FT  12 JAN 94 / 'Sensei, are we still in hot water?': William Dawkins
overhears a young member of Japan's finance ministry seeking advice from his
elderly mentor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a snowy day in the mountains north of Tokyo. An old man sits up to his
neck in a rock pool of steaming water, taking a therapeutic soak in the
wooded setting of one of Japan's most famous onsen, or hot water springs.
His name is Takeshi, a retired senior finance ministry bureaucrat. When not
playing golf or meditating in hot baths, he is employed as an adviser to
several of the world's largest banks.
A worried-looking young man, wearing a yukata - a cotton bath robe - pads
down the snowy path, undresses, shivers and slips into the pool. This is
Tokoro, a bureaucrat at the all-powerful finance ministry, who owes his
prestigious job to Takeshi's patronage.
Takeshi lifts a flannel from his lean, fit-looking face to acknowledge the
young visitor's attempt at a semi-submerged bow. 'What brings you here, my
boy?' he asks.
'I need your advice, sensei,' Tokoro replies. 'That troublesome prime
minister of ours has asked me to write a report about the recession. Is it
going to get worse, he wants to know.
'He wants quick solutions, in time to announce them late next week. The
economy is the first job on his list after political reform, which he thinks
he will get through parliament next Wednesday, despite the efforts of his
enemies in the Liberal Democratic party. Most regrettable. I thought my job
was to keep politicians in the dark.'
Takeshi narrows his eyes, for a moment looking like a dangerous water
lizard. Playing safe did not get him to his position as a member of the
'iron triangle' of senior bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians, which
covertly runs Japan.
'You must learn to move with the times,' he says. 'Politicians these days
want to give the impression that they, not we, are running the country. So
give Prime Minister Hosokawa what he wants. After all, your ministry will
far outlast his fragile government.'
Tokoro looks alarmed. 'You don't mean I should tell the prime minister the
truth?'
'By all means,' replies the sage. 'Tell him this: the economy might get a
bit worse soon, then improve maybe late this year. But it will be a pretty
weak recovery, because years of complacency by your bureaucratic colleagues
 -if you will forgive me for being blunt - and by the business establishment
have allowed surplus industrial capacity and excess employment to build up.
Companies are employing between 1m and 2m people more than they need -
perhaps the same number again as the 1 3/4 m officially unemployed.
'On top of this, it will take the banking system such a long time to write
off its bad debts, caused by the fall in property and stock prices, that it
cannot be expected to finance a strong recovery. Some of the gloomier ones
among my banking colleagues privately reckon their total bad debts are at
least Y30,000bn (Pounds 179bn), just over 11 times this year's net profits.
'Unless Mr Hosokawa takes courageous action, he risks an uncontrollable
deflationary spiral and a banking crisis. Judging by the recent rise in
share prices, the stock market thinks that won't happen. Yet in fact, a
crisis might be just the thing we need to sharpen the minds of those
squabbling coalition partners,' concludes the old man.
The effort of listening to this long speech makes Tokoro look even more
overheated than the sensei, hard-boiled by many years of hot water bathing.
'But how can it get worse?' asks the pupil. 'Already, this recession is the
worst since the war. And I don't believe the scare story about the surplus
of labour. I thought we had a long-term shortage of workers. If we don't
now, we soon will have, as the proportion of people over 65 increases from
13 per cent now to one in four by 2020,' he says, checking the figures from
the damp note-book wrapped in his towel. 'Moreover, our ministry will never
allow a banking crisis. What are we paid for?'
Takeshi, amused by the young man's innocence, smiles benevolently. A spiral
of steam twists round the old man's head, adding to the pupil's troubled
impression that not all is what it seems.
The sensei explains: 'Your ministry colleagues like to think that so long as
demand rebounds, we can go back to normal. But the real economic problem is
deeper than that. Why do you imagine the Y30,000bn of pump-priming measures
produced over the past 16 months and the record low interest rates our
friends at the Bank of Japan have been kind enough to deliver have had such
little effect?'
'Obviously, those measures weren't enough,' says Tokoro. 'We at the ministry
have withdrawn our opposition to the income tax cut that Mr Hosokawa wants
so badly, because he appears to have accepted our argument that it must be
financed by a rise in sales tax. So that is a good sign.
'Some politicians say consumer demand would improve even more if we scrapped
the planned sales tax rise. But we cannot do that. Somehow we must make up
for the decline in income tax revenues that will take place as we all get
older, and start drawing our state pensions. There are plenty of wage
earners like me to pay for your pension, sensei, but who is going to pay for
mine?'
Takeshi scoops a handful of snow from the pool edge and throws it at Tokoro
 -recalling the Zen masters' technique of using shock to knock wisdom into
slow pupils. 'We need tax reform, but don't be fooled into thinking that is
the way to economic nirvana,' he exclaims.
'The amount you can afford to give away in income tax cuts, say between
Y5,000bn and Y10,000bn, is not enough to stimulate the economy. And as I
have tried to explain, demand is not the real problem.'
Tokoro gives a despairing look. 'Have you got anything constructive to say?'
he asks.
'Yes,' says Takeshi. 'Mr Hosokawa still has time to stop deflation before it
runs out of control. He must improve the supply of credit and help companies
curb surplus capacity, so as to increase their profitability. First, he must
free up the supply of credit by making it practical for banks to turn bad
debts into marketable securities. It would also help the banks if he
dismantled the heavy property taxes we introduced in 1987 to try to brake
the rise in land prices.'
Tokoro says: 'Some of us at the ministry have been thinking about
securitisation for some months. We have not yet persuaded colleagues in
other departments, who think securitisation is a dodgy practice that might
lead to another uncontrollable rise in asset prices. I'll try harder, but I
can't guarantee anything, sensei.
'But what can we do about the other big problem, industrial overcapacity?'
asks the pupil. 'The bureaucracy is not as powerful as it was in your day.
We can't just tell Mazda to close down, for instance.'
'Of course not, thank goodness,' Takeshi replies. 'But you can use
administrative guidance to encourage companies to reduce their workforces
and bring their break-even levels more in line with their leaner US and
south-east Asian competitors.'
'Why haven't you mentioned de-regulation?' asks Tokoro. 'I know it's a
deplorable policy, but the electorate really seems to share Mr Hosokawa's
fondness for it. Too many economists are saying that fewer regulations will
improve corporate profitability in the long run.'
Takeshi sighs. 'This deregulation crusade only shows how you young
bureaucrats are losing your grip on power. But don't despair. Mr Hosokawa is
not the first to try deregulation, and you can ensure he joins the queue of
failures. Stop trying to resist too hard. When it becomes clear that
powerful business interests will get hurt as regulations are removed, the
whole thing should die away, as it has in the past.'
'I am always grateful for your wisdom,' says Tokoro. 'I will pass on your
ideas to the honourable prime minister. But if I get fired as a result of
his campaign to win control over the bureaucracy, can you fix me a job at
one of your banks?'
Takeshi smiles: 'Certainly, dear fellow. If we Tokyo University graduates
didn't look after each other, where would Japan be today?'

FT  12 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Chunnel pricing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have not done too well so far out of Eurotunnel. Now it looks like
passengers are not going to get a particularly good deal either. That, at
any rate, is the impression given by the prices Eurotunnel proposes to
charge for its car passenger service.
The pricing schedule, announced yesterday, ranges from Pounds 220 for a
return journey in winter to Pounds 310 in the peak summer months. Not only
are the prices higher than expected. They are also slightly higher than
those charged by Stena Sealink and P&amp;O European Ferries, the two ferry
groups which dominate the cross-Channel market.
Moreover, there is every sign that neither Eurotunnel nor the ferry
companies want to engage in a price war. At every opportunity, they stress
the point. P&amp;O yesterday even took the step of commending Eurotunnel's fares
as 'positive and realistic'. What we are witnessing are the latest moves in
a complex oligopoly game. Eurotunnel is anxious to avoid a price war because
its gigantic debts mean it has to find Pounds 600m in annual interest
payments alone. Equally, the ferry companies are concerned that an erosion
of margins would force them out of the market.
But passengers should not lose heart. Just because the main players say they
do not want a price war does not mean that they can necessarily stop one.
Oligopoly games are hard to control.
In the short run, Eurotunnel has every incentive to use the ferry companies'
prices as a benchmark for its own services. This is because for several
months the group will not be able to run at full capacity due to a shortage
of rolling stock. So there is little point in cutting fares to a point where
it is unable to satisfy demand.
In the longer run, it could be in Eurotunnel's interests to reduce prices.
Only by running the tunnel at near to full capacity will it be able to make
a sufficient return to satisfy investors. But that will probably require an
expansion of the market, not merely taking market share from the ferry
companies, and in turn will mean that fares will probably have to fall.
Moreover, passengers can take comfort from the fact that some benefits have
already come through in anticipation of Eurotunnel's opening. Ferry
companies have upgraded their services and marketed a wide range of special
offers involving deep discounts off their standard tariffs. Customers will
also gain from the fact that Eurotunnel's service is faster and more
reliable than the ferry companies'.
This does not mean that competition concerns can be dismissed. Eurotunnel
and the ferry groups may be able to avoid a price war, especially if P&amp;O and
Sealink were allowed by the competition authorities to combine some of their
operations - a move which would be at best premature. But this is a case
which calls for continued vigilance rather than immediate action.

FT  12 JAN 94 / A citizen's income could cut red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORD DAHRENDORF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the main political parties in the UK are considering reforms to the tax
and social security system. One idea they should revisit is the 'negative
income tax', which converts benefits into a single net payment from the
state, while taxpayers would pay their tax bill minus the benefits to which
they were entitled.
This is, in effect, a step towards a citizen's income, an entitlement to a
basic level of income for everyone. Under such an arrangement, those with
less than the guaranteed citizen's income from earnings or investments would
receive the balance from the state.
One of the strongest attractions of a single citizen's income is that it
would replace the costly waste and human humiliation of the diverse and
bureaucratic welfare arrangements currently in force. Basic income
guarantees are tied to the citizenship of all rather than the special
requirements of some. They dispense with complex assessments of needs,
especially if they are tied to the income tax system. They remove the
bureaucratic costs of collecting money from people in taxes only to pay sums
back to them in benefits.
The concept of 'negative income tax' is simpler than the reality. Defining
the level of income entitlement raises big economic, political and social
questions. And there are real difficulties over incentives to work or save
when there is an unconditional entitlement to an income from the state. But
when all is said and done, the case in favour of basic income guarantees for
all citizens is still persuasive.
Above all, a citizen's income could make bearable the greater labour market
flexibility which is one answer to the vexing problems of long-term,
structural unemployment. The levels of real wages and non-wage labour costs
deter potential employers. Without them, hundreds of thousands of new jobs
would emerge.
But - and this is a big but - a 'jobs miracle' based on lower wage costs
would have its price, as it has in the US. There, the price is called the
working poor. For more than a decade, the real wages of more than half those
employed in the US have been declining. The bottom 10 per cent, if not 20
per cent, have for some time been people who have a job but do not earn
enough to sustain themselves decently, let alone to sustain a family. They
are working, but they are so poor that they need help.
I find the distinction between deserving and undeserving poor distasteful.
But even those with fewer moral qualms would probably agree there is
something wrong about hard-working people not earning enough to live on.
Why then do we not start the implementation of the citizen's income idea
with this category? This is, of course, what Professor James Meade proposed
when he spoke of using a 'secure income' to offset 'the measures for the
downward flexibility of rates of pay' designed 'to increase the demand for
labour' (Liberty, Equality and Efficiency, Macmillan, 1993).
One way of financing a citizen's income, Meade suggested, was 'the
imposition of a special surcharge on the first slice of every citizen's
income other than the basic income itself'. Contributions could be flat-rate
or progressive; the latter would allow gradations of citizens' income
support, or what is called a 'negative income tax'.
There is by now sufficient literature on the implications of this idea to
make it clear that it is viable. Beginning with those who actually earn a
wage but do not earn enough would serve two purposes: it would help a new
labour market develop while reducing the risk of the new American dilemma,
the working poor. Problems remain, to be sure. Perhaps the most difficult
one is who sets the level of basic income guarantees and on what grounds is
it set?
There is another way of putting the same question: how does one prevent the
citizen's income from becoming a political football? In most European
countries, the answer is fairly clear. An independent agency would be set up
which is bound by certain rules.
In Britain, with its tradition of parliamentary sovereignty, this is hardly
likely. But perhaps restrictions could be imposed, in the required
legislation, on the extent of the changes of the initial level allowed in
any subsequent year.
In any case, there is room for lateral thinking in future budgets which
address themselves to the longer term rather than the next year, or even the
next election.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Leading Article: An end to foot-dragging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the insurance industry understand the real world? The question arises
from the wrangle over creating a new self-regulatory body, the Personal
Investment Authority.
Its history has been a messy one. First, the people putting together the new
body needed some overt spine-stiffening from Mr Andrew Large, who sits atop
the regulatory pyramid as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
Then they had to overcome the hostility of the clearing banks, the abrupt
departure of their putative chairman, and a public questioning of their
objectives by Mr Mick Newmarch, boss of the Prudential.
Now, one of the PIA's founding committee has himself resigned in protest. Mr
Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, is not by
temperament a rabble-rouser, and the life office for which he works is
Edinburgh respectability incarnate. Yet, like the Pru's Mr Newmarch, he may
underestimate the challenge now facing the industry.
The current system of regulation, says Mr Stretton, is unsatisfactory; its
mooted replacement worse. The intended composition of the PIA's board - nine
'public interest' representatives, nine active industry participants and the
authority's chief executive - tilts the balance too far away from the
industry to be true self-regulation, he feels. It would therefore be better
to go the whole hog, setting up a statutory body with proper public
accountability.
In the abstract, this argument has some merit. But the future of insurance
industry regulation is not an abstract matter. The early years of the
current phase of regulation were unduly influenced by the industry itself;
since then, the regulators have had to struggle to convince the life offices
of the need for commission disclosure. Undesirable - and far too widespread
 -selling practices have been revealed. Most recent and most damaging is the
discovery that many sales of the industry's hot new product of the 1980s,
the personal pension, were made without proper documentation, and sometimes
against the obvious interests of the pur-chaser.
Since Mr Large took over at the SIB, he has made serious efforts to address
these problems. He has also had to decide whether to ask the government to
tear up the current structure of regulation, or make it work better. He has
chosen the latter course, and has not had a great deal of public support
from the industry in doing so - though many people, including Mr Stretton,
have given much in private to the building of the PIA.
That is not enough. It is time for those in the industry who appreciate how
much their business relies on public confidence to speak out in support of
Mr Large's efforts. And it is time for ministers to make it clear that, if
push comes to shove, he will get the legislative time and support he needs
to end any further foot-dragging from the industry. The real world demands
no less.

FT  12 JAN 94 / A party labouring to make a point: The UK opposition's
struggles to find a long-term strategy to beat the Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, looked more than usually buoyant as
parliament reassembled yesterday after the Christmas recess. No wonder. Mr
Smith knows that Labour's big chance may have arrived.
After coming close to disintegration over during last year's debate over the
Maastricht treaty on European integration, the government shows further
signs of tearing itself apart in a tortuous debate over private morality.
Adultery is not an issue on which elections are won or lost. But trust may
be.
No one in the shadow cabinet is making public comments on Conservative
morals. But no one needs to. Every time Mr Smith tells the voters that they
cannot trust to Tories on tax, the message is clear: you cannot trust their
morals either.
Mr Tony Blair, one of Labour's rising stars, puts it succinctly. 'Back to
Basics' - the government's campaign for a return to traditional family
values - has, he says, 'opened a gaping crack right at the centre of the
government. As a result, the Tories are now incapable as a party of
providing the sense of direction and cohesion that our country needs.'
From Labour's point of view, the furore could hardly have erupted at a
better time. A year and a half ago, amid a deep UK recession, it lost a
general election it was confident of winning. Since then Labour has
struggled to formulate a set of policy ideas capable of preventing a fifth
successive Conservative victory at the next election, due by 1997.
But an opportunity to exploit the enemy's mistakes is one thing. Does Labour
have the intellectual confidence - and the stomach - to sustain a long-term
offensive against the government? Mr Smith tried to demonstrate Labour's
fighting spirit at the end of the last session by withdrawing parliamentary
co-operation with the Conservatives, ostensibly because the government
guillotined debate on its statutory sick pay and national insurance
contributions bills.
Few MPs accept Mr Smith's assertion that his motive is to defend Parliament
against an arrogant government. After all, Mr Michael Foot, leader of the
Commons in Mr James Callaghan's Labour administration in the late 1970s,
once cut short debate on five bills in a day. The cynical view in the bars
and tea rooms at Westminster is that the non-co-operation campaign was
launched as a smokescreen to hide the opposition's procedural incompetence
during December's Budget debate, when Labour's treasury team missed a prime
chance to embarrass the government: it failed to table an amendment to
government plans to impose value added tax on heating fuel.
'This is an artificial row,' says a Conservative whip. 'I've been here
during real rows when Labour MPs have been snarling at us in the corridors.
Nothing like that is happening at the moment; they are all smiles - when
they bother to turn up.'
This is not Tory hyperbole. Commons records show that more than 190 of the
200 MPs with the best voting records are Conservatives. With the exception
of a handful of zealots like Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwing 'Beast
of Bolsover', Labour MPs are largely going through the motions of
challenging the government and, after 14 years in opposition, many say that
morale is at best mediocre.
There have been successes. Mr Smith and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, have plugged away on the theme of broken promises. Mr Major has
been pushed on the defensive when explaining why the government promised at
the election not to increase taxes, and then did so. Mr Blair, shadow home
secretary, has reversed Labour's traditionally poor image on fighting crime
with his promise to be tough on criminals as well as the causes of crime.
At the same time, Mr John Prescott successfully attacked the government's
road-building plans as shadow transport secretary, and shows signs of being
effective in his new role as shadow employment secretary. Mr Robin Cook,
trade and industry spokesman, has shown that the government can be rattled
on economic policy - he has even provoked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
to intervene in his Commons speeches.
All of this has had some effect. The party has led the Conservatives in the
opinion polls for more than a year. At times it has had the support of more
than 45 per cent of voters. But few at Westminster take the polls too
seriously. Labour enjoyed a similar lead two years before the last election,
only to see it melt away as polling day approached. To stay ahead, Labour
will have to convey a positive message, and it is failing to do so.
All oppositions find it difficult to get their message across. But Labour
has a different problem. It has, almost literally, no message to sell.
To some extent, this is deliberate. Almost the first decision taken by Mr
Smith when he replaced Mr Neil Kinnock was to ditch the policies on which
the last election was fought. The strategy is intended to free the party
from its historical baggage. After the battles of the Kinnock years, fraught
with fratricidal clashes over unilateral nuclear disarmament,
nationalisation and taxation, Labour needed a rest.
In internal party terms, the policy review launched by Mr Smith has served
its purpose. Arguments about economic and social policy have been kicked
into touch. The simmering divisions between the party's modernist and
traditionalist wings have been cooled, or at least been papered over.
But the divisions have not disappeared. They surfaced during the debate on
the Sunday trading bill in December. Traditionalists argued for tight
restrictions to defend shopworkers; modernists argued for greater individual
freedom, particularly for working women. There was an ugly moment after the
vote when Mr Skinner delivered an angry lecture on working class solidarity
to Mr Blair, the prototype modernist.
Other currents are swirling around Mr Smith. More than 30 MPs have joined
the Full Employment group, set up by Mr Bryan Gould, a former trade and
industry spokesman, to campaign for a return to explicitly Keynesian
economic policies. The Social Justice Commission, set up to develop a fresh
social policy framework, has provoked unrest with modernist interim reports
which, for instance, have hinted that universal child benefit might not be
retained by a Labour government.
Labour leaders argue that the review process has enabled the party to avoid
committing itself to detailed policies of the sort which, arguably, cost it
the last election. Even cabinet ministers concede privately that Mr Smith is
right to keep his powder dry. That way, he will retain the room to manoeuvre
in changing circumstances which was denied to Mr Kinnock in 1992.
But the review is not confined to details. Its scope is so wide that the
party no longer has an ideological framework within which its spokesmen can
operate with confidence. A leading moderate says: 'What does the party stand
for? I don't know, and I don't believe anyone else does either.' For the
time being, Labour has a hole where the policy should be, and it shows.
Every time a Labour spokesman stands up to criticise the government, the
response is the same: what would you do, and how would you pay for it? These
are questions Labour cannot answer.
'Back to Basics' has given Labour some much needed ammunition. But some
senior party figures fear that the party will need to do more than exploit
Tory peccadilloes if it is to return to power. And the issue of trust, they
warn, may be a double-edged sword. 'The party is bland,' says one. 'Smith's
strategy is not to upset anyone and to hope for the best. But the truth is
that the public don't trust us, and they won't until we offer a real
alternative. That is the only way we can win; that is what people voted for
in 1945 and 1963 (Labour election victory years), even though it didn't
necessarily turn out that way.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Again out of step with Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr R BARRASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Harold Hughes (Letters, January 8) raises some very pertinent
questions concerning passport checks on travellers within the European
Union. The EU is a single market, defined by Article 7a of the EC Treaty as
'an area without internal frontiers'. The UK government claims the article
is subject to 'differing interpretations': but free circulation of goods
within the EU is clearly established in law - so why not free circulation of
people?
Systematic passport controls on travellers within the EU are not essential,
because there are alternatives, based on co-operation between national
authorities, for controlling the movement of terrorists and illegal
immigrants. A blueprint for the necessary measures is provided by the
agreement of nine member states to abolish passport controls at their common
frontiers. The UK, as a non-participant, has not been in a position to
influence this agreement, but may nevertheless have to adopt many of its
elements. The result would no doubt be arrangements more suited to our
continental neighbours than to the UK, thus repeating the history of
Britain's belated membership of the European Community. So much for being at
the heart of Europe.

Sir, Whenever I hear the phrase 'Back to Basics' I think of the current
Tesco low pricing promotion also called 'Basics'. An image of Prime Minister
John Major standing in front of 10 Downing Street holding up a Tesco carrier
bag pops into my brain.
It seems to me that both are attempts to obtain short-term advantage using a
range of items that the public believes are fundamental. The difference
between them is that the promotion is more plausible in the case of the
retailer than in the case of the government.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Model is no quick fix for hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in the article, 'Production line treatment for
patients' at the Karolinska Hospital, Sweden (January 7).
The suggestion that this experience is unique is incorrect. Many hospitals,
initially in the US but increasingly in the UK, have adopted 'patient
focused' organisational models which are, indeed, derived from approaches to
res-tructuring in the motor industry.
The widespread enthusiasm for these models (including that of the UK
secretary of state for health) should not obscure the fact that the
long-term cost/benefit outcome is ambiguous. The undoubted attractions of
patient focused care should be considered carefully against the potential
risks, which we identified in our report 'Patient focused care - a suitable
case for treatment'. What hospitals have to learn from the motor industry is
that there is no quick fix and no alternative to a sustained commitment to
quality.

Sir, In your report on friendly societies' diversification plans ('Time to

representatives as saying: 'If I could pay something now to make sure my
mother would never come and live with me, I probably would.'
If this is to be the driving spirit in future, surely the societies should
be obliged to change the name on the umbrella under which they trade. What

FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Under-prescribing by doctors may be
penny wise, pound foolish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J P GRIFFIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Curbing the cost of drugs', January 7) rightly warns that
bearing down on pharmaceutical costs can result in increasing the costs of
more expensive hospital and out-patient treatment. However, while you
suggest there should be incentives to provide no more treatment for patients
than is needed, you overlook the potentially expensive practice of doctors
prescribing less than they should.
There are already supply side restrictions on industry profits through the
pharmaceutical price regulation scheme and, on the demand side, financial
incentives and pressures on doctors to contain their prescribing. But there
is no mechanism by which doctors are being encouraged to increase or improve
their prescribing, even when there is clear evidence that it would bring
such long-term savings as you identified to the National Health Service.
Doctors, faced with financial pressures from their local health authorities,
are avoiding advances in medicines on the grounds of their perceived costs.
One example is the low take-up in the UK of ACE inhibitors to treat high
blood pressure. The heart failure task force has reported that 'there is
overwhelming evidence that, in heart failure, ACE inhibitors can improve
quality of life, reduce death rate and reduce hospital admissions. Less than
5 per cent of heart failure patients receive this treatment'.
A further study of this class of medicines has shown that treatment of
insulin-dependent diabetics with an ACE inhibitor can also dramatically
reduce the risk of kidney failure. As well as halving the death rate among
patients at risk, such treatment would also save the NHS Pounds 200m a year
in the cost of reduced dialysis or kidney transplants - after allowing for
the cost of prescribing the ACE inhibitor.
Cost saving schemes are currently designed solely to reward those who
prescribe fewer or cheaper medicines but this penny wise, pound foolish
approach is not in the interests of individual patients or the taxpayers'
interests of achieving a cost effective NHS. A rise in the medicines bill,
like a reduction in hospital beds, can be a sign of improving health.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Alive but ailing: Nato is not the solution to the future
security needs of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In theory this week's Nato summit in Brussels has breathed new life into the
organisation. In fact, the European allies have now been given notice that
the US does not intend, either in Nato or in any other way, to take any
significant leadership responsibility which would get it bogged down in
Europe's new security uncertainties.
One senior European defence analyst put it bluntly: 'Nato is dead. The
corpse is twitching, but there is no life in it.' Such a harsh judgment
seems at odds with what has happened this week in Brussels.
First, in the cause of stability and closer relations with former members of
the Soviet bloc, the alliance leaders have offered them 'partnerships for
peace', involving military co-operation now, together with the possibility
of Nato membership at some unspecified date in the future.
Second, Nato has set up new 'combined joint task forces' into Nato's
military structures, which should give the European member states more
weight in the alliance, and make it easier for them to tackle Yugoslav-type
conflicts.
Third, Mr Clinton has reaffirmed a commitment to Europe's safety, and
promised to keep about 100,000 US troops on the Continent.
These apparently constructive moves conceal an exercise in fudge and
deception. The east Europeans do not want 'partnerships for peace'; they
want full membership of Nato and the security guarantees that go with it.
They fear Russia still threatens their security, and their fears have zoomed
since last month's Russian elections and the extraordinary showing of
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Liberal Democratic
Party.
The Americans have ruled out full membership for the east Europeans,
ostensibly because they do not want to aggravate the unstable political
situation in Russia. Moscow has made clear that it would consider the
enlargement of Nato a hostile act, virtually amounting to a revival of the
cold war; and the US claims that the west must avoid any move which would
play into the hands of the ultra-nationalists in Russia.
As President Bill Clinton put it in a speech on his arrival in Brussels on
Sunday: 'We cannot afford . . . to draw a new line between east and west
that could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of confrontation.'
This sounds statesmanlike. What it means in plain English is that Washington
has decided that Russia not only takes priority over eastern Europe, but
that it has an effective veto over US links with eastern Europe. From the
leader of the western world, this is hardly bold, considering that the
prospects for democracy and market reform are moderately good in eastern
Europe and getting better, but dire in Russia and rapidly getting worse.
The fact is that there is no way that any rational US Senate will agree to
give eastern Europe an American security guarantee, at a time when the US is
fast running down its forces in western Europe. For Mr Clinton to guarantee
100,000 troops in western Europe sounds good; but it is nothing like good
enough if the troops are meant to back up an additional nuclear guarantee to
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic if Russia is even potentially
expansionist. And the more the east Europeans need such a guarantee, the
less their chance of getting it. The east Europeans have cavilled at the
'partnership' proposal as a second best, but they have obviously got the
real message.
The Americans imply airily that Nato may one day be enlarged, depending on
how the east Europeans respond to the 'partnership' plan: if they get lots
of practice at joint military exercises, they will have earned their Nato
stripes. This is hooey. The essential condition for Nato enlargement is that
Russia must first establish a record as a peaceful and stable market
democracy. At that point, anybody can join Nato, because it will no longer
matter whether the organisation is wound up, or converted instead into a
knitting circle.
Amid so much hypocrisy, there was one nugget of truth-telling which crept
into Mr Clinton's Sunday speech: 'We must build a new security for Europe.
The old security was based on the defence of our bloc against another bloc.
The new security must be found in Europe's integration - an integration of
security forces, of market economies, of national democracies . . .'
There you have the new US policy in a nutshell. Not merely is Yugoslavia
Europe's problem, but so, too, is the security of eastern Europe; and it all
depends on Europe's integration.
Traditional UK Atlanticists, who would much rather believe in Nato than in
Europe, must have a sad premonition that the US is about to betray them.
They may even see, through the fog of the special relationship, that the
plan for 'combined joint task forces' is really an advance warning that
America plans to tip-toe out of Nato's back door, leaving the European
allies to hold the baby of European security.
Unfortunately for the Atlanticists, Nato cannot escape the limitations of a
defensive military alliance: it can only deal with enemies; it can only
mobilise integrated forces; it has no majority voting; it cannot engage in
multi-dimensional, pre-emptive diplomacy.
Nato membership for Poland and Hungary is not available; they need
membership of the European Union. The EU does not now have a credible
security policy. But it is a flexible, multi-policy group with majority
voting; and if it were to extend to the frontiers of Russia, a majority of
its members would insist on an effective security policy.
Nato may not be dead but it isn't the solution to Europe's future security.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Any finance preferable to bank
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT J SPENCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Brian Warnes's letter (January 4) regarding growth and
companies vowing never to borrow again. This company, 20 years old this
year, recently approached its bank for a loan. The bank's proposed fees
amounted to almost 3 per cent of the sum advanced. It required a charge over
the company's assets, a personal guarantee from me and a mortgage on our
home. It also suggested we should use three sets of solicitors to advise (a)
the company, (b) me, (c) my wife.
In addition, it retained the right to debit the loan account with such
administration charges that it, at its absolute discretion, saw fit and,
finally, it admitted that, no matter what reduction in the loan balance over
time there might be, it would still retain its charge on our home at its
original level.
Given all this we are trying, as Mr Warne suggests, to find a different
source of funds. Perhaps the chancellor's enterprise initiative scheme may
be a way. Notwithstanding this reluctance to borrow, our business is growing
and we have increased employment.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: Mass appeal at its best - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is not the place to look for regular reviews of Pobol y Cwym, the soap
opera which has been running for years on Channel 4 in Wales and began
transmission four afternoons a week on BBC2 on Monday under the title People
Of The Valley. Nor should you look here for long supercilious articles about
Noel's House Party and Mr Blobby, or frequent 'funny' pieces scoring points
off the inanity of such daytime programmes as The Big Breakfast and Good
Morning. Newcomers to this page may think this odd, given the space devoted
by other broadsheet newspapers to such material these days. So, it being
January, perhaps it is worth recalling some of the precepts underpinning
this column.
They are not very different from those that, presumably, underpin the other
parts of this page. Most people's experience of dance comes from the local
palais and Come Dancing on television but the FT dance critic concerns
himself chiefly with the Royal Ballet, the Rambert company and so on. With
book reviews the FT concentrates on history, biography, travel, and those
novels which educated people would consider serious. Nobody seems surprised
by the absence of reviews of the romances pumped out by Mills and Boon and
Barbara Cartland although they sell many more copies than the books that we
do review. From time to time, as in last Saturday's Weekend FT, there will
be a think piece on the historical or social significance of changes in
these mass selling books. Similarly this television column is devoted once
in a while to consideration of such phenomena as game shows, Australian soap
operas and the daytime sofa shows. But they are rarely reviewed
individually.
Sustaining such an approach is increasingly difficult in a world where more
and more people maintain that all cultural phenomena are of equal
significance and that everything on television is consequently equally
worthy of notice. It is not only a matter of the tiresome quagmire of
relativism that we have been dragged into during the last couple of years
(you know, 'Was Keats really a better poet than Bob Dylan?' expecting the
answer 'Who can say?' when actually the sensible answer is 'Of course he
was, but Dylan was better at folk-rock'). The difficulty arises from an
older movement which began with George Orwell's brilliant essays on such
subjects as Boys' Papers in the 1940s and today has its most obvious
manifestation in The Modern Review which promises 'Low Culture For
Highbrows' and devotes its space to Hip Hop, The Avengers and 'One-Handed
Literature' (yes, exactly what that phrase suggests).
In the half century between Orwell and The Modern Review an entire academic
industry grew up, expanding upon the writings about mass culture by teachers
such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams, and it is from that industry
that today's torrents of material on The Simpsons and pop videos come
pouring down. What is too rarely pointed out is that Hoggart, Williams, and
most of their followers were, first and foremost, socialists, secondly
sociologists, and only incidentally (and often rather badly) critics. Their
chief concern was not the quality of writing in Peg's Paper or the
originality of the plotting in Saturday morning cinema but that such
artefacts of mass culture should take their place alongside established
highbrow material. Television, which happened to develop during precisely
the same half century, was, of course, their ideal stamping ground being
more of a 'mass' medium than any other.
In this school of thought, the more popular a programme is, the more
significant it is. Thus a television critic should be devoting most space to
Coronation Street and least to weighty documentaries or the more demanding
arts programmes. If that were so there would be little point in continuing
to try to be a serious television critic. On the other hand, it would be
absurd merely to turn such assumptions upside down and review only the most
obscure and 'difficult' material. The fact is, as John Mortimer reminded us
in an impressive article in the Daily Telegraph last Saturday, the
distinction between 'serious' and 'popular' art did not exist in the time of
our greatest achievements:
'The audiences that filled the huge Elizabethan theatres, the countless
readers of Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot, didn't bother to ask
whether it was high art or popular art they were enjoying. Hamlet was a
ghost story and a crime story as well as the drama of a thinking man in a
brutal world. Bleak House is a murder mystery as well as being a savage
denunciation of poverty and a poetic evocation of London. These works were
immensely popular and the audience loved them . . .'
The job of the critic, surely, is to have a clear idea of what is possible
in his medium, which means, among other things, knowing what has been done
before; to identify what newcomers are trying to do, say whether that seems
worthwhile, and whether they are achieving their aims; and above all to
discriminate between good and bad. And as with Dickens, so with television:
it is quite possible to be simultaneously good and popular. Examples which
spring to mind from the recent past include Attenborough's Antarctica
series, Life In The Freezer on BBC1, and ITV's Minder which began what we
are assured is its final series last Thursday. Naturally the quality of
episodes varies, but the characterisation in Minder is always strong and the
writing usually sinewy and often funnier than in television's half-hour
comedies. Last week, in a throwaway line George Cole as wide-boy Arthur
Daley picked up the phone and announced 'Daley into Europe'. Predicting the
failure of his latest 'nice little earner' (a Minder phrase which is now in
the dictionary) he lamented 'I'll probably end up on Shepherds Bush Green
with a mongrel dog and a bottle of cider'.
To fulfil his function the television critic must, of course, watch the
first, and perhaps the first few, episodes of new series even when they may
seem wholly predictable. In the case of People Of The Valley that is
unnecessary since it is a known quantity from its years on S4C. But who
could have guessed that BBC2's new Sunday series Nomads Of The Wind, about
life in the Pacific islands, would have a script so old fashioned and
stilted as to make it sound like a parody of a 1950s Disney travelogue? Who
would have thought there was anything left to be milked out of Superman
until BBC1 began The New Adventures Of Superman early on Saturday evening?
Here is a re-telling which would be perfectly acceptable as a first-time
adventure story for an eight-year-old, but which gains enormously from the
knowledge brought to it by an adult who has grown up with the (yes, yes,
mass appeal]) comics and films. More surprising still, who on this side of
the Atlantic would have guessed that the Americans were so far into
post-feminism?
The first of four comedy pilots on BBC2 under the umbrella title Comic
Asides was a laboured skit about cabin crew on a Scottish airline which
suffered dreadfully by comparison with the screening slightly earlier on the
same channel of the first of The Lost Steptoes. All the honesty, bite and
humanity of the 1974 programme was embarrassingly absent from the slapdash
and lacklustre 1994 offering. We shall have to come back to ITV's new crime
series 99-1 since it is both stylistically interesting (some of the ice
cream colours from Miami Vice with some of the grimy locations of The
Sweeney) and tantalising in its narrative: it seems that Leslie Grantham's
character is not just a hackneyed old bent copper, but about to become some
sort of spy. We shall discover more tonight. Above all it will be necessary,
if subsequent episodes are anything like as good as the opening programme,
to return to Jonathan Meades' Friday night series on BBC2, Further Abroad.
His first programme was a cross between an essay and a catherine wheel
illustrating the use of height in buildings and the consequent horrors of
vertigo.
The idea that Pobol Y Cwm is 'just as important' as Further Abroad is
piffle, and depressing evidence that, indeed, the centre cannot hold.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: Barenboim's 'Die Walkure' - The first new Ring in
Berlin for 40 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conductor is Daniel Barenboim, the producer Harry Kupfer and John
Tomlinson sings Wotan. Bayreuth 1988? No, Berlin for the next three seasons.
Germany's flagship opera house, the Staatsoper unter den Linden, has just
embarked on its first Ring for nearly 40 years. As artistic director,
Barenboim has put Wagner at the centre of his plans, with the same
production team and many of the singers who worked on the recent Bayreuth
Ring. He began with Parsifal last season. Now comes Die Walkure the first
part of a Ring to be completed by 1996.
Barenboim's logic is clear. At Bayreuth, he established a strong rapport
with Kupfer and the designers Hans Schavernoch and Reinhard Heinrich. Why
not continue in his own theatre? And where better than Berlin to interpret
Wagner's allegory of power for the 1990s? Barenboim and Kupfer say the
Berlin Ring will allow them to develop their ideas further. Die Walkure
suggested otherwise. The production lacked the originality or technical
virtuosity that distinguished their Bayreuth version. Despite Schavernoch's
new designs, this was a pale imitation.
Kupfer did his best to dress his concept in fresh clothes. In Bayreuth we
had the 'runway of history', on which man created bigger and bigger
catastrophes because of his inability to learn from the past. In Berlin this
becomes the 'room (or space) of history' - where nature spawns a human
intelligence with the capacity to dominate and exploit lesser beings, and
ultimately threatens the whole of creation.
Kupfer articulates the change persuasively in the Walkure programme book,
but it makes little difference to the staging. Wotan is still virile and
red-haired, still charging round the stage and thrusting his spear into the
ground, still forcing Siegmund onto Hunding's sword, still lying face-down
next to Brunnhilde before putting her to sleep.
For all the talk of nature - and its marvellous evocation in Wagner's music
 -Kupfer acknowledges it almost as little as he did in Bayreuth. The stage
is bare apart from a charcoal tree-trunk and a background grill, behind
which are projected a succession of murky photo-images - tangled foliage in
the Spring scene of Act one, a sunlit ocean during the Todesverkundigung.
The atmosphere barely changes from one scene to the next, and the fixed
perimeter of the 'room of history' has an inhibiting, boxed-in effect.
Although Kupfer draws powerful performances from his actors, their entrances
and exits pass for nothing, and the magic fire circle is an anti-climax.
Where the production does represent an advance on Bayreuth is the orchestral
sound. Freed from the Festspielhaus cowl and the homogenised sound it
produces, Barenboim makes us aware of Wagner's felicitous scoring - the
woodwind decoration of the Act one love music, the fat brass in Act three -
and goes for mammoth contrasts of loud and soft. He gets away with it
because of the dramatic breadth of his reading and sensitivity to his
singers' needs. Apart from an unnecessary change of speed after the opening
storm, tempi are more coherent than ever. The Staatskapelle is beginning to
sound like a front-rank orchestra.
In a high-powered cast, Waltraud Meier's Sieglinde was a revelation. After a
muted debut in the part a year ago in Vienna, followed by her first Isolde
in the summer, she has found her stride as a dramatic soprano - and how]
This Walsung was the embodiment of female courage, beauty and rapture, the
voice sounding fuller and freer than ever.
The other newcomers were Ute Priew's stately Fricka and Eric Halverson's
polished, dangerous Hunding. Poul Elming, Deborah Polaski and Tomlinson
repeated their Bayreuth performances. As Siegmund, Elming looked as good as
ever, but had to 'manage' his voice to reach the end of Act one. Polaski was
every inch the warrior maiden, though nothing could compensate for her
unyielding tone and imperfect top. Tomlinson, in strong, steady voice, is in
danger of turning his act into an Expressionist cliche.
Barenboim seems to have forgotten that one of the pitfalls in art is to
repeat yourself. If he really wanted to continue with Kupfer, Tomlinson and
the others, he should have picked a different opera. What he needed for The
Ring was a new producer, a new designer and a new cast, capable of striking
creative sparks off each other - the way they all did with such success back
in 1988.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: The Sleeping Beauty - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any Russian company offering Tchaikovsky ballets is, I'd hazard,
justification enough for audiences to flock to a theatre. Quality, alas, is
not considered - or is believed to be integral to the package  - and the
shrinking of such grandiose works as Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty to the
demands of a small theatre and undistinguished performance is part of the
sadness of the affair. I am not one of those who believe that great art can
be cut down to size, that Mozart operas or classic drama may be trimmed and
under-played for the sake of showing Don Giovanni or Hamlet to audiences far
from the theatres that can present them in decent style. Betraying the work
betrays the public.
Moscow City Ballet, returned to London this week at the end of a regional
tour, brings Beauty and its version of swan-upping for a third visit. On
previous appearances the company has at least served as a frame for a major
artist - the glorious Ludmila Semenyaka, the noble Yury Posokhov - and I
have sat through the stagings for their sake. For this Sadler's Wells season
we have the company unbolstered. I saw Sleeping Beauty on Monday night, and
I can report that Natalia Povago's tremulous designs seem somewhat
amplified, though no less appealing or credible than on prior viewings; that
the King is still outfitted in mustard sateen plus twos, a tinsel
crown-ette, and has a page-boy bob and a moustache (a combination suggesting
that he is in the middle of a sex-change); and that the whole affair looks
as if a strong wind could blow it away.
The company performance was brisk, and drilled to a point of efficiency that
made the choreography meaningless. It is ballet as fast-food, and bears as
much resemblance to the masterpiece it purports to show as a hamburger does
to meat. Solos are rattled through; the court scenes are like bad pantomime;
the dances for the first act waltz are tape-loop choreography. The Aurora
was Yevgenia Vorobieva, extremely efficient in showing the steps, but on
this occasion, giving us a coquettish and unnuanced view of the supreme
challenge for a classical ballerina. The role was dead. I liked Dmitri
Barmotin's Carabosse, big in scale, and not afraid to storm the stage, and
in Mikhail Ronnikov the company has an intriguing Prince Florimund.
Tall, elegant in physique, with a light jump, Ronnikov has a very youthful
air. He acts the role not at all, offering instead an open-mouthed eagerness
which is not the best indication of princely character. But he has real
potential, and in better surroundings may well turn out to be a true premier
danseur. In the vision scene, the corps de ballet was seen at its willing
best. The score under Igor Shavruk was as brusque as the staging.
Moscow City Ballet is at Sadler's Wells until January 15

FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So many hostages to fortune are offered up these days before the launch of a
major drama series such as BBC2's Middlemarch - Pounds 6m budget, whole
towns deprived of television aerials, entire roads camouflaged under 19th
century style gravel - that you tremble for the broadcasters in case it
isn't a huge triumph. George Eliot's novel has been adapted by Andrew Davies
who dramatised 'To Play The King', and the cast includes Michael Hordern,
Elizabeth Spriggs and Patrick Malahide (9.00).
That is preceded by the first in a new series of Ruth Rosenthal's
architecture series, Building Sites, which this time has USA tagged on the
title. Today Philip Johnson enthuses over Grand Central Station (8.50).
ITV's crime series 99-1 gets into its stride with Leslie Grantham as a
discredited policeman going undercover to suss out the criminal underworld
(9.00). Dispatches reckons that traces of oestrogen in water supplies may be
contributing to infertility. Given the over-population of the world do you
suppose they will see this as a good thing? (C4 9.00).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gallaher, the UK tobacco and drinks arm of American Brands of the US, has
appointed Michael Lunn and Peter Veen main board directors.
Lunn is chairman and chief executive of Whyte &amp; Mackay, Gallaher's drinks
subsidiary. He was managing director of the company when Gallaher bought it
from Brent Walker in 1990 and has since expanded its operations with the
acquisition of Vladivar vodka and the takeover of Invergordon, the Scotch
whisky distiller.
Veen, a former professor of business studies at Groningen University in the
Netherlands, is at present marketing director of Gallaher Tobacco, but will
take over as managing director in April on the retirement of John Taylor.
He was chairman and chief executive of Theodorus Niemeyer, Gallaher's Dutch
tobacco business before it was sold to Rothmans in 1991.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: The advantages of coming clean
 -More companies are now revealing details of their environmental records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, BP Chemicals emitted 30 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), six
tonnes of chlorine and 711 tonnes of benzene into the environment. These and
a host of other specific figures on emissions are published on a single
sheet at the back of the company's annual environmental report, as well as
on a computer disc.
The publishing venture is among the better examples from a new set of
corporate unveilings, in which companies reveal selective secrets about
their environmental performance in an annual report.
Most of the growing number of such reports tend to promise more than they
deliver in terms of hard facts on environmental impact and what the company
is doing to reduce this. Even so, they symbolise a vast step forward in
business attitudes to the environment and the acceptance among certain
industrial sectors that the public has a right to know what goes on behind
the factory wall.
Roughly 150 multinationals and a few smaller companies so far have published
environmental reports. 'That's a small proportion of the approximately
40,000 big companies around the world and the millions of small and
medium-sized companies,' says John Elkington, director of the consultancy
Sustainability.
Elkington is working with the United Nations Environment Programme to
encourage more reporting, especially among companies in countries outside
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The task is
enormous. For even in the western industrialised countries, most companies
make only a passing - and usually vacuous - reference to their environmental
responsibilities in their annual report and accounts. Many say nothing at
all.
A 10-country survey of leading companies by KPMG, the accountancy group,
showed that only 15 per cent of the 690 companies who responded published a
separate environmental report. Those were mostly in the US, Canada, Germany
and the UK.
This is hardly surprising. Other than specific accounting requirements in
the US and Canada to disclose environmental contingencies and liabilities,
companies are under no legal obligation to bare their environmental souls.
Why, then, should a significant group of leading companies take the risk of
publishing potentially incriminating details about their environmental
performance?
A glance at the different reports shows that few are as bold as British
Petroleum and its fellow soul-barers such as Dow, Du Pont, ICI and IBM.
Furthermore, even the most candid reports contain a good deal of public
relations fudge.
This is mainly because there are, as yet, no standards of reporting to which
companies can conform. Standards are being developed by industry groups but
it will be a long time before a universally acceptable format is available.
The Netherlands is the only country close to legislating on the matter. A
bill is being drafted that will force Dutch-based companies to publish
detailed annual reports on the environmental impact of their activities and
their plans to improve.
The European Union's Eco Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), is the only
other official standard that specifies what information should be published.
But membership of EMAS is voluntary.
Otherwise, it is a range of market pressures - mainly the need to keep a
good public image - that provide the necessary encouragement for those
companies that have chosen to be in the vanguard of environmental reporting.
KPMG's sector analysis shows that most companies publishing environmental
reports are from the oil and gas sector, followed by chemical manufacturers
and utilities.
These three sectors are under the most pressure - public and legal - to
reduce their environmental impact. More important, they feel they should be
seen to be responding to the pressure and the most visible action is to
publish a report on their efforts.
But many large companies known to take their environmental responsibilities
seriously still choose not to report. Among them are Hanson, Rolls-Royce
aerospace, Blue Circle, Unilever, BAT and GEC.
The clear difference between those companies who do publish full, regular
environmental reports, and those who do not, lies in the corporate attitude
to the ideas of stakeholders, the wide range of groups - employees, local
communities, investors, customers, suppliers  - that can influence the
fortunes of a company and are therefore said to hold a stake in it.
Most leading companies view good environmental communication between
themselves and their stakeholders as essential to gain or retain public
confidence. Many more pay lip service to this idea. But it has been the
chemical industry, which tends to suffer from a poor public image, that has
led the way in publishing annual reports on environmental performance.
The chemical industry trade associations, both in the US and Europe, began a
'Responsible Care' programme to improve the image. At the core was a
commitment to be more open about their industrial practices and to report
regularly on environmental impact.
Other companies have followed the chemical sector's example, mainly for
public image reasons. IBM UK, for example, publishes a regular and
comprehensive report. So do British Airways and British Telecommunications.
Some companies, such as the Dutch-based BSO Origin, a software services
group, attempts to produce a full set of environmental accounts where the
environmental impact of transport, energy use and other activities is
measured in financial terms.
Those companies that have published a report have been both surprised and
disappointed by the muted response to their efforts. Many thought that they
would have their heads shot off by the environmental groups as soon as they
raised them above the parapet.
But this has not happened because the information revealed, while
significant for the company, has not surprised the campaign groups. Neither
have the reports contained information that other readers felt demanded a
response.
'There's always been a fear that if you report bad news people will jump on
it,' says Peter Scupholm, head of health, safety and environment policy at
BP. 'In our experience, that is not the case, as long as the reporting is
balanced. I'm not aware of one negative reaction to a piece of bad news we
have communicated.'
Dick Robson, environment communications manager at ICI, says the company was
concerned when it published its first report two years ago. 'But we
recognised that it was the only way to go - we reported and our concerns
have evaporated.'
The first batch of environmental reports - some companies are now into their
fourth year of reporting - show little consistency other than an obvious
confusion about who the audience is. And because there are no standards
dictating what should be revealed, the overriding feeling when looking at
the reports is one of public relations gush with a strong emphasis on the
positive aspects of the company's performance.
'These reports are a management tool to get employees and shareholders to
feel good about the company. They are certainly not aimed at environmental
groups,' says Steve Warshal, a business specialist at Greenpeace. 'But we
would like more companies to report in this way because it signals that they
are at least taking the environment more seriously.'
This could become the case if two industry-led initiatives to formulate
reporting standards are successful. One is run by the World Industry Council
for the Environment, which has membership from the International Chamber of
Commerce. The other, Public Environmental Reporting Initiative (Peri), was
instigated in the US by Amoco, IBM and others, and is being led in Europe by
BP.
There are other initiatives by such organisations as the US-based Global
Environment Management Initiative (Gemi) and the Canadian International
Institute for Sustainable Development. But progress at producing standards
is slow. This is understandable because of the complexity of the subject and
the diversity of the industries involved.
However, cynics in both industry and environmental groups also point to the
value of keeping the initiatives in the public eye while delaying the
delivery of standards. It reduces the chance of industry's nightmare coming
true - laws that force companies to report truthfully on their environmental
performance in a standard and comparable way.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Why a hamburger should cost
Dollars 200 - The call for prices to reflect ecological factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most economic modelling concludes that the arduous negotiating exercise
recently concluded in Geneva under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade will give the world economy a new impetus.
Ecologists, however, believe the world's trade ministers can only tinker
with an economic system that is fundamentally flawed by its failure to count
the ecological costs of production.
'This could leave us with a world where there's lots of money but dirty air
and water and environmental degradation,' says Alan Thein Durning, author of
Saving the Forests: What Will it Take? from the Worldwatch Institute, an
environmental group. What is needed is a system of 'full-cost pricing' that
includes environmental costs in production of goods, he says. This would
radically alter cost structures.
A mature forest tree in India would then be worth Dollars 50,000 (Pounds
34,000), according to the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. A
hamburger produced on pasture cleared from rain forests would cost Dollars
200. One hectare of a Malaysian forest, providing carbon storage services
and helping to prevent climate change, would be worth more than Dollars
3,000 over the long term, according to Durning.
Environmentalists fear the costs of not moving towards ecological pricing
will only become clear after it is too late. Deforestation is accelerating;
two-thirds of the planet's original forests have already disappeared.
There are numerous projects to demonstrate the value of the forests. A new
scheme announced by Conservation International, a US environmental group,
includes two US universities, two pharmaceutical companies and a botanical
garden in an effort to expand the drug discovery industry in Surinam.
CI will raise Dollars 1m over five years to finance the development of drugs
from flora identified by forest dwellers, who have been collecting healing
plants for centuries. The project proposes to institute an 'ethnobotanical
premium', paying 50 per cent of royalties from future sales of drugs
developed to a Forest People's Fund for the support of local communities in
Surinam.
Durning also insists the rights of forest dwellers must be honoured. He
recommends 'joint management' arrangements between the indigenous peoples
and their governments, because forest programmes under exclusive control of
the state 'routinely fail'.
Political reform is also necessary to reforestation efforts. 'To varying
degrees, a bond between timber money and political power is found in all the
world's main timber economies,' says Durning. 'In less democratic societies,
those who question the prerogatives of economic power all too often end up
as murder statistics in human rights reports.'
Durning alleges that in countries like Malaysia - the world's largest
exporter of tropical timber - elected leaders distribute to their loyal
supporters contracts for the exploitation of public resources. Even in the
US, the government moves reluctantly against the entrenched timber, mining
and beef interests.
He would like full-cost pricing phased in over 10-20 years through user
fees, green taxes and tariffs. He reckons that a Dollars 3-a-day charge to
visitors to US national forests would raise more money than timber sales
from US government-owned lands.
But first, governments must stop subsidising forest destruction. In the US
the Clinton administration is edging towards raising prices for grazing
lands, mining resources and, eventually, timber sales. Last April, it
announced that it would halt the sale of timber from 62 of 156 national
forests because of the money lost on timber sales. However, that decision
has still to be implemented.
No country can move to full cost pricing alone without risking having their
industries undercut by foreign producers whose governments do not make
environmental destruction costly. Global action is necessary.

FT  12 JAN 94 / People: Owners - no holiday for Heald
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly a decade ago, Malcolm Heald took his honeymoon in Majorca on a
package organised by Sovereign, now part of the Owners Abroad group.
Yesterday, Owners Abroad announced that Heald, 38, is to be its group
finance director, replacing Geoffrey Stone, who resigned last November.
Heald has been on several package holidays since his honeymoon, the most
recent of which was last year when he went to Hong Kong and Bali with
British Airways Holidays.
Otherwise, he cheerfully admits, he has no experience of the holiday
business. But he does, he says, have experience of working for companies in
trouble.
When he was appointed finance director of clothing company Jacques Vert in
1992, he was told it was about to break even. It was his doleful duty to
inform the board they had actually made losses of over Pounds 4.5m. In
1992-3 it made full-year profits of Pounds 1.03m. Yesterday, Jacques Vert
announced first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 833,000, compared with Pounds
186,000 profits last time.
Heald says Owners Abroad is in less of a mess than Jacques Vert was.
Nevertheless, it last year lost Howard Klein, its chairman, and Roger
Allard, the managing director, who resigned after warning that profits this
year would be half market expectations. The group has slipped from second to
third place in the holiday market, behind Thomson and Airtours.
Michael Julien, former chief executive of the Storehouse retail group, has
since become non-executive chairman. Last year, he appointed Francis Baron,
chairman of Anglo-Saxon Television, chief executive.

FT  12 JAN 94 / People: Coulson prescribed for Prestwick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prestwick Holdings, the quoted Scottish printed circuit board maker which in
25 years has never broken through to sustained profitability, has called in
the company doctor. It has made Archie Coulson its executive chairman and
hired Postern, the firm of corporate recovery specialists which Coulson
helped found in 1991, to review its trading and financial position and say
what needs to be done. The review, costing Pounds 90,000, will take about
five weeks.
Prestwick lost nearly Pounds 4m in the year to July 31 1993 on sales of
Pounds 36m after the strategy of ceo Wayne Osman, hired in 1990 as a
saviour, turned to dust. The small electronics companies he acquired caused
big losses. Osman was replaced last year by John Gilhooly as executive
deputy chairman.
Coulson, 47, comes in at the insistence of shareholders with more than 40
per cent of the equity, including the Miller family who founded Prestwick
and managed it intermittently. He says the review will see what needs to be
done to improve the company's tight financial position, fulfil a big order
book and strengthen management. It will then see what future there is in
PCBs.
Hugh Laughland has stepped down as non-executive chairman but will remain on
the board at least till the review is complete. Gilhooly, credited by
Prestwick with establishing better relations with bankers and creditors, and
with starting to sort out managerial and manufacturing problems, has
resigned as director, as have David Simpson, a past chairman, and David
Hall. Alastair McKie and William Young remain executive directors.
Postern was set up to provide a one-stop shop to advise troubled companies
on restructuring and to implement rescue plans. Coulson, who gives the
impression on the telephone of a soothing corporate bedside manner, says it
has done more than 15 rescues, not all of which have got its name in the
papers since some companies prefer to be discreet when they call for help.
He sees Prestwick as 'a damn sight easier than most situations. A lot of
companies don't know what they're doing at all'. He suspects Prestwick's
problems stem from its not recognising that 'management is actually quite
boring. Its acquisitions were probably a good idea, but did anyone check
that they had systems that worked, or integrate them with the rest of the
group?'

FT  12 JAN 94 / Management: Piano gives a lesson for the workplace - Many
people suffer aches and pains from using computer keyboards. A new book
suggests tips based on a musician's experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BOYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barely a week goes by without news that some sporting personality has had to
'retire' or at least rest because of injury. Their high profile always
guarantees a mention. But what of aches, pains and injuries sustained by
people in the workplace and in particular those using computer keyboards?
The problems of tenosynovitis, tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome rarely
get any coverage unless a compensation payment has been involved.
Can anything be done to prevent the daily difficulties experienced by
countless individuals? The Hand Book, published this week* may provide some
answers.
The author is Stephanie Brown, a New York-based professor of piano who has
noted the injuries suffered by pianists. Brown has identified a direct link
between incorrect, strained finger and hand positions at the keyboard and
subsequent injury. Pianists with correct natural positions and movements had
a keyboard style characterised by fluidity and an absence of injury.
The application to computer keyboards became evident when Brown was learning
how to operate her own computer. Many of her teachers used the same harmful
positions and movements she had observed in pianists. Studying typing
manuals highlighted the need for a preventative keyboard method.
Unfortunately, many computer users have never learnt to type, which may put
them at even greater risk of experiencing aches and pains.
'It's well known that certain positions and motions can cause injury in
practically every sport,' says Brown. 'Everyone has had the experience of
watching someone swing a tennis racquet or golf club and think, 'Ouch]' It
just looks wrong. Using a computer keyboard is no different. It's a vigorous
micro-athletic workout for the hands and fingers. Do it wrong and you're
asking for trouble.'
The Hand Book aims to help computer users prevent injuries by avoiding
dangerous hand positions. These have been variously called The Dangerous
Angle, The Cobra, The Spider and The Flying Pinky.
Instead, keyboard users can experience the comfortable and relaxed feel of
the correct position by working through a series of 14 easy to follow
lessons, predominantly aimed at the hands. Other parts of the body - which
can be responsible for symptoms in the hands - are either omitted or
mentioned only briefly.
The book advises on how to care for the hands and details are given of
various stretches like the Teepee, Curl, Press and Tuck to maintain
mobility. Athletes warm up before playing and so should computer users, says
Brown.
Details of exercises and massage during rest breaks from the screen are
given for those body parts that need to be moved. There is nothing
controversial in this but there are some parts that have not been stretched
but which should be stretched to prevent some of the symptoms reported by
keyboard users
Of course there is more to preventing hand injuries at the keyboard and this
is acknowledged in the book. Unfortunately the section on workstation
adjustment is too brief and could be confusing for some readers. It also
assumes that most keyboard users can adjust the height of the keyboard
whereas the majority of users sit at desks of fixed height.
However, the visual reminder of the Do's and Don'ts ('The Golden Rules')
offers a useful summary.
Here are some of them:
Keep the natural wrist line;
Let the wrists float;
Let the elbows hang free;
Relax the ring and little fingers;
Don't squeeze the mouse;
Rest the hands when not keying.

Incorporated, 145 West 96th Street, Suite 800, New York, NY10025.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Management: Change is not enough - Christopher Lorenz on
calls for a revolution among managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Pascale, scourge of the complacent and prodder of the timid, is
acting as 'facilitator' at a workshop of senior executive teams from 16
leading multinationals, including Black &amp; Decker, British Airways, BP,
Monsanto, Nissan and Unilever. He listens to them patiently for several
hours as they enumerate a string of seemingly impressive improvements that
their companies have introduced in the past four years: in customer
responsiveness, total quality, cost reduction, supply management, European
organisation and teamwork.
Only occasionally does he interrupt to ask a question. But it is almost
always a variant of the same phrase: 'Are any of these really
breakthroughs?' The executives shuffle sheepishly, having heard Pascale
speak earlier in the day about the need for corporate 'transformation'.
Eventually one bursts out: 'I don't believe in breakthroughs - fast
incremental change is what gets results.' The other participants laugh
awkwardly, some in relief, others because they know that Pascale, in spite
of his politeness, is disappointed in them. Some later admit privately to
disappointment with themselves.
This episode, at a recent three-day meeting at a hotel near Arundel in
southern England, epitomises the discomfort that many managers feel at the
power of the challenging gospel according to this Californian teacher,
writer and consultant: that, for many large companies in today's viciously
competitive world, change is not enough - nothing short of a revolution will
save them.
With executives from troubled IBM and Kodak in the audience, the point
should not need ramming home. But it does, because it is unpalatable, even
frightening.
Pascale explained why in an article in the latest issue of the Harvard
Business Review, written with a colleague, Tracey Goss*. 'What many chief
executives are missing is that incremental change is not enough for many
companies today. 'Managers groping about for a more fundamental shift in
their organisations' capabilities must realise that change programmes treat
symptoms, not underlying conditions. These companies do not need to improve
themselves, they need to reinvent themselves.'
'Reinvention is not changing what is, but creating what isn't,' Pascale
continues. 'A butterfly is not more caterpillar or a better or improved
caterpillar; a butterfly is a different creature.'
One of Pascale's problems in motivating managers such as those at the
Arundel meeting of the Inter-Company Productivity Group - its activities are
far more ambitious than its name suggests - is that precious few large
companies measure up to his definition of 'reinvention' and
'transformation'.
On a conspicuously short list of European paragons he cites British Airways
and Shorts, the Belfast aircraft and missile maker. Europcar, the rental
chain, and the European arm of Haagen-Dazs ice cream are also trying to
reinvent themselves, he says.
In the US he points to Ford, Intel, part - but not all - of General
Electric, and, above all, Motorola, which, by sustaining its reinventive
capacity, has been able to compete in a succession of different industries
over several decades.
The reasons for the scarcity of 'reinvention' cases are not hard to find,
Pascale says ruefully. He enthuses a company's top managers into embracing
the gospel of transformation, only to find them backing off when they
discover how conflict-ridden and wrenching the shift can be.
Normally very discreet, Pascale has been known to castigate the heads of
AT&amp;T, Whirlpool and one BP division for getting cold feet when what he calls
'executive reinvention' became too painful for the people at the top.
Beneath this surface drama lies a more fundamental challenge: that, in order
to reinvent itself, a company must alter what Pascale calls 'its context -
the underlying assumptions and invisible premises on which its decisions and
actions are based'. Rather than just concerning itself with new types of
'doing', he continues, it must alter its 'being' - its inner nature. That is
not the same thing as its culture, it is deeper and more active.
Lest anyone thinks he has converted to the mumbo-jumbo of New Age
spiritualism, he hastens to point out that the Japanese recognise the
differences between doing and one's inner being (kokoro) in their everyday
speech. On more familiar ground for westerners, he cites the difficulties
other US retailers have had capturing what he calls the 'magic' of
Nordstrom, a remarkably successful but controversial store chain based in
Seattle.
Its rivals 'don't seem to realise that Nordstrom sales people live its motto
of 'Respond to Unreasonable Customer Requests',' he says. To most staff at
competing stores, such a principle means that the customer comes first -
within reason. Customer demands must be met - unless they are ridiculous.
But at Nordstrom each ridiculous request is an opportunity for an 'heroic
act' by an employee - like the San Francisco woman who got up early one
morning to fetch a pair of shoes in my size from a different branch several
miles away.
Faced with the painful need to reinvent who they and their companies are
rather than just what they do, it is not surprising that most senior
executives decide to take the seemingly easier route of incremental change.
This involves what Pascale calls 'trying harder', going 'back to basics',
and searching for 'improvement' techniques.
Until recently Pascale used to condemn this 'fork in the road' decision as
leading, more often than not, to 'stagnation and decline'; the diagram he
used in presentations said as much. But at Arundel and other meetings in the
past few months he has removed those three words from the slide. He fears
they may demotivate companies which, having achieved considerable
improvements through conventional means, could suddenly find they have laid
the foundation for a quantum leap into 'reinvention'.
Coming from an evangelist as thoughtful as Pascale, such a shift in
conversion tactics is understandable. But it risks muddying his message. The
organisers of the Arundel meeting report that some participants have since
said that 'we don't want to be told 'you've done very well, keep on taking
the medicine'. We want more powerful treatment, even if it's painful'.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Jobs: Bringing in, raising up, throwing out - Psychologists'
research casts disturbing light on widely used tests of people's working
ability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you willingly stake your livelihood on your performance in tests not
only devised by folk largely ignorant about your job, but of dubious
legality? What prompts me to ask is that, far from being hypothetical, the
question seems more and more likely to confront this column's readers in
hard reality.
The danger is especially great for those of you whose living depends on your
being employed in organisations, which show signs of becoming addicted to
psychologists' measures of human capability. To make things worse, the cause
of the danger is not just that the so-called psychometric devices are in
growing vogue for selecting new recruits and deciding who is to be promoted.
After all, such yardsticks have been used for those purposes for several
decades.
The big difference is that employers are no longer using them solely for
those purposes. For in the days when use of the psychologists' divining rods
was confined to promotion and initial selection, the only people at risk to
them were aspiring job-changers who volunteered themselves to be measured as
candidates. People happy to continue working in the same job were safe from
the shrinks' inventions.
But fewer and fewer settled staff now have the guarantee of safety. no
matter how loyal their service. The reason is that besides relying on tests
and the like to select new blood to bring in or raise up, organisations are
increasingly using them to determine which longer-serving employees to throw
out.
While the reject-earmarking variant has been in occasional operation for 15
years or so, the latest recorded example in Britain at least came just
before Christmas in the London borough of Southwark. Staff of the local
council's 120-strong finance section were given a long and complex test,
apparently on the assurance that there was no 'correct' answer to any
question. As a result, however, 19 of them were told to cease working and
escorted from the office, and 10 have since reputedly been informed that the
council considers them unsuitable for employment.
Wishing to learn what leading psychologists think of such goings-on, I
telephoned Professor Ivan Robertson of the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, who is a world authority on
psychometric testing. It turned out that he hadn't previously heard about
the Southwark incident.
Even so, his opinion of it can be gauged from the fact that I had to make
several attempts before persuading him that such a thing had really
happened. He found it very hard to believe that anyone could misuse a
selection device so badly. Once I finally convinced him, Outrageous] was the
only printable comment on the matter he uttered. But he did add, among other
things, that in his view shrinks of the occupational type, at any rate, have
long and wrongly concentrated their efforts on providing the employers' side
of the issue with yardsticks, at the expense of paying insufficient heed to
their effect on the employees who get measured.
Professor Robertson also endorsed numerous of the criticisms of current
testing which were spelt out by a fellow psychologist - Dr Mark Cook, of the
University College of Swansea's Personnel Selection Research Group - during
last week's annual conference of the occupational section of the British
Psychological Society.
Dr Cook's main target was the way in which the selection devices are
'validated' or, in lay terms, the rules by which shrinks decide whether or
not the tests adequately assess what it takes to succeed in the types of
work for which candidates are being selected. The only properly acceptable
yardstick, he argues, is one that is demonstrably linked directly with
objective criteria of actual achievement in the job at issue. Examples are
value or volume of orders gained in the case of sales people, and numbers
and quality of widgets turned out in the case of certain production workers.
One reason behind his argument is that unless selection tests are valid by
directly objective criteria, those using them may fall foul of Britain's and
other countries' laws prohibiting discrimination by race, sex and so on.
Indeed, such laws often state specifically that, if there is an illegal bias
in any attribute demanded by a selection procedure, the onus is on the
employer to prove that the particular attribute is essential to good
performance in the work concerned.
Unfortunately, Dr Cook's extensive research into methods of validation shows
that only a minority of yardsticks are directly tied to actual job
achievement, for the simple reason that there are relatively few types of
work in which performance can be adequately gauged by objective criteria
alone. Hence most psychometric devices - at least 60 per cent, and possibly
more than three quarters - settle for more subjective criteria such as
ratings of employees' performance by their bosses.
While that may be understandable at a technical level, however, the Swansea
psychologist's studies also show that far from being a reasonable substitute
for objective criteria, bosses' ratings are a very different thing.
Researchers in various parts of the world have found that such ratings are
subject to a wide range of biases that can have little bearing on actual
achievement in a job.
He divides them into four main categories. One includes not only dis -
crimination on illegal grounds together with 'ageism', but irrelevant likes
and dislikes of particular physical and other individual traits as well as
personal views. A second covers the distorting effects of politicking. The
third group lumps together various aspects of 'impression management',
including the art of buttering up the boss discussed in the Jobs column last
week.
The biggest group is left to the last. Headed 'the undeserved reputation',
it notes 10 ways in which seniors and juniors alike go about getting
themselves seen as good performers while doing little if any productive
work.
Dr Cook tells me that the criterion of bosses' ratings flaws not only a lot
of tests of personality, but also many of those purporting to measure what
was once called 'intelligence' although it is now termed 'cognitive ability'
or the like. In all such cases, the prevalence of subjective biases suggest
the yardsticks cannot be reliable for selecting truly productive staff, and
cast doubt on the measures' legality to boot. He nevertheless stresses that
mere doubt is a long way short of sufficient reason to view them as
unequivocally against the law.
But there was a certain contrasting lack of caution in the words of another
psychologist who contributed to last week's conference. He is Dr Derek North
of Sheffield who criticised further selection yardsticks which are even more
widely used in Britain. Their most popular use is in whittling down initial
applications to shortlists of people deemed worthy of interview.
He certainly pulled few punches in declaring that the evidence shows such
methods are not only of very dubious legality, but a poor predictor of work
performance. Employers using them in the standard way probably ensure two
results. First, rob themselves of 'the opportunity to employ people who will
probably be eminently suitable for the job'. Second, some of the recruits
whom they do take on will be less competent than the people they put off.
Dr North, by the way, works for Britain's official employment service. And
the yardsticks he criticised are formal educational qualifications.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Brief Description of the Clauses and
Schedules of The Finance Bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has issued background notes describing briefly the clauses and
schedules of the Finance Bill, which was published yesterday.
PART I CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
GENERAL
Rates of Duty
Clause 1 and Schedule 1 introduce new rates of duty for wine and cider from
January 1 1994. The duty rates are increased by 1.9 per cent except for the
duty on wine exceeding 15 per cent but not exceeding 22 per cent alcohol by
volume which is reduced by 5.9 per cent.
Clause 2 increases the rates of specific duty on tobacco products by 7.3 per
cent with effect from 6pm on November 30 1993.
Clause 3 increases the rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils with effect from
6pm on November 30 1993. The duty on leaded petrol is increased by 8.6 per
cent, on unleaded petrol by 9.9 per cent and on diesel by 10.2 per cent.
There are similar increases for other oil products.
Clause 4 raises the minimum VED rate where 6 monthly licensing is allowed
from Pounds 35 to Pounds 50; taxes old motorcycles in Northern Ireland the
same as in the UK; ensures that hackney carriages in Northern Ireland are
taxed the same as in the UK; sets new rates of duty for articulated lorries
used in combined transport; amends the concessionary rates of duty for
certain farmers and showmen's goods vehicles; and raises the rate of duty on
cars, light goods vehicles and taxis from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130.
Other provisions
Clause 5 and Schedule 2 cover amendments to the Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971,
not contained in clause 4, which are required to facilitate the
consolidation planned for later this year.
Clause 6 and Schedule 3 restructure the administrative arrangements for the
issue of gaming machine licences. The changes deregulate licensing periods
and the application procedure; abolish special licences; define the seasonal
licence concession and revise the amendment and surrender provisions.
APPEALS AND PENALTIES
VAT and duties tribunal
Clause 7 changes the name of the existing VAT Tribunals to become VAT and
Duties Tribunals, and extends their jurisdiction to excise and customs
matters referred to in later clauses. It also provides for rules to be made
so that costs awarded against an appellant may be recovered as if they were
duty.
Civil penalties
Clause 8 introduces an alternative means of penalising any person engaged in
evasion, or attempted evasion, of excise duty. Instead of prosecuting in the
criminal courts the Commissioners of Customs and Excise will be able to
impose a civil penalty of an amount equal to the excise duty evaded or
sought to be evaded. The penalty may be mitigated to a lesser amount by the
Commissioners of Customs and Excise or, on appeal, by the VAT and Duties
Tribunals.
Clause 9 and Schedule 4 provide for civil penalties to be imposed on any
person breaching excise law. These penalties will be Pounds 250 for most
offences. Some penalties (for example those for failure to pay duty) will be
calculated by reference to the amount of the duty. In such cases the
penalties will be Pounds 250 or 5 per cent of the duty, whichever is
greater. In addition, daily penalties of Pounds 20 per day will be
chargeable for specified continuing offences. Schedule 4 lists all excise
offences which have been decriminalised under this clause.
Clause 10 ensures that a penalty provided for under clause 9 will not be
imposed where there is a reasonable excuse for the conduct giving rise to
the penalty. Inability to pay a penalty, reliance on a third party, or
conduct by third parties, are not acceptable as reasonable excuses.
Clause 11 provides that where any person, without reasonable excuse,
breaches an agreement not to remove goods distrained on in lieu of excise
duty or penalties, he shall be liable to a penalty equal to 50 per cent of
the duty or the penalties in question. This clause does not have effect in
Scotland.
Assessments to excise duty or to penalties
Clause 12 provides for the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to assess
duty underpaid, not paid, or overclaimed. Such assessments must be made
within one year of facts sufficient to make an assessment coming to the
knowledge of the Commissioners and, except in cases of fraud or dishonesty,
within six years of the taxpayer becoming liable to pay the duty. In cases
of fraud or dishonesty the six-year limit will be extended to 20 years.
Clause 13 provides for civil penalties to be assessed and for penalty
amounts to be recoverable as duty. Where assessments are for both duty and
civil penalties, both must be identified separately.
Customs and excise reviews and appeals
Clause 14 and Schedule 5 require the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to
review certain decisions if given notice in writing, and describe reviewable
decisions. In addition the clause prescribes the time limit for requesting a
review and the conditions for any further review. It requires the
Commissioners to give decisions in writing if so requested, and empowers
them to add to the list of reviewable decisions by statutory instrument.
Clause 15 sets out the review procedures. On review a decision may be
confirmed, withdrawn, or varied. Only penalties issued under clause 8 (civil
evasion of excise duty) may be mitigated. If the Commissioners fail to
notify the outcome of a review within 45 days it will be assumed that they
have confirmed their original decision.
Clause 16 provides for appeals to the VAT and Duties Tribunals. The Tribunal
may not hear an appeal unless the appellant is the same person who required
the Commissioners to conduct a review and the Commissioners are content that
any relevant revenue is secure. The Tribunal may, in some matters, overturn
the decision in dispute, quashing or varying it, substituting their own
decisions in its place. In other matters their role is more limited.
Schedule 5 lists the other matters.
Supplemental provisions
Clause 17 defines terms used in clauses 7 - 19 and schedules 4 and 5.
Clause 18 details amendments of other legislation as a consequence of the
clauses 7 to 19 and schedules 4 and 5.
Clause 19 makes provision for the introduction of the provisions set out in
clauses 7 to 19 and schedules 4 and 5. The Commissioners of Customs and
Excise may bring into effect, by order, the provisions and they may appoint
different days for different provisions or purposes (including different
duties).
CUSTOMS: ENFORCEMENT
POWERS
Clause 20 sets out the scope of information-gathering powers in the customs
area, which are being amended to fit in with the increasing use of inland,
audit-based controls instead of frontier checks. The powers are modelled on
those already existing for excise and VAT and apply to any person whose
business activities involve goods which are subject to any customs duty or a
European Community agricultural levy.
Clause 21 enables the Commissioners to make regulations requiring any person
to whom the powers apply to keep records of their business activity and to
preserve such records for up to four years. Such regulations may also
require a person concerned in some other capacity with the importation or
exportation of customs goods (such as a manufacturer of components of
customs goods) similarly to keep and preserve records for up to four years.
Clause 22 allows copies of documents to be admissible as evidence to the
same extent as the records themselves. This is also the case for certain
documents generated by a computer.
Clause 23 enables Customs officers to require persons involved with customs
goods to furnish information or produce documents about their business, or
to require any other person who has possession of those documents to produce
them. It enables officers to take copies of, make extracts from, or, if
necessary, remove any document.
Clause 24 gives officers the authority to enter and inspect business
premises that may be used in connection with customs goods, and to inspect
any goods found on them.
Clause 25 permits a justice, on application by an officer, to order the
production of documents or information potentially required as evidence.
Clause 26 outlines the procedures which are to be followed by an officer who
has removed documents under an order made under clause 25. On request, an
officer is required to provide access to or copies of the documents, unless
to do so would prejudice an investigation or possible criminal proceedings.
Clause 27 provides safeguards to ensure that the appropriate judicial
authority may order an officer to comply with the procedures set out in
clause 26.
AIR PASSENGER DUTY
The duty
Clause 28 introduces a new air passenger duty on flights beginning in the
UK. The duty will apply to a chargeable passenger who travels on a
chargeable aircraft and will be accounted for by the operator of the
aircraft.
Clause 29 provides for the definitions of chargeable and non-chargeable
aircraft. Aircraft of under 10 tonnes maximum take-off weight or seating
fewer than 20 passengers will not be chargeable.
Clause 30 sets the rates of the duty. It provides that where the flight ends
in the UK or elsewhere in the European Community, the rate of duty will be
Pounds 5; for other destinations the rate will be Pounds 10.
Clause 31 provides for a passenger with a return ticket to a final
destination within the UK to be charged the appropriate rate of duty on the
outward leg of the journey only. The clause also provides that passengers on
transfer and transit flights, which will be defined in secondary
legislation, are not liable for duty for the flight immediately following
their transfer or transit, and that children under two who are not allocated
a separate seat before entering the aircraft are excluded from the duty.
Clause 32 provides that where circumstances beyond a passenger's control
cause a change in flight plans shown on his ticket, this will not lead to an
increase in the amount of duty due.
Persons liable for the duty
Clause 33 provides for the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to keep a
register of aircraft operators. It also requires the operator of a
chargeable aircraft to register with Customs and Excise within a prescribed
time, and provides for a penalty for failure to notify liability to
register.
Clause 34 provides for an operator who does not have any business or other
fixed establishment in the UK to appoint a fiscal representative who will
account for the duty on their behalf. The clause also provides for the
fiscal representative to be jointly and severally liable for the duty.
Clause 35 provides a power to make regulations concerning the appointment of
fiscal representatives and provides for an operator who does not appoint a
fiscal representative within the specified time to be liable to a penalty.
Clause 36 permits the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, where
appropriate, to require a registered operator or fiscal representative to
provide security for payment of any duty that is due or may become due. It
also provides for a penalty for failure to provide security.
Clause 37 provides that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise may notify
the operator's handling agent that they will be jointly and severally liable
for any future duty if the operator fails to pay within 90 days any duty
due, or fails to appoint a fiscal representative when required to do so.
Clause 38 provides for regulations specifying accounts which operators shall
keep, and procedures for making returns and paying duty due. It also
provides for penalties for failure to comply.
Administration and enforcement
Clause 39 and Schedule 6 provide that air passenger duty will be a duty of
excise and accordingly shall be under the care and management of the
Commissioners of Customs and Excise. Schedule 6 sets out provisions relating
to administration and enforcement of the duty.
Clause 40 creates offences for fraudulent evasion of air passenger duty and
false declarations.
Supplementary
Clause 41 provides for regulations and orders to be made by statutory
instrument.
Clause 42 contains definitions and provides that where not otherwise
specified, terms have the same meaning as in the Customs and Excise
Management Act 1979.
Clause 43 provides that duty will be due in respect of any carriage of
passengers by air after 30 September 1994.
PART II VALUE ADDED TAX
Clause 44 provides for an increase in the minimum amount of repayment
supplement which Customs and Excise are required to pay in the event of
there having been undue delay in the repayment of VAT claims. The amount is
increased from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50. The clause also withdraws the
provision whereby VAT claims may be received up to one month late and still
qualify for repayment supplement. In future late claims will not qualify for
repayment supplement.
Clause 45 excludes all insolvent VAT registered businesses from the
provisions of section 21 of the Finance Act 1988. This will make it easier
for insolvent businesses to survive, as VAT credits accruing after the
insolvency will not be used to pay VAT debts from before the insolvency.
PART III INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX
The basic provisions
Clause 46 provides for a new tax, insurance premium tax, to be administered
by Customs and Excise.
Clause 47 provides that the tax will be charged on premiums (for taxable
insurance contracts) received by insurers on or after October 1 1994 (but
see also clause 66).
Clause 48 provides that premiums received will be deemed to include tax (but
clause 67 restricts this where the contract is for both taxable and exempt
insurance).
Clause 49 sets the rate of tax at 3 per cent.
Clause 50 places the liability to pay the tax on the insurer, except where
regulations make the insured person liable (see clause 65).
Administration
Clause 51 stipulates that insurers providing taxable insurance must be
registered (until they cease to provide such insurance and have paid all tax
due) and must notify Customs and Excise of this liability. The clause
provides for regulations to establish the detailed provisions and
requirements for registration.
Clause 52 permits regulations to be made to specify the form and manner of
tax returns and how tax is to be paid.
Clause 53 deals with cases where any part of a premium for taxable insurance
is repaid to a policyholder and allows regulations to provide for credit of
tax to insurers in such cases, and how such credit may be claimed.
Clause 54 allows the Commissioners to make assessments of tax due from a
person, which are then recoverable as if they were tax. It contains
provisions specifying, for example, the circumstances both in which
assessments may be made and in which they must be withdrawn, the basis on
which assessments are to be made, and when two or more assessments may be
combined into one.
Tax representatives
Clause 55 provides for insurers with no establishment in the UK, and who are
registered (or liable to be registered) for the tax, to appoint a tax
representative approved by the Commissioners. It provides that their tax
representative will, if no one else is appointed, be taken to be the person
who is their general representative for the purposes of EC regulatory
requirements. In extreme cases where no suitable representative has been
appointed, the clause also allows the Commissioners to direct any agent of
the insurer to be the tax representative.
Clause 56 imposes various rights and obligations jointly and severally on
the tax representative and the insurer, but provides that only the insurer
is liable to register, and restricts the liability of a tax representative
for an offence committed by the insurer to cases where both are at fault.
Review and appeal
Clause 57 grants the right to those affected to require the Commissioners to
review certain decisions, such as an assessment for tax or whether a person
is liable to be registered. The clause includes restrictions on the time
allowed both to lodge a request for review and for the review to be carried
out.
Clause 58 allows appeals to an independent tribunal against decisions which
have been reviewed by the Commissioners. For some cases, the clause requires
the appellant to have made all returns and paid all tax due, and usually any
amount in dispute, before an appeal can be heard. It also provides,
following an appeal, where appropriate, for payment of interest by the
Commissioners to the appellant or vice versa.
Clause 59 provides for the introduction of the review and appeals procedure
on a date specified by an order made by the Commissioners.
Miscellaneous
Clause 60 allows regulations to determine who is to fulfil the tax
obligations of insurers which are partnerships or other unincorporated
bodies, and to make various provisions relating to bankrupt insurers and
insurance businesses transferred from one person to another as a going
concern.
Clause 61 and Schedule 7 make various provisions relating to records
insurers and others are required to keep, powers of Customs and Excise
officers, recovery of tax, offences and penalties, interest, and other
matters.
Clause 62 gives the Commissioners the power to make insured persons jointly
and severally liable for tax on their premiums when the insurer has neither
a UK establishment nor an approved tax representative. It provides that the
insured person can only be liable for tax incurred after receipt of a notice
from the Commissioners, and that any tax paid by the insured person is
liable to be refunded by the insurer. The clause allows regulations to be
made relating to the collection of tax from the insured and prevents the
same tax from being recovered more than once from people who are jointly and
severally liable for it.
Clause 63 allows the Commissioners, where the premium is artificially low,
to direct that tax be accounted for on the open market value of the
insurance cover to which the premium relates.
Clause 64 provides anti-forestalling measures under which certain premiums
paid between Budget day and October 1 1994 are deemed to be received on
October 1 1994 (and therefore taxable if they relate to taxable insurance).
Clause 65 provides that, where a contract is for both taxable and exempt
insurance, tax is only to be charged on the portion of the premium which
relates to the taxable insurance. Thus, for example, tax will not apply to
any portion of a premium which relates to risks outside the UK.
Supplementary
Clause 66 defines taxable insurance contracts and thus the scope of the tax,
listing those types of insurance which are exempt from the tax.
Clause 67 allows the list of exemptions from the tax to be amended by
Treasury Order.
Clause 68 defines the premium for taxation purposes, treating separate
payments as separate premiums, and stipulates that non-monetary payment
should be taken at its open market value. It also states that a premium will
be treated as received by the insurer as soon as it is received by someone
(such as an intermediary) on the insurer's behalf.
Clause 69 defines various terms and provides that the rules used to
determine whether a risk is located in the UK should be those set out in the
Insurance Companies Act 1982.
Clause 70 sets out how orders and regulations are to be made.
PART IV
INCOME TAX, CORPORATION TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX
Income tax: charge rates and reliefs
Clause 71 reimposes income tax for 1994-95 with the same rates as in
1993-94. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged, at Pounds 23,700 of
taxable income (though the effective threshold for some taxpayers is
affected by the change to the married couple's allowance and related
allowances and reliefs in clause 73), and the lower rate band is increased
by Pounds 500, to Pounds 3,000 of taxable
income.
Clause 72 sets the personal allowance for 1994-95, and the income limit
above which the age-related amounts of the allowance are progressively
withdrawn , at the same levels as for 1993-94.
Clause 73 and Schedule 8 reduce the rate of relief for the married couple's
allowance to 20 per cent for 1994-95 and to 15 per cent from 1995-96. The
same change is made to the additional personal allowance (mainly for single
parents') and the widow's bereavement allowance. The clause also sets the
levels of the allowances for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The married couple's
allowance for people aged under 65, and the allowances linked to it, are set
at the same level as in 1993-94 in both years. The amounts of the married
couple's allowances for couples with one or both partners aged 65 or over
are increased by Pounds 200 in 1994-95, and by a further Pounds 330 in
1995-96. An assessment of the compliance costs affecting businesses can be
obtained by writing to Danny Connor, Inland Revenue, Deregulation Unit, Rm
F7, West Wing, Somerset House, London WC2R lLB.
Clause 74 sets the income limit, above which the age-related amounts of
married couple's allowance are progressively withdrawn, at the same level
for 1994-95 as for 1993-94.
Clause 75 restricts tax relief on the first Pounds 1,720 of maintenance
payments to 20 per cent for 1994-95 and 15 per cent for 1995-96, in line
with similar restrictions in the married couple's allowance. The clause also
withdraws relief on payments made to or for children when they reach the age
of 21 in the limited number of cases where relief would currently continue
beyond that age.
Clause 76 sets the limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief
for 1994-95 and 1995-96 at Pounds 30,000 (the same as for 1993- 94). The
clause will have effect from 6 April 1994.
Clause 77 and Schedule 9 reduce the amount of mortgage interest relief to 20
per cent for 1994-95, and to 15 per cent from 1995-96. They also change the
way that relief is given where loans are not in the Miras (mortgage interest
relief at source) scheme. For home-purchase loans, and for loans taken out
by elderly people to buy life annuities, interest paid will no longer be a
deduction from income. Instead, interest relief will be by means of an
'income tax reduction', whereby borrowers' income tax liability will be
reduced by the 'applicable percentage' of the interest they pay. Where a
loan is in the Miras scheme, the amount that borrowers may deduct from
interest payments to their lenders will be similarly reduced. The applicable
percentage for annuity-purchase loans will be the basic rate of tax. In
relation to most interest payments the clause will have effect from April 6
1994.
Clause 78 increases the blind person's allowance from Pounds 1,080 in
1993-94 to Pounds 1,200 in 1994-95 and subsequent years.
Clause 79 and schedule 10 make a number of changes to the tax relief on
private medical insurance for the over 60s. First, they limit relief on
premiums to the basic rate of income tax and change the way of giving relief
so that premiums do not reduce the payer's income for other tax purposes.
Second, they allow a widow or widower aged under 60 to receive relief for
the remainder of a contract following the death of an elder spouse. Third,
they remove the requirement for the Inland Revenue to certify a contract
before relief can be given. And fourth, they allow benefits costing up to
Pounds 30 to be provided without disqualifying a contract from relief; and
ensure that incentives costing more than Pounds 30 will disqualify it. The
first and second changes will have effect from April 6 1994, and the third
and fourth from July 1
1994.
Clause 80 extends tax relief for vocational training to National Vocational
Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at level 5 from
January 1 1994. It also excludes from tax relief from the same date children
under 16, 16-to-18-year-olds in full-time education at a school, and
training undertaken for recreational purposes or as a leisure activity.
Corporation tax charge and rate
Clause 81 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial 1994 at
the unchanged rate of 33 per cent.
Clause 82 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the
financial year 1994 at the unchanged rate of 25 per cent. It sets the
fraction used in calculating the marginal rate (unchanged at 35 per cent)
for companies with profits between the lower and upper profit limits at the
unchanged level of one fiftieth. It increases the lower profits limit, below
which tax is charged at the small companies' rate, from Pounds 250,000 to
Pounds 300,000, and the upper profits limit, above which tax is charged at
the main rate, from Pounds l25m to
Pounds 1.5m.
Benefits in kind
Clause 83 sets for 1994-95 the scale charges for assessing the benefit of
fuel provided by employers for private use of company cars.
Clause 84 changes the tax treatment of cheap and interest-free loans
provided by employers. Employees will be taxed as if they had been given the
equivalent amount of cash instead of a cheap or interest-free loan and given
tax relief as appropriate for the interest they would have paid. The
exemption for small benefits from loans is replaced by a new exemption for
loans totalling up to Pounds 5,000. Loans which employers provide to
employees on the same terms as loans they make to the public will be exempt
from tax as a benefit in kind. The Treasury will be able to set a lower
'official rate' of interest for loans in a foreign currency where interest
rates are significantly lower than in the UK.
Clause 85 makes technical amendments to the way vouchers and credit-tokens
are taxed, to make sure they are valued for tax purposes according to the
expense to the person or persons at whose cost they are provided. This is
linked to the measures to counter avoidance of PAYE (clause 116-122 below).
Chargeable gains
Clause 86 freezes the annual amount of gains which can be made before
capital gains tax becomes payable at Pounds 5,800 for 1994-95.
Clause 87 and Schedule 11 extend the re-investment rollover relief on gains
which are reinvested in shares in a qualifying unquoted trading company.
Gains arising on all disposals made on or after November 30 1993 by
individuals and by most trustees will be eligible for the relief and there
will no longer be any requirement for the investor to take a minimum 5 per
cent holding in the company.
Clause 88 increases the amount of gains eligible for retirement relief when
part or all of a business is disposed of. For disposals on or after November
30 1993 the first Pounds 250,000 of gain will be wholly exempt and half of
any gain between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m.
Clause 89 restricts indexation allowance for losses made on the disposal of
an asset. For disposals on or after November 30 1993 indexation will be able
to reduce or extinguish a gain, but not to create or increase a loss.
Clause 90 sets out specific capital gains tax rules for taxing and giving
relief for payments under commodity and financial futures contracts which
are settled in cash. It provides that relief for expenditure can be given in
full and is not to be reduced under the wasting asset rules. It applies to
contracts entered into on or after November 30 1993.
Clause 91 amends the capital gain tax rules applying when an option is
exercised and results in a cash payment. It specifically ensures that such a
payment can be relieved as allowable expenditure for the payer as well as be
treated as disposal proceeds for the recipient. It applies to options
granted on or after November 30 1993.
Clause 92 clarifies the circumstances in which information must be provided
about certain transactions involving trusts with a foreign element. In
outline, these transactions concern the setting up of a non-resident trust,
the transfer of property (other than on arm's length terms) to a
non-resident trust which was set up before March 19 1991, and a trust
ceasing to be resident for tax purposes in the UK. The clause ensures that
the obligation to provide this information applies in all cases - and is not
restricted, as it is at present, to cases where the settlor, at some time in
the year, has an interest in the trust.
Profit-related pay
Clause 93 changes the rules for calculating the upper limit on the profits
which must be brought into the reckoning in calculating PRP for a particular
profit period. First, it provides that if pay in the profit period is less
than pay in the previous period or base year the minimum upper limit is to
be 160 per cent of the earlier year's profits, plus an additional percentage
found by expressing the pay reduction as a percentage of the earlier year's
profit. Second, for the purposes of calculating the upper limit, PRP and
NICs are to be treated on the same accountancy basis in both the current
profit period and the previous period or base year. The clause applies to
PRP schemes registered on or after December 1 1993.
Clause 94 imposes a new condition which will have to be satisfied by a PRP
'special scheme'. The condition is the special scheme's fixed percentage (if
it is a Method A scheme) or notional/distributable pool (if it is a Method B
scheme) should not exceed a limit calculated by reference to the ratio of
total pay to PRP in the other scheme (or schemes) registered for the
business in question. This ratio will be calculated by reference to the
figures for pay and PRP paid in respect of a specified earlier period. The
clause applies to schemes registered on or after December 1 1993.
Profit sharing schemes
Clause 95 provides that a man who, after reaching retirement age, becomes
chargeable to income tax in respect of shares allocated to him under a
profit-sharing scheme approved before July 25 1991, will not be chargeable
on a greater amount than a woman of the same age. The clause takes effect
from November 30 1993.
Clause 96 enables the trustees of an approved profit-sharing scheme to
retain in the scheme trust qualifying corporate bonds which they receive
when the company whose shares they hold is reconstructed or taken over; and
to distribute the bonds in due course tax-free to scheme participants.
Retirement benefits schemes
Clauses 97 to 100 concern arrangements for monitoring the tax affairs of
retirement benefits schemes to make sure that the conditions on which tax
reliefs are given continue to be met.
Clause 97 introduces new rules for identifying the administrator of a
retirement benefits scheme. This is the person responsible for its tax
affairs. In general, the trustees will be responsible (or the scheme
sponsors, where the scheme is not set up under trust), but they may appoint
some other person to act as administrator in their place.
Clause 98 amends the present arrangements for dealing with situations where
the duties of the administrator are not carried out. Under this clause
responsibility for the tax affairs of a retirement benefits scheme passes
from an appointed administrator to the scheme trustees (or sponsors) or, as
the last resort, to the employer.
Clause 99 provides for regulations to be made which specify what information
must be produced about the tax affairs of a retirement benefits scheme,
either automatically or on request, and for how long records should be kept.
The clause also provides authority for those records to be inspected.
Clause 100 introduces a penalty (of up to Pounds 3,000) covering the making
of false statements in order to obtain tax approval of a retirement benefits
scheme or of an alteration to such a scheme. The penalty will also apply
where a false statement results in relief from, or repayment of, tax being
obtained.
Clause 101 amends one of the conditions for granting tax approval of
retirement benefits schemes. It removes a requirement that certain annuity
contracts taken out by schemes should be approved by the Inland Revenue. In
place of that requirement the scheme managers will be expected to satisfy
themselves that the benefits under the annuity contracts are of a type and
amount that an approved scheme could pay. This change to the tax approval
rules reflects the coming into force of the European Communities third life
insurance directive from July 1 1994.
Clause 102 changes the tax rules to ensure that tax is charged on a benefit
received from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) which
has not itself been taxed in the UK. The legislation also applies where
FURBS are marketed by insurance companies. The clause will have effect for
all benefits received under arrangements made or varied on or after December
1 1993.
Annuities
Clause 103 will, from April 6 1995, bring personal pension annuities within
the PAYE system. This will put the tax treatment of personal pension
annuities on the same footing as annuities paid under approved retirement
benefits schemes with the correct amount of tax being deducted from each
payment.
Clause 104 confirms the existing practice that where members of approved
retirement benefits schemes choose to have an annuity purchased from an
insurance company, instead of receiving a pension from a scheme, the annuity
remains taxable under the PAYE system.
Authorised unit trusts
Clause 105 changes the rate of corporation tax for authorised unit trusts to
the same rate as the basic rate of income tax.
Clause 106 and Schedule 12 set out new rules for the taxation of authorised
unit trusts and of unit holders for distribution periods beginning on or
after April 1 1994. These rules allow authorised unit trusts to pay a new
kind of distribution which will be treated as interest for tax purposes.
Non-resident investors will be able to register to receive these
distributions without deduction of tax where they derive from eligible
assets.
Exchange gains and losses
Clause 107 makes some amendments to the rules which determine when a company
becomes or ceases to be entitled to an asset, or subject to a liability, for
the purpose of applying the provisions on foreign exchange gains and losses
in Chapter II of the Finance Act 1993. The amendments make it clear that
exchange differences on a debt are to be computed from the date when the
obligation to pay arises, rather than the later date when payment is due. In
addition, where assets acquired or disposed of by transfer are accounted for
under normal accountancy practice by reference to the date of delivery
rather than the contract date, it is to be possible to follow this in
computing exchange gains and losses.
Clause 108 extends the scope of the rules for computing exchange gains and
losses on currency contracts to cover contracts which provide for net
payments rather than an actual exchange of amounts of principal.
Clause 109 enables regulations to provide for non-monetary assets to be
matched with currency contracts in determining when exchange differences on
the contracts are to be taken into account for tax purposes.
Capital allowances
Clause 110 introduces new rules which provide that buildings and structures
cannot qualify as plant for capital allowances purposes (though the broad
aim is that expenditure on buildings and structures which already qualifies
will continue to do so). The clause will have effect from November 30 1993.
Clause 111 introduces new time limits for giving notification of qualifying
expenditure on machinery and plant for which a capital allowances claim is
to be made.
For expenditure incurred on or after November 30 1993 the limit will be two
years from the end of the chargeable period in which the expenditure was
incurred. (A different time limit will apply for self-employed taxpayers
dealt with under the new system of self-assessment.)
For expenditure incurred before November 30 1993 the same two-year time
limit will apply in all cases except where the expenditure was notified to
the Inspector before November 30 1993.
Clause 112 amends the capital allowance provisions for connected persons to
include transfers of qualifying hotels and enterprise zone commercial
buildings prior to March 16 1993. A measure in the March Budget made similar
provisions for such transfers after that date.
Securities
Clause 113 provides for price adjustments made in lieu of 'manufactured
payments' under agreements for the sale and repurchase of securities to be
treated for tax purposes in the same way as actual manufactured payments.
('Manufactured payments' are payments which compensate the recipient for not
receiving dividends or interest on securities). The clause will have effect
from a day to be appointed in Treasury regulations.
Clause 114 prevents charges arising under the Accrued Income Scheme
legislation (sections 710 to 728 of the Taxes Act 1988) in certain
circumstances where the tax rules on manufactured payments apply, and
clarifies the tax rules for payments passing through the hands of
intermediaries. The Clause will have effect from November 30 1993.
Clause 115 enables regulations to be made to confirm that tax relief will
not be available in respect of tax credits on overseas dividends received
when the tax credits have been offset against tax due on manufactured
overseas dividends paid, or when the overseas dividends have been
effectively paid on to someone resident outside the United Kingdom.
PAYE: extension of scope
Clauses 116 to 122 extend the scope of PAD to prevent employers avoiding
their PAYE obligations by paying their staff in assets (such as gold) or
through third parties (such as offshore trusts).
Clause 116 treats a payment of Schedule E income made by an intermediary of
an employer as paid by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. An
intermediary is defined as someone acting on behalf of the employer, or a
trust.
Clause 117 treats the provision of Schedule E income in the form of a
tradeable asset as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE. A
tradeable asset is defined as one capable of being sold on certain markets,
or in respect of which trading arrangements exist.
Clause 118 treats the receipt by employees of non-cash vouchers which are
either exchangeable for tradeable assets or are themselves tradeable assets
as a payment by the employer for the purposes of PAYE.
Clause 119 treats the use by an employee of a credit-token provided by
reason of his employment to obtain money or tradeable assets as a payment by
the employer for the purposes of PAYE.
Clause 120 treats the receipt by employees of cash vouchers as a payment by
the employer for the purposes of PAYE.
Clause 121 includes supplementary provisions for payments treated as made
under Clauses 116 to 120. These cover interpretation, including a definition
of trading arrangements, and provide powers to make PAYE regulations
governing how employers are to account for PAYE tax on certain notional
payments.
Clause 122 provides that where an employer is treated as having made a
payment under clauses 116 to 120, and the employee receives that payment
free of tax, then there shall be an additional Schedule E emolument equal to
the amount of the tax concerned.
Miscellaneous provisions about companies
Clause 123 amends the provisions which impose additional tax on companies
that control foreign companies (CFCs) in low-tax areas overseas. It revises
the level of dividends which a non-trading CFC must pay to the UK residents
to prevent the additional charge from arising to 90 per cent of its taxable
profits less capital gains and tax suffered.
The changes apply to accounting periods ending on or after November 30 1993.
Clause 124 allows the Board of Inland Revenue to collect unpaid corporation
tax from the previous owners of a company or from other companies previously
under the same ownership, when the company is sold in circumstances intended
to ensure that its corporation tax liabilities arising prior to the sale are
unable to be collected. The clause applies in relation to contracts for sale
entered into on or after November 30 1993.
Clause 125 enables regulations to permit oil companies which account for
their oil and gas extraction activities in different currencies to compute
their taxable trading profits (before capital allowances) by reference to
those currencies.
Miscellaneous
Clause 126 and Schedule 13 introduces the Enterprise Investment Scheme. This
replaces the Business Expansion Scheme and provides a range of income tax
and capital gains tax reliefs to encourage outside equity investment in
unquoted trading companies. There are special new rules for 'business
angels' who want to provide expertise as well as finance by becoming paid
directors.
Clause 127 and Schedule 14 introduce the Foreign Income Dividend scheme,
including special rules for international headquarters companies.
Under the scheme a company can opt from July 1 1994 to pay a foreign income
dividend which will carry no tax credit, but which will allow the company to
recover surplus advance corporation tax if the dividend can be switched with
foreign income profits.
Clause 128 brings into tax the new incapacity benefit which will replace
invalidity benefit from April 1995. Only new recipients of the benefit paid
after April 5 1995 will be subject to tax. Benefit paid in the first 28
weeks of any period of incapacity (when sickness benefit would be paid under
the current rules) will not be taxable.
Clause 129 provides that non-residents carrying on business in the UK will
not be able to claim relief for losses incurred as a result of the exemption
of royalty income under a double taxation convention.
This restriction, with a similar restriction in existing legislation
concerning losses incurred as a result of the exemption under a double
taxation convention of dividends and interest received by non-residents
carrying on certain types of business, is to apply irrespective of the
nature of the business company's first accounting period to begin on or
after a day to be appointed by order by the Treasury.
Qualifying contracts
Clause 136 defines a qualifying contract as an interest rate contract or
option or currency contract or option entered into or acquired after that
day, a currency contract or option held on that day and an interest rate
contract or option held on commencement day if that day falls more than
twelve months after the appointed day.
Clause 137 provides for a qualifying company to elect for the new rules on
the taxation of financial instruments to apply to all the interest rate
contracts and options it holds on its commencement day where that day falls
within 12 months of the appointed day.
Interest rate and currency contracts and options
Clause 138 defines an interest rate contract and an interest rate option.

contract or option do not prevent that contract or option falling within the
new rules on the taxation of financial instruments.
Other basic definitions
Clause 142 defines qualifying payments.
Clause 143 identifies the companies ('qualifying companies') to which the
new rules on the taxation of financial instruments will apply.
Accrual of profits and losses
Clause 144 sets out how profits and losses are to be calculated on

disposes of or varies a qualifying contract.
Clause 151 prevents double counting of profits or losses on currency

Clause 153 brings to account debts which are released.
Anti-avoidance and related provisions
Clause 154 provides for an adjustment to the profit or loss on a qualifying
contracts where there is a transfer of value under the contact from a
qualifying company to an associated company or an associated third party.
Clause 155 provides for a compensating adjustment to the profit or loss on a
qualifying contract held by an associated company which is also a qualifying
company and which receives a transfer of value under clause 154.
Clause 156 provides for adjustments to the profit or loss on a qualifying
contract which a qualifying company enters into on other than arm's length
terms.
Clause 157 treats qualifying contracts between qualifying companies and
certain non-residents as contracts which would have not been entered into at
all by parties dealing at arm's length, thus invoking the adjustments under
clause 156.
Miscellaneous
Clause 158 and Schedule 16 deal with the application of the general rules
for the taxation of financial instruments to insurance companies and mutual
trading companies.
Clause 159 ensures that the non-trading profits on interest rate contracts

income which is applied for charitable purposes to profits and losses from
qualifying instruments.

including qualifying companies.
Supplemental
Clause 162 provides rules to ensure that these provisions override existing
legislation and thus prevent double charging or double relief of profits or
losses.
Clause 163 provides that a qualifying company is not required to deduct
income tax from qualifying payments or account for income tax on receipt of
a qualifying payment.
Clause 164 contains transitional rules for currency contracts held before a
qualifying company's commencement day.
Clause 165 makes minor amendments to the Taxes Acts to accommodate the
effects of the new provisions on the taxation of financial instruments.

Chapter II and enables the Treasury to make regulations amending clauses 138
to 142 with any corresponding amendments to the provisions in Finance Act
1993 dealing with exchange gains and losses.
MANAGEMENT: SELF ASSESSMENT ETC.
Clauses 167 to 188 and Schedule 17 provide the rules for the introduction of
a system of self-assessment of income tax, capital gains tax and corporation
tax. Unless otherwise stated, the rules will come into effect for income tax
and capital gains tax for the tax year 1996/97 and subsequent years, and for
corporation tax for accounting periods ending after an appointed date, which
will be not earlier than March 31 1996.
Income tax and capital gains tax
Clause 167 amends the time limits for returns of income and gains from
individuals and trustees to January 31 following the tax year of the return,
or, if later, three months after the issue of the return. It also provides
for the share of any partnership income, loss or charge to be included in
the return.
Clause 168 provides that a taxpayer's return should include a
self-assessment and provides for the possibility of the Revenue calculating
the tax due and correcting obvious errors or mistakes, and the circumstances
in which the taxpayer can amend the self-assessment.
Clause 169 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to make inquiries into
tax returns of individuals and trustees, requires formal notice of the
inquiries to be given to the taxpayer and sets the time limits within which
such inquiries can be commenced.
Corporation tax
Clause 170 requires a company that carries on a trade or business in
partnership to make a return on its total income from the partnership in
accordance with partnership statements made under clause 174. Clause 171
provides that a company's return should include a self-assessment and
provides for the possibility of the Inland Revenue correcting obvious errors
or mistakes and the circumstances in which the company can amend the
self-assessment.
Clause 172 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to make inquiries into
company's returns of profits, requires formal notice of the inquiries to be
given to the company and sets the time limits within which such inquiries
can be commenced.
Partnerships
Clause 173 introduces rules for returns of the profits of partnerships and
the allocation between partners of those profits.
It identifies the partner to whom the return should be issued, the
information that may be required with the return and the time limit for
delivering the return to the Revenue, the later of January 31 after the year
of assessment or three months from the issue of the return.
Clause 174 specifies that a partnership return should include a partnership
statement. It provides for the amendment of the statement by the Revenue and
the partnership.
Clause 175 introduces powers for the Inland Revenue to inquire into
partnership returns. It requires formal notice of the inquiries to be given
and sets the time limits within which such inquiries can be commenced.
Inquiries: procedure
Clause 176 introduces specific powers for the Inland Revenue to call for
documents for the purposes of certain inquiries into returns. It specifies
the circumstances in which an officer of the Board may require information,
the types of information, the form in which it is to be provided and the
formal procedure for enforcing production of the information including the
right to appeal against a notice.
Clause 177 enables amendments to be made to a person's self-assessment once
the Inland Revenue has commenced its inquiries into the return on which it
is based and sets out the procedure for bringing those inquiries to a
conclusion.
Clause 178 enables amendments to be made to a partnership statement once the
Inland Revenue has commenced inquiries into the return on which it is based
and sets out the procedure for bringing those inquiries to a conclusion.
Determinations and assessments to protect revenue
Clause 179 introduces a power for the Inland Revenue to make a determination
of tax due where no return has been delivered by the taxpayer. The
determination may be superseded by a self-assessment.
Clause 180 amends the rules for the Inland Revenue raising assessments under
Section 29 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 which will in future deal only
with assessments made where a loss of tax or grant of excessive relief has
been discovered.
Payment of tax
Clause 181 introduces rules for payments on account of income tax normally
on January 31 during and July 31 after the end of the year of assessment.
Clause 182 introduces rules for the final balancing payment of income tax
and capital gains tax liability for each year of assessment, normally due by
January 31 following the year of assessment.
Clause 183 provides rules for surcharges on unpaid income tax and capital
gains tax, the dates and amounts on which it is due and rights of appeal
against the imposition of the surcharge.
Clause 184 moves the rules for the payment of corporation tax from the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to the Taxes Management Act 1970.
Miscellaneous and supplemental

1970 in connection with the introduction of self-assessment; in particular
to amend the rules for notification of liability to income tax and capital
gains tax; to apply the new rules for partnerships to European Economic
Interest Groupings; to introduce a provision requiring taxpayers to keep
records for the purposes of making a tax return; to amend the rules for
recovering overpayments of tax and for assessments to tax; for amendment of
the partnership statement where a loss of tax is discovered; to amend rights
of appeal, and the provisions for correcting errors or mistakes in returns
and partnership statements; to amend time limits for assessments; to amend
the provisions for making claims; to amend arrangements for postponing
payment of tax and for collection and recovery of tax; to amend the
provisions for interest on overdue tax; to amend the penalties for failure
to make a return for income tax and capital gains tax and a partnership
return and penalties for making an incorrect partnership return; new
penalties for failure to produce documents under Clause 176; and powers to
inquire into claims and amendments to claims.
Clause 186 gives the rules for constructing certain references in the
legislation.
Clause 187 provides rules for calculation of the amount of tax payable on
the relevant due dates with regards to 1996-97.
Clause 188 gives the general starting date for the changes under Clauses
168-185 inclusive, for income tax and capital gains tax as respects the year
1996/97 and later years and for corporation tax for accounting periods
ending not earlier than 1 April 1996.
CHANGES FOR FACILITATING SELF-ASSESSMENT
Note Clauses 189 to 207 and Schedule 18 provide the rules for computation of
income assessable under Schedule D on a current-year basis, and for the
transition from the existing preceding-year basis to the new rules. Unless
otherwise stated, the new rules in practice apply to the tax year 1997/98,
and 1996/97 is the transitional year. Where a new source of income or a
business commences after April 5 1994 the new rules apply immediately to
those sources.
Assessment under Cases I and II of Schedule D
Clause 189 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D
Cases I and II. Income tax will be charged on the profits made in the tax
year itself. The profit shown by accounts drawn up each year to a date other
than April 5 as adjusted for tax purposes will be taken as those of the year
to April 5.
Clause 190 amends the basis of assessment for Schedule D Cases I and II for
the first year and in some circumstances the second year of assessment of
new businesses. The assessable profits for the year of assessment in which a
businesses commences are those which arise in the fiscal year. The second
year profits are normally determined by the rule introduced by Clause 189
but in certain circumstances it is the profits of the 12 months from the
date of commencement of the business.
Clause 191 provides rules for the basis of assessment under Schedule D Cases
I and II where a business changes its accounting date. Except for changes
which take place in the early years of the business certain qualifying
conditions (set out in clause 192) have to be met if the basis periods are
to change.
Clause 192 introduces the conditions which must be met if a change of
accounting date is to result in a change in the basis period under clause
191 other than where the change takes place in the early years of the
business. The change must not be achieved by means of an account which
exceeds 18 months; the taxpayer must give notice that he wishes his basis
period to change; and either there must have been no other change of
accounting date for that business in the previous five years or the change
must have been made for bona fide commercial reasons.
Clause 193 introduces a new basis of-assessment under Schedule D Cases I and
II for the tax year in which the business ceases or is treated for tax
purposes as ceasing. The basis period for the year of cessation is the
period of trading in that year plus the part of the preceding year (if any)
which did not fall in the basis period for that year.
Clause 194 introduces a new provision to ensure that over the lifetime of a
business no more than the actual profits made are taxed. Where the basis of
assessment under Clauses 189-191 causes the same profits to be taxed in two
successive years ('overlap profits') the new provision deducts the amount of
the overlap profits in assessments for later years either where more than 12
months' profits are taxed in one year or on cessation.
Assessment under Cases III to VI of Schedule 9
Clause 195 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D
Case III. Income tax will be charged by reference to income arising in the
current year of assessment.
Clause 196 introduces a new current-year basis of assessment for Schedule D
Cases IV and income tax will be charged by reference to income arising in
the current year of assessment.
Clause 197 provides for the basis of assessment for income under Schedule D
Case VI to be only on a current-year basis.
Loss relief
Clause 198 makes several changes to the loss-relief provisions in the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It provides for sideways loss relief under
Section 380 to be given against the income of either the year of loss or the
preceding year. It ensures that loss reliefs are computed by reference to
the same periods of account as income from the same source would be. It
simplifies the procedure for making claims under Section 385 for relief for
losses by carry-forward against future income from the same source. It
removes an anomaly whereby relief for terminal losses could not be given
against any profits which arose in the year of assessment in which the
source ceased.
Clause 199 provides that relief under Section 574 ICTA 1988 for losses on
unquoted shares will be available for set-off against income of the current
or preceding years.
Capital allowances
Clause 200 determines the manner of making capital allowances and balancing
charges which fall to be made in taxing a trade, profession or vocation.
Capital allowances will be treated as trading expenses and balancing charges
as trading receipts.
Clause 201 provides a new definition of the expression 'chargeable period'
in the Capital Allowances Act 1990. The chargeable period is to be a period
of account instead of a year of assessment as currently.
Clause 202 makes a number of amendments to the Capital Allowances Act 1990
which are consequential upon the changes introduced by clauses 200 and 201.
Clause 203 makes a number of amendments to the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988 which are consequential upon the changes introduced by clauses 200
and 201.
Miscellaneous and supplemental
Clause 204 provides that where a trade or profession is carried on by two or
more persons in partnership each partner is assessed on their share of the
income from the partnership.
Clause 205 provides that where there is a change in the ownership of the
trade, profession or vocation and one person is engaged in that activity
both before and after the change, the activity shall not be regarded as
discontinued for the purposes of basis periods for Cases I and II of
Schedule D unless there is an actual cessation of the activity. Clause 206
provides rules for allocating double taxation relief in respect of overlap
profits under Section 804 ICTA 1988.
Clause 207 provides the rules for the new provisions coming into effect. It
also gives effect to Schedule 18 providing for transitional provisions for
businesses and other sources of income arising before April 6 1994 in
respect of calculation of profits for the year 1996/97 and other relevant
years, transitional provisions for capital allowances and double taxation
relief.
LLOYD'S UNDERWRITERS;
CORPORATIONS ETC.
Clauses 208 to 219 provisions to charge to corporation tax the profits
arising from corporate membership of Lloyd's. The provisions operate for
accounting periods beginning on or after January 1 1994. (Inland Revenue
Press Release October 14 1993 and January 11 1994)
Main provisions
Clause 208 provides that the profits of a corporate member's underwriting
business at Lloyd's are to be computed as trading income, except for
non-syndicate related profits that are otherwise chargeable to tax.
Clause 209 sets out the general rules to decide for which accounting period
the profits and losses arising from the corporate member's syndicates and
from funds in which its premiums received are invested (premiums trust
funds) are to be treated as arising.
Clause 210 provides for the assessing and collecting of tax on the profits
and losses arising from a corporate member's syndicates and from premium
trust funds by importing and suitably modifying the provisions in Finance
Act 1993 for assessing and collecting that apply to individual members.
Trust funds
Clause 211 ensures that the corporate member and not the trustees is treated
as owner of the assets in its premiums trust fund for corporation tax
purposes and treats the assets in premiums trust funds as acquired and
disposed of each year.
Clause 212 ensures that the corporate member and not the trustees is treated
as owner of the assets in ancillary trust funds at Lloyd's - that is funds
other than premiums trust funds - for corporation tax purposes.
Other special cases
Clause 213 provides that relief for payments (reinsurance to close premiums)
which the members of one syndicate make to the members of the successor
syndicate to take over their outstanding liabilities is available to
corporate members of syndicates in the same way as it is available to
individual members (that is to the extent that the payments are fair and
reasonable with respect of the liabilities transferred).
Clause 214 provides rules giving relief for payments and charging receipts
in respect of stop loss insurance taken out by corporate members. It also
provides relief for payments made to transfer to someone else a corporate
member's rights and liabilities in respect of business it has underwritten.
Miscellaneous
Clause 215 disapplies provisions relating to the currency to be used in
computing a corporate member's profits from its underwriting business. It
also excludes assets and liabilities in certain trust funds of corporate
members from the application of provisions dealing with exchange gains and
losses, interest rate and currency contracts and options.
Clause 216 provides that the final underwriting year for a corporate member
is generally that in which its deposit at Lloyd's is repaid, subject to
other rules that the Board of Inland Revenue may make by regulations.
Clause 217 and Schedule 19 introduce changes to the scheme set out in
Finance Act 1993 for the taxation of individual members of Lloyd's (as
announced in an Inland Revenue Press Release 14 October 1993) generally
effective from 1994/95 but subject to different start dates in some
instances.
The clause also removes two provisions (which are no longer necessary) for
members of Lloyd's to make modified elections relating to retirement annuity
relief and personal pension contributions, effect for 1997/98 onwards. The
schedule makes changes consequent on the move to a distribution year basis
for individual member's acceptance of corporate members at Lloyd's and
clarifies some aspects of the Finance Act 1993 scheme for the taxation of
individual members of Lloyd's. These provisions are effective from different
dates.
Supplemental
Clause 218 enables the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations on
specified matters concerning the taxation of corporate members.
Clause 219 defines various terms used in the legislation.
PART V OIL TAXATION
Clause 220 provides for the proceeds chargeable to petroleum revenue tax
(PRT) from the arm's length sale of landed North Sea crude oil for a price
which includes subsequent delivery costs to be reduced by those additional
costs. The clause also reduces by 24 hours the time available to North Sea
producers to nominate sales of oil for the purpose of establishing the tax
value of own crude production. The clause will have effect from January 1
1994.
Clause 221 and Schedule 20 amend the PRT rules for determining the market
value of gas not sold on the open market. The new rules will enable market
value to be determined on an arm's length basis taking account of all the
circumstances relevant to the particular disposal. The clause will have
effect from January 1 1994.
Clause 222 clarifies the conditions for relief of abortive exploration
expenditure incurred before March 16 1983, following the changes to
Petroleum Revenue Tax enacted in the 1993 Finance Act.
Clause 223 imposes a disposal receipts charge to Petroleum Revenue Tax on
the market value of assets transferred between affiliates where those assets
are used to earn tariffs. Previously the receipts charged would have been
limited to an amount equal to the vendor's acquisition costs.
PART VI STAMP DUTY
Clause 224 makes it clear that for stamp duty purposes deeds will not
generally be regarded as executed until they have been delivered as well as
signed. The stamp duty charge on a document is generally fixed by reference
to its date of execution. The clause removes doubts about the meaning of
execution for stamp duty in Scotland. It is not regarded as changing the law
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The clause has effect for
instruments executed on or after December 8 1993.
Clause 225 relaxes the stamp duty penalty provisions on agreements for
lease. This will enable an agreement for a lease to be submitted for
stamping at the same time as the lease itself without incurring undue
penalty.
Clause 226 provides that all exchanges of one interest in land for another
will be treated as sales for stamp duty. Currently many property exchanges
attract only a fixed 50 pence charge. The clause also provides that on a
sale or lease of land the nature of the property received in payment does
not matter for stamp duty purposes. The clause applies to instruments
executed on or after December 8 1993, unless the instrument was executed in
pursuance of a contract made before November 30 1993.
Clause 227 provides that if the price payable for an interest in land cannot
be ascertained at the time the transfer document is executed (and could not
be ascertained by reference to a possible future event specified in the
document) stamp duty will be payable on the open market value of the
property (or on the market premium and/or the market recent in the case of a
new lease). Currently the stamp duty payable in such cases is a fixed charge
of either 50 pence or Pounds 2. The clause applies to instruments executed
on or after 8 December 1993.
Clause 228 provides that where a lease is surrendered otherwise than by
deed, stamp duty will be chargeable on the price paid in return for any
agreement for the surrender. The clause applies to agreements made on or
after December 8 1993.
Clause 229 provides that purchasers or lessees of land and buildings in
Northern Ireland are required to produce to the Inland Revenue with the
convincing document a form (the so-called Particulars Delivered form)
summarising such details of the transaction as shall be prescribed by
regulations. This will bring Northern Ireland into line with England,
Scotland and Wales in this respect. Currently purchasers in Northern Ireland
can leave it to the Stamp Office to complete the Particulars Delivered form.
These forms provide essential information to the Valuation Office and are
used for statistical purposes. The clause takes effect from a day to be
appointed by Treasury Order.
Clause 230 provides powers to make regulations exempting certain classes of
instrument from the requirements of clause 229. The intention is to make
regulations enabling documents recording transactions below the stamp duty
threshold to by-pass the Stamp Office and to go direct to the appropriate
Northern Ireland Registrar. Parallel arrangements are already in place in
England, Scotland and Wales. This clause will also be brought into effect by
Treasury Order.
PART VII INHERITANCE TAX
Clause 231 sets the inheritance tax threshold for 1994/95 at Pounds 150,000.
Clause 232 extends from 12 months to three years (or such extended period as
the Board of Inland Revenue may allow) the period for a donee, who receives
and then sells property eligible for business or agricultural property
relief, to acquire a qualifying replacement property and retain relief on
the gift. The clause will apply to deaths and other chargeable events on or
after November 30 1993.
Clause 233 ensures that assets forming part of a corporate member's premiums
trust fund or ancillary trust funds are excluded from the definition of
relevant property for the purposes of inheritance tax settlement provisions
(see clauses 208 to 219 above).
PART VIII MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL
Companies treated as non-resident
Clause 234 amends the rules on company residence for certain dual-resident
companies, that is companies which are regarded as resident for tax purposes
by both the UK and another country. It provides that where a dual-resident
company is regarded as not resident in the UK for the purposes of the double
taxation agreement between the two countries, it shall be treated as not
resident in the UK for all tax purposes. The change applies for periods
beginning on or after November 30 1993.
Clause 235 relaxes certain provisions which would otherwise apply where a
dual resident company ceased to be resident on November 30 1993 as a result
of the new rule in clause 234 coming into force. The company will not be
required to notify the Inland Revenue of its change of residence status and
its resulting liability to tax on certain capital gains will be removed or
deferred.
Clause 236 repeals a number of anti-avoidance provisions which are no longer
needed as a result of the new rule in clause 234 coming into force.
Privatisations
Clause 237 and Schedule 21 make provisions for the reorganisation and
privatisation of the railways. In common with many earlier privatisations, a
package of tax measures will ensure that the statutory reorganisation of
BR's business will take place on a broadly tax-neutral basis for BR, its
successor companies and employees. In order to achieve that result, the
provisions will apply with effect from November 51993 (when the Railways Act
received Royal Assent) or January 11 1994.
Clause 238 and Schedule 22 deal with the tax treatment of the
pre-privatisation reorganisation of Northern Ireland Airports Ltd (NIAL)
under the provisions of the Airports (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 (the
order).
Their main effects are to prevent capital gains or losses arising on the
reorganisation and to enable a successor company to inherit NIAL's tax
position in relation to the activities transferred.
The provisions apply to transfers under the order which are due to take
place on April 1 1994.
Management
Clause 239 extends the powers given to the Lord Chancellor to make
procedural rules for the General and Special Commissioners to allow the
Commissioners to obtain relevant information from any party to an appeal,
and not just from the taxpayer as at
present. Clause 240 amends Section 20 of the Taxes Management Act, the
Inland Revenue's general power to obtain information from taxpayers and
third parties, to provide new safeguards for taxpayers who are subject to
information notices. Clause 241 allows the Inland Revenue to obtain the
papers of an accountant where are reasonable grounds for believing that he
or she has assisted the making of a tax offence, subject to the consent of a
Special Commissioner.
