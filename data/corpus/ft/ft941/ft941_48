FT  06 JAN 94 / US warns Croatia to stay out of Bosnia

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Mrs Madeleine Albright, warned
Croatia yesterday that it could face international economic sanctions unless
it stayed out of the Bosnian war.
The warning, issued during a news conference in Zagreb, the Croat capital,
came as Moslem and Croatian negotiators in Vienna promised to make 'firm
efforts' to stop the war in central Bosnia at a top-level meeting in Bonn on
Saturday.
Mrs Albright said the US was 'very concerned' by the reported activities of
the Croatian military in support of Bosnian Croat forces. 'We have in a
number of ways warned the Croatian government and military specifically on
the subject,' she said.
Her statement came hard on the heels of statements by President Franjo
Tudjman and his senior officials that Zagreb might intervene directly to
support Bosnian Croat forces encircled by Moslem-led Bosnian troops in the
central Lasva valley.
In spite of government denials UN officers and Lord Owen, the European
Union's mediator on Yugoslavia, have claimed that Croatia has already given
military help against both Moslems and Serbs.
In an interview on Britain's Channel 4 television last night, Lord Owen said
the international community should react as strongly as it did to the
Serbian military intervention in Bosnia in 1992.
Mrs Albright's strictures coincided with harsh criticism of all the
participants in the Bosnian war from the Vatican, normally Catholic
Croatia's unconditional supporter. 'No individual, much less politicians,
can resign themselves to allow people to ravage each other and await a peace
which would be the rotten fruit of exhaustion, or the crushing of one side
by the other,' a Vatican spokesman said yesterday.
Meanwhile, the joint statement issued in Vienna by Mr Haris Silajdzic,
Bosnian prime minister, and Mr Mate Granic, Croatian foreign minister, said
their plan to halt hostilities would be put to their respective presidents
in Bonn on Saturday. They were making strenuous efforts to prepare 'a
complete plan of the implementation of a ceasefire along all the
frontlines'.
An agreement in Bonn is clearly a vital condition for progress at full-scale
negotiations, including the Serbs, due to take place in Geneva on January
18. But Lord Owen stressed that ceasefires alone would not solve the problem
and that political solutions were required.
In Paris, a defence ministry official said France was asking the US to help
in two proposed operations in Bosnia to relieve Serb pressure on Moslem
enclaves. It wanted air power and logistical support to lift the Serbian
blockade of Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia and allow a Danish armoured
column to relieve the besieged town of Srebrenica.
It was announced yesterday that Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose of
Britain would become the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia. General Rose,
currently commander of UK Land Forces, will succeed Belgium's Lt-Gen Francis
Briquemont, who has asked to be relieved at the end of this month.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Paris to strengthen its role within Nato
</HEADLINE>

France is to start sending its defence minister and chief-of-staff to Nato
meetings which have a bearing 'on the possible use of French forces or on
French interests', a senior defence official said in Paris yesterday.
This move will effectively put an end to France's boycott of Nato defence
ministers' meetings ever since the late President de Gaulle ordered Nato
headquarters out of Paris in 1966 and removed French troops from the
alliance's integrated military command.
'The French government has decided that its defence minister and
chief-of-staff can attend Nato meetings which discuss the possible use of
French forces, such as in ex-Yugoslavia or in central and eastern Europe, or
in operations involving the Western European Union,' which by the Maastricht
treaty is the intended defence arm of the European Union, according to the
official.
He predicted that French defence ministers would thus figure 'relatively
frequently' at Brussels meetings, though not necessarily at each of the
biannual meetings of the defence planning committee. France would also like
to see foreign and defence ministers of Nato countries meeting together as
they do in the WEU.
because '
Meanwhile, French defence and foreign ministry officials yesterday expressed
broad satisfaction with the Clinton administration's two main proposals for
next week's Nato summit in Brussels - the idea of giving east European
countries a 'partnership for peace' with Nato, falling short of any
commitment to outright membership, and the proposal to create a 'combined
joint task force', outside the alliance's regular structure, to plan
peace-keeping operations.
French support for the task force idea will be particularly welcome in
Washington, which designed the idea with French sensibilities in mind.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday issued a sharp protest against Lithuania's
wish to join Nato, warning this could rekindle cold war divisions and lead
to the region's 'military and political destabilisation', writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.
In a statement published a day after the former Soviet republic announced it
would try to join Nato, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said that the president was
concerned the expansion of Nato to include countries on Russia's border
would provoke 'a negative reaction' in Russia.
The spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, said Mr Yeltsin expected Nato leaders
to dispel 'an impression of ambiguity on a question which concerns both the
fate of the world and of Russia's national interests'.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Education overhaul accepted by Patten: Dearing plan wins
state backing but teachers' boycott may continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government tried to end the five-year controversy over its education
policy by accepting in full the sweeping recommendations in Sir Ron
Dearing's review of the national curriculum in England and Wales yesterday.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said there would be a cut in the
mandatory content of the national curriculum and that vocational education
courses would be offered to 14-year-olds for the first time since the second
world war.
The move, however, may not head off continued industrial action by teachers'
unions. Mr Patten's personal position also remains under threat after
continued criticism by Conservative backbenchers.
Mr Doug McAvoy, of the National Union of Teachers, the biggest teaching
union, declared that its boycott of all national curriculum tests would
continue.
However, Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers
and Lecturers, said he could see no reason why the tests should not
continue, opening a split between the unions for the first time since their
industrial action began last April.
Sir Ron's review was ordered by Mr Patten last year in response to the
boycott. He has now recommended that tests should be restricted to the 'core
subjects' of English, mathematics and science, while reducing the proportion
of teaching time that must be devoted to the government's prescribed
curriculum to about 80 per cent.
For 14-year-olds, he suggested that the ambitious compulsory curriculum of
10 academic subjects should be abandoned. Instead, pupils should study the
basic academic subjects of English, mathematics and science, with short
courses in technology and a modern language, and should be allowed to devote
the rest of their time to vocational education.
Sir Ron said he thought the measure would reduce truancy and encourage
children not interested in academic subjects to continue in school. But he
said: 'This is not to be seen as a major change for the short term. Proper
courses need to be developed by schools, and that will take time. I am
rather looking to the second half of the decade.'
The proposals were welcomed by employers' organisations, including the
Confederation of British Industry, and by all teachers' unions.
Mr Patten's acceptance of Sir Ron's proposals on testing was greeted with
relief by backbench Tory MPs.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former Conservative education minister, said: 'We are
moving back to a sensible position, and teachers will welcome that.'
Mr Alan Howarth, another Tory former education minister, welcomed the
decision to give teachers more scope to decide what they wanted to teach.
But he was concerned that the greater emphasis on vocational training would
force schoolchildren to specialise too early. 'We need to think very
carefully before we encourage people to specialise on a narrow front,' he
said.
Rightwing educationalists remained unhappy. Dr Sheila Lawlor, director of
the Thatcherite Centre for Policy Studies, attacked the proposals, saying:
'If the government's policy is to encourage choice and competition in
schools, why is it still imposing a comprehensive curriculum on them?'
The Labour party took the opportunity to focus a new attack on Mr Patten
himself, claiming that he had been forced into an embarrassing U-turn by the
Dearing report.
'John Patten is now saying things that he patently was not saying 12 months
ago, and that makes him look extremely foolish,' said Mrs Ann Taylor,
Labour's shadow education secretary. 'He cannot bring himself to admit that
there has been a mistake.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Metallgesellschaft reveals losses of almost DM2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft yesterday stunned its creditor banks with news of an
estimated loss of almost DM2bn (Pounds 773m) last year, and a request for a
massive capital injection.
'It was far, far worse than expected,' one participant said after bankers
met the new management of the crumbling metals, mining and engineering
group. 'The company is effectively in the hands of the banks.'
According to a formal statement from the group, the board proposed to raise
DM2.7bn in new capital through a DM250 a share issue to raise DM1.4bn, and
the conversion of DM1.3bn-worth of bank debt to junior convertible stock.
The board also requested DM500m in new credit lines for the parent company,
Metallgesellschaft AG. While bankers were asked to agree in principle to a
90-day debt moratorium, the company said they should decide on their
participation in the planned capital raising with 'the highest priority',
for fear of further damage to the company.
Sound, high-profile subsidiaries such as the Lurgi plant engineering
business, dependent on long-term contracts, often awarded by governments,
could be put gravely at risk by loss of international confidence.
Asked if the group's shares, condemned as 'effectively worthless' by some
bankers, were to be suspended, a spokesman said: 'I don't know, I'm not the
chairman of the stock exchange'.
In November, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, later sacked as chairman, announced a
pre-tax deficit of DM347m for the year to September 30, attributing most of
that to losses at a toolmaking subsidiary. But yesterday, Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, chairman since December 17, said when the revision of the
accounts was complete, the consolidated deficit would be around DM1.9bn,
almost all attributable to the parent, Metallgesellschaft AG.
If the worst came to the worst, speculation on the New York oil futures
market by MG Corp, a US subsidiary, which sparked the crisis, could cost
another DM1bn over the next two or three years as positions were unwound.
Apart from the equity issue, the group management also plans a sale of
assets, possibly including the Buderus heating equipment business and other
readily saleable operations, and to cut its workforce by at least 20,000.
Although a company statement said the restructuring plans had been
positively received by the 40 to 50 bankers present, some were unhappy at
the tightness of the timetable.
At the time of Mr Schimmelbusch's sacking, the group supervisory board said
it had not been kept adequately informed.
However, critics of German management controls have long complained that
supervisory boards, often dominated by large banks, are overindulgent. At
yesterday's meeting, officials representing Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank
 -both large shareholders and lenders to Metallgesellschaft - were reported
to have contributed little to the discussion.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director, and chairman
Metallgesellschaft's board of supervisors, said shortly before Christmas
that management had allowed MG Corp to run its own affairs.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Major reshuffles team after Yeo's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was forced into an unplanned government
reshuffle yesterday after Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, resigned
over an extramarital affair.
Mr Yeo's job as one of three deputies to Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, went to Mr Robert Atkins. Mr Atkins moves sideways from the
minister of state's job in the Northern Ireland office.
He will be replaced by Mr Michael Ancram, the junior Northern Ireland
minister, who has co-ordinated talks between the government and Ulster's
non-violent political parties.
Downing Street said Mr Ancram would retain responsibility for the talks to
avoid a hiatus in the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Tim Smith, the MP
for Beaconsfield, will take over Mr Ancram's less sensitive responsibilities
for economic policy.
Mr Yeo's resignation was announced less than 24 hours after he declared that
he would not be driven out of office by media attacks on his behaviour.
He changed his mind after the executive of his South Suffolk constituency
association formally criticised his affair with a Conservative councillor
who had a child by him last year.
The association stopped short of seeking Mr Yeo's resignation, but urged him
to reflect on 'widespread disappointment' expressed by local party members.
The statement echoed claims by senior Conservative backbenchers that Mr
Yeo's behaviour conflicted with the government's 'back to basics' campaign,
which emphasises traditional values.
Downing Street sought to limit the political damage by distancing Mr Major
from calls by cabinet colleagues for a reduction in the number of single
mothers.
But the affair is deeply embarrassing to Mr Major, who was aware of Mr Yeo's
relationship before it was disclosed in the media last month.
The prime minister refrained from giving open support to Mr Yeo, but his
decision not to seek the minister's resignation was criticised by some
Conservative backbenchers.
In his resignation letter, Mr Yeo said his personal life 'has never in any
way prevented me from discharging my duties as a minister'.
However, he said he believed he had no option other than to step down 'to
concentrate on uniting my constituency party organisation'. Mr Yeo said
yesterday he was 'sad' to leave the government.
In his reply, Mr Major said that Mr Yeo had been 'a most effective
minister'. The prime minister said he was 'sorry' that Mr Yeo's talents
would not be available to the government. Mr Major also said that he hoped
Mr Yeo's talents 'may be used again at a future stage', raising the prospect
that he may return to the government after a period on the back benches.
The prime minister's decision to limit the reshuffle to three ministers
confirms that a wider ministerial shake-up is likely in the summer.
Mr Atkins, a friend of Mr Major, is a former sports minister who shares the
prime minister's enthusiasm for cricket. He has previous experience of the
Environment Department, which will ease the transition.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister and leading cricketers paid tribute to commentator Brian
Johnston, who died at the age of 81. Mr Johnston, known as 'Johnners' and
the BBC's voice of cricket, recently suffered a heart attack. His
conversational commentaries for BBC Radio's Test Match Special enabled him
to establish a special rapport with his audience. John Major said his death
meant summers would not be the same again.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Government may review its use of private consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering launching a wide-ranging review of how
departments award consultancy work, which is estimated to be worth more than
Pounds 100m a year.
The Cabinet Office's efficiency unit is looking at whether private
consultants are giving taxpayers value for money, how consultants are
appointed and whether there is scope to make the system more competitive,
according to a senior official.
Whitehall departments are increasingly taking on management consultants,
merchant banks and accountants as outside advisers on big projects.
In many cases the government is the biggest customer of private
consultancies.
Senior civil servants from all government departments which use outside
consultancies, such as the Treasury and the Department of Trade and
Industry, would be involved in any review.
An investigation into the use of the private consultancies would be the
government's strongest response to date to criticism that lucrative private
contracts are often made on an ad hoc basis.
An increasing number of government departments have taken to hiring merchant
banks and accountants. The DTI for example, hired Kleinwort Benson, the UK
merchant bank, and KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, to advise it over the
future of the Post Office, while the Department for Education recently took
on Rothschild, another UK merchant bank, to look at ways of attracting
private investment.
Whitehall officials predict that the government's determination to break new
ground in developing public sector projects with private finance and to
contract many services to the private sector as part of its market testing
programme will lead to more contracts for consultancies.
'The efficiency unit is already looking at whether these consultancies offer
value for money' said a Whitehall official.
Private companies have also been used to advise government on significant
political changes, such as the reform of the National Health Service, which
has seen a large increase in the use of consultancies.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Banks pressed to provide Pounds 1.4bn to shore up Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain has pressed the country's big banks and savings banks into
opening a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.4bn) line of emergency short-term credit on the
interbank market to help shore up liquidity at Banesto, the struggling
commercial bank whose management was replaced by the authorities last week.
Spanish retail depositors have withdrawn up to Pta250bn from Banesto since
its chairman, Mr Mario Conde, and the rest of his board were dismissed by
the Bank of Spain on December 28. The move came after the central bank's
inspectors found a Pta503bn over-valuation of assets at Spain's fourth
biggest bank.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the governor of the bank, met senior executives of the
banks and savings banks in Madrid on Tuesday morning, winning agreement from
them that the banks would supply 70 per cent of the credits Banesto needs,
with the rest being supplied by the savings banks.
A representative of one savings bank described the meeting as 'tense',
reflecting unease, particularly among the savings banks, at being forced to
come to the assistance of Banesto. The commercial banks may also be asked
later this year to help recapitalise Banesto with a temporary equity
injection.
In order to ease worries among the institutions being asked to supply
short-term credit to Banesto now, the Bank of Spain has undertaken to
guarantee loans made through the credit line to Banesto, which by September
last year was Pta504bn in debt in the interbank market.
Details also emerged yesterday of an earlier attempt by JP Morgan, the US
bank which advised Banesto, to persuade the Bank of Spain that Banesto could
survive under its former management. Morgan's effort was led by Mr Roberto
Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman, who also sat on Banesto's board.
Morgan estimated the over-valuation of Banesto's assets at Pta372bn,
compared with the central bank's figure of Pta503bn.
Morgan drew up a plan late in the year to write down Pta265bn of Banesto's
Pta7,000bn assets immediately, using Pta180bn of the bank's capital reserves
and releasing a tax credit of Pta85bn.
According to the intervention document drawn up by the central bank, Morgan
also intended to help Banesto raise up to Pta230bn of fresh capital over the
following 18 months.
Measures would include issuing Pta60bn in convertible bonds, selling half of
Banesto's controlling stake in Banco Totta y Acores of Portugal and possibly
raising additional equity of up to Pta60bn.
But the document said the management had 'shown themselves to be incapable
of correcting the slow but inexorable decline in the bank's condition'. The
document argued that Morgan's plan was based on several overoptimistic
assumptions about Banesto.
At Banesto's large insurance affiliate, La Union y El Fenix, a new
management installed by the Spanish insurance watchdog last week announced
it would make a group loss of some Pta12bn in 1993. New managers said a
planned takeover of Union y Fenix by AGF of France would proceed.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fresh cash for joint Czech and
Slovak bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech and Slovak governments have injected new capital and strengthened
the balance sheet of Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka (CSOB), their
jointly-owned foreign trade bank. The move is the latest in a series
designed to improve the operational efficiency and profitability of the bank
and set it on course for privatisation.
The governments have injected Kcs4.05bn (Dollars 135m) into the foreign
trade bank of the former Czechoslovak socialist republic, and transferred
Kcs40bn of bad and doubtful debt into two new 'collection units,' to be
funded and managed by CSOB. The bank also implemented credit write-downs
which, together with the capital injection, raised its capital adequacy
ratio to 6.25 per cent at the year end. The ratio should rise to 7 per cent
by the end of 1994.
The bank, which finances over half the foreign trade of both republics, is
73 per cent-owned by the Czech government, which provided Dollars 100m of
new capital, and 26 per cent by the Slovak government, which provided the
remaining Dollars 35m. One per cent of shares are held by bank employees.
It will report an increased operating profit for 1993 before providing for
bad debts, but an overall loss for the year.
Unlike with other Czech and Slovak banks, which have been permitted to
transfer all or part of their bad debts to specially-created consolidation
banks, the two governments began to restructure CSOB in December 1992 by
assuming liability for Kcs95bn of state-related assets and Kcs74bn of
state-related liabilities.
These included domestic loans made to state enterprises under the central
planning rules, and doubtful foreign loans to former socialist states and
big arms purchasers such as Iraq.
N. M. Rothschild has been advising the bank on financial restructuring with
a view to eventual privatisation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OZ Zurich Optionen und Futures, the quoted futures and options unit of the
BZ banking group, has reported a sharp rise in 1993 profit, to some SFr80m
(Dollars 54m) from SFr17.6m in 1992.
However, it pointed out that SFr28m of the increase arose from the
liquidation of provisions that would no longer be needed because it planned
to establish a holding structure this year.
OZ said shareholders' equity stood at SFr300 per share at the end of the
year. The directors would propose repaying SFr30m or SFr50 per share of
equity at the AGM on January 22.
Banca del Gottardo, the Swiss bank in which Japan's Sumitomo Bank holds a 55
per cent controlling interest, has reported a 50 per cent jump in parent
bank net income in 1993, to SFr63m.
The directors said the downward movement of interest rates contributed to
the 'very positive results,' as did opportunities in volatile financial
markets. They have proposed raising the dividend from SFr20 per share and
participation certificate to SFr25.
Gottardo said its cash flow jumped 21 per cent to SFr151.9m.

FT  05 JAN 94 / India rejects Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India yesterday rejected Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue to a
change in New Delhi's stand on the Kashmir issue and cautioned Pakistan that
this might cause a delay in settling other bilateral problems such as the
Siachen glacier, the demarcation of a maritime boundary in the Sir Creek
area, nuclear non-proliferation, and stabilisation along the line of control
between the two countries, Shiraz Sidvha reports from New Delhi.
Mr JN Dixit, India's foreign secretary, told a press conference yesterday
that a stalemate on the Kashmir issue had not been broken during talks with
Pakistani officials which concluded in Islamabad on Monday.
Indo-Pakistan relations could not be viewed through the prism of the Kashmir
issue alone, he said, and India was prepared to continue bilateral
discussions as long as no pre-conditions were set. Mr Dixit said India had
earlier planned to send proposals within two weeks which could result in the
resolution of almost all outstanding issues between the two countries. These
might be delayed, with Islamabad virtually rejecting India's proposal to
hold the next round of foreign secretary-level talks in four months.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Dispute over Kashmir drags on: Farhan Bokhari charts the
impasse between India and Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India and Pakistan have made little progress towards resolving their
protracted and often fractious dispute over Kashmir during high-level talks
which concluded earlier this week.
Mr Sheharyar Khan, the Pakistani foreign secretary, and Mr JN Dixit, his
Indian counterpart, met in Islamabad at the weekend after months of prodding
and encouragement from western governments, including the Clinton
administration.
Their intention was to restart their dialogue which was broken off 18 months
ago.
The meeting was the seventh of its kind since the process of secretary-level
talks began over three years ago.
However, it was also the most important meeting since it was the first time
that India agreed formally to discuss the Kashmir dispute, despite their
long-standing argument that the Kashmir issue was a domestic matter.
The new approach from both sides not only reflects the changing realities in
the region but also the mood of an international community, increasingly
concerned over the possibility of an intense and possibly nuclear conflict
between the two south Asian countries.
Battle-ready troops remain on guard along the disputed Kashmir border, the
scene of many protests and incidents during the 46-year conflict between the
two countries.
Indian officials claim that they could continue the military operation for
years without facing pressure to retreat.
However, a four-year continuing insurgency of Moslem fighters in Kashmir,
where a quarter of a million troops remain deployed, has increasingly become
the source of criticism based on claims of human rights violations.
The conflict has so far claimed between 7,000 and 10,000 lives, while at
least 30,000 people are estimated to have been injured in the fighting. In
addition, at least 10,000 Kashmiris are in detention for their alleged
involvement in separatist activities.
For Pakistan, a country which devotes almost a third of its annual budget to
national defence, maintaining such a level of expenditure has become
unsustainable due to concerns from many of its leading donors.
The newly-elected government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has publicly
stated that it will not compromise the country's vital defence needs. But
privately, many officials know that equally vital is the need to reduce
expenditure if the country is ever to recover from its chronic deficits.
There has also been increasing pressure for the government to allocate more
resources to social services, health and welfare.
Despite the failure of the latest talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute, both
sides have tried to keep open the possibility of future dialogue without any
specific timeframe.
The breaking point in the talks apparently came after Pakistan said that
there could be no further progress unless key Kashmiri leaders who have been
imprisoned are released and allowed free access to the international media
and diplomats.
Furthermore, Pakistan also demanded an easing of repression in Kashmir
before any further discussions take place.
For his part, Mr Dixit expressed confidence that the fact the two countries
decided to discuss the issue was progress. 'It is not necessary that when
you are dealing with a complex problem that accomplishments should emerge
immediately. It takes time.'
In response, Mr Khan said: 'The people of Kashmir should be allowed to
breathe and be allowed to put across their point of view.'
He reiterated Pakistan's longstanding demand that the only way to resolve
the dispute is through a plebiscite which would allow the people of Kashmir
to decide if they want to remain within India or rejoin Pakistan.
Despite the break-off without a timetable for the resumption of talks,
officials and western diplomats are hopeful that the meeting may prove to be
a turning point in the dialogue. 'The biggest difference is that there are
fresh compulsions on both sides to try to do something,' said one senior
Pakistani official.
Although there are grounds for optimism, there are equally good reasons to
argue against the possibility of substantive progress.
Nationalists in both countries are almost certain to resist their
governments if there are any signs of a compromise. 'Progress will only come
if our leaders say to hell with politics and getting re-elected. We should
settle this dispute because that would be the most important contribution to
peace,' one Pakistani official said.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asian stock markets kept up their record-setting pace yesterday as Japanese
fund managers, on holiday on Monday, returned to compete with their US
counterparts in fuelling the advance.
Records were set in nine centres. Bangkok, closed on Monday, led with a 4.2
per cent rise as it caught up with the rest of the region in near-record
turnover.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose more than 500 points at one stage before
profit-taking trimmed the advance, leaving the index 114.60 higher at
12,201.09.
Highs were also seen in Singapore, Manila, Australia, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur,
Bombay and Karachi, which scored its largest ever one-day rise. Tokyo,
however, made an uncertain start to its trading year, and investors are
expected to remain wary until the government passes its political reform
bill and announces details of a new fiscal package at the end of this month.
The Nikkei average fell 47.50 to 17,369.74.
In Europe, Nordic markets surged with Helsinki adding 4.1 per cent to a
record high as falling interest rates persuaded investors to switch from
bonds to stocks.
Norway jumped 2.1 per cent to a new peak, and records were also set on the
Stockholm and Copenhagen stock markets.
In London the money supply figures, measured by M0, the most narrow
definition of the money supply, rose by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent
in the year to December.
The news did little to help sentiment in the UK government bond market,
where long gilt prices fell by 1 1/4 points. Analysts felt the apparent
buoyancy of the consumer sector may have damped hopes of an early cut in UK
interest rates.
The FT-SE 100 share index, down 38 points at one stage, rallied in the
afternoon to close 9.9 points lower at 3,408.5.

FT  05 JAN 94 / MCI plans Dollars 2bn assault on US local phone markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the innovative US long-distance telephone company,
yesterday announced a Dollars 2bn initiative to compete with America's Baby
Bell local phone companies.
It also unveiled an intensified programme of investment in its own
information 'super-highway', a network for transmitting huge amounts of data
at high speed. The company said that it and various 'associated partners'
were expected to invest more than Dollars 20bn over the next six years to
deliver new long-distance and local communications to business, homes and
research institutions, under a new brand name: networkMCI.
MCI played the central role in forcing competition into the US long-distance
telephone market in the 1970s and 1980s. Until recently Baby Bells have
enjoyed virtual monopolies. Yesterday's announcement was the clearest
indication so far of MCI's long-range strategy in America's information
revolution, which is blurring the boundaries between the telecommunications,
computer and television industries - as well as the regulatory and legal
divisions between long-distance and local telephone companies.
Even so, the company left uncertain many important details of its plan -
including the names of its potential partners and just how much they would
contribute to the Dollars 20bn expenditure figure. Mr Bert Roberts, the
chairman, noted that last summer's global alliance with British
Telecommunications, which is investing Dollars 4.3bn in MCI in return for a
20 per cent stake in the company, had given MCI added flexibility in
financing its capital spending programme. The most dramatic element of MCI's
strategy is its plan to compete against the local telephone companies, as
one of a number of so-called Competitive Access Providers (CAPs), which
operate efficient fibre optic networks in big cities, creaming off
particularly profitable business customers by offering cheaper rates for
bulk traffic.
MCI already owns a subsidiary, acquired in 1990 from Western Union, which
has telecommunications access to over 2,000 office buildings in US cities.
It is to give this business - renamed MCI Metro - a big boost by investing
Dollars 2bn in fibre optic cable rings and modern traffic switching
facilities, initially in 20 leading metropolitan areas. By sharply
increasing its presence in the local market, MCI will reduce the huge
'access fees' it must pay local telephone companies to carry long-distance
traffic the last few miles to customers.
MCI also announced it had now deployed a key ingredient of modern
communications networks - high-speed SONET transmission technology - in half
its system, substantially more than its long distance rivals.

FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bucked the poor market trend in London,
moving sharply ahead after stating that the 23 leading banks of its creditor
syndicate had approved its funding plans. Market watchers said the agreement
clears the way for a likely rights issue within the next few months.
The shares rose 20 to 630p in active trade of 2.7m, and were heavily traded
in Paris where the group is also listed.
Sentiment was further boosted by confirmation of its tariff for users when
it opens in May, and analysts suggested that novelty value was likely to
attract users in spite of the rather expensive tariffs.
Yesterday's announcement followed the recent agreement by the French and
British governments to extend the Channel tunnel concession for an extra 10
years.
Hotel, racing and property group Ladbroke was the best performing FT-SE 100
stock as a variety of pundits and brokers tipped it as a likely outperformer
in 1994. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant banker, has included it in its top
10 buys of the year.
Analyst Mr Paul Slattery said: 'The on-going managerial changes at Ladbroke
are leading to improved disclosure and empathy with investor concerns, while
the trading recovery will boost earnings performance in 1994. We expect the
share price to outperform strongly as the year progresses.'
The shares have underperformed the market by 28 per cent, 51 per cent and 58
per cent over the past 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Yesterday the
stock jumped 12 1/2 to 175p, with 11m shares traded.
BT was an easier exception in a strong telecoms sector as Hoare Govett
underlined market sentiment that the stock was looking overbought. Hoare
said worries over new competition, Oftel-induced price cuts and the threat
of a more aggressive pricing from Mercury, hung over BT. The shares later
rallied to close just a penny off at 471 1/2 p.
News of a wide-ranging review of UK cross-media ownership once again led to
renewed bid speculation for several television stocks.
Those said to be bid targets include Anglia TV, which put on 5 at 433p, and
HTV, 4 up at 113p. Yorkshire, currently in merger talks with bid target LWT,
jumped 18 to 174p. LWT was unchanged at 606p.
Bargain hunters were active in the much-maligned food manufacturing sector.
Many stocks benefited from 1994 tipping in the media. Among them,
Cadbury-Schweppes rose 9 to 518p, Unigate 3 to 369p, Tate &amp; Lyle 9 to 409p
and Bensons Crisps 11 to 67p.
Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries shed 3 to 551p after
James Capel was said to have trimmed its profits forecast.
News that the chief executive of international conglomerate BTR had sold
part of his holding in the group at 374p a share brought a retreat of 15 to
358p in the stock.
The recovery in the gold price boosted mining group RTZ late in the session.
The shares jumped 32 to 844p.
Worries that the Channel tunnel will prove strong competition for the ferry
services left P&amp;O down 8 at 638p.
Volume in computer maintenance company Wakebourne jumped to 404m shares,
making it by far the day's most actively traded stock, after the placing of
the rump of last month's rights issue which received a 68 per cent take-up.
The shares rose 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 p.
Seasonal support lifted Fairline Boats 30 to 350p.
The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices shown below are the first to use the
revised classification of industry sectors. A table explaining the new
system can be found on the UK Company News pages.
The FT's share price listings, the London Share Service, have also been
adjusted to reflect the new classification. A complete alphabetical guide to
where companies fall in the new classification was published in yesterday's
FT.

FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile telephone operator Vodafone recorded its biggest monthly increase in
new connections in December and the shares responded in kind, jumping 13 to
a record 607p.
The company said 52,500 new subscribers had signed up last month, taking the
total number to above 1m for the first time. Analysts had been expecting a
figure of around 40,000. Although much of the increase was put down to
Christmas buying in the consumer market, there were also indications that
demand from business users - which pay higher tariffs - had also been
strong.
One telecoms analyst said that the December connections, which were up 75
per cent from November's, would focus the market's profit forecasts on to
1996, with some said to be pencilling in a figure of Pounds 450m to Pounds
460m. The group recently reported interim profits of Pounds 174.5m for the
six months to September 30.
Vodafone supporters said the more impressive 68,500 December connection
figure reported by Cellnet, rival mobile phone operator owned by Securicor
and BT, had been boosted by a generous sales package. Smith New Court,
reiterating its strong buy stance on Vodafone, said the new connection
figures showed the mobile telecoms market still had plenty of growth
potential.

FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Focus on stores prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first whispers of Christmas high street sales figures seeped into the
stock market yesterday, with retailers in general said to have seen some
useful increases. In spite of a slow early December, the week before
Christmas seems to have seen shoppers flocking back. However, the picture is
still patchy.
Clothes sales appear to have been strong, as were jewellery and other
giftware. But some computer games were dull, although small electrical
appliances were said to be in demand. Analysts said the full picture would
become clearer over the next 10 days as some of the leading stores groups
put out trading statements.
However, while sales may be stronger, analysts said the key to improved
revenues will be those companies which held margins. Next is one which has
been attracting the most bullish comments in this respect, its shares adding
6 1/2 at 238p yesterday. Austin Reed gained 9 at 195p. Jeweller Signet
Group, which will make a sales statement next week, moved up 2 1/4 to 26 1/4
p.
Talk of strong book sales lifted WH Smith 'A' 7 1/2 to 517 1/2 p, while
Pentos firmed 2 to 27. Boots, which will issue a report by the end of this
week, slipped 5 to 593p.

FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets continued to exert a powerful influence over the
underlying stock market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
But stock index futures were themselves highly volatile as locals, or
independent traders, tried to anticipate the expected bout of profit-taking
in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index. There was also continued
nervousness over expiry on over the counter programmes.
The March futures contract ignored a firm opening in equities and fell
sharply as the locals sold it down relentlessly until it stood at a small
discount against the index itself - fair value now stands at around 13
points. Selling pressure also came from the US, where investors feared that
interest rates may rise.
In what has become a rare response, London securities firms opened
'negative' basket programmes, buying the future and selling the blue chip
stocks. At midsession, however, futures selling died away and the contract
rallied strongly, closing at 3,422, almost in line with fair value. Trading
volume was high at just above 13,000 contracts.
Business in traded options was also strong, at 40,740 contracts, with the
FT-SE 100 option recording 18,658; the half-session on New Year's Eve saw
5,992 Footsie contracts traded. The Euro FT-SE option had 3,571 lots dealt.
Individual contracts were headed by Glaxo, with 2,355 traded as the market
responded to the news on US sales rulings.
Tomkins, Ladbroke and Trafalgar House, favoured in the new year
recommend-ations of several broking houses, had 1,488, 1,129 and 1.016
contracts transacted respectively.

FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally reduces losses in nervous
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first trading session of 1994 saw a highly volatile performance from UK
equities, with an equally erratic trend in stock index futures calling the
tune for the stock market. The FT-SE 100 Index was down 38 points at the
day's low but rallied strongly, reducing its fall by two-thirds before the
close. At its final reading of 3,408.5, the index was 9.9 off on the day,
having touched extremes of 3,427.9 and 3,380.4 earlier.
Traders agreed that yesterday's session had been difficult to measure since
both market indices and volume statistics had been distorted by special
factors. Senior executives at many market firms, and institutions, had
returned from the Christmas break to face unexpectedly high trading levels
in the marketplace. Morning meetings were often extended and there were
lengthy telephone conferences with fund management clients. 'A slightly
unreal day,' cautioned one leading dealer.
Equities opened higher on the back of the further strength shown by
continental European markets while London was closed on Monday. But, after
climbing 9.5 in Footsie terms, the market was hit hard when the March
contract on the Footsie opened sharply down and fell to a small discount
against cash. US selling was blamed for the fall in futures contracts in
both gilts and equities.
Worries that interest rates may be about to turn higher in the US were
balanced against hopes that the Bundesbank will this week lead rates lower
in Europe.
Pressure on equities was increased by hints that a UK institution with heavy
pension fund exposure wanted to put Pounds 400m into the new index-linked
tap stocks, and was funding the move by selling shares.
But selling of both futures and shares dried up at midsession and a cautious
rally turned distinctly better towards the close when London was taking heed
of firmness on Wall Street and in some European markets. The Footsie
regained the 3,400 mark towards the end of a session which had seen the
index move through a range of nearly 48 points.
However, traders were far from convinced that the rally was genuine. Seaq
volume totalled 1.0664bn shares, well at the higher end of daily averages.
But around 48 per cent of this total came from the placing of the rump of a
rights issue from Wakebourne, one of the stock market's 'penny stocks'.
Buttressed by the Wakebourne placing, trading in non-Footsie stocks made up
an astonishing 75 per cent or so of the day's Seaq total, which was
substantially above average. In addition, basket trading from the futures
market indicated an even lower proportion of genuine investment activity in
the blue chip Footsie stocks.
The high level of interest among the second line issues, however, enabled
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to move against the trend of the blue chips, adding
8.1 at 3,799.4.
Against this slightly surrealistic backcloth, the stock market made little
significant response to the 1 per cent rise in domestic M0 money supply in
December. Renewed vigour in gold bullion prices was reflected in demand for
RTZ shares.
There was the expected crop of shares moving higher in response to the round
of broker recommendations for the new year. But across the wider range of
market forecasts, there was some caution over the timing for the general
advance in equities predicted for 1994.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises sharply as bond
prices rebound

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks finished with solid gains yesterday after a rally in the bond
market was followed by a burst of program buying in the session's final
hour, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 27.30 ahead at 3,783.90,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.45 higher at
466.89. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.12 to
477.36 and the Nasdaq composite was 3.52 stronger at 774.28.
Volume on the New York SE was heavy, with 326.6m shares traded. Advancing
issues led declines by 1,208 to 914.
With no first-tier economic reports due out, stocks had some leeway ahead of
Friday's important data on December employment. The Labor Department's
report, if it comes in at the high end of expectations, could trigger a
fresh round of selling in the fixed-income markets. Stocks would be likely
to suffer as a result.
Yesterday, however, inflationary fears were eased a bit by weaker than
expected car sales data for late-December and a somewhat disappointing
Johnson Redbook report on retail sales. In response, the benchmark 30-year
bond climbed  3/4 to 98 1/2 in a late afternoon rally. After a shaky start,
equities followed suit and closed well ahead in a late flurry of buying by
institutions reinvesting funds raised from stocks sales at the year-end.
Among the blue chips, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 91,
Eastman Kodak Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 and Walt Disney Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 44, but Allied Signal fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/4 .
Automobile issues were buoyant in spite of data showing sales running at an
annual rate of about 7m units in the last 10 days of the year, against 7.4m
in the previous period. Chrysler led the Big Three with a Dollars 2 3/4 gain
to Dollars 56. General Motors was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56 1/2 and
Ford Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 7/8 .
Some retailing shares were strong despite the industry's modest 8.5 per cent
year-on-year increase in December sales. Sears Roebuck snapped back from a
big loss registered in the previous session, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
53 3/8 . JC Penney put on Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 53.
Del Webb, a Phoenix-based property developer, was marked up Dollars 1 to
Dollars 16 3/4 on a year-end surge in orders.
On the Nasdaq, technology stocks bounced back from Monday's bout of
profit-taking. Apple Computer advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 and
Intel Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/4 .
MCI Communications shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 on the announcement
that the company and its partners would invest more than Dollars 20bn to
create a transcontinental information superhighway.
Canada
The Toronto market started the new year strongly, hitting a record high for
the third time in the past four sessions. Gold stocks led the surge, gaining
6.31 per cent. The bullion price has risen about USDollars 3 an ounce in the
past two days.
The TSE 300 index closed at 4,368.5, up 47.1, while rises outscored declines
by 477 to 321 after volume of 63.05m shares.

The golds index closed 177 stronger at 2,331, industrials rose 121 to 5,717
and the overall index climbed 179 to a closing peak of 5,088.
Zimbabwean stocks soared to new highs following Saturday's 17 per cent
devaluation of the local dollar and renewed foreign investor interest. The

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as nine
records are set in region
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage selling of Nikkei 225 futures depressed the Nikkei average on the
first trading day of 1994, but traders still looked for a stronger year for
the Tokyo stock market as the Topix index of all first section stocks closed
higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished the half-day session down 47.50 at 17,369.74 after a low
of 17,242.32 and a high of 17,424.84. The Topix index was finally 6.66 up at
1,445.97 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.92 firmer at
1,197.45.
Volume totalled 110m shares, against 121m during the half-day session last
Thursday. Rises led falls by 529 to 357, with 179 issues unchanged.
A decline in Chicago futures on Monday dragged down the Osaka market,
prompting arbitrage unwinding. However, a weakening of the yen triggered
buying of export-oriented high-technology stocks.
The yen closed at Y113.27 against the dollar, deteriorating from the Y113
level for the first time since April 16 on favourable US economic figures.
Mr Keith Donaldson, a strategist at Salomon Brothers, said the sharp fall in
the yen was good news for companies since it could improve the outlook for
earnings.
However, for the short term, most analysts expect share prices to remain in
a narrow band until the political reform bill is passed through parliament,
and details of a new fiscal package are announced at the end of this month.
Electronics companies gained ground on the weaker yen. Sony rose Y110 to
Y5,620 and NEC advanced Y19 to Y874. Automakers were also stronger, with
Toyota Motor up Y30 to Y1,810 and Honda Motor adding Y50 at Y1,570.
Reports that Suzuki Motor is planning to share common car parts with
Daihatsu Motor pushed the former forward Y60 to Y1,110.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y6,000 to Y750,000. Reports over the
weekend that the company may spin off one of its business divisions
supported investor interest. KDD, the international telecoms group, put on
Y300 at Y11,300.
A rise in gold prices supported mining stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining
advanced Y49 to Y919 and Dowa Mining gained Y17 at Y485.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 49.39 to 19,271.11 in volume of 7.1m shares.
Roundup
The region remained in record breaking form, with new highs set in nine
centres, including Bangkok. Taiwan and New Zealand were closed.
HONG KONG remained at a peak in heavy turnover, with foreign and local
investors encouraged by further strength in the property market, although a
sharp early advance stalled in the face of afternoon profit-taking. The Hang
Seng index ended 114.60, or 0.9 per cent, higher at 12,201.09, well below
the intra-day high of 12,599.23.
SINGAPORE shrugged off strong profit-taking and the Straits Times Industrial
index added 30.37 at a new record closing high of 2,471.90, having peaked at
2,482.32.
MANILA remained at a peak, taking its lead from the record setting
performance of Philippine National Bank. The composite index rose 36.86, or
1.1 per cent, to 3,308.37. A 50-peso rise to 720 pesos by PNB was attributed
to a pick-up in demand by foreign investors.
AUSTRALIA saw profit-taking among some leading shares balanced by strong
support for the resource sector, which left the All Ordinaries index 0.7
firmer at another six-year peak of 2,174.3.
JAKARTA closed higher in an upbeat mood, driven mainly by local investors.
The official index rose 10.29 to 599.94 as the market awaited the budget for
fiscal 1994-95 due tomorrow.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded in the afternoon as investors returned to the market
and the composite index climbed 24.50 to a peak 1,313.35.
KARACHI registered a record daily advance to close at a new high on heavy
institutional buying and opening of fresh accounts by investors. The KSE-100
index rose 75.84, or 3.5 per cent, to 2,253.95.
BOMBAY registered sharp gains but blue chips fell below the day's best on
profit-taking towards the end. The BSE 30-share index closed 14.06 ahead at
a peak 3,479.92, having touched the 3,542 mark at midsession.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Consolidation rules in
Frankfurt, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction stocks starred in Frankfurt and Paris, writes Our Markets
Staff.
In both, there were signs that analysts were exploring stocks and sectors
which had lagged behind the general advance in 1993.
PARIS consolidated, the the CAC-40 index closing 16.22 lower at 2274.34.
Turnover rose from FFr3.26bn to FFr4.5bn.
Eurotunnel extended its recent strength, gaining FFr1.10 to FFr55.50.
Construction stocks were led higher by Bouygues, up FFr22 to FFr714 and
expected to gain this year from the government's building-related growth
initiatives.
Financials fell, afraid that Monday's bank rate cuts would slim lending
margins, and insurers were down on worries about the impact of recent storms
in France. Improving underperformers included Accor, up another FFr5 at
FFr627, and LVMH, FFr31 better at FFr3,829.
FRANKFURT mixed a continued penchant for construction stocks with general
profit-taking. The Dax index fell 14.40 to 2,253.58 on the session and,
Ibis-indicated, by 3.73 more to 2,249.85 in the post bourse.
In construction stocks, recommended after they lagged behind the market last
year, Hochtief rose another DM33 to DM1,233 and Holzmann by DM30 to DM1,075.
Elswhere, Metallgesellschaft was nervous ahead of today's meeting with its
banks, falling DM11.50 to DM267.50 on the session, and another DM7.50 to
DM260 in the afternoon.
MADRID saw real fear in the banking sector in the wake of the Bank of
Spain's intervention in Banesto. Banco Central Hispano was badly shaken by
rumours that it would pass its final dividend and although it said it
expected pay an unchanged dividend,the shares fell Pta180 to Pta3,200.
The general index fell 2.55 to 324.61. Volume in BCH was heavy, with 611,000
shares traded. With its parent still suspended, Banesto's industrial holding
company, Corporacion Banesto, lost Pta150 to Pta1,750.
ZURICH consolidated, but a 3.6 rise to 2,999.8 was sufficient to keep the
SMI index at a record high.
Cyclicals, strong on Monday, ended mostly lower. Brown Boveri eased SFr2 to
SFr1,114 and Alusuisse registered fell SFr8 to SFr656. However, Sulzer
registered added SFr24 to SFr880.
Among insurers, Zurich registered rose SFr15 to SFr1,548.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed, holding up in spite of weaker overseas markets and
bonds. The AEX, which surged 6.1 on Monday, closed up 0.52 at a record
420.89.
Philips topped the volume charts after breaking chart resistance at Fl 40.00
on Monday, posting a 20 cent gain to Fl 41.50.
Elsevier added Fl 3.20 to Fl 188.20 after a US magazine said that Paramount,
in the past, had tried to buy a stake in the publisher. Hoogovens continued
to rise in response to a cautiously positive new year address by its
chairman, picking up Fl 1.60 to Fl 51.90.
MILAN was easier on profit-taking after the last month's gains amid some
uncertainty over the outcome of a parliamentary confidence vote on January
12. The Comit index fell 4.19 to 620.32, the mood soured by political
in-fighting over the date of the general election.
Blue chips were broadly lower, with trading again dominated by Montedison in
turnover of 32m shares, three times as high as for any other stock.
The price dipped L24 to L930 after the cumulative rise of more than 25 per
cent over the last two weeks.
Nordic bourses had a buoyant day, with particular strong performances from
HELSINKI and OSLO, up by 4.1 and 2.1 per cent respectively. Finnish equities
were lifted by funds previously invested in fixed interest instruments,
while Norwegian stocks were lifted by higher North Sea oil prices, and a
stronger dollar.
VIENNA detached from Frankfurt for the day and hit its highest point since
June, 1991, the ATX index climbing 13.14 to 1,162.7.
ISTANBUL reached its fourth consecutive record high, the composite index
ending provisionally at 22,394, up 605.9 or 2.8 per cent from Monday, its
previous all-time high, following tax changes in the money market.
WARSAW slowed down, but the WIG index rose 300, or 2.3 per cent to 13,345 on
buying from small investors. Traders said that the very active turnover of
2,100bn zlotys might be a sign that big investors were stepping up selling.
LISBON burst into action after a quiet period, the BTA index jumping by
65.4, or 2.5 per cent to 2,685.3. The ship repairer, Lisnave, soared by
Es85, or 6.7 per cent to Es1,265 after an announcement in the bourse's
official bulletin said that its main shareholder, Mr Jose Manuel de Mello,
would buy up any shares left over from an Es6bn rights issue.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok's final quarter leaves
observers cautious - The burgeoning Thai market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The explosion in the Bangkok stock market's fourth quarter continued over
the Christmas and new year holidays, with the Stock Exchange of Thailand
index surging through record highs for seven consecutive sessions to
1,753.73, up 70.88 or 4.21 per cent yesterday.
This has been a far cry from the mid-summer doldrums, when the index hovered
weakly above the 800 level. Its final flourish incorporated the inevitable
year-end window dressing, but most brokers seem to think that the weight of
money available to the market is sufficient to carry equities past any minor
short-term corrections.
However, some market watchers are becoming uncomfortable. Thai stocks have
rocketed by more than 80 per cent since the beginning of October, following
the sudden interest which North American fund managers took in the region.
New issues, notably in telecommunications, are improving the market's tone,
but it remains relatively immature with a limited ability to absorb large
amounts of cash.
Investors have put behind them last spring's corporate earnings
disappointments, the new Securities and Exchange Commission's various
attacks on share price rampers early last year, and mild unease at the
traditional shenanigans in parliament.
It is true that, for investors jaded with economic performance or the lack
of it in western countries, Thai growth in 1993 and 1994 approaching eight
per cent is reassuring. However, if you anticipate earnings of 12-16 per
cent for the rest of the decade than, by some estimates, Thai shares deserve
to trade on a price-earnings ratio of 16-22 times. The market has been one
or two points beyond this on 1993 earnings and stands at around 20 times
1994 earnings.
Technical indicators are signalling caution: previous runs like that of late
1993 have presaged a sharp downturn. Foreign investors will almost certainly
decide if and when the legs are to be pulled from under this market, having
pushed a net Bt15.8 billion into the market in July/September, 1993 and,
probably, at least Bt40bn (Dollars 1.57bn) in the final quarter.
However, a burgeoning mutual fund industry is beginning to bring a
stabilising influence into the market. Thailand's cash-rich middle classes
receive scant returns for their savings from the local banking cartel, but
they have become increasingly risk averse; the mutual fund industry took off
in 1993 with at least Dollars 2 billion being raised from local savers.
Mutual funds account for little more than three per cent of the market's
capitalisation, but they will grow in importance. As one examlple of the
domestic funds poised in the wings, professionals consider the implications
of the impending liberalisation that will allow the setting up of private
funds.
Total deposit bases in the local banks and finance houses amount to an
estimated Bt2,500bn. If just one per cent of that finds its way into the
stock market, that is Bt25bn of new money, roughly the same figure that
produced the striking outperformance in the final quarter of 1993.
Thai companies have been quick capitalise upon the stock market's strength,
with a flurry of Euroconvertible issues. The dearth of straight rights
issues means that - remarkably, considering the bull run - less money will
have been raised from the market than in 1992. This, of course, has also
encouraged higher share prices in the short run.
Bangkok's banking, financial and property sectors are, arguably, fully
priced by most analytical measures. Aside from the odd respected blue-chip,
like the property developer, Land and Houses, and certain special
situations, this leaves the industrial sector for current investment
consideration.
Earnings here have been poor but are expected to improve: the problem is
that so far there are only a relatively small number of companies in this
area with a free-float of a decent size.
Mr Robert Zielinski, head of research at Jardine Fleming Thanakom
Securities, reckons that the stock market is on the verge of refocusing its
attention away from financial stocks to companies serving the real economy.
'Liquidity-driven markets usually give way to earnings driven markets as the
combination of low interest rates and the wealth effect of rising share
prices lead to a pick up in demand,' he says.
'The risk premium for investing in Thai shares is higher than for more
mature markets,' concludes Mr Zielinski, 'but growth prospects are good and,
in time, funds will flow to the companies working in the real economy.'

FT  05 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Cautious start to 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's financial markets got off to a cautious start yesterday in the
first day of trading of 1994, writes Gillian Tett.
With market operators now focused on the likely impact of the meeting of the
Bundesbank council tomorrow and publication of the US non-farm payroll
figures on Friday, dealers were hesitant about taking strong positions too
early in the week.
But though trading was fairly light yesterday, the strengthening of the
dollar and sterling, and weakness of the yen and D-Mark, highlighted trends
that seem set to underpin the currency markets in the first few weeks of the
new year.
Sterling yesterday rose against most major currencies after the publication
of higher than expected M0 figures in Britain.
Provisional, seasonally adjusted M0 grew by 5.8 per cent in the year to
December, several points higher than the 5.2 per cent growth that had been
expected by the market.
The well publicised boom in retail sales over the Christmas period had
already encouraged most money market dealers to discount some rise in M0.
But the rise partly dampened speculation about the possibility of early UK
rate cuts.
Sterling rose  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.578, up from
DM2.572 the day before. It also gained slightly against the dollar,
finishing at Dollars 1.4815, up from a previous level of Dollars 1.4805.
However, although dealers expect sterling to continue to strengthen against
the D-Mark, opinions remain very mixed about the possibility of a British
rate cut. In spite of the release of strong housing figures yesterday, the
latest in a string of positive economic data, analysts point out that the
effect of tax rises in the spring could undermine the economic recovery.
Nevertheless, they point out that another factor that could trigger a rate
cut would be the further strengthening of sterling in the coming months.
'The market's perception is that the Bank of England does not want to see a
strong sterling. The feeling in the markets is that the Bank of England will
knock sterling down if it breaks through the DM2.60 level,' said Mr Avinash
Persaud of JP Morgan.
The dollar yesterday continued to maintain its bullish tone in both European
and US trading. Although profit-taking contributed to a slightly uneven
rise, it made further gains against the yen and D-Mark. In early London
trading the dollar hit a new high of DM1.7480, before ending at DM1.7400, up
from the previous day's close of DM1.7370 in European trading. The dollar
also continued to make inroads against the yen, closing at Y113.2, up from a
previous Y112.4. But in New York it finished at DM1.7355 and Y112.65.
With the outlook for the Japanese economy likely to remain gloomy, dealers
yesterday said that the yen seemed set to remain weak against the dollar in
the near future, not least because of the continuing political uncertainty
in Japan.
However, the dollar's gains in recent days have provoked differing
predictions about the sustainability of the rise.
Mr Julian Callow, currency economist with Kleinwort Benson, predicts that
the dollar is now 'on its way up' against both the D-Mark and the yen, and
believes it could hit DM1.80 and Y115 in the near term.
Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, however, thinks that Monday's
strong dollar push is unlikely to be sustained. 'How much more of a growth
story can you build into the US?', she wonders, pointing out that the
performance of the dollar could be sharply affected by the publication of
the non-farm payroll figures on Friday.
One point of consensus, though, across the market, is that the D-Mark will
remain weak against most major currencies. The publication of West German
industrial production figures showing a sharper than expected fall of 2.1
per cent in November pushed the D-Mark down yesterday, and fuelled
speculation about the likelihood of another rate cut soon.
Although dealers remain uncertain that this will occur when the Bundesbank
council meets tomorrow, they point out that a rate reduction is widely
expected by the end of this month. Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at
Sumitomo bank, yesterday said: 'The market particularly feels that the
Bundesbank will cut rates either on Thursday or on the 20th.' Meanwhile, a
comment from the Swedish central bank governor indicating that further rate
cuts were unlikely in Sweden helped to push the Swedish kronor up
significantly against the D-Mark. It ended at DM0.2106, up from a previous
day's close of DM0.2079.
The Central Bank of Portugal yesterday followed the downward trend in
European interest rates by shaving  1/8 percentage point off its money
market intervention rate, offering eight-day certificates at 9.875 per cent
to absorb liquidity and offering to inject eight-day funds at 10.875 per
cent.
Dealers pointed out that the move was widely expected, given the steady
performance of the escudo in recent weeks.
The Bulgarian lev slid at noon to a record low of 34.80 to the dollar on a
nervy local forex market, dealers said.
They could not explain whether the new turmoil was pure speculation or a
result of real dollar demand, but several banks and financial houses bid for
dollars without bargaining. However, it later partially recovered.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: FT broadens gold mine index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times is replacing the gold mines index, which is based on the
performance of South African companies only, with one enlarged to include
gold producers from other parts of the world.
Regional indices covering three geographic areas will be published at the
same time.
The accompanying chart shows the new indices' values and illustrates their
high leverage to the price of the precious metal. It also highlights
differences in the performances of the regional indices. The 1993 year-end
gold price of Dollars 391 a troy ounce (up by 17 per cent compared with 31
December 1992) translated into a jump of more than 100 per cent for the new
gold mines index over the same 12 months.
Gold mining companies are included in the index if they:
Have sustainable, attributable gold production of at least 300,000 ounces a
year;
Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from mined gold sales;
Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing
public.
These conditions mean that there will be no set number of constituents and
the eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year.
The present 34 constituents account for about 53 per cent of western world
output, or about 31m ounces. Australasia is represented by Dominion Mining;
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Highlands Gold; Homestake Gold Australia;
Newcrest; Placer Pacific; Plutonic Resources and Poseidon Gold. Canadian
constituents include American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo Bay Mines;
Hemlo Gold Mines; Lac Minerals; Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome and TVX Gold.
From South Africa there is Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein; Elandsrand;
Freegold; Harmony; Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof; Randfontein;
Southvaal; Vaal Reefs; Western Areas; Western Deep Levels; and Winkelhaak.
US mines in the new index include Battle Mountain Gold; Homestake Mining;
and Newmont Gold.
The index reflects the sum of the market capitalisations of the component
companies, denominated in US dollars and based at 1,000 on December 31,
1992, when the gold price was Dollars 333 an ounce. On December 31 last year
the gold price was Dollars 390.75 and the index was 2,232.1. It has been
calculated back to December 1991, so a two-year history is available.
Calculations follow the close of business on the New York and Toronto stock
exchanges.
Indicative index values will be published weekly until the end of this month
and then the FT will publish daily figures, including yield, highs/lows and,
on Mondays only, market capitalisations.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia faces Dollars 1.5bn US
grain credits bill in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia must keep up to date on payments falling due this year against
US-backed grain loans to remain eligible to receive new US farm credits, a
senior US official said yesterday.
The payments, against Dollars 1.5bn owed to private banks but guaranteed by
the US Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation, start
falling due this week and extend through the year.
Mr Chris Goldthwait, the USDA's general sales manager, said yesterday that
so long as Russia remained current on its existing loan repayments it was
technically eligible to receive new credits. However, the Russians have
appeared to be cautious about increasing their debt for food purchases. 'The
Russians have not requested further credit guarantees,' Mr Goldthwait said.
'In recent discussions, they have indicated that they would rather make
their purchases with cash.'
Russia spent much of 1993 in default on its US grain loans but became
current at the end of the year through a series of payments arranged as part
of the Paris Club's rescheduling of the country's overall foreign debt. A
final Dollars 147.4m payment was made to the USDA last week. Russia's total
debt to the USDA, including the Dollars 1.5bn due in 1994, is about Dollars
3.5bn.
Grain traders hopes that President Clinton will offer a combination of farm
credits and aid when he meets President Boris Yeltsin later this month are
waning.
Wheat futures for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade jumped more
than 8 cents a 60lb bushel yesterday on news that China, long absent from
the US market, had bid for 1.1m tonnes of US soft red winter wheat under the
Export Enhancement Programme. The wheat would be delivered to China during
January and February.
Traders said that China's bid - Dollars 88.50 a tonne - would require a
subsidy of as much as Dollars 60 a tonne at current prices. The results of
the USDA tender are expected today.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers Viewpoint): Gatt deal
adds twist to beef hormone plot - Health-based barriers to trade must in
future be justified by scientific evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In some farming circles, last month's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
settlement has been presented as the answer to all the world's food
problems. Like ministers of fundamentalist religions, enthusiasts regarded
the prospect of accord between Gatt-member nations as a shining star for all
to follow. Only reject the sin of subsidies and throw out protectionism,
they seemed to say, and everything will come right. The purity of market
forces will take over and all will be well.
Cynic that I am, I have never held that simplistic view. For while I accept
that a Gatt deal was necessary and that some sectors of industry  - perhaps
even farming industry - will benefit, others will suffer irreparable damage
as relative price stability disappears and is replaced by market volatility.
That situation may even be exacerbated by the fact that Gatt-member
governments have not decided to deregulate completely but will still keep
their fingers in the regulatory pie - albeit at a much reduced level - even
after the six-year transitional period starting in 1995.
The other main reason I am sceptical that the Gatt accord will bring peace
and light to all is that trade disputes between nations are not confined to
production subsidies and export refunds. They are also concerned with
matters that are even more difficult to resolve. When it comes to food, this
includes such things as the perceived safety of goods to be traded between
one country and another.
Moreover, in the week that the Gatt agreement was signed in Europe, I was
visiting farms in the US and immediately came across an example of what may
prove to be an insoluble problem.
I was on a specialist beef-finishing farm in Colorado. In common with many
such operators in the US, the owner took in calves and fed them in open,
uncovered yards until they were ready for slaughter. In order to achieve
maximum growth rates and the highest possible proportion of lean meat in the
animals' carcasses he, like most American beef farmers, routinely dosed them
with synthetic growth hormones.
These come in the form of slow-release pellets, which are inserted beneath
the skin of the animal's ear. The reason for this unusual application site
is that ears have no meat value and are discarded, thereby eliminating the
risk that any hormone not absorbed into the rest of the body of the animal
could be consumed by humans in concentrated form. The farmer I visited last
month claimed that he rigorously observed food safety regulations and never
dosed his cattle with more than two pellets in their lifetime. In California
a few months previously, however, I had been told on another beef lot that
in order to produce 'best meat quality' some animals had up to four hormone
pellets during their finishing period.
A few years ago, the same hormones were in common use across the European
Union, although normal practice was to inject one pellet per animal in its
lifetime, with only the occasional farmer contemplating using two. Then,
however, the use of such products was banned amid accusations by consumer
groups that they were a health hazard. Sex change symptoms, particularly in
Italy, were alleged to have been caused by the improper use of hormones and
the European Commission decided to forbid their further use.
The commission took the action without considering evidence from its own
scientific committee and there were suggestions at the time that the ban
might have had more to do with the growing beef mountain in the European
Community, as it was then called, than with the real dangers of using
growth-promoting hormones.
Nevertheless, the products remain illegal throughout the EU - as,
incidentally, does bovine somatotropin (BST), a similar product which boosts
milk yields in dairy cows, the EU ban on which has just been extended for a
further year.
In the US, the use of BST on dairy cows has just been authorised and it may
soon be as much a part of American cattle production systems as beef
hormones.
Now, the Gatt agreement contains a section intended to limit the extent to
which human, animal or plant health measures can be used as barriers to
trade. Any measures that are invoked must in future comply with scientific
principles and be based on recognised international standards.
Colorado beef farmers took no time at all to conclude that this would enable
them to export beef to Europe. There was, they claimed, no scientific
evidence to justify a ban on the use of hormones, otherwise why did the US
allow it, and the EU ban had only been imposed to stop them exporting across
the Atlantic. I did not visit any US dairy farmers on this trip but
presumably they will have come to similar conclusions about milk and milk
products produced with the help of the BST.
A committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures will be established under
the new World Trade Organisation (the successor to Gatt) to adjudicate
disputes between member countries. If the attitudes and ambitions of
Colorado beef farmers are any guide, that committee will have its work cut
out.
Here are just a few of the questions it will need to answer. Is there or is
there not scientific evidence against beef growth hormones? If there is,
should US farmers be banned from using them? If there is not, should EU
farmers again be allowed to use them? And whichever way they decide, how do
they persuade at least one significant group of consumers, in the US or the
EU, that previous information on the safety of beef was inaccurate?
It would, I think, be naive to assume that the Gatt agreement brings
international trade disputes to an end.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican rising lifts silver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Armed conflict in Mexico, the world's biggest producer of newly-mined
silver, helped precious metals start the new year with a price surge,
traders said yesterday. Mexico produces about 19 per cent of the world's
primary silver.
Price rises, which started in New York on Monday with silver leading the
way, spilled over to trading in the Far East and London yesterday. The first
'fix' on the first trading day of the new year in London resulted in gold
going to Dollars 395 a troy ounce, its highest level for five months.
After some profit-taking, gold closed in London up Dollars 3.50 at Dollars
394.25 an ounce, silver was 12 cents an ounce ahead at Dollars 5.235 and
platinum ended the day at Dollars 398 an ounce, up Dollars 4.50.
Reuter reported from Germany that Commerzbank had suggested gold's price,
driven by technical factors, would be volatile this year, but would range
between Dollars 360 and Dollars 380. Any higher price would spark bullion
sales. However, DG Bank predicted short-term rises up to Dollars 420, which
could bring in more buyers and take gold up to Dollars 500.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Dealers take post-Christmas profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets fell broadly as traders cashed in profits
following the Christmas season rally and braced themselves for possible
adverse economic data later in the month.
In the UK, an unexpectedly large jump in the narrow M0 money supply measure
dampened expectations of further interest rate cuts and sent prices of gilts
down sharply. Money supply expanded at an annualised rate of 5.8 per cent in
December, well beyond the Treasury's 4 per cent target band, particularly
depressing the longer end of the yield curve. The nearby March gilt futures
contract fell to a low of 119.02 from the peak of 120.20 on December 29
before recovering at the close.
In Germany, bund prices eased as dealers took post-Christmas profits,
triggering some technical selling as prices fell through key support levels.
There is also some nervousness ahead of German cost-of-living data, which
may be released this week, and little expectation that recent economic data
has shown sufficient weakness to prompt a cut in the German discount rate
when the Bundesbank Council meets this Thursday.
Italian government bond prices closed modestly higher, aided by optimistic
assessments about Italian inflation for 1994. However, dealers remain
concerned about a no-confidence debate in Parliament which could delay
national elections tentatively slated for March.
The combination of yen weakness against the US dollar, Monday's sell-off in
the US treasury bond market and the prospect of new supply later this week
all helped to push Japanese government bonds lower in yesterday's half-day
trading session.
The March futures contract opened at 117.33 and fell to a low of 117.08
before closing at 117.10. This compares with the close of 117.53 on December
30, the previous half-day session.
The dollar strengthened yesterday against the yen, trading at Y113.45,
compared with Y111.845 on December 30. Adding to the market's weakness is
the expectation of an auction of about Y1,000bn of 10-year government bonds
this week. Dealers said the coupon on the new bond issue is expected to be
about 3.4 per cent.
US Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday afternoon amid signs of a modest
slowdown in the motor car and retailing sectors.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 ahead at
98 17/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.355 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/16 higher at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.266 per cent.
After a week in which the yield on longer-dated securities climbed about 15
basis points, strong futures-led buying boosted prices across the maturity
range. However, much of the activity came from traders adjusting their
positions after the big sell-off. Demand evaporated and prices fell back to
near opening levels.
The market was lifted for a second time in mid-afternoon, when the final
10-day car sales figures of 1993 proved lacklustre. The Johnson Redbook
report further eased concern over the pace of economic expansion. It showed
December retail sales down 0.4 per cent from November, and up by a
disappointing 8.5 per cent over the year-earlier period.
The focus shifts now to the Labor Department's report on non-farm payrolls
to be released on Friday. Forecasts range from an increase of 225,000 to
300,000. A figure at the high end could trigger a further bout of selling.
The French economy ministry said the Treasury would issue around FFr275bn of
OATs and FFr245bn of two and five-year notes (BTANs) in 1994, Reuter reports
from Paris. It said net OAT and BTAN issues, after scheduled redemptions,
would be about FFr300bn in 1994 against FFr332bn last year.
The treasury issued FFr244bn of OATs and FFr231bn of BTANs in 1993,
including Ecu4.2bn of bonds and notes denominated in the EU's basket
currency.
The Ecu amount, some FFr28bn worth, represented about 6 per cent of the
total, compared with the treasury's original wish to issue some 15 per cent
of new issues in Ecu.
The Balladur bond, a special offering in July convertible into privatised
shares, allowed a reduction of FFr72bn in outstanding Treasury bills.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Year starts with flurry of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international bond market kicked off the new year with a burst of
activity as issuers launched a flurry of new deals in a broad range of
currencies.
The Euroyen sector saw several new issues and dealers expect more over the
next few days. In particular, the market is awaiting the
previously-announced Y300bn deal from the Republic of Italy, which is likely
to come next week.
At Y300bn, it will be the largest yen-denominated deal outside Japan. The
bonds are expected to have a term of between seven and 10 years to take
advantage of interest in these maturities. They are likely to yield between
3.4 and 3.5 per cent, about 35 - 45 basis points over the relevant
government benchmark. Daiwa and J. P. Morgan have won the mandate.
The Japanese finance minister abolished the 'lock-up' period for Euroyen
bonds issued by sovereign borrowers with effect from January 1. As a result,
dealers expect to see greater interest by Japanese investors in Euroyen
issues.
In the past, the ministry had prohibited Euroyen bonds from entering the
country for the first 90 days of issuance. Instead, Japanese securities
houses agreed to 'warehouse' the bonds for three months before selling the
paper to Japanese investors.
The Euroyen issues announced yesterday - which included deals from the
Kingdom of Sweden and Finnish Export Kredit - were mainly targeted at
specific investors, predominantly Japanese, syndicate officials said.
The European currency sectors saw plenty of new issuance as well, with deals
denominated in D-Marks and lire. Depfa Finance announced a DM1.5bn 10-year
issue with a 6 per cent coupon, yielding 45 basis points over the 2003 bund
issue. Proceeds will be used for both public sector and mortgage financing.
Qwinzy Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based broker, said it is hoping to place
Dollars 600m of bonds issued by Republique du Congo among emerging market
investors. The zero-coupon bonds are priced at Dollars 82 and are expected
to yield between 9 and 11 per cent, according to Qwinzy, which has bought
the deal. The bond proceeds will be redeemed by royalty payments from Agip,
the Italian oil company, which has drilling rights in the republic.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Italian government bonds lead
market performance table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy topped the government bond market performance league table in
December, showing a gain of 5.3 per cent, and was the best performing market
for the whole of 1993, with a return of 31.89 per cent in local currency
terms, according to J. P. Morgan Securities.
'Italian government bonds rallied in December as local election results led
to a lessening of political uncertainty, parliament passed an austere budget
package for 1994, inflation continued to subside and further progress was
made on establishing procedures for withholding tax refunds,' says J. P.
Morgan Securities in its monthly report.
Italy was also the top-performing bond market in US dollar terms last month,
posting a gain of 4.95 per cent, although in dollar terms, the return was
only 14.04 per cent for the year.
The UK was the second-best performing government bond market in December,
with a return of 3.59 per cent in local currency terms, helped by the
better-than-expected November inflation figures and the November 30 budget
announcements.
Sweden ranked third with a gain of 2.82 per cent in local currency terms.
Many of the other European government bond markets also showed healthy
advances on the back of interest rate cuts, or expectations of lower
interest rates, and lower inflation.
Both Belgium and Denmark were able to cut official interest rates as their
respective currencies strengthened against the D-Mark.
The worst-performing bond markets in local currency terms were the US, with
a gain of just 0.43 per cent, and Australia, with a rise of 1.31 per cent.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mobil takes Dollars 250m
write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The slump in world oil prices has forced Mobil, the US energy group, to
announce a Dollars 250m charge to cover a write-down in the value of its
inventory.
However, the one-off hit is unlikely to be matched by write-downs at other
big oil groups when the industry reports its full-year results shortly.
Mobil's charge, a non-cash item which will be recorded in its results for
the fourth quarter of 1993, arises from the timing of the company's move to
last in, first out accounting (lifo) for the oil inventory of its
international operations.
The company made the switch in 1982, after the oil price surge of 1979.
Other big oil groups are all believed to have adopted lifo accounting before
1979.
As a result, the book value of Mobil's inventory is higher per barrel than
its competitors, forcing it to take a charge when oil prices fall sharply.
Mr Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, said the next reporting
season was unlikely to reveal any other large write-downs among the oil
majors, though some independent oil companies could be affected.

The Japanese government is next month expected to detail new rules allowing
companies to buy their own shares, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
A plunge in Japanese share values in 1992 prompted the government to
consider changes in the commercial code to reduce the extra supply of shares
on the Tokyo market.
The Tokyo stock market saw the number of shares surge during the late 1980s,
as corporations raised funds through rights issues and equity-linked
instruments.
The government wants to make legal changes for implementation from next
April.

Merck, the US's biggest pharmaceuticals group, reshuffled its senior
management team to give a prominent role to Mr Martin Wygod, chairman of the
recently-acquired Medco Containment Services, writes Richard Waters.
Mr Wygod, who sold his company last November for Dollars 6bn, has been given
responsibility for all of Merck's North American prescription drug
businesses, more than half the company's sales.
He has been prominent in driving down drug prices for large-scale buyers.
Part of his responsibility will be a new division in Merck, announced
yesterday, which will merge Merck and Medco's sales and marketing operations
to managed care organisations.

The Japanese government is next month expected to detail new rules allowing
companies to buy their own shares.
Japanese companies are currently banned from buying back their own
outstanding shares, but a plunge in Japanese share values in 1992 prompted
the government to consider changes in the commercial code to reduce the
extra supply of shares on the Tokyo market.
The Tokyo stock market saw the number of shares surge during the asset
'bubble' of the late 1980s, as corporations dipped into the stock market to
raise funds through rights issues and equity-linked instruments.
Leading businesses, now wary of the stock market slump, have been calling
for the government to lift its ban on share buybacks by companies.
Advisory bodies to the justice ministry and finance ministry are currently
studying the details, and in February are expected to announce their
proposals, including detailed disclosure by companies which buy back their
shares. The government wants to make legal changes for implementation from
next April.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Companies issue a new record -
Raising finance is a booming activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies worldwide raised a total of Dollars 1,500bn in debt and equity
financing last year, and investment bankers hope that if international
markets compensate for an expected slowdown in US underwriting activity more
records could be broken in 1994.
According to Securities Data, the US financial information group, Dollars
1,100bn of corporate debt and equity was issued in the US last year, with
another Dollars 404bn issued on the Eurobond and international equities
markets.
The total easily eclipsed the previous record of Dollars 1,100bn, set in
1992.
The driving force behind the global underwriting bonanza was low interest
rates and buoyant stock markets. A rush of privatisations in Europe, rapid
growth in emerging financial markets, heavy demand from institutional and
individual investors for stock and bonds, and the continued trend among US
companies to lighten their debt loads, were also important.
As always, US capital markets dominated the global scene. Domestic financing
in the US topped Dollars 1,000bn for the first time, and shattered the
previous record of Dollars 856bn, set in 1992. The rush among US companies
to refinance existing debt at lower rates pushed total corporate bond
issuance to Dollars 422bn last year, up 37 per cent on 1992's record figure.
The big story in the corporate bond sector was the frenzy in the high-yield
or junk market, where companies with debt rated below investment grade
stampeded to raise money. The volume of junk bond sales reached Dollars
54bn, more than the total issued in the previous three years.
It was an astonishing recovery from 1990, when only Dollars 1.4bn was issued
in the wake of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street
investment bank that had pioneered the issue of high-yield debt.
The junk bond market thrived for two reasons: companies with low investment
ratings rushed to raise funds, either to pay off expensive debt with cheaper
credit or to meet tough repayment schedules; and securities paying high
returns were in demand from investors frustrated with low yields on
traditional corporate debt and equity.
The strong performance of US share prices persuaded many companies that the
time was right to raise money through new stock issues last year.
A total of Dollars 102bn was raised from the sale of common stock in 1993,
40 per cent more than the previous year.
The market for initial public offerings of stock (IPOs) was particularly
busy as more than 800 companies went public in the rush to take advantage of
high equity valuations and insatiable demand from investors. At the end of
the year, IPO volume had reached an all-time high of Dollars 57bn, up from
Dollars 40bn in 1992.
The huge volume of underwriting business last year delighted Wall Street
securities firms, who between them earned Dollars 9.1bn in fees and so
smashed the 1992 record of Dollars 6.8bn. Merrill Lynch was the biggest
underwriter for the sixth consecutive year, followed by Goldman Sachs,
Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers.
The big question on Wall Street today is whether 1994 can match last year.
The consensus is yes - but only if international activity grows strongly.
US interest rates are forecast to rise this year, which will cut the size of
corporate debt issuance. Also, demand from investors for stock and bonds is
expected to shrink. Consequently, financing activity is likely to slow down
in 1994, although the sale of new stock and bonds by companies to finance
mergers and takeovers may help offset some of the declines.
Ultimately, however, investment bankers are relying on the international
capital markets to pick up the slack from the US.
Interest rates in Europe and elsewhere are expected to continue to fall or
stay historically low in 1994 and, with the pace of privatisations likely to
remain strong in Europe and the emerging economies, the volume of
underwriting outside the US this year should exceed 1993.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort Benson in Indian fund
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, is joining forces with Tata Group,
India's largest private sector conglomerate, to establish a new fund
management company.
The joint venture, Tata Asset Management Company, is 20 per cent owned by
Kleinwort and 80 per cent by Tata Sons, the group holding company, and
Investment Corporation of India, also a Tata company.
The venture is taking advantage of a liberalisation in the Indian fund
management business which until recently was dominated by the state-owned
Unit Trust of India. About 20 companies are planning fund management arms,
some with foreign backing.
The new venture plans to launch a closed-end mutual fund during the first
quarter of the year.
Mr Derek Condon, a Kleinwort executive who will be managing director based
in Bombay, said the venture would be aimed principally at the domestic
Indian market, particularly the growing middle class population.
Kleinwort estimates that economic reform is producing an increase in the
number of new retail investors of between 2m and 3m people per year and that
they are increasingly turning to the capital markets.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ford pins its hopes on Windstar
/ A look at the US multi-purpose vehicle market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first shots in a multi-billion dollar battle for the hearts and cheque
books of affluent suburban American families will be fired in Detroit this
week at the city's annual international motor show.
For the show, which opens to the public at the weekend, will mark the
official unveiling by Ford Motor of its new Windstar mini-van, which poses
the most serious threat yet to Detroit rival Chrysler's hold on this
fast-growing and highly profitable segment of the US vehicle market.
Mini-vans, as they are called in the US, are seven-seater passenger vehicles
which look similar to small vans but have the handling characteristics of a
car. In Europe, they are generally called multi-purpose vehicles and the
best known is probably the Renault Espace.
In the decade since Chrysler pioneered the mini-van in 1983, the vehicles
have largely replaced the family station wagons which once dominated
suburban America.
Mini-vans, bought mainly by parents between the ages of 35 and 50, can
accommodate more children, in much roomier, more comfortable and flexible
conditions than traditional estate vehicles, and still leave plenty of
luggage space. They can significantly reduce the stress inherent in
travelling with a young family.
Sales have risen by over 10 per cent a year in the past two years, topping
1m units in 1993, and are expected to keep rising as the baby-boom
generation moves through its child-rearing phase.
Chrysler still dominates the sector, accounting for about 45 per cent of
sales with its boxy but easy-handling, front-wheel drive Caravan and Voyager
vehicles - having beaten off repeated challenges from domestic and foreign
rivals.
Ford currently holds around 24 per cent of the market. Its main entrant in
the sector, the Aerostar, is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a very
truck-like appearance, although in late 1992 it introduced a more attractive
small vehicle, the Mercury Villager, which has sold well.
General Motors, the least efficient US manufacturer, holds about 22 per
cent. Its Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac TransSport
vehicles, which have a beaky nose and plastic body, have sold poorly since
their introduction in 1990.
Japanese companies largely make up the rest of the sector, but they have
failed to increase their market share, partly because of design, partly
because of the high yen and partly because of anti-dumping suits against
their vehicles filed by Detroit's Big Three.
The new Windstar poses a threat to Chrysler because it is an easy to handle,
front-wheel drive vehicle which essentially matches the largest of
Chrysler's vans in size and most popular features and adds an additional
dash of style. Its curvy, aerodynamic appearance makes it look much more
car-like than most competitors.
Ford plans to build up to 270,000 Windstars a year, which would put it among
the company's 10 top-selling vehicles. As it is, Ford increased its share of
the US car and truck market from around 23 per cent in 1987 to some 25.4 per
cent in 1993, thanks to a string of successful new or revamped vehicles such
as the Taurus family car and the Explorer sports utility.
It has also just launched a new version of its Mustang sports car to strong
demand, and this year will bring out American versions of its prize-winning
'world' car, known in Europe as the Mondeo.
But for all this success, Ford is currently far less profitable in North
America than the much smaller Chrysler, which has bounced back from
financial problems with a series of hit vehicles of its own, as well as
strong controls on costs.
And Chrysler, which makes around 480,000 mini-vans a year, is hardly going
to give up its share of this market lightly. The invention of the mini-van
played an important part in saving it from financial crisis in the early
1980s and it still refers to the vehicle as a 'crown jewel' because of the
fat profit margins it generates.
Many analysts expect Chrysler to greet the Windstar with a pre-emptive price
cut - repeating a tactic it pursued three years ago when GM launched its
beaky mini-vans.
Chrysler has also been giving journalists sneak previews of a totally
re-engineered mini-van it plans to launch in the 1996 model year. Mr Bob
Lutz, Chrysler chairman, boasts that 'our mini-van will come out a year
after Windstar, but it will clearly be a generation and a half beyond, both
aesthetically and functionally'.
However, Mr Ed Hagenlocker, who heads Ford's North American automotive
operations, says that, because of growth in the mini-van market, Ford and
Chrysler will be able to 'co-exist very nicely'.
He points out that this happened in another fast-growing market segment, for
sports utilities. These are four-wheel drive vehicles, similar to a Land
Rover, which give the driver a sense of off-road ruggedness, even though
they are bought mainly by baby-boomers whose prime experience of the wild is
jostling for parking space in a suburban mall.
When Ford burst into this market with its Explorer vehicle, which has become
the market leader, many analysts forecast it would seriously depress
Chrysler's sales volume. But Chrysler's sales have also risen strongly,
thanks to the introduction of a new vehicle of its own, the Jeep Grand
Cherokee, and the rapid growth of the overall market.
'It really hasn't been a head-to-head confrontation,' says Mr Hagenlocker.
'We both sell everything we can build, because the segment is
product-driven.'
As for mini-vans, he says existing owners tend to be loyal to the products
they drive but around six out of 10 new purchasers are switching from car
ownership. 'Among the 60 per cent that come from the car park, we think the
Windstar will do very well.'
Several analysts agree and suggest that Ford could boost its share of the
market to around 30 per cent - although not necessarily at Chrysler's
expense. The biggest loser could be GM, which is not due to replace its
mini-vans until the middle of the 1996 model year.
Whatever the outcome, a longer-term issue is just how long the mini-van
market can keep growing. Mr Joel Pitcoff, research manager for Ford in North
America, points out that 'the age group that spawned the success of the
mini-vans is approaching the age of empty nesters. A big question is what
will happen to their tastes when their children go off to college.
'Only in Jack and the Beanstalk,' he adds, 'do things grow to the sky.'

Bristol Myers Squibb has announced an overhaul of its operations and
extensive job losses. It joins a growing list of US drug groups working to
adapt to changes in pharmaceuticals markets around the world.
Some 5,000 jobs will be shed over the next two years, out of a total of
51,000, many of them through a restructuring of the group's sales and
marketing operations in the US and Europe.
The company has been slower than other US pharmaceuticals groups to cut
costs and focus its sales and marketing operations on managed care buyers in
the US. Managed care groups, which buy in bulk, now account for a large part
of total drug purchasers and have forced drug groups to discount heavily.
As part of the restructuring announced yesterday, Bristol Myers said the US
sales force would be reorganised into 12 regional groups, backed up be a
strengthened managed care group and marketing staff.
The company said it was removing a layer of management in Europe, and that
its 11 business units on the continent would report directly to a European
headquarters rather than through four regional divisions.
These changes would reduce staff in the pharmaceuticals business around the
world by 3,000 in all, the company said.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Weatherstone called for Banesto
crisis meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan, the US bank advising
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), wrote to the central bank of Spain on
the day it ousted Banesto's board of management, asking for a meeting to
explain Morgan's position.
Sir Dennis wrote to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the central bank's governor, last
Tuesday asking him to meet Mr Roberto Mendoza, Morgan's vice-chairman who
sat on Banesto's board.
Sir Dennis' letter, written following the central bank's intervention,
emphasises that Mr Mendoza represented J. P. Morgan's corporate office,
'where all decisions relating to the investment by Corsair in Banesto have
been made'.
Corsair is the investment fund managed by Morgan on behalf of US investors
which bought Dollars 175m of equity in Banesto last summer. Mr Mendoza sat
on Banesto's board as a representative of Corsair, and supervised Morgan's
advisory work.
Sir Dennis' letter indicates that he was familiar with Morgan's dealings
with Banesto. Morgan yesterday described as 'completely false' a report in
the Spanish newspaper El Pais that Mr Mendoza had failed to keep Sir Dennis
informed.
Sir Dennis said in the letter he 'would appreciate' a meeting between Mr
Mendoza and Mr Rojo, 'given the gravity of the measures taken by the Bank of
Spain'.
Morgan believed that Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest bank, was in a better
condition than Mr Rojo claimed last week. It estimated that Banesto's assets
were over-valued by Pta372bn (Dollars 2.6bn), compared with the central
bank's estimate of Pta503bn.
Mr Rojo told the Spanish parliamentary finance committee that the central
bank had intervened after discovering a serious over-valuation of Banesto's
assets, partly created by over-rapid growth in loans between 1988 and 1991.
The document written by the bank to justify intervention shows that Morgan
thought the over-valuation was less serious. In particular, it put the
over-valuation of loans at Pta166bn, rather than the Bank's figure of
Pta223bn.
Although Morgan executives are thought to accept that the central bank was
right to intervene when the run on deposits started, they had believed until
then that Banesto could return to profitability helped by further
capital-raising.
Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president, was dismissed along with other
board members when the central bank intervened.

<TEXT>
Trans World Airlines, the US carrier which emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in November, last night said it had parted with its
top two executives: Mr William Howard, chairman and chief executive, and Mr
Glenn Zander, vice-chairman.
In a terse statement, TWA said the two had resigned. Mr Zander was said to
have left for personal reasons but there was no explanation for Mr Howard's
departure.
TWA said Mr Howard's place would be taken by Mr Donald Craib, an existing
board member who was formerly chairman and chief executive of Allstate
Insurance Group. Mr Robin Wilson, vice-chairman and chief operations
officer, would retain those positions, the company said.
Mr Howard, the 71-year-old former chairman of Piedmont Airlines, was brought
into TWA only last July to oversee its transition out of bankruptcy. He said
then that he expected to spend the next few years turning the airline
around.
Late last year there was speculation that a rift had developed between him
and Mr Zander. But last month Mr Howard denied the reports, saying Mr Zander
'will play an ever-increasing role for the airline as time progresses'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech and Slovak governments have injected new capital and strengthened
the balance sheet of Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka (CSOB), their
jointly-owned foreign trade bank. The move is the latest in a series
designed to improve the operational efficiency and profitability of the bank
and set it on course for privatisation.
The governments have injected Kcs4.05bn (Dollars 135m) into the foreign
trade bank of the former Czechoslovak socialist republic, and transferred
Kcs40bn of bad and doubtful debt into two new 'collection units,' to be
funded and managed by CSOB. The bank also implemented credit write-downs
which, together with the capital injection, raised its capital adequacy
ratio to 6.25 per cent at the year end.
The bank, which finances over half the foreign trade of both republics, is
73 per cent-owned by the Czech government, which provided Dollars 100m of
new capital, and 26 per cent by the Slovak government, which provided the
remaining Dollars 35m. One per cent of shares are held by bank employees.
It will report an increased operating profit for 1993 before providing for
bad debts, but an overall loss for the year.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paris theme park woes hit Disney
chairman's pocket

<TEXT>
The financial troubles of the Euro Disney theme park near Paris have claimed
a new victim: Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, collected no bonus
in 1993 for the first time in almost 10 years as head of the Hollywood
company.
Walt Disney owns 49 per cent of the loss-making Euro Disney, and is involved
in negotiations with the company's creditor banks for an emergency
restruc-turing of its debt.
Walt Disney reported a sharp drop in 1993 net income last November, to
Dollars 299m from Dollars 816m, largely because of the problems of Euro
Disney. It took a Dollars 350m fourth-quarter charge to cover difficulties
at Euro Disney, and lost Dollars 514m on its investment in the full year.
The downturn meant the company failed to meet the financial targets
necessary to trigger Mr Eisner's bonus scheme, which is calculated according
to a formula based on net income and return on equity.
Mr Eisner received a salary of Dollars 750,000 and exercised options during
the year on Disney stock valued at Dollars 202m. In 1992, Mr Eisner's bonus
was Dollars 6.7m, while the year before that it was Dollars 4.7m and in 1990
it totalled Dollars 10.5m.
In an interview published last week by the French magazine Le Point, Mr
Eisner warned that the closure of the Paris park would be a possibility if
Euro Disney failed to reach an agreement with its creditor banks.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: A lesson in diversification
survival - Ian Rodger gets to the root of Motor Columbus's financial
troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the idea of aggressive diversification still had any credibility, Motor
Columbus, the Swiss electrical power production and engineering group, has
put an end to it.
The group, one of the world's best known engineers of hydroelectric
projects, has just survived by a whisker a disastrous diversification binge
that began in the mid-1980s.
At the end of 1992, when a reckoning was finally made, the group's trading
profits barely covered its SFr262m (Dollars 176.4m) interest charges. It had
to write off SFr257m on misadventures, and was left with shareholders' funds
of a mere SFr2m. The dividend was passed.
Today, under new management, Motor Columbus is firmly on the recovery trail,
after several disposals and with a new concentration on core
electricity-related businesses. Its bearer shares were one of the top
performers in a perky Swiss stock market last year, trebling to a recent
SFr1,570.
The group's diversification programme began in the mid-1980s, when profits
from electricity generation were being squeezed and the Swiss government
suddenly scrapped a nuclear power plant project. Motor Columbus, which had a
big engineering team working on the project, took a write-off of more than
SFr200m, and began to diversify into high-technology services.
The first initiatives were in cable television. The group acquired rights to
build systems in parts of France, Germany and Switzerland. The Swiss and
German systems worked out fairly well, but the typical Swiss penchant for
building everything with a copper bottom went awry in France. Motor
installed an ultra-modern system in Alsace with fibre optic cables and
interactive capability, and then discovered that the subscribers were
unwilling to pay a big premium for it. The result: SFr100m of the group's
SFr150m investment there was written off.
A second thrust was into the data communications sector, with a big
investment in WorldCom, a US private line-leasing business that did well
until American Telegraph &amp; Telephone started cutting prices.
Motor was lucky though, being able to sell WorldCom to IDB Communications, a
US telecoms group, in return for a 40 per cent share stake in IDB. Most of
that stake was sold in November at a net profit of SFr200m.
It was less lucky in its third area of diversification, service and
manufacturing businesses. These varied from water purification equipment to
proteins for pharmaceuticals, electronics for textile machinery and powder
coatings. Most have been sold or closed.
The one large remaining non-core business is Studer Revox, which makes
specialised audio studio equipment and upmarket consumer electronics. Last
year, losses and write-offs at Studer reached SFr100m. The two businesses
have been revived under new management, and are being readied for sale.
At their peak in 1991, the diversifications generated a little over a
quarter of the group's SFr1.9bn turnover, but only 6 per cent of its SFr283m
trading profit.
In 1991, with the recession deepening, directors saw disaster looming. Mr
Ernst Thomke, a highly-regarded former executive at the SMH watchmaking
group, was brought in to perform surgery.
It did not take long to set a new course. Ironically, in the middle of the
diversification binge, the group's principal electricity-generating
subsidiary, Atel, had found an exciting new source of growth in electricity
trading.
With a large pool of hydro power generation and a high-tension transmission
network criss-crossing Switzerland, Atel was in an excellent position to
deal in electric power with neighbouring Italy, France and Germany.
The competitive advantage of hydro power is its flexibility. It can be
turned up or down as needed within seconds, without adding any significant
marginal cost. Electricity dealing in central Europe is conducted daily by
telephone, and Atel is an important player. Last year, more than half of its
SFr1.4bn turnover came from trading, and Motor is vigorously expanding the
network's capacity and coverage.
Analysts are reckoning on a sharp turnround at Motor in 1993, from 1992's
SFr225m net loss to a profit of about SFr70m. For their part, the directors
have recently demonstrated optimism that the group can trade out of its
crisis by cancelling 94,000 shares held in treasury against bonds that were
never converted.
This turnround has restarted speculation about Motor's ownership. Union Bank
of Switzerland holds a 40 per cent block of shares, bought in the mid-1970s.
Swiss analysts have speculated about a merger between Motor and Electrowatt,
a similar company and part of the CS Holding financial services group built
around Credit Suisse.
Whatever happens, Motor could soon be back in a dilemma similar to the one
it faced in the 1980s: what to do with a brisk surplus cash-flow. One thing
is sure, diversification is out of the question.

FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rescue plan agreed for property
bank CDE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Le Comptoir des Entrepreneurs (CDE), the French property bank, has agreed
with its principal shareholders on a rescue plan which involves the sale of
FFr9bn (Dollars 1.5bn) worth of credits and non-performing assets to a
newly-created company.
The plan will strengthen the balance sheet of CDE, victim of the downturn in
the French property market. Provisions against non-performing property loans
resulted in net losses of FFr940.5m in the first half of last year, compared
with net profits of FFr23.7m in the first six months of 1992, forcing CDE to
turn to its state-owned shareholders.
The terms of the plan involve the establishment of a new vehicle for CDE's
non-performing loans.
The five state-owned financial institutions which have a controlling stake
in CDE - the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Credit Foncier, and the
insurance companies Assurances Generales de France, Union des Assurances de
Paris, and GAN - will hold the shares in the new company.
The purchase of the assets from CDE will be achieved through a bond issue,
the proceeds of which will go to the property bank. This is expected to take
place in the first quarter.
Industry observers said that the scheme is necessary to remove bad loans
from CDE's balance sheet and restore its capital ratios.
The principal shareholders in CDE have already taken substantial provisions
against losses from the company. Analysts estimate that AGF, the largest
shareholder with just under 30 per cent of the shares, faces costs of more
than FFr1bn from its exposure to the property bank.
The successful implementation of the restructuring plan should defuse the
most serious crisis in CDE's 145-year history. It was founded to provide
state-subsidised loans for cheap housing, but expanded into commercial and
private property lending.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson to receive Pounds 17.6m
for bullion business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the merch-ant banking group, yesterday said it would
collect Pounds 17.6m cash for Sharps Pixley, the bullion and metals business
being bought by Deutsche Bank.
The latest financial information suggests that the value of the net assets
being sold is Pounds 7.07m.
Kleinwort announced in September that the sale was being negotiated.
Sharps Pixley is one of the five members of the London Gold Fixing which
meets to fix the gold price twice each working day.
The acquisition gives Deutsche Bank marketmaking capability in London, where
it previously had only precious metals trading activities, plus a
ring-dealing membership of the LME, where base metals prices are
established, and membership of the New York Commodity Exchange.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Williams maps out route for progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Rudd is not a man to suffer an identity crisis. As chief executive of
Williams Holdings, the 1980s-born conglomerate, he is crystal clear about
the route his company intends to take in the 1990s in spite of the
apparently waning popularity of the sector.
'We are not a conglomerate in the sense that people see a group of sprawling
industrial businesses,' he says. 'We are no more diversified than ICI.'
The acquisition announced yesterday of Corbin &amp; Russwin, the US locks
business, reinforces Mr Rudd's picture of a company focused on businesses in
three areas: building products, security, and fire and safety.
Security, more than any of Williams Holdings' other core divisions, needed a
boost to give it critical mass, particularly in the US. Little had been
added since the purchase of Yale and Valor in 1991.
'Yale is a worldwide brand name, but the business is smaller than anyone
thinks,' Mr Rudd says. Corbin &amp; Russwin will bring the division's sales to
more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 203m) worldwide and almost double the group's
presence in the US market.
Mr Rudd says the group will squeeze a significant amount of improvements out
of the business through synergies in distribution networks and product
integration. He says there is scope to double the recently-restructured
Corbin's underlying 7-8 per cent margins, even without raising prices, in
two years.
The City is inclined to agree with Mr Rudd's perception of the deal. 'It
certainly makes a great deal of strategic sense,' said one conglomerates
analyst. However, the purchase is widely seen as little more than a
reassuring step in the right direction.
Williams still faces phantoms which must be laid to rest before the City
rushes in. The most oft-quoted criticism is the company's failure to
generate cash and the state of its balance sheet.
The deal announced yesterday will push year-end gearing to about 60 per
cent, against expectations of less than 40 per cent. Now, many are expecting
that any further deals will have to be done through share issues.
Mr Rudd is scathing about many of those who criticise Williams, but reserves
his strongest attacks for those who condemn the group's use of long-term
leverage. 'The last thing we want to do is pay the debt down. We want to use
it to have assets that are earning,' he says.
Mr Rudd quotes the group's Dollars 370m in long term debt - with covenants
attached to the US businesses leaving the parent free to 'do what we like' -
as one of Williams's strengths, in spite of the higher interest rates. 'I
would rather pay another 1 per cent on interest rates so no horrible banker
can come and poke me in the eye,' Mr Rudd says.
He also denies charges of failure to generate cash. 'In the last three to
four years we have spent a lot of money improving the business.' Mr Rudd
roughly calculates that Williams has invested Pounds 150m since 1990. 'This
year, and next, that will come through in a big way.'
The City is still uncertain, however. Although agreeing that cash flow will
certainly improve this year, 'it wont be enough to fund the bolt on
acquisitions strategy if it is maintained at the same pace (of Pounds 100m a
year),' says one analyst. There will have to be further disposals, but these
are at least one to two years away.
The final consensus appears to be that Williams has much left to prove
before it convinces sceptics of its ability to perform in the
post-conglomerate age.
The recent strategy, says one industry observer, 'is probably better than
what has been employed in the past, and for that reason they deserve to be
looked at, but there is nothing . . . that will produce strong
outperformance.'

Edinburgh Fund Managers, the fund management company, is establishing a new
venture based in Atlanta, Georgia, to market its investment services to the
North American market.
EFM is one of a number of UK fund management companies which have achieved
success in attracting international fund management mandates from US pension
funds seeking to diversify investment outside the US. According to InterSec
Research Corporation, which specialises in pension fund research, the value
of US pension assets invested overseas rose by nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds
34bn) in the first six months of 1993.
A recent survey from the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a UK-based
trade group, found that overseas assets managed by its members increased by
41.9 per cent in 1992 while the value of UK client assets rose by a more
modest 17.7 per cent. The survey found that North America and east Asia were
by far a larger market for non-UK business than Europe.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pentland pays Pounds 20m for Italian sports
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentland Group, the cash-rich consumer brands company, yesterday paid
L50.6bn (Pounds 19.7m) for 90 per cent of Ellesse, the Italian sports goods
company.
Ellesse makes sportswear, concentrating on skiing and tennis.
Pentland has distributed Ellesse clothing in the UK for 12 years, and has
acted as UK licensee for its footwear for the past five years.
Mr Richard Stevens, company secretary, said yesterday that Pentland felt the
Ellesse brand might have 'lost focus a little in the last few years', but it
had a first class pedigree.
'We think it will prove to be a good investment at this price.'
Pentland would sharpen up its image and improve worldwide distribution, he
said.
Ellesse products would complement rather than compete with Pentland's
existing brands.
For example, Ellesse swimwear was more style oriented than Pentland's
Speedo, which was aimed at competitive swimmers.
Mr Leonardo Servadio, founder of Ellesse, will retain the remaining 10 per
cent of the company.
He has the right to require Pentland to buy his stake in certain
circumstances, and Pentland has a similar right to acquire his stake.
Maximum consideration would be L12.5bn.
Pentland will pay a deferred consideration of 10 per cent of profits before
interest and tax if they total more than L48bn for the five years to 1998.
Maximum payment would be L7.2bn.
In the year to end-December 1992, Ellesse announced profits of L4.1bn.
Mr Stevens said Pentland would continue to look for larger acquisitions in
the branded consumer durables sector.
At the end of the six months to June 30 last year Pentland had cash of
Pounds 252.9m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.7m on turnover of Pounds 198.4m
after losses and closure costs at its US trade finance business.
Last April it paid a 12p special dividend from the profit on the sale of its
20 per cent stake in Adidas, the sports goods company.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New structure and sectors of the All-Share
Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market tables published in today's FT are the first to use the
revised FT-SE Actuaries classification, writes Peter Martin.
The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough
overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the
shape of today's market. Sectors have been merged or subdivided as their
relative importance has changed.
The new classification system is of special interest to FT readers because
it shapes the layout of the paper's share price listings, the London Share
Service. As a result of the changes, several hundred of the 3,000 or so
securities quoted on the pages change sectors.
To ease the transition, yesterday's FT provided a full alphabetical list of
shares carried in the London Share Service. Readers may wish to use it for
reference so as to find their way easily around the pages.
There is one particular change worth noting. Foreign stocks which are not
part of the main classification - those categorised as Americans, Canadians,
etc - move from the beginning of the classification scheme to the end.
We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and
hope that it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar.
Though we believe that the service is improved, we are conscious that
disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs. After this burst
of activity, we are hoping for a period of greater stability.
The structure of the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index (formerly the
FT-Actuaries All-Share) is shown below. It contains three tiers: Economic
groups, Industry sectors and Sub-sectors. Each company has been allocated to
the industry sub-sector whose definition most closely describes the nature
of its business.
More detailed information on the new FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification
System, including a set of the Classification Ground Rules, can be obtained
by writing to: The Secretary, FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification
Committee, Financial Times, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.
For further information on the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices electronic data
feeds, please contact the Finstat Help Desk on 071-873-4613. For further
information on the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices and Index Data Services

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Banks approve Eurotunnel funding plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Eurotunnel, the company which will operate the Channel tunnel,
rose 20p to 630p yesterday on news that it had obtained approval from its
banks to raise an extra Pounds 1bn in funding.
The agreement reached with the company's 23 main banks clears the way for it
to go ahead with detailed negotiations on a further Pounds 500m of bank
loans and for a planned Pounds 500m rights issue.
However, it does not automatically signify that the banking consortium will
provide the loans.
Details of which banks will provide the additional loans and the exact form
the new lending will take have still to be negotiated though Eurotunnel said
it already had a good idea where most of the money would come from.
Under the agreement with the banking syndicate Eurotunnel will provide fresh
security over revenues from its operating concession, recently extended from
55 to 65 years.
Mr John Noulton, administration director, said: 'This represents a dilution
of the banks' present security. It shows they are taking a judgment that the
likely revenues are robust enough to provide sufficient security.'
Approval for the increase in Eurotunnel's funding requirement from Pounds
9bn to Pounds 10bn will also lead to modifications in the credit agreement,
including changes to the financial ratios which the company will have to
meet.
It described these as technical changes but said they would probably take
until the end of February to sort out.
The rights issue, which was given shareholder approval at the end of last
month, is expected to take place between March and the official opening of
the tunnel in May.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bonuses static at GA and Friends Provident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident and Friends Provident began the 1994 round of with-profits
endowment bonus announcements with maturity values for 25-year policies only
marginally changed.
The value of a 25-year GA endowment maturing on January 1 this year is
Pounds 65,604, an increase of 0.2 per cent on last year. The figure uses the
standard industry assumptions of a policy started by a man aged 29 paying
Pounds 30 monthly premiums.
General Accident's pay-out on a 10-year endowment, based on the same
assumptions, slipped 0.4 per cent to Pounds 6,567, after a drop of 6.2 per
cent last year.
Many insurers have cut bonuses in recent years to compensate for
over-generosity in the past. However, Mr David Heslop, marketing actuary for
GA Life, said the company's pay-outs on endowment policies were now at a
sustainable level, roughly in line with their asset share.
Friends Provident's 25-year pay-out is up 0.2 per cent at Pounds 61,636,
while its 10-year pay-out is down 2.5 per cent at Pounds 6,709.
Friends Provident said it expected lower investment returns in the future
would reduce bonus rates, but this year's excellent investment returns
allowed bonus rates to be maintained.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Churchill receives further Pounds 5m cash
injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Churchill Insurance yesterday announced that its parent company, Winterthur
of Switzerland, had injected Pounds 5m in additional capital, paving the way
for a further expansion this year in telephone sales of motor insurance.
The new capital injection follows one of Pounds 6m last October and brings
the company's total paid-up capital to Pounds 60m.
The group insures about 500,000 motorists and began marketing home insurance
policies last year. It currently insures about 35,000 householders and next
month expects to announce pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.5m for 1993.
In a separate development, Churchill this week assumed management control of
Winterthur Tell, a new Winterthur subsidiary in Denmark. Like Churchill,
Winterthur Tell will sell motor insurance by telephone directly to the
public.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has begun further patent infringement action against Genpharm, a
Canadian drug manufacturer which wants to make a generic version of Glaxo's
Zantac, the world's best selling drug. At stake is a slice of a market that
is worth Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year to Glaxo in the US alone.
Glaxo's move is a response to a new challenge to Zantac's patents by
Genpharm in the wake of a court ruling in favour of Glaxo in September 1993.
Genpharm is now challenging two of Glaxo's US patents on the drug.

FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 28.9m management buy-out at APV arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries,
has sold Douglas Machine Corporation to its manage-ment for Dollars 28.9m
(Pounds 19.4m) cash.
The disposal is the latest undertaken by Mr Clive Strowger. He was appointed
chief executive 18 months ago and has launched an extensive restructuring
programme to re-focus APV, which expanded rapidly through acquisition in the
1980s.
The sale of Minnesota-based Douglas, which manufactures case packing
machines and other packaging equipment, follows the divestment of the other
packaging businesses, Rose Forgrove in January last year and Ortmann &amp;
Herbst in November.
Yesterday Mr Strowger said: 'We are concentrating our skills in application
and process engineering, automation and project management while
manufacturing key components, such as pumps, valves, heat exchangers and
homogenisers.'
Douglas reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 4m for 1992 and had net assets
of Dollars 13.9m at the end of the year. It is being acquired by a newly
formed company controlled by Norwest Venture Capital Management together
with members of Douglas' senior management who have a minority equity
interest. As part of the deal net cash of Dollars 6.9m has been retained by
Douglas.
APV expects to report a profit on the disposal of about Pounds 9.5m after
transaction costs and writing back goodwill of Pounds 1.6m previously
written off against reserves. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Williams buys US lockmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings yesterday boosted its presence in the US security market
with the Dollars 80m (Pounds 54m) purchase of a commercial locks
manufacturer, Corbin &amp; Russwin.
The deal, Williams' largest acquisition since the Pounds 330m purchase of
Yale &amp; Valor in 1991, will propel the group into the number two position for
commercial locks in the US, after Ingersoll Rand.
Industry sources estimate Williams will have 24 per cent of an annual market
for locks and door-closing devices worth roughly Dollars 623m, while
Ingersoll Rand is thought to have 34-36 per cent.
Williams is paying cash to buy the Corbin &amp; Russwin architectural hardware
business from Black &amp; Decker. Corbin and Russwin claims roughly 10 per cent
of the builders' hardware market in the US, supplying cylinder and mortice
locks to commercial customers such as hospitals. Black &amp; Decker is retaining
the retail business which supplies locks for domestic uses.
Corbin &amp; Russwin has been rationalised in the past two years and achieved
profits of Dollars 3.3m on sales of Dollars 78m in the year to December 31,
after heavy restructuring charges. Further charges are expected as the
business is integrated with Yale in the US, but Williams maintains the
acquisition will not dilute earnings per share.
The deal is expected to increase Williams' year-end gearing from 40 per cent
in December 1992 to roughly 60 per cent. However, Mr Nigel Rudd, chief
executive, said he was comfortable with the increase. Indeed, given
Williams' spread of business and Dollars 370m in long-term borrowing
facilities, he was prepared to see gearing rise to as much as 100 per cent
if the right acquisitions appeared. The group had nothing in its sights but
would be looking to expand the security division in Europe.
Williams had been stalking Corbin &amp; Russwin for more than two years. 'The
deal makes huge commercial sense to us,' he added. The Yale business in the
US had been focused, until now, on door-closing devices. This brought Yale
back into locks, for which it was more widely known in Europe.
Worldwide annual sales of the Yale security division would be about Dollars
300m after the acquisition, two-thirds of which would be in the US.
The acquisition's net assets at completion are expected to be Dollars 35m.

FT  05 JAN 94 / MCI puts Dollars 2bn into local challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the US long-distance telephone company, yesterday
announced a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) initiative to compete with America's
Baby Bell local phone companies.
It is also stepping up investment in its information super-highway - the
network needed to transmit huge amounts of data at high speed.
The company said that it and 'associated partners' were expected to invest
more than Dollars 20bn over the next six years to deliver new long-distance
and local communications services to businesses, homes and research
institutions, under the brand-name networkMCI.
MCI played a central role in forcing competition into the US long-distance
telephone market. Its entry into the local arena could spell tough
competition for the Baby Bells.
Yesterday's announcement was the clearest indication so far of MCI's
long-range strategy in America's information revolution, which is blurring
the boundaries between the telecommunications, computer and television
industries - as well as the regulatory and legal divisions between
long-distance and local telephone companies.
Even so, the company left many important details unclear, including the
names of its potential partners and just how much they would contribute.
Mr Bert Roberts, the chairman, noted that last summer's global alliance with
British Telecommunications, which is investing Dollars 4.3bn in MCI in
return for a 20 per cent stake, was helping MCI to finance its capital
spending.
The most dramatic element of MCI's strategy is its plan to compete against
the local telephone companies, as one of a number of so-called Competitive
Access Providers (Caps), which operate fibre optic networks in cities,
creaming off lucrative business customers.
MCI already owns a subsidiary, acquired in 1990 from Western Union, which
has telecoms access to more than 2,000 office buildings. It is to give this
business, renamed MCI Metro, a boost by investing Dollars 2bn in fibre optic
cable rings and modern traffic switching facilities, initially in 20
metropolitan areas. The company may later target household consumers.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Dreams versus hard facts in private banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With private banks, mystique counts for a lot. So has the small London-based
bank Leopold Joseph taken a big risk by trying to open up the normally
opaque investment process and emphasise that disorientating concept (for
private bankers) of value for money?
Leopold Joseph has just launched a new approach to portfolio management
based upon index-tracking mutual funds, under the slightly pretentious title
of the Optimised Investment Service. This is aimed at private clients and
the kind of charities and smaller institutions which find private banks
congenial.
The investment management industry has been polarising into the managers
serving big institutions, which demand rigorous reporting and performance
measurement, and the smaller client managers; such advisers make it their
business to emphasise relationships and service rather than statistics.
Performance figures have had the effect of ruthlessly sorting out the sheep
from the goats among big pension fund managers. Over the past 10 years a
lower quartile UK manager would have turned an initial Pounds 1m into Pounds
4.3m but an upper quartile manager would have generated Pounds 6.5m.
Unfortunately there is a strong possibility in this business that a sheep
may metamorphose into a goat, or even a donkey.
For private banks and similar firms the performance numbers can be very
difficult to find. Usually there is a vague claim to expertise, unsupported
by quantitative evidence. A bank may, for instance, claim to be able to find
investments which are fundamentally undervalued by the markets. It may be
able to use 'detailed economic and company research from the most highly
regarded sources' which can be combined with its 'strong in-house analytical
capability'.
I am teasing Leopold Joseph here because these phrases come from its latest
annual report, published last July. Its new brochure on the Optimised
Investment Service observes more candidly that the conventional private
client and smaller institutional fund manager will find it very difficult to
add value.
Evidence is, I repeat, hard to come by, but LJ has taken the published
performance of UK general unit trusts as a proxy for what the private client
and small institutional manager may be achieving. Over a recent five-year
period (ended last April) the average trust underperformed the FT-A
All-Share Index by almost 3 per cent a year (even ignoring the bid-offer
spread).
The bank reckons that the total cost of managing a conventional Pounds 1m
portfolio for a 40 per cent taxpayer resident in the UK may be about 3.2 per
cent a year, about 2 percentage points of which arises from capital gains
tax and commissions resulting from portfolio switching.
These costs can be halved by changing to the 'optimised' strategy which
eliminates all stockpicking and relies on top down asset allocation using
index funds, deposits and bonds. The saving effectively comes from a
reduction in transaction costs and taxes.
One problem, however, is that some of the same doubts are associated with
asset allocation as with individual stockpicking: can the costs of switching
really be recouped through the exercise of investment skills in efficient
markets? The logical extreme here is to index to some kind of consensus
strategy, a service actually available to UK pension funds from Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Investment Management.
But of course the client is usually not at all happy dealing with a
computer, and this is the marketing problem. A private banking client may
not be all that rich and may be expensive to service, but he (or she) thinks
he deserves a premium service and that is the ego-massaging relationship
that the most successful private client managers provide.
The client wants to believe that his portfolio manager is clever and well
informed, not least because he would like to think he has been smart in
choosing him in the first place. Part of the deal is an individualised
portfolio, which just happens to make it very difficult to produce
comparable performance statistics.
Portfolio management all too often represents the triumph of greed over
experience. Leopold Joseph somehow has to put over its low-cost approach to
clients without destroying their dreams of outperformance.

FT  05 JAN 94 / New market measures start to converge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A flurry of new equity indices has been launched in world stock markets.
This week alone, there is a new index for the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and
in Germany a 167-share version of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's
long-running 100-share index.
Increasingly, indices look alike. Most are adopting the
capitalisation-weighted approach, which is theoretically more accurate and
harder to manipulate. This is desirable because investors want to trade
futures based on stock indices that accurately reflect the underlying cash
market. Indices with historical quirks - such as the unweighted Nikkei 225
index, heavily influenced by moribund companies - are too easily
manipulated.
There are still enough differences between major indices to trap the unwary.
Take the new Amsterdam EOE index, the former European Options Exchange index
newly adopted by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange to replace the old CBS
Tendency index. From February 18 it replaces its old semi-fixed weightings
with capitalisation weightings, but there will be a 10 per cent cap applied
to Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever, which would otherwise take up nearly
half the index between them.
The main German index, the DAX, is unusual because its basic calculation
measures an investor's total return - not just the share price appreciation
but also the dividends. The FAZ newspaper is adding a similar type of index,
the FAZ-Performance-Index, to its more conventional capital-value FAZ 100
index. The DAX now publishes a calculation based on the late-afternoon close
of the IBIS electronic trading system, as well as the earlier close of the
physical market.
France, like the London market, now has a consistent set of indices. The
CAC-40 index, the main real-time indicator, is a subset of the new SBF 120
index, soon to be calculated in real time. It, in turn, is a subset of the
SBF 250, which replaces the old CAC General index.
Italy's new Mibtel index, which now covers all 152 stocks traded on Milan's
electronic system, is rebased to 10,000 each year. This used to be common in
continental Europe, but has largely been discarded because it makes long-run
comparisons harder.
Canada's TSE 100, launched last year, uses as its key criterion a company's
float capitalisation: the value of the portion of the equity that is
available for trading. Many big Canadian companies have substantial portions
of stock in the hands of controlling investors. This is excluded for the
purposes of selecting constituents and calculating weighting.
Finally, today marks the first publication of the new FT-SE Actuaries
All-Share industry sectors. It is also relaunch day for the FT Gold Mines
index, formerly of South African companies. It now covers 34 gold producers
worldwide. Indicative figures will be published weekly during January, with
daily publication starting in February.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Metallgesellschaft to outline its survival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new management at Metall- gesellschaft, the financially stricken metals
and engineering conglomerate, is to outline its survival plans this
afternoon to its creditor banks.
Bankers said yesterday they expected to be asked to delay calling in loans
and to allow a 90-day breathing space in which plans could be refined and
put into operation.
The 40 to 50 banks also expected to be told the extent of the losses
incurred by the German group's US subsidiary, MG Corp, on the New York oil
futures market. The losses, independently estimated at around DM1bn (Pounds
300m) last month, precipitated the crisis and the sacking or demotion of
several senior executives, including the chairman, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch.
Bankers called to today's meeting, which was originally planned for next
week, said they were asked only yesterday morning to confirm the balances on
their Metallgesellschaft accounts. 'They should have done that a week ago,'
one said yesterday.
Despite earlier suggestions that some creditors were considering declaring
the group in default, optimism had grown that there was 'the prospect of a
viable rump' emerging from the crisis.
Lenders were keen to hear which of the group's 260 subsidiaries were to be
sold off, as well as the scale and handling of an expected rights issue to
'shore up its depleted net worth', the banker added. Peripheral creditors
were concerned that a moratorium should be agreed, to avoid the possibility
that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, both shareholders and main lenders,
might gain security over prime assets, leaving them 'out in the cold'.
Both banks were quick to step in and extend credit lines when news of the
New York oil futures losses emerged. A week later, the Metallgesellschaft
supervisory board, chaired by Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director,
shook out the management claiming the supervisory board had not been kept
informed. Mr Schimmelbusch was replaced by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a
restructuring expert well-known to Deutsche.
Metallgesellschaft has estimated net short-term obligations of DM8bn,
described by a spokesman as 'not unusual' for a company deriving half its
annual DM27bn turnover from trading.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Yeltsin plans curbs on abuses of privatisation by voucher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin published a decree yesterday aiming to
conclude a voucher privatisation programme by July, amid increasing fears
about protection for small investors.
In what one investment fund manager predicted would turn into a 'series of
loud scandals over the next six months', Russian citizens face growing risks
on the country's weakly regulated financial markets.
Every night, television viewers, already confused about how to invest
privatisation vouchers that were distributed to all citizens last year, face
a deluge of advertisements from investment funds licensed to invest in a
broad portfolio of companies on behalf of voucher holders.
Yesterday, MMM-Invest promised to turn vouchers into 'gold', saying its
portfolio of shares had increased in value 82.7 times. Another,
Neft-Almaz-Invest (literally, Oil-Diamond-Invest) promised to pay an annual
dividend of 750 per cent.
But one fund manager, Mr Vladimir Koshelev, said last night his fund, called
Programma Privatisatsiya, would not be paying any dividends this year, and
that other funds should not promise big payouts. He pointed out that many
privatised enterprises were precarious.
Reliability is the pitch made by Mr Koshelev's own fund, which even uses the
same logo as a government ad for the mass privatisation campaign.
But Mr Koshelev sees nothing wrong with his own fund's TV ad - claiming
European Community endorsement because it had been given a Euromarket
trophy. The Financial Times has confirmed that the award was granted to all
paying guests at a Dollars 3,900-per-couple seminar held in Brussels last
month by a private organisation called the European Market Research Centre
(EMRC).
The award was included in what Ms Florence Daxhelet, deputy co-ordinator of
EMRC, described as the 'global price for the seminar'. The EMRC's brochure
claims the patronage of the European Commission's Directorate-General 23,
responsible for business development, although Ms Daxhelet said EMRC
received no financial support from it. European Union officials made clear
that this award could not confer Commission endorsement.
Mr Yeltsin's decree outlines which enterprises can be privatised and exempts
investment funds from tax on dividend income.
Re-selling shares for a capital gain is difficult in a highly illiquid
market. Trading in vouchers is illegal.
Risk extends to all manner of financial services. The central bank last week
broadcast a statement warning investors off the GMM investment trust, which
has a Dutch registration.
Last night, GMM issued its own press release, the contents of which were
also broadcast on television. However, it only denied newspaper allegations
that it had funded the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky - not mentioning the central bank's announcement that GMM had no
licence to conduct its banking operations.

FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market clearly believes all news is good news for Eurotunnel as opening
day looms. Following a string of reassuring developments, yesterday's
announcement that Eurotunnel's leading banks had approved its latest funding
plan helped prompt a further 3 per cent rise in its sterling units. The
official publication of Eurotunnel's fare structure next week will doubtless
provoke a further bout of excitement.
The resolution of the remaining worries surrounding the project's
construction phase certainly provides an encouraging backdrop as Eurotunnel
prepares to raise a further Pounds 1bn this spring. But the rights issue
prospectus will make intriguing reading now that the scale of the
operational challenges is becoming clearer.
Ferry operators estimate the total revenues generated by freight and
passenger services and duty free sales on the short ferry routes between the
UK and mainland Europe amount to Pounds 600m a year. That is about
equivalent to the annual interest payments Eurotunnel will have to make to
service the debt it will have sunk into the project. Eurotunnel will thus
have to rely on expanding the cross-Channel market by drawing business from
longer ferry routes and airlines. To make a half-way decent return, its
shareholders must be hoping that it will win traffic that no-one predicted.

FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Media ownership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The possible relaxation of government regulations on media ownership
promises to keep the City's mergers and acquisitions merchants busy for
years to come. If protected media assets come on to the auction block
following the government's review, a wholesale restructuring of the industry
will naturally result. Cross-border mergers could become fashionable along
the lines of the successful merger of Reed International and Elsevier.
Companies from other industries may also be keen to enter the media game.
BT, for example, will be itching to explore multi-media possibilities given
half a chance. US telephone operators are already showing the way.
Newspaper groups will surely press ahead with their plans to diversify into
television. Whether buying Channel 3 franchises proves the best means of
doing so, however, is open to doubt. Newspaper groups would find it too hard
to justify the going rate for television franchises since they could not
derive the merger benefits available to other television operators.
Moreover, deregulation could prove a two-way street. TV contractors could be
just as keen to expand their media interests in regional newspapers.
All these thrills may come too late for LWT's shareholders, who must now
decide on the merits of Granada's existing bid. But it is clear that the
re-rating of the television sector which stemmed from the current wave of
bid speculation is unlikely to abate once the bids are resolved.

FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On its own, the acquisition of Corbin &amp; Russwin, the US locksmith, will
hardly transform Williams. Yet the Pounds 50m deal, completed on new year's
eve, brings the group's acquisitions for last year to nearly Pounds 140m.
Taken together with the recent sale of its engineering businesses, Williams
thus seems less trapped by its balance sheet than some of its critics have
claimed. Though sale of the electronics businesses and its Fairey bridge
builders will have to wait, the group has made progress in adjusting its
focus on to a limited range of businesses with a reasonable strategic fit.
Corbin, for example, will double Williams' share of the US commercial lock
market to 20 per cent, creating a stronger base from which to attack the
market leader, Ingersoll-Rand.
In the final quarter of 1993, Williams' shares outperformed Hanson by 10 per
cent and BTR by 15 per cent. This relative re-rating does not necessarily
mean Williams can now relax. The Corbin acquisition will both absorb cash
and involve a goodwill hit of some Pounds 30m, so that gearing will rise to
60 per cent. Williams may rail against those on the Accounting Standards
Board who still believe goodwill should be written off. But even with eight
times interest cover, such gearing leaves little leeway for acquisitions to
complete the transformation process. It will help if the company's full-year
figures show its cash generation has improved as the use of acquisition
provisions has come down.

FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Capital connections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the multimedia hype continues, phone company executives may soon have to
stop talking telephone numbers and start spending them. MCI's announcement
yesterday of Dollars 20bn-worth of strategic plans falls mostly into the
talk category - the investment in long distance super-highways and local
capacity will be phased, shared with partners and is partly an upgrading of
existing facilities.
The gambit is also politically inspired; MCI wants to cut the amount it pays
local phone companies for its final connection to consumers, so threatening
to compete with them is a useful spur.
Still, even with the rhetoric stripped away, it does point towards the high
capital investment that phone companies will need. AT&amp;T and MCI may well
move from long distance traffic to compete for local calls. While that
investment would be costly, there is little doubt that the Baby Bells'
monopoly margins could be cut. That, however, would probably prompt the
regulator to open the US long distance market to local companies, increasing
competition and cutting margins there too.
Several expensive fibre-optic super-highways may be built, providing the US
with vast capacity. As such systems could carry almost limitless traffic,
phone companies will struggle to avoid prices falling to commodity levels.
Some value-added services will help maintain margins, and even if video
conferencing becomes as cheap as using the fax, network operators will
benefit from the increased usage of their systems. Yet phone companies will
be relying on lower prices stimulating demand in order to recoup most of
their capital spending.
MCI's strategy is a sensible response to the development of real competition
in US telecoms, but shareholders may yet view the old cosy cartel with
nostalgia.

FT  05 JAN 94 / French car sales at lowest point for 18 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The depressed state of the French car market was demonstrated in statistics
yesterday showing car sales fell by 18.3 per cent to 1.72m last year, the
lowest annual figure since 1975.
The figures from the CCFA, the French carmakers' committee, showed a
particularly sharp fall in December. Car sales last month totalled 152,000,
a fall of 31 per cent compared with the same period in 1992.
Industry analysts in Paris said December's decline was exaggerated by
artificially high sales at the end of 1992, the result of a rush by
consumers to beat the expiry of tax incentives for low-pollution models.
Excluding such factors, the decline in the month's sales was estimated at
about 16 per cent.
But the figures for December demonstrated the continued weakness of the car
market. 'The impact of recession and depressed demand is very clear,' one
industry analyst said. 'Cars, more than other consumer products, continue to
suffer from a lack of economic confidence.'
French manufacturers had, however, some cause for comfort. The combined
sales of the French car companies represented 60.3 per cent of the market,
an increase of 0.5 per cent compared with 1992.
Renault, the state-owned group, limited its fall in sales to 15.1 per cent,
partly reflecting the successful introduction of models such as the Twingo.
Citroen saw sales fall by 16 per cent, and was also supported by the
introduction of models like the Xantia mid-range car. Peugeot, however, its
partner in the PSA Peugeot-Citroen group, suffered a fall of 22.6 per cent.
Most industry executives expect some recovery in the market this year,
although they emphasise the slow pace of revival and continued high level of
competition. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot- Citroen, forecast
total car sales in France would rise to about 1.85m units in 1994.
French car manufacturers also continue to suffer in the face of difficult
international markets. According to figures from the CCFA, exports amounted
to 1.68m in the first 11 months of 1993, a fall of 13.25 per cent.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Owen urges action to counter Croat forces: Mediator attacks
troop moves into Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator in former Yugoslavia, accuses the
Croatian government today of sending its army into Bosnia and argues that
the world should respond to the deployment 'with considerable strength of
purpose'.
Joining Croat and Bosnian government negotiators in Vienna yesterday to
continue the search for a territorial compromise in Bosnia, Lord Owen
accused the warring parties of ignoring the United Nations and ceasefire
agreements.
In a British television interview to be broadcast tonight, on Channel 4's
Dispatches programme, he says a 'very substantial' element of the Croatian
army is already operating in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
He suggests that the international community should react to that no less
strongly than it did to the Serbian military intervention in Bosnia in the
spring of 1992.
Undeclared military help for the Bosnian Serbs from Serb forces helped the
Bosnian Serbs to gain control of nearly 70 per cent of the ethnically
complex republic after Bosnia-Hercegovina's declaration of independence.
Such covert military and political intervention led to the imposition of UN
sanctions against Serbia.
Thus far, however, the west has largely ignored a similar build-up by Croat
forces over the last six months, Lord Owen argues. The programme
concentrates on the role played by the Croatian government led by President
Franjo Tudjman in helping Bosnian Croats carve out their own ethnic
mini-state of Herceg-Bosna.
Covert intervention by both the Serb and Croat governments led to increased
pressure from both sides on Bosnia's Slavic Moslem community. But the
Bosnian Moslems' determination to fight for land and access to the outside
world, and their ability to obtain and manufacture weapons despite the
formal arms embargo, has extended the fighting into areas largely populated
by Croats.
That has led to increased fighting between Moslem and Croat forces who in
the early stages of the war in Bosnia often allied with the Moslems against
Serbs as the common enemy.
The Vienna talks are to work out a territorial deal that would leave the
Moslems access to the sea and avoid the mass expulsion of ethnic Croats from
areas now threatened by Moslem forces.
The talks are being held for the first time under the auspices of a European
Union now led by Greece. Athens, still smarting from the recognition of the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia by other EU members, now 'places top
priority on solving the Bosnian conflict', Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek
foreign minister, said in a French press interview yesterday.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Balloon struggles to get airborne: Andrew Hill asks why
Europe's single market has failed to take off, a year after its high-profile
launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year after barriers to trade and free movement in the European Union
were supposed to come down, many pioneers of the single market are still
waiting for Europe to open for business.
Mr Don Cameron, who founded one of Britain's few manufacturers of hot-air
balloons, has plenty of pioneering spirit, but he is running out of
patience. For more than two years, he has been trying to break down the
resistance of German technical regulators to the import and sale of his
balloons - or rather, the propane gas cylinders used to inflate them. 'It's
been a nightmare,' he says. 'I can fly them over Germany, but they can't be
transported on the roads.'
Mr Knud Buhl of the Danish bacon and meat council faces legal problems in a
more down-to-earth area: he claims Germany and France are restricting
imports of meat from uncastrated boars. 'We're in a deadlock. What we are
doing is fully legal under internal market rules, but illegal according to
German law,' says Mr Buhl. The European Commission is challenging the German
rules in the European Court of Justice, but in the meantime all Danish
slaughterhouses can do is scale down production and wait for a judgment.
So what has happened to the single market and its high-sounding pledge to
free the movement of people, goods, capital and services across Europe?
On paper it is still in good shape. On January 1, Finland, Sweden, Norway,
Austria and Iceland joined the market, creating the European Economic Area,
the biggest multilateral trading zone in the world. All but the most rabid
Euro-sceptics acknowledge that it is, as EU leaders declared after
December's Brussels summit, 'a major asset of the European economy'. But
since the celebratory fireworks of January 1 1993, the political impetus
behind the market seems to have faded.
One problem is that the market arrived at the same time as a deep economic
recession in continental Europe. As a result, many companies are not strong
enough to exploit the potential of the single market, which was first tabled
during the more prosperous mid-1980s.
Some companies also claim that the single market has imposed additional
bureaucratic costs and burdens, exacerbating the economic downturn.
According to a survey published this week by KPMG, the UK accountancy firm,
48 per cent of British exporters feel they have not gained from completion
of the single market, claiming that increased bureaucracy has cancelled out
its benefits. The main criticisms are levelled at the new regime for
collecting and monitoring value-added tax on cross-border transactions.
Another problem with assessing the market is that many of the important
legislative initiatives adopted by the member states have not yet come into
force. Vocational qualifications achieved in one member state will not be
valid elsewhere in the EU until June. Insurance companies will have to wait
until later this year to set up offices and sell policies across frontiers.
Stockbrokers will not get their 'single passport' to operate everywhere in
Europe until 1996.
As for a surge in cross-border shopping, the sight of Britons struggling
across the Channel to France to fill their cars with cheaper alcohol
represents a failure of the single market - the reluctance of member states
to harmonise excise duties - rather than a great success.
More seriously, the likes of Mr Buhl and Mr Cameron claim that the new rules
of the market are not being properly enforced by the Commission and by
member states. This is now the main concern for the Commission, which has
been gradually changing its role over the past year, from bulldozing through
new legislation to enforcing and co-ordinating existing measures.
The change of tone was both necessary and politically prudent. By the end of
1992, the target for completion of the original single market plan, nearly
300 directives and regulations had been proposed by the Commission in six
years. At the same time, grassroots resentment against 'meddling Brussels
bureaucrats' had reached a climax, with strong opposition to the European
Community voiced through referendums on the Maastricht treaty in Denmark and
France.
Luckily for the Commission, agreement had been reached among member states
on almost all of the original programme of legislation. Since January 1
1993, the Commission has fought shy of tabling new legislation; and
high-profile European Court cases pursuing sluggish member states have been
kept to a minimum. Just before Christmas, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who
took over as internal market commissioner a year ago, declared that the
Commission had managed to sort out 588 legal complaints against member
states 'by friendly agreement following discussion with national
administrations'.
The question for would-be pioneers of the single market is whether the
Commission is now being too soft on member states. Only 115 out of the 219
single market measures that needed to be translated into national
legislation by member states have been implemented by everyone.
Mr Robert Brooke, European marketing director of Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firm, says: 'I think in policy terms (the Commission) should set
the overall goals and objectives and then let the governments themselves get
on with it. But then I think what they have to do is to be much more
ruthless with enforcement.'
'(The EU) is very weak when it comes to enforcing its measures on member
states,' adds Mr Buhl, as he endures the long wait for judgment in the
Danish pig-meat case.
If the Commission and member states fail to implement the legislative
programme evenly across Europe, businesses fear that long-standing
distortions to trade will never be ironed out. That could in turn provoke
new calls for protectionist measures inside the single market, sapping the
commercial strength of the trade zone.
In their defence, Brussels officials point out that they are still pursuing
nearly 1,000 legal complaints against member states, and Mr Vanni
d'Archirafi has promised 'very severe action' to ensure that existing
legislation is implemented. In December, the Commission also proposed to
member states a detailed 'Strategic Programme', aimed at streamlining the
operation of the single market, making it easier for users to take advantage
of it, and complain if it goes wrong.
But the Commission itself is under fire for its failure to enforce the most
basic principle of the 1992 programme: the free movement of people around
the Union. Euro Citizen Action Service, a Europe-wide citizens' pressure
group, has brought one European Court case against Brussels for not
punishing member states that failed to lift passport checks at internal
borders, and the European Parliament has brought another.
Independently, nine of the 12 EU members have promised to abolish passport
controls from February 1. But critics of Brussels' diplomatic approach
believe this deadline, like others before it, will be postponed, leaving the
Commission short of ammunition with which to attack the others: Britain,
Denmark and Ireland.
The Commission's own verdict on its grandest project to date, delivered in
the 'Strategic Programme', is predictably upbeat: 'The internal market is
working.' But the document goes on to admit that 'it can and must be
improved in order to fulfil its promise'.
Consumer groups, trade associations and small businesses are more cautious.
A year on, they say the market is working only for those with the
determination and money to fight for their rights, and for those - citizens
living near borders, multinational companies and international travellers -
already used to dealing with European barriers. The benefits may take longer
to trickle down to small companies, occasional tourists, balloon-makers and
slaughterhouses.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Workers' control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed worker-shareholder deal at United Airlines (UAL), whereby the
workforce will acquire majority control of the company in exchange for
Dollars 4.5bn worth of cost savings, has met with understandable scepticism.
The financial distress of the US airline industry is due at least in part to
the power of its trade unions. UAL's workers may be prepared to give ground
as part of a one-off transaction; whether they remain so adaptable when they
control the company may be another matter. Besides, worker control is
scarcely a new concept. Barring a handful of successful cases on both sides
of the Atlantic, it has mostly been tried as a desperate last throw in
struggling industries such as shipbuilding and steel, and its record over
the last few decades is correspondingly dismal.
But these are strange times in the world of capitalism, and strange remedies
should not be quickly dismissed. Leaving UAL's troubles aside, it is worth
recalling that in the US, in particular, it has become commonplace for
employers to preach the necessity of involving the workforce more closely in
the enterprise. This may sometimes be rhetoric, but is more often a matter
of practical urgency. In the fast-moving 1990s, the key to lower costs is
frequently the speed of a company's response to changes in markets or
technology. Imposing change from above on a hostile or apprehensive
workforce takes too long. The trick is to have ideas pushed up from below.
The snag is that, for the workforce, the deal can prove one-sided.
Commitment is required in the form of ideas and enthusiasm. Corresponding
commitment from the owners in the form of job security is seldom on offer.
Indeed, some of the most ardent advocates of worker involvement in the US
have also been among the most sweeping job-cutters. In Japan, a system of
reciprocity is still widely practised, whereby flexibility and enthusiasm
are rewarded with a job for life. But that ultimately depends on Japanese
companies growing fast enough to create new jobs for those displaced by the
process of change. Now that the Japanese economy has slowed down along with
the rest of the world, the model is under pressure: for in a low-growth
world, rigidity of numbers is no more affordable than rigidity of function.
But the thinking behind the Japanese approach still holds good. One reason a
company such as Toyota evolved a flexible and committed workforce was that
in its early days it simply could not afford an army of passive workers on
the old Detroit model. Many more companies around the world now appreciate
that logic. In the impoverished climate of the 1990s, employers need to
enlist the full energies of the workforce to survive. The question remains
how those energies are to be rewarded.
This brings us back to the issue of worker ownership. To the extent that the
UAL deal is the product of desperation, it is likely to prove a bad example.
But the interests of capital and labour are becoming increasingly hard to
disentangle. Arguably, the standard corporate structure no longer reflects
that. There is plenty of room for experiment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA is not ready for peace; last week's attacks show that. Yet Sinn
Fein, the terrorists' political wing, is wriggling. Its president, Mr Gerry
Adams, has sought refuge in confusion. He has made a series of contradictory
comments on the declaration signed by the Irish and British prime ministers
at Downing Street before Christmas. So has Mr Martin McGuinness, another
senior spokesman.
This is a measure of the strength of the Downing Street document. Its
signatories, Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major, offer nationalists a
chance to fulfil their dream of a united Ireland, if a majority of the
inhabitants of Ulster concur. If Sinn Fein wants to take part in the
democratic process, the IRA has only to lay down its arms. That, in time,
would lead to a fading away of the British military presence in Ulster - the
'demilitarisation' that Mr Reynolds speaks of, using nationalist language to
the consternation of unionists.
Linguistic wobbles aside, London and Dublin have so far kept their balance
while addressing their respective constituencies. They have won
international support, notably in Washington, by placing themselves on the
side of peace, democracy and self-determination. The world now knows that
Britain has no interest in Northern Ireland beyond protecting the right of
its inhabitants to determine their future.
Leaving aside some Paisley blather, the unionists have kept remarkably cool.
Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, elected by
nationalists, says, rightly, that an end to IRA violence would be 'one of
the greatest acts of moral courage of this century'. The net effect, in
public relations terms, is to present a choice to the IRA. It can end the
violence, and thus begin a long march through the democratic process.
Alternatively, it can reject peace, at the risk of political isolation.
Mr Major is right to allow more time. He and Mr Reynolds must counter IRA
propaganda with steady re-iteration of the Downing Street principles,
preferably in public but if necessary through the 'lines of communication'
referred to by Mr Hume. Publishing the Hume-Adams agreement, which the
inter-governmental declaration is said to resemble, would add to the
pressure.

No wonder John Patten, UK education minister, favours strong government; it
seems he endured the smack of it himself on more than one occasion.
Thwarted by the European Court of Human Rights in his efforts to reintroduce
caning as a schoolroom punishment, Patten now admits that 'the Jesuits
flogged me from time to time' while a schoolboy.
No, it was not for smoking behind the bike sheds or talking out of turn.
Young Patten's offence was far more grave: 'It started because I had
difficulties with the proof of the second theorem, and it went on . . .'

Television wars are rather like soap operas. So it's nice to see two old
flames in the ITV franchise wars setting up shop together.
Janice Hughes, head of the European media practice of consultants Booz Allen
Hamilton, batted successfully for Michael Green's Carlton Television which
has just completed its first year as London's weekday commercial TV station.
Kip Meep, head of the media unit at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, acted for
Thames Television - the losers to Carlton.
They have buried the hatchet and opened their own multi-media consultancy -
Spectrum Strategy - thus avoiding any unnecessary bickering about whose name
should appear first in the title.

Shock, horror. Management Today, the flagship of Michael Heseltine's
publishing empire, has appointed a new editor and he is not a journalist.
Charles Skinner, 33, has been plucked out of 3i's corporate finance
department to edit a magazine which was once worshipped by the great and the
good of British industry.
To make matters worse, the current editor, Dennis Hackett, a veteran
magazine man credited with spotting Tina Brown's editorial talents when he
was relaunching Tatler, doesn't seem to have been in on the decision-making.
MT's publishing director, William Pecover, who was up at Oxford at the same
time as Skinner, says he picked a non-hack because the UK does not have a
big pool of experienced business magazine journalists, unlike the US.
Moreover, Skinner 'understands our natural readers'.
Those journalists used to lecturing managers on how to run their business
will be monitoring progress closely.

Social affairs minister Simone Veil thought up the idea and Balladur's 29

You may not yet have heard of Edward Belgeonne; but it's not for want of his
trying. Belgeonne is a clever 30-year-old who had earlier spotted the 1980s
UK boom in mobile phones. He is now about to sell his second mobile phone
business for around Pounds 1.5m. The first went for Pounds 2.5m.
Belgeonne is tired of mobile communications and is making a bid to become a
pop star. Well, actually, he always wanted to be a pop star but thought it
more sensible to make a couple of million first to back his talents.
His band - Gone Tomorrow - has just splashed out on producing 500 copies of
a CD single of the Louis Armstrong classic Wonderful World, his version
having what he calls 'the white reggae feel of the band UB40'.
Given the parlous state of the recording industry, might his next attempt be
a cover version of Who wants to be a millionaire?.

FT  05 JAN 94 / How to widen the circle: A bigger Nato should not be more
threatening to Russia than German unity was
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A democratic and strong Russia would be the strongest guarantee of peace
and stability in Europe.' If that had been said by the US or British or
German foreign minister, it would be barely newsworthy. But coming as it
does from the Polish foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, during his
recent visit to Germany, it should be considered an important contribution
to the resolution of Europe's current security dilemma.
Accepting the expansion of Nato towards Russia's own frontier does not come
easily to Russian political leaders, but there is no reason to think it
impossible. Many people doubted in the first half of 1990 that the Soviet
Union (as it then still was) would ever allow a united Germany to remain in
Nato. But it ended up doing so. Why?
First, the US administration was single-mindedly determined to achieve that
result, and made this its top foreign policy priority.
Second, the West German chancellor, once he saw the strength of US resolve,
became convinced that maintaining Nato membership was a condition for German
unity rather than an obstacle to it, and acted accordingly.
Third, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev himself understood that, having
once accepted the basic principle of the right of the East German population
to decide its own future, he was ill-placed to impose conditions.
Finally, both the US and German governments realised that Mr Gorbachev had
to be helped to sell that unpalatable proposition to the Soviet
establishment. Accordingly, they made sure that German unity came about as
part of a series of changes with which Moscow was associated, and from which
the Soviet Union, along with the rest of Europe, could expect to benefit.
Why was the united Germany's membership of Nato so important to the US?
Because the alternative was West Germany's secession from Nato, which would
have meant the effective demise of the alliance. The argument for further
expansion of Nato, to include other central and east European countries, is
less clear cut.
One US lobby, led by Republican senator Richard Lugar but including some
influential people within the Clinton administration, has argued that
failure to expand, or at least to address effectively the security problems
of central and eastern Europe, would be no less fatal to the alliance in the
medium term than the departure of West Germany would have been in 1990. 'Out
of area or out of business' is this lobby's catchy slogan ('out of area'
being Nato's jargon for the world beyond the territory of its existing
member states).
The opposing view, associated particularly with the new deputy secretary of
state, Mr Strobe Talbott, is that over-hasty enlargement itself poses the
greater threat to the alliance. It would dilute the mutual defence
commitment of Nato members by extending it to fragile new democracies which
cannot be relied on not to engage in ill-advised provocations. Above all, it
would stimulate a nationalist backlash in Russia, so jeopardising the
position of pro-western reformers and increasing the very danger of renewed
Russian expansionism against which central and east European states are
seeking protection.
This second view has apparently come out on top in preparations for next
week's Nato summit, and is reflected in the cautious fudge of the proposed
'partnership for peace', which envisages greater co-operation between Nato
and east European countries but does not give any clear security guarantees.
Mr Olechowski is rightly dissatisfied with that proposal, but his remark
shows sensitivity to the thinking behind it. Indeed he went further than the
most pro-Russian western analysts in saying that 'without the inclusion of a
functioning democratic Russia' there could be no European security. In
reality, Poland's first concern is to find ways of making itself and the
rest of Europe secure in the all too likely event that democracy in Russia
fails - or ceases - to function.
Intellectually, the case for Nato enlargement would become more compelling
after the failure of democracy in Russia and the re-emergence of a plausible
Russian threat. The danger is that politically and militarily it might then
be too late. Western governments might be even more reluctant to guarantee
Poland's security if there were an imminent danger of having to implement
that guarantee by coming to Poland's defence; and if they did so, they might
not have the forces available at the right time and place to defend Poland
fully.
Poland went through that experience in 1939, and has no desire to repeat it.
Poles do not want to wait for Russia to turn nasty. They want, in the homely
phrase Chancellor Helmut Kohl used about German unity in 1990, to 'get the
hay into the barn before the storm'. They need to exploit the present benign
phase in Russian policy (or retreat of Russian power) to forge ties with
western Europe such that in future a western guarantee to Poland will seem
credible and indeed inevitable, because any future Russian attack on Poland
would really be an attack on Europe itself.
But that can only be achieved if Poland and the other candidates for Nato
membership, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, make it clear, as Mr
Olechowski is doing, that they more than anyone share the general European
interest in the success of democracy and reform in Russia; that their first
preference is for a European security system in which a democratic Russia
would play a full part. Their membership of Nato, while clearly an insurance
policy against things going wrong in Russia, should also be seen as a step
towards Nato's transformation into a pan-European collective security system
with Russia as a full member, if things go right.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Multi-media regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a year in which US media markets have been convulsed by a series
of massive takeovers, the UK government has finally got round to reviewing
its own policy towards the broadcasting, newspaper and other related
industries. One does not have to be swept up in multi-media mania to welcome
the review announced this week by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary. The UK's media industries are hamstrung by a hotchpotch of
policies that have been adopted without a strategic overview.
Prime among these is the law preventing national newspaper groups owning
more than 20 per cent of an ITV company and vice versa. Newspaper
proprietors such as Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Associated
Newspapers, the Daily Mail's owner, have lobbied against the rule on the
grounds that it prevents them taking advantage of synergies between the two
industries.
Much of the talk about multi-media convergence may be fuzzy and shareholders
could suffer if over-ambitious chief executives go on wild spending sprees.
Nevertheless, technological advances have opened up opportunities for
cross-fertilisation between different parts of the media sector and new ways
of distributing its products. There is a danger that government restrictions
could stop healthy and internationally competitive companies emerging in
this area.
The lack of a comprehensive approach to media regulation has also created
anomalies. For example, despite being Britain's largest newspaper owner, Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has been able to dominate BSkyB, which is
rapidly developing into a major force in broadcasting. This is because
BSkyB, in which Pearson is also a shareholder, is not treated as a UK
broadcaster in terms of ownership rules.
The government's review will need to be wide-ranging if it is to avoid the
piecemeal approach that has characterised its policy to date. In particular,
it will need to re-examine restrictions preventing British Telecom, the UK's
most highly capitalised company, providing entertainment over its network.
Ministers should also ask how the BBC can more fully exploit its
world-renowned brand, and whether privatisation has any role to play.
In general, the best policy will be for the government to cut back
regulation and leave business decisions to private enterprise. There is,
however, an important caveat. Deregulation must be accompanied by a strong
competition policy. Otherwise, the unhealthy concentration of ownership that
is already apparent in the newspaper industry could extend to other media
markets.
Devising an effective competition policy for media markets will be hard,
because television and newspapers are central to the political process.
Ministers face a conflict of interest when deciding whether to stop press
barons who support their party in elections from expanding their empires.
Although the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's independence from
government provides something of a buffer, it is not ideal. Referrals to it
are not as automatic as would be desirable, its proceedings are not
transparent and ministers usually have the final say over what action to
take. Building it into an effective instrument for combating media
monopolisation should be an important objective of the review.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Two-tier local authority structure
more likely to offer coherence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A G STRICKLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to your editorial, 'Local difficulties' (December 22), and
Peter Mandelson's letter (December 30), I think evidence suggests a two-tier
system can work best of all. The 39 English shire counties, along with their
eight Welsh counterparts, provide the strategic dimension that is surely
needed in local government. They can promote whole areas as a coherent
economic entity, and work in partnership to attract inward investment with
other agencies plus training and enterprise councils.
Mr Mandelson makes the point with regard to service provision that it must
be close to the people. But it must be remembered that the personal services
the shire counties provide (social services, education) are expensive, and
need large populations to gain economies of scale. This is why the
single-tier county borough system was replaced in 1974.
The current debate constantly refers to the argument that districts should
adopt county services and that the county should be abolished. But if this
were to happen, especially in the absence of a regional tier of government,
the strategic dimension would be lost. Much better to publicise the services
that each tier provides in simple fashion.
The current debate also has apparently assumed that while counties try to
protect their interests, districts would do no such thing. The
self-interest/preservation question is a double-edged sword; it should not
be employed against the counties in isolation.
Finally, Mr Mandelson uses Cleveland as an example of a county that is
unpopular. In the interests of balance, I feel compelled to point out that
Cleveland is a rare example of a county with thin popular identity, in that
it is an artificial construction, like Avon or Humberside. Others like
Lancashire or Cheshire have no such problem.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Bright spots in the gloom: Yoshio Suzuki sees a possible end
to the Japanese recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YOSHIO SUZUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In postwar Japan, the word 'recession' has traditionally meant not a
decrease in real gross domestic product, but a 'growth recession', reflected
in a lower growth rate. The present recession is different. Already in its
third year, this recession is the longest since 1945, and GDP may contract
in the year to March. Pessimists are forecasting another decline in GDP in
the next fiscal year.
More than a year ago, personal consumption began to decline. This trend  -
unusual for a Japanese recession - was not caused by a drop in personal
income, since both employment and wages were still increasing, and the
unemployment rate currently stands at only 2.7 per cent, below the peak of
3.1 per cent registered in 1986, during the high-yen recession.
Instead it is the result of a decline in personal consumption after four
years of aggressive buying of durables, such as television sets and cars,
during the late 1980s. Spending patterns have also been affected by the
decline in the value of assets, such as land and stock prices, and the
uncertain economic outlook.
Even though this recession has been worse than past ones, it will really
bite this year. Personal income could decline, and it is feared that the
unemployment rate will exceed 3.1 per cent.
In previous recessions, there was in-house unemployment under Japan's
life-time employment system, which ensured that people had jobs even if they
had no meaningful work to do. This time, companies may have to cut staff, in
order to reduce costs and improve profitability. This would have a serious
effect on consumer confidence and incomes, causing personal consumption to
fall further, and creating a vicious circle of continuing GDP decline.
Political uncertainty has also hit confidence. Last year, the Liberal
Democratic party lost office for the first time in four decades. The new
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa staked its survival
on two issues - political reform and the settlement of the Gatt Uruguay
Round, including the opening of Japan's rice market - and the economy was
not at the top of its list of priorities.
The present political situation is confused, because the government is
opposed not only by the LDP, but also by the Social Democratic party of
Japan, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, which is supposed to be
a member of the government coalition. This awkward relationship within the
government is delaying decisions on economic policy.
Ultimately, however, the government is likely to include in its next budget
an income tax cut amounting to more than Y5 trillion (million million) and
an increase in public works spending. If all goes according to plan, the
income tax cut, which may be made retroactive to January 1 this year, will
be equivalent to 20 per cent of average income taxes, or 2 per cent of
personal disposable income, which should have a positive effect on
consumption.
In the shorter-term, the tax cut will be financed by government bond issues.
But the government plans to increase the country's consumption tax, the
Japanese version of a value-added tax, from the present 3 per cent to 6 or 7
per cent after two years or so, by which time the economy should have
strengthened.
Another encouraging sign for the Japanese economy this year is the value of
the yen. Last year it appreciated sharply, directly affecting Japan's export
industries, including the automotive and electronics sectors - industries
that were already under pressure because of the change in personal
consumption patterns at home. In August, the yen almost topped Y100 to the
dollar.
However, it has already receded to about Y108 to the dollar. And as there is
a time lag between the appreciation of the yen and a decline in domestic
prices of imported goods, consumers will have a lingering increase in their
purchasing power.
The favourable turn in the yen's value has three causes. First, Japan's
export industries have reacted to the strong yen by reducing domestic
production and increasing production at overseas plants built during the
high-yen phase of the late 1980s. As a result, the trade surplus has already
begun to shrink in both volume and yen terms, and will continue to shrink in
dollar terms from early this year.
Second, until August last year, interest rates in the US and Germany were
falling faster than Japanese interest rates, meaning that money was drawn to
Japan and the yen, causing the Japanese currency to appreciate.
Economic stagnation is expected to bring a further decline in Japanese
interest rates, while interest rates in the US will rebound thanks to the
improving pace of economic recovery. This will further ease the upward
pressure on the yen.
Third, US officials have realised that the strong yen has hindered Japan's
economic recovery and not been in the interest of the US or the
international economies. These officials, who were earlier this year keen to
talk up the value of the yen, are unlikely to repeat their statements in the
coming year.
Another positive turn for Japan is that the Hosokawa coalition is the first
Japanese government to advocate voluntarily the deregulation of the economy,
something that the US has long sought in the hope of reducing the current
account surplus. The US will be carefully monitoring the Hosokawa
government's ability to carry out this policy. The Advisory Panel for
Economic Structural Reform, under the chairmanship of Gaishi Hiraiwa, leader
of the Keidanren business federation, has submitted a report to Mr Hosokawa
recommending the promotion of competition through deregulation.
But the successful implementation of medium-term economic reforms will
depend on the Japanese economy's ability to avoid the more pessimistic of
the economic scenarios this year, and return to a sustained growth path. The
important factors will be the size and impact of the tax cut and the trend
in the value of the yen.
Once the Japanese economy starts to recover, corporate earnings should
improve sharply thanks to companies' restructuring over the past three
years. If all goes well, capital spending will be revived, further boosting
economic activity.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Taxpayers' money is squandered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS WELSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Another fudge from Tokyo' (December 29), argues that the
Japanese government should do to its taxpayers what the US government did to
its own in bailing out the savings and loans associations. 'Enabling the
commercial banks to recapitalise' is another term used from time to time for
the same dodge.
Taxpayers' money is taxpayers' money. It does not matter whether it is
handed out in the form of 'state assistance' or 'cheap credit at the
official discount rate'. It still remains money extorted from tax-payers and
squandered by politicians.
If, in writing about such things, the term 'taxpayers' money' was invariably
used, it is conceivable that, over time, it might dawn upon taxpayers what
was happening, namely that their money was being misappropriated on a
mind-boggling scale to bail out private institutions. As things stand,
shareholders make money when banks declare profits, and taxpayers foot the
bill when, every six years or so, banks lose their shareholders' shirts. The
press does the public a disservice in failing to point out that 'cheap
credit at the official discount rate' is just one of the subterfuges
resorted to by governments to conceal what they are up to.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a serious education option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs ALISON WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Authers informs us ('Vocational schooling urged for 14-year-olds',
December 31) that government officials believe vocational options for
non-academic 14-year-olds to be the solution to a 'major national failing':
lack of the high-class technical education provided by Britain's major
competitors. Can they be serious? Vocational courses for low-achieving young
people are certainly a common European option. They are also generally
despised as 'dustbin' courses, and have rapidly declining enrolments.
High-status, high-class technical education is something quite different.
Specialised technical courses generally start much later than 14; and are
difficult (and therefore respected). They also give entry to first-rate
higher technical institutes of the type Britain's polytechnics so
disastrously failed to become.
This sort of technical education is very expensive, and requires long-term
planning. Small wonder, then, that it never appears in the UK's constantly
renewed lists of educational 'reforms'; or that bright English children
continue to choose the most traditional of academic options.

<TEXT>
Sir, Perusal of the new year honours list, as with previous lists, reveals a
number of names which appear to have been chosen at random. Formalising this
by inclusion of honours as prizes in Britain's national lottery would do
much to ensure its success.

Sir, R L Webb (Letters, January 1/2) is not at all alone in disliking the
new plan for premium bond prizes and I agree entirely with his observations.
It might have been better to leave premium bond prizes as being 'little and
often' as a counterbalance to the 'lots but unlikely' winnings proposed for
the national lottery, with the pools to cater for those who want a chance of
either result.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENIS VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The lottery for the people which Mr John Major, the prime minister, so
heartily endorsed is at risk. Money which should go to the arts, sports and
environment may be so whittled down as to become ridiculously small. This
could be a betrayal of all that we and so many others have fought for.
The fundamental point about equity or debt capital for lotteries, which your
editorial ('Charity lottery', December 20) and Richard Branson's letter
(December 23) do not address is that the capital can be repaid within months
of start-up.
Guy Simonis (British Columbia Lottery Corporation) is a leading lottery
expert. On December 9 he outlined in a London seminar how his 20-year-old
lottery now achieves the maximum gains from its Dollars 240 per capita per
annum input: 'We are freed at start-up from the obligation to pay profits
immediately for some months. Therefore we could pay off suppliers without
loans or advances. We didn't have to borrow money to pay the beneficiary.
The enormous cash flow provided the financing we required. The bank found it
a silly arrangement.'
He also saves expenses by running his own facilities management system.
If the UK government and all the bidders adopt this simple wisdom, our
lottery will be for the people and not for super-profiteers. The profit from
handling Pounds 4bn or Pounds 5bn a year is a handsome stimulus for any
operator and bank. The super-profits from equity capital do not enhance the
image of those who propose them, and risk convincing the world that the
government is not sincere in its aims to maximise funds to the good causes.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Poised for a pick-up: French recovery is on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN-MICHEL CHARPIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession was unusually deep for France last year, with gross domestic
product contracting by an estimated 0.7 percentage points. The recession
stemmed from a chain of events arising from the unforeseen costs of German
unification and the difficulties relating to European integration.
A recovery is on the cards for the French economy in 1994. However, because
the French and German economies are so closely linked the former is unlikely
to improve without a corresponding pick- up in the latter.
There was a clear public relations element in the French and German
authorities' announcement last November of a 'joint convergence strategy'
for European economic and monetary union. Nevertheless, the stances adopted
by Paris and Bonn are fully justified by their extraordinary degree of
economic interdependence.
France's economy has bottomed out since the second quarter of 1993. There
was some mild growth (0.2 percentage points) in the second and third
quarters after a sharp slump in the two previous quarters.
Demand for private housing picked up, the number of real estate transactions
increased, property prices stopped falling and there was a drop in the
number of unsold flats and houses. Household consumption also increased. Its
sharp rise during the summer came as a surprise after the substantial tax
increases introduced in July and August.
This year, industrial production, which fell by 3.5 per cent in 1993, should
increase moderately. The reversal should be spectacular for the car
industry; a 3 per cent increase in car sales should be achieved in the year
ahead, after a decline of 18.3 per cent in 1993.
Although the newly introduced European statistical system has complicated
the task of analysis, France's external trade account is improving,
particularly with its non-European trading partners. The surpluses have been
increasing steadily in nominal terms, and France has even run a surplus on
bilateral trade with the UK of more than Pounds 100m a month.
Business investment has declined for the third year running. But recent
surveys suggest that the downward trend has almost come to an end.
Meanwhile, inflation is under control and unit labour costs are stable. The
competitiveness of French exporters, measured in terms of costs and prices,
seems on average to be good. For example, it appears to be close to the
levels of 1991, when French companies gained market share.
For more than a decade, maintaining a stable franc/D-Mark exchange rate has
been the cornerstone of French economic policy. This policy has proved
successful. Interest rate spreads have narrowed, inflation is under control,
companies are more profitable and France's economic growth has outstripped
that of most other leading industrialised countries.
But now the situation has changed. First, the widening of the European
exchange rate mechanism fluctuation bands following last August's currency
crisis when the franc came under intense selling pressure, has extended the
range of policy options. Second, the Banque de France's newly independent
status will modify decision-making procedures.
The goal of French monetary policy since last summer's ERM crisis has been
to maintain the 'internal and external stability' of the franc. This policy
should soon be spelled out in greater detail by the Banque de France's new
monetary policy-making body, the Monetary Policy Council, whose members will
be announced today. While a number of options are possible, radical
scenarios can be ruled out, particularly those based on a shift in policy
priorities. Stability will remain the central objective of monetary policy.
Fiscal policy has played an active role since the government of Mr Edouard
Balladur took office in April, but from a macroeconomic view the impact of
such a policy has been virtually neutral. The government has already
benefited from the success of its privatisation policy, and the effect will
be even stronger in 1994.
On the downside, the fall in tax receipts from recession and the increase in
welfare spending have limited the scope for cutting taxes and reducing
employees' and employers' social contributions.
Provided Germany does not slip back into recession, the Banque Nationale de
Paris forecasts growth close to 1 per cent for the French economy in 1994.
This would be driven by residential investment, exports outside Europe and,
to a lesser extent, household consumption. Inflation will remain low, at
about 2.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the trade and current accounts will continue
to generate surpluses.
Unfortunately, the projected rate of growth will probably not be sufficient
to make a significant reduction in unemployment. While France's economic
performance in the past 10 years has been healthy, its record on jobs is
mediocre. Unemployment is currently 12 per cent of the labour force.
But the real blemish on economic performance is the fact that, in 1989,
after several years of strong growth, unemployment was still 9.4 per cent,
revealing a deep structural problem. Assuming the trends in productivity and
economic activity persist, growth would have to reach 2 per cent in order to
produce a rise in net employment, and 3 per cent to bring unemployment down.
Clearly these thresholds are much too high.
In the recent past, France may have appeared caught up in its rural origins,
reluctantly facing up to the challenge of international competition and
indifferent to its unemployed. While this impression is not entirely false,
it distorts and overshadows the whole picture. In the past few years, French
companies have made considerable efforts to innovate and adapt to the
changing economic environment, and they will emerge more com-petitive from
the recession.
Several recent developments augur well for France and other economies:
negotiations on the long-delayed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have
been successfully concluded, and the spectre of a trade war has dissipated;
and oil prices are at historically low levels.
If Germany comes out of its recession, economic activity in France should
begin to pick up this year, in line with the rest of Europe.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick Stewart, and Charles Dickens, plainly have a dedicated following. At
the end of his one-man performance of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic,
Stewart received an immediate standing ovation. And in the last 20 minutes
of his two-hour show one can see why: as the reformed, beneficent Scrooge,
Stewart is totally in command of his material and his audience.
Not that there were lapses before; the technique is always there. Any
reservations are about how far it is possible to reduce the Dickens novel to
a solo show.
When people were reputed to have known A Christmas Carol by heart, perhaps
they would have picked up every nuance and minor character and gone along
quite happily with the sequence of the ghosts of Christmas. A lot of people
still do. Never having developed a taste for Dickens, I shall defer to them,
save to say that much of it seems maudlin and repetitious and that unless
you know the story by heart, you may find a one-man version confusing and
irritating.
My only other criticism could be a compliment. Stewart's opening Scrooge -
the hard man - does not seem such a bad old stick. When someone wishes him
'Merry Christmas', he replies 'humbug': not an uncommon sentiment. Possibly
this a deliberate interpretation. Underneath the mean old Scrooge, there was
always a generous soul waiting to break out. The simpler explanation,
however, is that Stewart is much better playing Scrooge, good or bad, rather
than all the other characters as well.
The Old Vic is a biggish theatre with a large stage. On the first night it
was packed. Despite the seasonal coughing, Stewart held the audience
throughout. He knew his performance was working because after going through
an hysterical burst of laughter, he suddenly ad-libbed: 'For a man who has
been out of practice so long, that was a brilliant laugh.' Applause all
round.
For the last six years or so Stewart has given his talents to Hollywood and
television. Here is a welcome re-appearance. As an actor he has a lean and
hungry look. One hopes that the Royal Shakespeare Company, of which he is
still an honorary member, can tempt him back to greater parts.
Old Vic until January 8. (071) 928 7616

FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: Dance is at the crossroads - Ballet in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year is going, let him go;/Ring out the false, ring in the true. Such
Tennysonian thoughts could be those of dance-lovers after twelve months of
false ballets; false dancing; false dealing; false repertories, and false
seasons.
A critic's - this critic's - accounts for 1993 are dismaying. Artistic
falsehoods abounded. How else to explain the Royal Ballet's diabolical
version of Don Quixote, in which not one single ingredient - design, text,
score, production, performance - was right, and a wonderful old ballet was
served up, in Coral Browne's memorable phrase about an actor 'like two tons
of condemned veal'. Consider, too, Glen Tetley's La Ronde, which was
deposited on the Opera House stage like an old Wienerschnitzel, with the
activities of its copious scenery more interesting than the relentless grind
(in any sense of the word) of its choreography. This was the year of David
Bintley's gnat-busy Tombeaux, and of his awful misreading of Sylvia for
Birmingham Royal Ballet. We were also faced with less than triumphant
novelties in a recent programme that went under the witless title of
White-hot and Different, with another piece from William Forsythe to hit out
at us, short but aggressive, like a child mugger.
The restoration of Ballet Imperial with nearly all the glorious Berman
designs, albeit not quite enough of the glorious dancing, was good news, as
were Irek Mukhamedov's appearances as Balanchine's Apollo (a grand hellenic
torso) and the Prodigal Son. He was also outstanding as Romeo, in Judas Tree
(which looked very fine), and seemed like Sisyphus as he tried to give some
momentum to Don Quixote.
Nina Ananiashvili was seen at the Opera House as a grand and Russian
Firebird (with Stuart Cassidy an excellent Ivan), and Darcey Bussell showed
an ideal physical sympathy for her Balanchine roles - clear and ardent.
Debut of the year at Covent Garden was Sarah Wildor's memorably intense and
luminous Juliet, exquisite, bright with promise.
Also on the side of truth, Birmingham Royal Ballet brought Ninette de
Valois' noble Job back to Covent Garden, and then took it to Coventry
cathedral (Dame Ninette had long hoped to see it in such a setting). We
admired Marion Tait and Miyako Yoshida, and the return of Massine's
Choreartium showed the troupe at its best. Standards of classic dancing were
otherwise less sure, and both Sleeping Beauty and Romeo were under-manned.
English National Ballet gained Derek Deane as a welcome new director, put on
a serious Bolshoi-style Swan Lake and a traditional Sleeping Beauty. The
best news was that Deane had started to polish the ensemble: performances in
Beauty looked truer, sharper than for years. Thomas Edur remains a shining
example of aristocratic style allied to dramatic sensitivity, and is thereby
unique on our ballet-scene. The indomitable London City Ballet - which, I
must suppose, Heaven rather than the Arts Council is determined to save -
closed and then re-opened. Hurrah] Hurrah, too, for Kim Brandstrup's Arc
Dance, also not favoured by the Arts Council, which continued to produce
valuable dance with Brandstrup's Antic.
The year's abundant falsities included suspect and fearsome goods from home
and abroad. I list, from a sense of duty but with considerable distaste:
Maurice Bejart's Lausanne troupe which brought farragos about Chaplin and
Italy that were a vexation to the spirit, and vehicles for Sylvie Guillem
(Sisi) and Koen Onzia (The Miraculous Mandarin, with Onzia as a transvestite
tart) which were made bearable by their central performances. The ill-named
Stars of American Ballet, Prague Festival Ballet, Batsheva from Israel,
Nederlands Dans Theater 2 (wonderful dancers; insupportable repertory) and
Nederlands Dans 3 (sheltered accommodation for dancers over 40); Scottish
Ballet looking glum in an unlikely Anna Karenina; the Cholmondelys and the
Featherstonehaughs in the tiresome Precious; Northern Ballet Theatre in a
spirit-lowering triple bill and an inexcusable Cinderella; an apotheosis of
Euro-trash in The Place's Dance Workshop Europe: these, and many more,
celebrated the rule of the tasteless or the inept.
The single worst event of the year - and like the Chinese water torture it
was slow and inexorable in its eight weeks of inadequacy - was the
Anglo-American television survey Dancing on BBC2, which combined garrulity
with political correctness and a stupefying inability to cope with its
subject. And as the apotheosis of what was wrong with 1993, let me cite the
proposed re-shaping of London Contemporary Dance Theatre (a troupe of which
we can be unabashedly proud) and the anticipated expansion of Rambert Dance
which, without Richard Alston, (who gave it an uncompromising but clear
image), is an unknown quantity. Contemporary dance is at the crossroads -
and that is where the dirty work takes place.
There were, though, great truths on view. The New York City Ballet's eight
week Balanchine Festival, featuring 73 of the master's works, was a grand
achievement, made even more glorious for me by the performances of Kyra
Nichols, who can do no wrong. I reported with greatest pleasure on
performances at the Paris Opera where the repertory is lively, and the dance
is radiant, both from such etoiles as the flawless Elisabeth Platel, Manuel
Legris and the recently promoted Nicholas LeRiche, and from serried ranks of
hugely gifted youngsters. Twyla Tharp's company and her dances also looked
very good on a visit to the Paris Opera.
Our own major visitors came from Russia. The Kirov made an odd impression at
the Coliseum. Their version of the Lavrovsky Romeo was a mistaken choice;
the omnipresent and flashy Julia Makhalina was not the best advertisement
for Petersburg classic style, and Farukh Ruzimatov removed himself after a
few self-parodying performances. Happily, certain younger ballerinas - Irina
Shapchits, Veronika Ivanova, Larissa Lezhnina - and the corps de ballet were
there to tell us of Kirovian excellence.
The Bolshoi stormed the Albert Hall. Here, I fear, is the shape of ballet to
come: huge arena, pop presentation, expensive tickets, dance as a
gladiatorial art, and seek in vain for many niceties of style or
choreography. Big ballet equals big bucks. The Grigorovich repertory can
sustain this exposure; the traditional classics looked bleached, beached.
There were heart-whole performances from the Bolshoi's dancers, with such
newcomers as Andrey Uvarov, Sergey Filin, Yury Klevtsov, Elena Palshina a
delight to see. And at the Edinburgh Festival, Mark Morris - despite losing
his theatre - reasserted the rule of fine and subtle choreography with his
thrilling Liebeslieder Waltzer and a triple bill, appreciatively recorded
here by Alastair Macaulay.
In surveying the year, certain things must be recalled with especial
gratitude. I have mentioned the unflawed dancing of Elisabeth Platel and
Kyra Nichols. The appearance of Mikhail Baryshnikov with the White Oaks
Project for two nights at Sadler's Wells, showed us sublimest artistry. At
an age when most male dancers have hung up their shoes, Baryshnikov - in
pieces by Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris - was as brilliant, as rhythmically
vivid and physically exhilarating, as the young divinity we first saw in
1970, and the great artist we knew in the succeeding decades. It was
miraculous dancing, life-enhancing. And Life-enhancing in a very different
way was a performance by Amici, a group of men and women variously and
seriously handicapped, who, under the leadership of Wolfgang Stange,
produced a dance piece (The Journey) which spoke eloquently of their
problems, of their aspirations, and of their gifts. Unlike much of what 1993
brought us, Amici's work is of great value.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: Bizarre saturnalia - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the social history of the world comes to be written, the saturnalia in
late 20th century Britain will make a bizarre footnote. For two weeks in
midwinter the nation closes down. Any days which are not weekends are
declared bank holidays. Transport comes to a halt. Dustbins, though
abnormally full, remain unemptied. Postal services cease. The streets are
deserted. And what is the population doing? Watching television.
As darkness falls at four in the afternoon visiting Martian sociologists
patrolling the roads would observe flickering electronic light seeping from
countless front rooms. Inside, in an atmosphere of pine needles, turkey
soup, and family tension, people sit and watch for hour after hour as the
entire history of American cinema is played out on the box: from the silent
antics of Harold Lloyd, via the astounding insults of Groucho Marx, to the
fin-de-siecle nostalgia of Michael J. Fox in Back To The Future III
(actually a hymn to an idealised Wild West) and Kevin Costner in Field Of
Dreams (an anthem to an idealised society where baseball provides the values
that the English once projected onto cricket). The oddest thing is that this
weird ritual grows longer every year, even though it is impossible to find
anybody who claims to enjoy it.
                         *      *      *
Having long ridiculed the French for their xenophobic panic over 'American
cultural imperialism' and their efforts to use the power of the state to
force fellow countrymen to stop watching American films and programmes and
watch French ones instead, it may seem odd, now, to start complaining about
American content on British television. But what matters, surely, is the
difference between coercion and persuasion. It is wrong to try to legislate
against public taste but right to scold ITV for offering us such a cynical
schedule on Christmas Day. Between 6.00 in the evening and 3.30 in the
morning they screened four American movies, one documentary about an
American songwriter, a half hour programme about American cinema, and 10
minutes of news. To make matters worse, the films were announced by a man
with an American drawl who said 'Eye Dee Vee and Diet Coke pre-zent eh movie
prer-mere' (to rhyme with 'revere'). Why? What is wrong with English?
Perhaps the drubbing that ITV took from BBC1 in the ratings battle will
persuade the commercial network to mend its ways. True, BBC1 did screen an
American movie at 9.10, but the rest of the comparable period was
all-British, from Only Fools And Horses to the mandatory repeat of The
Morecambe And Wise Christmas Show.
                         *      *      *
And were there really no worthwhile original programmes during the great
Christmas splurge? From Christmas week itself four were worthy of
remembrance. The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park's second animated cartoon
featuring Wallace and Gromit, not to mention a sinister penguin, will
probably win as many awards as his brilliant first work Creature Comforts.
Shown on BBC2 at teatime on December 26, it should and no doubt will be
repeated ad infinitum.
Guys, Dolls And D-Wing on BBC2 on December 29 was a white whale of a
documentary: an account of events inside prison which was unlike all the
other prison documentaries you have ever seen. Watching the pro-am
production of a musical inside Wandsworth gaol, you suddenly realised that
while sewing mailbags or listening to sociology lectures would never change
these men, fulfilling the extraordinary requirements of a stage musical just
might. It was tremendously heartening.
On the same night Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps And Their Johns (C4) was
disappointing even though it was so unusual as to remain memorable. Perhaps
we were expecting too much because Beeban Kidron had done so magnificently
well in directing Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. Here, with her documentary
review of sex-for-sale in New York, there was a lack of cohesion. It was
brave and honest, and neither glamorised nor demonised the protagonists, but
as a programme it might have worked better if the fat young pimp, 'Junior'
(who did an amazing consumer survey of street walkers with the camera on the
floor of the limo) had acted as host throughout.
The Railway Station Man on December 30 was promoted as the film in BBC2's
'Screen Two' series which brought together Julie Christie and Donald
Sutherland for the first time since their splendidly erotic bedroom scene in
Don't Look Now 20 years ago. Both, though especially Christie, still looked
good and, sure enough, there did still appear to be some sort of electric
charge between them. The drama, scripted by Shelagh Delaney from a book by
Jennifer Johnston, seemed deceptively slight, in the manner of William
Trevor. A story of love, politics, and the baffling power of art, it keeps
on growing in the memory.
                         *      *      *
And now, in the past few days, new series have begun to stream onto the
screen. Health And Efficiency (nothing to do with monochrome photos of
air-brushed nudists) on BBC1 on Thursdays is that rare phenomenon, a new
British comedy which looks as though it may actually prove funny. The
hospital setting is nothing new, but having marketing experts and a
management gorgon at the centre of affairs is. No promises, mind, because
opening episodes can be irritatingly unrepresentative, but this appears to
have potential.
On paper Broadway Stories (Channel 4, Saturdays) also looks like a winner,
but not on screen. Mike McShane, the outsize Canadian known from Whose Line
Is It Anyway and as Sandy Toksvig's partner in The Big One, narrates Damon
Runyon stories. We know how effective the lone actor/narrator can be from
Alan Bennett's unforgettable Talking Heads, and McShane has shown himself to
be a gifted comedy actor and possibly even a talented comedian. Yet the
first episode did not work. Having McShane cook himself up a hot drink in a
freezing New York apartment while telling the story was oddly distracting.
BBC1's new Sunday teatime serial, Smokescreen, may be popular, and it
certainly has strengths: a reasonable budget by the look of things, Timothy
West in a leading role, and an interesting milieu - early cinema in northern
England. Unfortunately, like so many previous British costume dramas, this
one appears to be in love with its period artefacts and locations. From the
museum-condition vintage motors to the cobbles in the street, nothing is
allowed to pass without a loving caress from the camera and a nudge to the
viewers; after all, children may be watching and they need to have such
things brought to their attention. This is British steam train drama of the
most mannered sort . . . though the story may yet prove strong enough to
distract us.
It seemed odd for BBC2 to screen the two-part Art Of Conducting on BBC2 on
Sunday and Monday so soon after the jokey and telling Omnibus on BBC1,
'Everything You Wanted To Know About Conductors', although this BBC2
offering was a more classic documentary. A veritable catalogue of clips
showed how keen Hollywood and television have been on these artistic
show-offs, and indicated again what a significant tool television has become
in modern history. Here is one more subject where television is obviously
far more powerful and useful than any book.
The first episode of Auction (BBC2 again) was schemed in such a way that
events inside Sotheby's were made to seem as exciting as, and not unlike,
the proceedings at those Antiques Roadshow rallies. A Pounds 4.5m Goya with
impeccable provenance was the centrepiece of a sale which also included a
Dutch panel painting taken from under her bed by a woman in Stockport and
sold, at Pounds 33,000, for twice its estimated value. More revelations
about Sotheby's charges (one per cent of the hammer price and Pounds 500
catalogue charges to the vendor) would be even more interesting.
It will be surprising if there is a better classic British thriller this
year than A Dark Adapted Eye, shown by BBC1 on January 1 and 2. A story of
secrets within a middle class family, of eccentricity bordering on madness,
of suppressed emotion in rural communities, and hidden passion abroad, it
was an outstanding example of what has become a strong tradition in British
television. Yet again Celia Imrie, this time playing a quietly neurotic wife
buried in a picturebook Suffolk cottage, gave a performance of great
intensity and power. Though it broke no new ground, this production created
an atmosphere and a sense of period that you could almost smell and feel.
If there is as much good television in every other week of 1994 as in Week 1
we shall have nothing to complain about.

The second of BBC2's programmes this week featuring new dance works, Dance
For The Camera, is a salute to the Wild West: wide open spaces, saloon doors
and plenty of leaping about. The choreography is by Yolande Snaith, music by
Graeme Miller, and Ross MacGibbon directs. The ballet is performed by Dance
Quorum (8.15).
The central character in ITV's new six-part police drama, 99-1, is described
hopefully as 'a cross between Callan, Man In A Suitcase and The Fugitive'.
This semi-bent copper is played by Leslie Grantham and we are told that the
police think he is corrupt while the crooks think he is still a copper. Who
knows, perhaps there really is still mileage in the grittily realistic crime
series (9.00).
Somebody somewhere has declared 1994 'The Year Of The Family' so BBC1 is
mounting a 90-minute programme called The Family Show. It's one of those
studio-based talk-ins which usually have too many 'experts' and too many
pre-recorded inserts, but we shall see (9.30).

FT  05 JAN 94 / People: Former shipmate comes aboard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perhaps appropriate that one of the first shore jobs taken by Sir
Julian Oswald, who stepped down as Chief of Naval Staff earlier this year,
is to join the board of an old shipping company whose directors have just
mutinied. Sir Julian, 60, has become a non-executive director of
Barrow-in-Furness-based James Fisher following the ousting of John Hornby,
the 48-year-old chairman.
Sir Julian has been brought on board by Sir David Hardy, a former finance
director of Ocean Transport and one of two non-executive directors who
joined the Fisher board at the end of June.
Sir David, a director of several companies including Hanson, is an old
friend of Sir Julian. Sir David used to be chairman of Swan Hunter which
built HMS Worcester, one of Sir Julian's last commands, and Sir Julian
arranged for Sir David to go to sea on a Nato exercise.
Sir David says he had wanted to recruit someone to the board who could help
restore the low morale at Fisher, which expects to lose money in the current
half year. He added that John Hornby, who has been chairman and chief
executive for the past four years, was an accountant and not a 'people
person'.
Pressure for change at the top of James Fisher, which manages several
British Nuclear Fuels ships in addition to its large short-sea fleet, came
from the charitable trusts which control nearly half its equity. The company
cut its dividend sharply last year and passed its interim dividend this
year, substantially reducing the trusts' income.
Sir David has taken over as acting chairman but has hired Sir John Trelawnay
of headhunters Goddard Kay Rogers to look for a replacement and a new chief
executive. In the interim, Trevor Hart, 43, managing director of the firm's
Coe Metcalf Shipping, becomes acting managing director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ingram Lenton has resigned from his position as non-executive chairman of
Compass Group on grounds of ill-health. He is also giving up his post as
chairman of Watts Blake Bearne.
Lenton had been with Compass, which lost its then chief executive, Gerry
Robinson, to Granada, in 1991, since 1987. The chairmanship will temporarily
be taken over by Robinson's replacement as chief executive, Francis Mackay,
though he said yesterday that the company hoped to place a new non-executive
chairman 'during the first quarter of the new year'.
At WBB, where Lenton had been for six years and its chairman since 1991, he
will be succeeded by Michael Beckett, a director and deputy chairman since
May 1992. Lenton's place on the board will be taken by Alan Lesser who,
until he retired in June 1993, was chief executive of RTZ Borax &amp; Minerals.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Farmers turning over a new
Leaf - Deborah Hargreaves considers an initiative which combines 'green'
agricultural methods and profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trees planted in the late 1970s are beginning to provide shelter on the
windswept acres of Stanaway Farm near Ipswich in Suffolk, and wildlife is
creeping back to the borders of wheatfields where new hedges have now
rooted.
Chris Hayward, who manages the farm, tries to use environmentally-friendly
methods of production while still making a profit.
'I hope we are addressing many environmental issues in the public eye,' he
says. He still sprays pesticides and fertilisers, but cuts down their use by
rotating crops regularly and analysing the soil to plan more carefully the
amounts of chemicals to use.
Hayward follows the low input/low output approach adopted by advocates of
'sustainable' farming - a current buzzword in the agricultural community -
and still manages to make a profit of more than Pounds 100 per acre.
Stanaway recently became the latest holding to join the Leaf initiative  -
Linking Environment and Farming - which was set up two years ago in the UK
as a way of encouraging farmers to produce in a more
environmentally-sensitive way.
Leaf is also partly a public relations exercise in an attempt to change the
popular image of farmers as antediluvian carnivores splashing pesticides
across the land.
'Farmers have an image problem,' says David Richardson, a Norfolk farmer who
is chairman of Leaf. 'Farmers will often preserve hedgerows and protect
habitats because they need them for shooting pheasants. They don't call this
conservation, they call it shooting.'
The greater environmental awareness among the European public is encouraging
many farmers to produce in less intensive ways. In addition, recent reforms
of the Common Agricultural Policy have laid increased emphasis on more
environmentally-friendly methods of production.
Some farmers are replanting hedges that were torn up in the drive to
maximise profits in the 1960s. They are leaving wide margins at the edge of
their fields so that weeds from the hedges do not seed into crops which
means they can then use fewer herbicides.
Leaf is one of several organisations trying to show the public that farmers
are doing much towards conservation while also running commercial farms. It
treads a middle road between the often unprofitable organic farms and
highly-intensive producers.
Richardson stresses that Leaf farmers are responding to financial incentives
to cut down on their use of chemicals. It is often cheaper for producers to
match their inputs of chemicals more closely to optimum crop yields. This
minimises the leaking of chemicals into the land and eventually, the
watercourses.
At the same time, there is no longer any need to splash out on fertilisers
and pesticides in the hope of squeezing every last bushel of grain from the
land. The public is weary of EU food mountains and Brussels is reducing
guaranteed prices to farmers.
These price cuts and the need to move towards world market levels for EU
farmers can give a marketing advantage to those who are using 'greener'
production methods. 'One of the ways the farmer will be able to make his
products more attractive to the consumer will be to ensure the customer
knows they were produced in an ethical way,' says Richardson. Large
retailers such as J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Safeway have joined
the organisation to provide the link to the consumer.
All Leaf farms have to abide by a set of guidelines on conservation. Other
specific advice for growing certain crops is also stipulated. Although
guidelines such as minimising inputs are often unspecific about target
levels, Leaf farmers must undergo a rigorous inspection process before they
can join.
One Leaf farmer, Robert Lawton who has a 1,500-acre dairy, arable and beef
farm in Wiltshire, recently won the Farmers Weekly and Dalgety award for
farmer of the year.
'One of the most important things from an environmental viewpoint is that
Leaf farmers are maintaining countryside features and habitats in good
health,' says Paul Wynne, land use officer at the Council for the Protection
of Rural England, who sits on the Leaf advisory board. 'These farmers are
preserving the hedgerows and ponds - commonplace features which farms can
lose without many of us even seeing it.'
In December, Stanaway became the 14th Leaf demonstration farm, which means
it will be open to touring parties of opinion-formers such as members of
parliament, local councillors, teachers and agriculturalists. The idea is to
influence other farmers as well as the public.
Leaf aims to have a network of demonstration farms with one in each county
on show in the next couple of years. In addition, it has around 30 other
members which adhere to its principles, but do not want to show the public
round.
As a way of reaching out to more farmers, Leaf recently sent out an
environmental audit to more than 200 farms to gauge their awareness of green
issues. The audit aims to help farmers to take stock of their existing
farming methods. It asks them questions about landscape features and
habitats on their farms, management of the soil, crop protection and
conservation of energy.
Caroline Drummond, Leaf project co-ordinator says she thought the audit 'had
made people think'. She hopes farmers will fill in the questionnaire every
year and record their progress on environmental issues.
Leaf, which is part of a wider European movement with offshoots in Germany,
Spain and Sweden, is partly funded by the large agrochemical and related
companies - Schering (Germany), Dalgety (UK), Willmot Crop Protection (UK),
Ciba (Switzerland), and Hydro Agri (the UK offshoot of Norsk Hydro of
Norway) - anxious to promote a 'greener' image.
They also hope to preserve a market which could be restricted by a public
backlash against using chemicals on the land.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Islanders count the cost of
climatic change - Two cyclones in 18 months have left Samoans with a sense
of unease and a Dollars 500m bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA PEGUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, Western Samoa was recovering well from Cyclone Ofa, the worst
storm to strike the Pacific island state in 20 years. The last thing it
needed was another large cyclone - but barely 18 months later came Cyclone
Val.
Cyclone Ofa caused Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) worth of damage and Cyclone
Val brought the total cost to Dollars 500m.
Despite a big clear-up, the devastation is still evident in many parts of
the country. A sea wall has recently gone up in the capital, Apia, and whole
villages remain deserted on the badly-hit western side of the islands.
Several hotels closed and have not reopened.
'We were still recovering from Ofa when Val came,' says Wes Ward,
information officer for the locally-based South Pacific Regional Environment
Programme.
Much of the damage caused by Ofa was coastal - it even destroyed houses on a
30m clifftop. Waves washed away the road to the airport in several places,
and while the runway was not affected, damage to the airport buildings meant
that no planes could land for three days.
It was so long since the islands had suffered such a severe storm that many
trees had grown up, only to be blown over and uprooted, bringing down power
lines and dislodging pipes. Samoans were left without power for five weeks
and without water for seven. Food crops were devastated, and 80 per cent of
the population relied on emergency food aid for three months.
While Ofa was considered the worst storm in 20 years, Val was the storm of
the century. It raged for four days, looping back on itself once it had
passed the island of Savai'i, with wind speeds averaging 100mph and gusting
up to 150mph. 'Strong winds from the south are very unusual,' says Noumea
Simi, head of the government's aid division. 'Now we don't know what to
prepare for - it could come from anywhere.'
As a wind-based cyclone, Val caused greater devastation than Ofa, especially
to buildings, including schools and hospitals, with repair bills running to
Western Samoan Tala 336m (Pounds 114m). Roofs were ripped off and leaks
damaged electrical wiring and interiors of houses.
Substantial damage was inflicted on 90 per cent of the buildings on Savai'i
and 80 per cent on 'Upolu, the country's two main islands.
Overseas aid proved to be crucial - and the expatriate Samoan community in
New Zealand was particularly generous.
The Samoan government responded by suspending import duties on building
materials - even though vast numbers of trees had fallen, the islanders were
still short of materials. Rehabilitation is not yet complete, but more than
half of all families have been able to rebuild their homes to their original
standard.
'I couldn't find where my house used to be,' says Pene Lefale, a Samoan
worker for Greenpeace. Many families took refuge in the sturdy concrete
water tanks found in every village, or even in Savai'i's caves. A few were
unlucky and had only a fence for shelter. 'You definitely thought your life
was in danger,' adds Lefale. 'There was no contact with the outside world.
The weather here has been more extreme on all fronts - the rains have been
heavier, and it has been hotter and more humid. We've realised we've entered
into something we've never experienced in our lives before.'
Apia's main street, Beach Road, and its major intersections were badly
damaged by the cyclone, and one bridge had to be totally reconstructed. The
harbour was destroyed, though not the new container park, and the ferry
building, transit sheds, stores and warehouses all had damage to their roofs
and or walls put at WST10.9m.
However, roads in the less populated island of Savai'i got the worst of the
cyclone: substantial stretches were washed away and pavements were badly
affected. The east coast road on 'Upolu suffered extensive destruction, and
an EC-funded reconstruction contract needed to be extended by two months,
bringing the total road repair bill to WST24.7m.
Food crops were the worst affected, with damage to bananas, breadfruit,
vegetables, taro, and other root crops put at 100 per cent - a WST44.2m cost
to the country.
Supplies lasted only a few weeks, and food supplies were critical for
months. It is likely to take several years before tree crops (estimated at
90-100 per cent damage and put at WST29m) can grow to fruit-bearing size.
Half the country's livestock was lost at a cost of WST12.5m.
The forestry industry was also badly affected, with the loss of native
forest timber put at WST100m. Total primary industry (agriculture) losses
amounted to WST200m.
Although the cyclone caused catastrophic damage, local people were quick to
repair their homes, hauling on roofs and tidying up. As Noumea Simi says, 'a
lot of people took the initiative, no one hung around and waited for the
government to help them.' 'People were very resilient,' Lefale says, 'they
went from village to village to help - it really brought the country
together.'
With two once-in-a-lifetime cyclones in 18 months, many Samoans are heeding
warnings on climate change and wondering when they will be struck again.
They have particular cause to worry, as Cyclone Val put an end to cyclone
insurance for many people. National Pacific Insurance now insists on a
certificate from a structural engineer and asks for extra premiums for
cyclone insurance - too much for most people or businesses to pay.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Jobs: Smoothing the way to promotion - Study pinpoints the
ways that organisations encourage the subtle art of buttering up the boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-one today, the Jobs column is. So now it has reached the
traditionally recognised age of adulthood, it might perhaps be forgiven for
raising an adult question: to wit, what are the real rules for getting to
the top in organisations?
My reason for asking is that over the years the answers fed to me in youth -
working hard, being technically skilled and the like - have increasingly
seemed childish fancies. What's more, my growing suspicion that political
operations are at least equally important has been strengthened by a trickle
of reports on such manoeuvrings by management researchers, some of whom have
even devised tests to identify the types of politicians involved.
For example, which of the following two recommendations do you readers think
is the more effectual as a rule for getting to the top? 1 - 'When you ask
someone to do something for you, it's best to give the real reasons for
wanting it rather than reasons which might carry more weight.' 2 - 'Never
tell anyone the real reason why you did something unless it is useful to do
so.'
Those of you who chose the second may care to know that you are on the way
to branding your-selves politicians of classic style. The two statements are
items from a test of Machiavellianism, defined as a propensity to be
deceptive and manipulative in dealing with other human beings.
Another, more specific mode of manoeuvring which has been pinpointed is
described by the researchers as 'a set of assertive tactics which have the
purpose of gaining the approbation of an audience that controls significant
rewards for the actor'. A simpler term is 'ingratiation' or, more bluntly,
'buttering up the boss'.
The most revealing study* of it which the Jobs column has seen is the work
of a team led by Samuel Aryee of the National University of Singapore, who
confidentially questioned 214 fellow Singaporeans working as managers or as
professional specialists such as engineers in eight organisations, spanning
both the public and the private sectors. The researchers' aim was
*Published in the International Journal of Human Resource Management, Vol 4,
No 1.
to discover the circumstances in which ingratiating tactics were most apt to
thrive.
A particularly topical focus of the study was on the prevalence of the
manoeuvre in employing outfits of different size and complexity. The reason
for the topicality is that - if counter-productive politicking is more rife
in bigger organisations, as many theorists believe - it should have been
reduced by two recent developments.
The first, which has definitely been taking place wholesale, is the
'delayering' exercises in which large companies have scrapped whole tiers of
middle management. The second, which seems to be more talked about than
actually put into effect, is the 'empowering' in which authority formerly
held by the discarded middle rankers is handed down to the shop-floor.
Besides taking account of organisational size, however, the the researchers
examined links between ingratiating tactics and various characteristics of
the 214 employees. One was whether they were managers operating through
other people, or specialists directly responsible for their own results. A
third was the extent to which the quality of their work could be gauged by
objective yardsticks, as distinct from being measurable only in subjective
ways. A fourth was whether their immediate boss had personal power to reward
them richly with promotions or the like, or whether such decisions were made
farther up the hierarchy.
So what were the findings?
It turned out that ingratiating tactics on the employees' part were most
strongly linked with the power of the immediate boss to bestow rich rewards,
and with jobs in which performance could not be objectively measured. The
prevalence of the tactics was also significantly greater among the managers
than among the more individually operating specialists.
But, alas for the hopes that politicking has been reduced by delayering,
ingratiating behaviour was just as rife in the smaller organisations as in
the larger. Worse, since the empowerment of lower-level jobs would make them
less subject to measurement by objective yardsticks, the study's findings
suggest that the handing down of authority would result in increased
political manoeuvring on the shop-floor.
O
ddly enough, Singaporeans also figure prominently in the table below which
sheds some light on a question often asked by people considering taking a
job overseas: 'How much would it cost to keep up the same living standard
for my family?'.
As in previous years, the figures are provided by the Employment Conditions
Abroad consultancy, which keeps check on international pay-rates and the
like. Anyone wanting to know about its services, which cover more than 150
countries, should contact Barry Rodin at 15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; tel

The pattern for the exercise is a middle manager such as the head of
marketing in a medium sized company, from each of the nine countries
covered. Starting with their typical gross salaries in their homeland. the
table shows their typical annual outlay on consumer goods, housing costs
excluded, on their own territory together with the price of keeping up the
same buying habits in the remaining eight countries.
Other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates of
mid-December. The nationalities are ranked by their costs of their
purchasing patterns in the eight countries other than their own - which
gives the Singaporeans pride of place for overseas expensiveness, and the
thrift award (as always) to the Japanese.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Management: Mysterious case of the vanishing career ladder -
Tomorrow's bosses are being left to find their own way to the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time managers spent their careers climbing the company ladder a
step at a time, in a straight line towards the top.
The upward journey taken by today's managers is more circuitous. Now that
the old corporate hierarchies have been dismantled, the ladders have gone
and it is often unclear what counts as the next step up.
Moreover, in many companies there is no longer a paternalistic personnel
department showing ambitious employees the way. Now that everybody is
'empowered', they are meant to 'own' - ie be responsible for - everything,
including their careers.
This laissez-faire approach to nurturing tomorrow's managers came under
attack at a recent seminar in London attended by personnel directors of
large British companies.
According to Andrew Mayo, director of human resource development at ICL,
many aspiring high-fliers are getting lost, and may even be leaving their
jobs because they feel stuck. 'I listen to people who say that 'there used
to be five slots between me and the top. Now I can't see the way forward, so
I've decided to go outside'.'
A survey conducted by GHN, the management consultancy which hosted the
seminar, shows that 19 out of 20 companies believe it is important to
develop high-fliers. Yet half do so passively, arguing that the full
responsibility for career progression should rest with the individual, not
with the company. Indeed, many of these companies now frown on the very word
'career', preferring instead the vaguer euphemism 'personal development'.
Yet the task for which top managers are being groomed - or grooming
themselves - is increasingly onerous. The days when someone could rise
through a single department such as marketing or finance and emerge at the
top, are gone. Business leaders need broad experience of different
functions, and different markets. They need strategic vision, political
skills, communication skills, team leading skills, a clarity of mind as well
as the ability to change and be flexible. It is a tall order.
Mayo argues that companies wanting to help equip managers for such a role
must intervene to make sure that the right training and experience is going
to the right sort of people. 'If you want to develop true general managers
you need to help them and make interventions.'
He also argues that if you leave it to the aspiring managers themselves you
may miss some people with real potential. He says the laissez-faire approach
penalises women: 'The kind of person who pushes themselves needs to do it 24
hours a day,' he
explains.
Deciding to intervene is one thing - getting it right is another.
Companies pick out their high fliers in a bewildering variety of ways. Some,
such as Amstrad, have traditionally gone for a seat of the pants evaluation,
leaning heavily on the culture and style of Alan Sugar, the company's
founder.
At the other extreme are the multinationals - IBM or Shell, for example -
which use complicated systems of appraisal, often backed up with high-tech
wizardry, that plot the career profile of individual managers and map that
against the needs of the company.
Having selected the high-fliers, companies develop them through a mixture of
outside training and work experience: and both routes are strewn with
obstacles.
Sheila Forbes of Reed Elsevier argues that companies are too willing to pay
enormous sums on training tomorrow's bosses, sending them to business
schools without any clear idea of what they are getting out of it. 'Often
the standard MBA approach doesn't help. The problem is how you get the
management trainers to work with you, rather than simply adopt an MBA
approach. We need to ask ourselves if we are demanding enough as clients of
the providers of management education'. She says it is a mistake to put
someone through these courses (which might take them out of the office for
two or three months) only to return them to the same job afterwards. 'During
those courses people move on, and they want a new challenge when they come
back.'
Practical problems of moving people around the organisation can be even
greater still. Blue Circle, the building materials group, owns a number of
autonomously-managed companies. It believes that top managers do not make
themselves, and that candidates for the top need experience of different
parts of the group. Without stage managing from the centre it would be
impossible for managers to jump from one subsidiary to another.
To meet its needs, Blue Circle has developed a five-to-ten year management
succession plan, and is moving its hand-picked managers round the world, to
ensure that each will have the right sort of experience for a future at the
top. 'In theory it is simple,' says Peter Mutter, personnel director. 'We
ensure there is enough training so they have a tool bag of skills and then
we supplement that with experience.'
However, the company has found that its subsidiaries blanch when they are
asked to give up their high fliers so that they can get more experience
working for another part of the group.
The answer, says Mutter, is to negotiate each case, in some cases giving in,
in others holding out.
Some companies doubt the worth of such an interventionist approach. In
particular, they argue there is little point in drawing up a detailed
corporate plan for the future and then attempting to train the people to fit
that plan. 'Five years ago we used to look at the business plan and then at
the people,' says Mike Haffenden, director of personnel at Hewlett-Packard
(UK). 'Now we don't know what the business plan is. So we help individuals
grow as people first.'

FT  05 JAN 94 / Management: Adapting to change - Jozef Cornu is well-placed
to capitaliseon Alcatel-Alsthom's rapidly evolving markets / Euromanagers to
watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I have never been just a technology nut,' says Jozef Cornu. But the
director of technical affairs at Alcatel-Alsthom, the Paris-based
telecommunications, engineering and transport group, has a glint in his eye
when he explains the rapid pace of technical change in the
telecommunications sector and the business opportunities it creates.
From the development of cellular and cable technologies to the growing
importance of software and broad band transmission, Cornu describes in
detail the directions of the group's rapidly evolving markets. 'Almost
anything is possible now,' he says, referring to the upheavals in the US and
European telecoms industries.
Such enthusiasm about technical matters helps to explain Cornu's ascent to
the top echelons of one of Europe's fastest-growing industrial groups.
Alcatel-Alsthom's net profits have more than trebled since 1988 to reach an
expected FFr7bn (Dollars 1.19bn) in 1993. Annual sales have risen to more
than FFr160bn. The rise is largely the result of heavy investment in new
technology and its applications. As head of these operations, Cornu is at
the cutting edge of group strategy.
He is also at the sharp end of several substantial management challenges -
how to develop and commercialise technology, and how to do so in a group as
geographically diverse as Alcatel-Alsthom.
On the first count he has the advantage of knowing his technology. Cornu
completed a doctorate in electronics at Carleton University in Ottawa and
has subsequently kept track of the new developments in relevant research.
'Not all technicians adapt to business,' he says. 'But I do not regard it as
a disadvantage to know what you are talking about.'
Scientific aptitude alone, however, counts for little. For Cornu, it has
been complemented by commercial experience gained from a winding career
through various technology-based companies.
His first job was at Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group,
where he worked in the research department. In 1973, he joined a subsidiary
of ITT in Belgium, his homeland, to start its micro-electronic design
activities. Nine years later he was appointed general manager of a telecoms
joint venture between ITT and the regional investment company in Flanders
and in 1984 he became general manager of ITT's Belgian subsidiary.
The big move, however, came in 1987. The merger between the
telecommunications activities of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and the
telecommunications operations of ITT gave birth to Alcatel and brought Cornu
into the new company.
Put in charge of the key telecoms switching division, he successfully
developed the rival digital systems of ITT and CGE, expanding their combined
market share from about 17 per cent then to about 20 per cent today. He was
appointed to the Alcatel board in 1988 and to the board of Alcatel-Alsthom,
the mother company, in 1992.
The trail, which has led Cornu through Belgium to Canada and Paris and
through companies of different nationalities, appears fitting.
Alcatel-Alsthom is one of the world's most international business groups,
with a management base in Paris, a financial base in the Netherlands, a
joint venture with GEC of the UK, and three-quarters of its sales from
outside France.
But its diversity also poses a problem - how to manage such a dispersed
group and how to harness technology from the group's various research
facilities.
For Cornu, the solution is to adapt management to the strengths of diversity
rather than to impose a rigid centralised influence. One example is in the
appointment of local managers. Whereas Siemens' overseas operations are
often headed by Germans, and Ericsson's by Swedes, Cornu argues in favour of
local appointments.
'We have national people even at the subsidiary level. We have Brazilians
running our operations in Brazil and Australians in Australia,' he says.
'The biggest benefit is that you can use the talents of many nationalities.
The most mobile people in a company are not always the best.'
Cornu is also an advocate of decentralisation within each management group.
'The greatest danger for big companies is to be too rigidly structured, too
formal,' he says. 'We have to maintain the dynamism of a small company,
which involves being open and relatively informal. In that respect we are
not a typically French company.'
For Cornu this dynamism requires a high degree of delegation. 'You have to
give people responsibility. You cannot manage through formal reports.'
This in turn places a strong emphasis on the appointment of subordinates.
'Attracting the best people will continue to be our biggest challenge,' he
says, arguing that the group's large advertising expenditure is aimed at
potential employees as well as clients.
But channelling the various international operations and managing a
decentralised group requires a strong system of communications.
At the level of research, Cornu's domain, the solution is partly based on
what he refers to as the general relations agreement. Under this agreement,
technical information from Alcatel's various operations is pooled and is
accessible to all companies in the group. To finance research, each company
pays a percentage of sales to a common fund. The application of technology
is determined by a research director in Paris.
If communication within the group is an important part of Cornu's management
creed, so too is contact with the client. 'Just three years ago this was a
relatively predictable industry. Now everything is changing very quickly.'
The best example is the US where the four levels of telecommunications
operators - regional and long distance, cable and cellular - are battling to
enter each other's territory.
The result, says Cornu is that Alcatel's customers are no longer 'sleeping
beauties'. They are, he says 'much more awake and have much more flexible
strategies. I need to have my ear much closer to the ground, to know what
customers are doing and to match our research to the changes in the
industry'.
So far, so good. The rise in the group's sales and profits and its
resilience to recession reflect Alcatel's ability to adapt. Having undergone
a personal transition from technology to the marketplace, Cornu is well
placed to help steer the group through the same transformation.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Life policy agents say disclosure rules will cut business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telling potential customers the commission they will pay when they buy life
insurance will make them shop around and reduce life and pensions business
overall, says a survey of sales agents.
About one-third of tied agents - life company appointed representatives - in
the survey said they would leave the industry if commission disclosure
reduced their income. The survey also included independent financial
advisers and members of direct sales forces.
About three in 10 of the direct sales agents said they would leave the
industry if their income fell because of commission disclosure.
However, just over half of all those questioned said that if disclosure
reduced their income, they would fund their activities by increasing their
business and number of clients.
The poll was carried out in November and has been published by the Life
Insurance Association. It comes as the Treasury considers the draft rules
put forward by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, for requiring sales agents to disclose commission on life
products.
The new rules are expected to come into effect late this year.
The association said the responses to a questionnaire from 1,006 of its
members underlined the industry's concern that the proposals for disclosing
commission would not reflect a fair balance of the charges and expenses of
the different distribution channels for life products.
About two-thirds of respondents said they thought commission disclosure
would make clients shop around, mainly on the basis of cost, though this
view was less widely held among IFAs than among other categories of sales
agents.
Of those responding, 64 per cent thought the change would mean a reduction
in life and pensions business. A clear majority thought it would increase
the pressure for the client and sales agent to split the commission, a
practice known as 'rebating'.
Mr Lawrence Hawthorn, association president, said the survey reinforced the
industry's impression that disclosure could dilute people's commitment to
taking out cover.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Buy-out proposed at closed colliery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A management buy-out has been proposed at Hatfield colliery near Doncaster,
British Coal confirmed yesterday.
If successful, it would be the first in England during the current round of
pit closures. A buy-out has also been proposed at Betws colliery in south
Wales.
Mr Jeff Ainley, Hatfield's pit manager, has written to Mr Neil Clarke,
British Coal chairman, informing him of his interest in heading a management
buy-out team for the pit.
Hatfield employed 260 men when it closed on November 18, down from 450 a
year earlier. The pit, sunk from 1911 to 1917, can produce coal for the
domestic, industrial and power station markets. In 1992-93 its output was
nearly 550,000 tonnes. From April 1993 to its closure, it lost more than
Pounds 8m.
British Coal said: 'If the management team at Hatfield pursue their interest
to the tender stage their submission will be considered on the same criteria
as all other applicants.'
A total of 28 closed pits have been advertised for lease and licence,
including four where the closing date for applications is January 21 -
Littleton and Silverdale in Staffordshire, Frickley at Pontefract, West
Yorkshire, and Hatfield. British Coal said it had received preliminary
indications of interest for these four.
Interest has also been expressed in the four pits advertised last month, for
which the closing date was yesterday. These are Bentley near Doncaster,
Calverton near Nottingham, Rufford near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and
Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear. All ceased production last year.
British Coal would not identify the bidders. However, RJB Mining and
Caledonian Mining are believed to have expressed interest in Wearmouth. RJB
is also believed to be looking at several other pits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three men appeared at the Old Bailey in London yesterday charged in
connection with an IRA attack last year on a gas holder at Warrington,
Cheshire. The assault would have caused the loss of many lives if all the
bombs had exploded, the jury heard.
Pairic MacFhloinn of Dublin and Denis Kinsella of Nottingham deny causing an
explosion likely to endanger life, attempting to murder a policeman, causing
him grievous bodily harm with intent, kidnapping a motorist, attempting to
murder a policeman in a pursuing car and possessing a firearm with intent
last February. Denis Kinsella's uncle John Kinsella, also of Nottingham,
denies possessing Semtex with intent.
The trial was adjourned until today.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Record sales for mobile phone groups
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's two leading mobile telephone operators reported more than 120,000
net new connections in December, easily the highest monthly total since the
launch of cellular networks in the mid-1980s.
Vodafone, the largest operator, reported a net increase of 52,500 in
December, taking its total to more than 1m.
Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor,
reported a net increase of 68,700, taking its total to 906,000. Cellnet
added more connections in December than during the whole of 1992.
Vodafone and Cellnet together made a net addition of nearly 750,000 new
subscribers during last year, taking the total number of UK cellular
subscribers, including Mercury One-2-One, the third network, to nearly 2m.
Cellnet yesterday launched a digital cellular network operating to the
pan-European GSM standard (global system for mobile communications). It
competes with a similar service started by Vodafone last autumn.

FT  05 JAN 94 / MPs may probe milk reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons agriculture committee is likely to hold an inquiry into the
reorganisation of the Milk Marketing Board if government objections to the
board's plans to become a farmers' co-operative are not rapidly resolved,
Alison Maitland writes.
The milk market in England and Wales is due to be opened to competition on
April 1 after 60 years of domination by the board, which buys all milk from
farmers and sells it to dairies.
But the government's rejection of the board's plans last month has cast
doubt over whether approval can be achieved in time. The government was
responding to European Commission objections to the board's proposal to
transfer the bulk of its assets directly to the new co-operative, Milk
Marque.
Board officials are this week meeting the Dairy Trade Federation, which
fears Milk Marque will in effect be a new monopoly.
The delay has pushed back the flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's dairy
products subsidiary.

FT  05 JAN 94 / NHS deputy chief to take top post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuity in the senior management of the National Health Service was
signalled yesterday by the government's appointment of Mr Alan Langlands,
deputy chief executive, to succeed Sir Duncan Nichol as chief executive.
Mr Langlands, 41, a career NHS manager who joined as a graduate trainee, has
a similar background to Sir Duncan. His previous posts include managing the
Middlesex and University College hospitals in London. He was general manager
of North West Thames regional health authority before becoming Sir Duncan's
deputy in 1992.
The appointment of Mr Langlands to the Pounds 88,190-a-year post will please
senior NHS managers, who believed someone with a strong background in the
service was needed. They had feared that the government might make an
outside appointment.
The chief executive and the Leeds-based staff of the management executive
are responsible to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, for daily
management of the service.
Mrs Bottomley said the challenges facing Mr Langlands would include:
improving performance and maintaining proper stewardship of resources;
handling strategic change in London and other cities where hospital closures
were proposed; and streamlining top NHS management.
Mr Langlands will have to pick up some controversial issues when he takes
over in April. A substantial hospital-closure programme is in prospect in
London and other cities, and the planning of this has to be made compatible
with the freedoms of purchasing authorities in the NHS internal market.
Mr Langlands will also have to oversee the introduction of new codes on
corporate governance following financial scandals in the West Midlands and
Wessex regions.
Legislation to abolish regional health authorities from 1996 is to be
introduced next year. The regional line of command will then be through
offices of Mr Langlands' management executive.
Sir Duncan - the first career NHS manager to be chief executive - is leaving
to head a new centre for international healthcare management at Manchester
University.

FT  05 JAN 94 / BBC pulls out of contract magazines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC Enterprises, the commercial wing of the BBC, has sold its
contract-magazine interests responsible for publishing customer titles for
companies such as Marks and Spencer and American Express.
The change has led to an effective split of Redwood Publishing, the magazine
publisher in which the BBC has held a 77 per cent stake since 1988. At
present Redwood publishes four contract magazines and a raft of magazines
such as BBC Good Food Guide.
Redwood, now wholly owned again by its founders Mr Christopher Ward and Mr
Michael Potter, will consist of the contract titles only.
Redwood's present consumer titles, ranging from BBC Gardeners' World and BBC
Clothes Show Magazine to BBC sports magazines, will become part of BBC
Magazines.
The decision to sell the contract-magazine business followed a review of all
BBC commercial activities as part of the corporation's response to the
government's green paper on its future. The BBC will concentrate on
magazines with direct links to its programmes.
Mr John Thomas, managing director of BBC Enterprises, said yesterday: 'The
BBC's review of its commercial activities has provided the trigger for the
two areas of business to separate.'
The BBC declined to give details on the financial transactions involved in
the deal.
Redwood Publishing will continue to operate from its headquarters in Camden,
north London. The BBC magazines launched by Redwood will also stay there.
Mr Ward said yesterday that his company planned to expand its base in
publishing customer magazines and was also interested in developing
magazines for other media organisations. BBC Television had nine out of the
top 10 programmes on Christmas day and took a 68.4 per cent audience share.
Over Christmas week the BBC took a 50.7 per cent share.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Yeo defies calls to resign over affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, yesterday rejected calls for his
resignation over an extra-marital affair with a Conservative councillor.
Mr Yeo has been criticised by officials in his South Suffolk constituency
since admitting last month that he is the father of the councillor's child.
Senior backbench Tories have contrasted Mr Yeo's behaviour with his comments
on the need to reduce the number of single mothers, and the government's
promotion of traditional family values. However, he has the support of Mr
John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman.
Mr Yeo said yesterday: 'I am absolutely confident that I won't have to
resign.'
Interviewed on BBC Radio, he said he regretted his 'foolish' behaviour. But
he added: 'I don't believe that in any government there are such demanding
standards that those individuals who make mistakes should be regarded as
unfit for office when it is quite clear that none of those actions have any
direct relevance to the tasks which those ministers perform in the
government.'
Last night Mr Yeo met constituency officials, who said a statement would be
made this morning. Formal criticism by the local party executive could force
his resignation from the government.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Tunnel prompts Stena to simplify ferry fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition on cross-Channel ferry routes will intensify today when Stena
Sealink announces a simplified fare structure modelled on the format adopted
by Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, which is due to open in May.
Stena, which on Monday said it would wait until the official announcement of
Eurotunnel's tariffs next week, will today unveil its 1994 fare structure. A
standard return for a car and five passengers on the Dover-Calais route will
start at Pounds 126 rising to Pounds 220 in the peak season.
'The company is scrapping the traditional industry system of price bands
linked to sailing times in favour of a new simplified fares structure,' it
will tell travel agents at a presentation in London today.
'The old system was a way of fine-tuning our prices which had its merits but
it required a degree in statistical analysis to understand,' Stena says.
In future there is to be one price per day within four seasonal bands and
supplements for peak weekend travel. Ending the complicated tariffs will
make it easier for travel agents to sell tickets, the company says.
The standard return fare on the Dover-Calais route will be Pounds 126
between January and March, Pounds 188 from March to July, Pounds 220 from
July to September and Pounds 188 between September and December. This
represents an increase of 'a couple of per cent overall' on the 1993 fares,
it says.
Similar increases will be made on all of its seven routes to the Continent
and Ireland.
Stena says it does not intend to enter into a price war with Eurotunnel or
the other ferry operators. Eurotunnel might be able to charge a premium for
speed but it could not match ferry operators such as Stena with Pounds 60m
vessels offering a choice of restaurants and other facilities.
Eurotunnel is due to announce tariffs next Tuesday. It is expected to offer
return tickets of between Pounds 160 and Pounds 220 to Pounds 260 in the
summer, with premiums for busy weekends.
P&amp;O European Ferries said it would wait until Eurotunnel's formal
announcement before revealing its 1994 tariffs.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Rifkind attacks Scottish gallery plan for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and Edinburgh MP, yesterday joined
objections to last month's decision by the National Galleries of Scotland to
move much of its collection to a new gallery in Glasgow.
He said that aspects of the plan were 'unacceptable and do not deserve
public support'.
The National Galleries of Scotland intends to create a gallery of Scottish
art in Glasgow. It would display many of the paintings by Scottish artists
now in the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art in
Edinburgh. It would also feature all the paintings in the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, as well as pictures not currently on display.
When the new gallery was proposed in 1991 there was no suggestion of it
being anywhere but Edinburgh. But Glasgow offered accommodation more cheaply
and consultants said a Glasgow gallery would receive more visitors.
The plan has been attacked by leading figures in Edinburgh. Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, has said the government will not contribute to its
Pounds 20m cost.
Mr Rifkind attacked the plan because it would entail removing the most
important Scottish paintings from the National Gallery and closing the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Government accused of 'learning no lessons and doing very
little' over sinking of tanker Braer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was accused yesterday of 'learning no lessons and doing very
little' as a result of the sinking of the tanker Braer in Shetland a year
ago today, James Buxton writes.
Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the
government had refused to hold a public inquiry into the disaster, the
wreckage of which can still be seen off Garth Ness (above).
The government has yet to publish the report by the Marine Accident
Investigation Branch into the disaster and has refused to provide radar
surveillance of the channel between Shetland and Orkney. The inquiry on
marine safety around the British Isles has also yet to report.
The Liberian-registered Braer spilled 85,000 tonnes of crude oil when it
grounded. About 1,500 sea birds died but storms dispersed the oil. The
Shetland salmon farming industry lost about Pounds 20m because some fish
were contaminated and became unsaleable.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Youth Training scheme challenges the 'thick' image: A
Northumbria initiative aims to put quality before quantity in tackling
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Most people think you are thick if you go on Youth Training,' says Ms Katie
Wetherston, who believes her decision to join the scheme instead of going to
college like most of her friends, was the best thing she has ever done.
Ms Wetherston is one of a few hundred young people involved in an innovative
re-modelling of YT in Northumbria. She says she has received the same
business and finance qualifications as her friends but a better training for
the world of work. She is a YT trainee at Snyder General AAF, which makes
heating and ventilating systems.
Her training scheme is being evaluated by the government for the 'modern
apprenticeship' it wants to launch in 1995 as part of a drive to improve
craft, technician and supervisory skills in the UK.
The Northumbria scheme is a radical move. Traditionally YT has been
overwhelmed by the politics of youth unemployment. The government guarantees
a place on the scheme to all unemployed young people. And most local
training and enterprise councils, which administer the scheme in England and
Wales, have gone for volume over quality.
Normally YT lasts two years and individuals, who may or may not be employed,
work towards semi-skilled qualifications - level 2 of the National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). Many trainees drop out before achieving
qualifications.
The Northumberland Tec is going further, subsidising employers to provide
higher quality training to craft and supervisory levels. These are level 3
or level 4 NVQ standards, which can require up to four years training.
The scheme has attracted young people of the calibre of Ms Wetherston, who
has nine GCSEs, because it offers progression to a high-quality
qualification. Snyder General likes it because it gets more financial help
to produce a highly skilled and motivated employee.
But it costs money. The Engineering Training Authority estimates that while
it costs up to Pounds 7,000 to provide training to NVQ level 2 in
engineering, it could cost an employer who took the young person on as a
full-time employee up to Pounds 20,000 (discounted for productive work) to
train and pay wages to NVQ level 3.
'The amount of additional funding the government is offering does not seem
to be sufficient to fund a major expansion,' said Mr Ken Jones, chief
executive of the Engineering Training Authority who nevertheless is keen to
explore the new apprenticeship.
The Department of Employment, which spends about Pounds 800m a year on YT,
has not been explicit about funding of the new scheme.
Maintaining the budget - given that rolls on YT will fall because of more
people staying on at school - will mean the amount it will spend per person
aged between 16 and 19 on improved career advice and work-related training
will rise by up to 25 per cent over the next three years. Those on the
modern appren-ticeship are likely to receive more.
An incentive for employers may be a repackaging of subsidies, with more in
the first year when the trainee is normally at college and therefore
unproductive in the workplace.
A number of issues are still to be explored. There will be a large-scale
debate within Tecs and the government as to how young people will be
selected for the scheme.
To attract employers there is a need to distance the new scheme from YT. But
this could also ghetto-ise those left on mainstream YT.
A key element of the new scheme will be that employers will be asked to sign
a pledge with the young person that they will see the training through to
successful completion. There is no such arrangement for YT.
Both parties will have to take the arrangement more seriously, so that
employers feel more confident about investing in training and trainees
become more motivated than at present to stay on a training scheme.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Rover to launch Discovery in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Land Rover yesterday announced an April launch for the Discovery
four-wheel-drive vehicle in North America. The move is expected to quadruple
its sales in the US.
The company, which is part of Rover vehicles group, will slot the Discovery
between its existing US sales of the luxury Range Rover and the utility
Defender ranges. The launch is expected to push Land Rover production to a
record level this year.
Output at Land Rover's Solihull plant rose by 18 per cent to 68,000 last
year, its second best year. Weekly output jumped from 1,290 last January to
1,830 in December. The four-wheel-drive division of the Rover group added
600 jobs, bringing its workforce to 8,500.
Mr John Russell, Land Rover commercial director, said sales in the US last
year rose by 15.9 per cent to a record 4,907.
Discovery prices in the US will begin at just less than Dollars 30,000
(Pounds 20,270). The vehicles will include dual front passenger airbags and
anti-lock brakes as standard equipment, and an extended warranty.
The prices will be well below UK levels to allow the Discovery to compete in
the lower-priced US market against vehicles such as the Ford Explorer and
Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Meanwhile Chrysler, the US vehicle maker, has enjoyed growing success with
the UK launch of its US-built Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler four-wheel-drive
vehicles. Almost 4,000 were sold in 1993, double the initial target.
Rover has run into resistance from white-collar workers reluctant to switch
jobs to the assembly line, Mr David Bower, the company's personnel director,
said yesterday, Richard Donkin writes.
Only 60 clerical staff have made the move after a request for 1,000
volunteers in November, designed as a move towards more flexible working
patterns that could help secure the company's promise of no compulsory
redundancies among the 33,000 workforce.
Mr Bower said that the company would now probably need to recruit as many as
500 new workers after the period for volunteers expired in May. Most staff
were being added at the Swindon and Solihull sites, he said, adding: 'We
would not force people to do this. If we ended up doing that it would not be
in the spirit of what we are trying to become.'

FT  05 JAN 94 / House prices show increase of 'twice the inflation rate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices rose by more than 3 per cent last year, more than twice the
latest published annual inflation rate, says Nationwide, Britain's
second-largest building society.
The society's figures, published yesterday, are thought to be at odds with a
house-price survey due to be published tomorrow by Halifax, Britain's
biggest mortgage lender.
According to Nationwide, house prices rose on average by 0.8 per cent in
December, or Pounds 438. The society said that in the past 12 months the
price of an average home had risen 3.3 per cent to Pounds 53,571.
The Halifax survey, based on a larger sample of mortgage loans than the
Nationwide's, is understood to point to a much more subdued recovery rate.
Halifax is expected to say that the rise in house prices last year was close
to the general rise in annual inflation of 1.4 per cent in November.
This would mean that, according to Halifax, prices fell by less than 1 per
cent last month. December is traditionally one of the weakest months of the
year for house sales.
The society has said it expects the pace of recovery to accelerate this
year, although it has warned that there still could be occasional monthly
price falls.
Halifax has forecast that prices will rise by about 5 per cent this year,
with the number of sales expected to rise by about 15 per cent. Nationwide
internal forecasts are thought to take a similar view.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said yesterday: 'The
modest upturn in the UK economy in 1993 has led to an increase in confidence
in the housing market which in turn has been reflected in the rise in house
prices in the last 12 months.
'As the economic recovery continues we expect confidence in the housing
market to continue to improve in 1994, resulting in an increase in the
number of transactions as buyers take advantage of the lowest mortgage
interest rates for 20 years. This could well be translated into further
price rises during 1994, probable slightly outpacing inflation.'
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at brokers UBS, said the figures
firmed up predictions of a steady rise in prices this year.
He added: 'Prices, whichever numbers you look at, have started to rise again
 -at least in line with general inflation. This, together with better
unemployment figures and the fact that houses are the most affordable for at
least 15 years, should encourage the confidence of potential house-buyers.
'The snowball of recovery is beginning to grow in size.'

activities, but are to continue talking about co-operation.
The plan, which has been under discussion since the summer, would have
created the UK's largest single lobbying voice for manufacturing industry.
But it has fallen victim to opposition from the EEF's 14 powerful regional
associations.
Mr Nick de Jongh, the federation's director of external affairs, confirmed
yesterday that a merger of the two organisations' central functions was now
'off the agenda'.
But over the next few months the CBI and EEF will hold talks to identify
precise areas where they could work together to industry's advantage.
The CBI said: 'The talks are still continuing and we still expect some sort
of proposals to be formally put to the councils of both bodies in due
course. Until then, there is nothing further to add.'
Cancellation of the plan for a merger of the central parts of the two
organisations will come as a relief to staff at the much smaller EEF. But it
is likely to disappoint big companies, which would have had one fewer
organisation to join.
As a federation, the EEF could not have approved a merger without backing
from its regional associations, which provide a range of services to 5,000
member companies based on policies produced centrally.
Although the associations would have retained their identity, Mr de Jongh
said they were worried that policy might no longer be 'tailor-made' for the
engineering industry if the central functions of the EEF were subsumed into
the CBI or its National Manufacturing Council.
Both organisations had been hoping that a tie-up would enable them to lobby
more effectively and efficiently for industry. But Mr de Jongh said this was
still possible, as the EEF would be put on its mettle to identify when it
should work together with the CBI and when separately.
Some EEF functions could still be combined with counterparts at the CBI, he
said. 'But any change is likely to be evolutionary rather than
revolutionary. Our members did not want a 'big bang'.'

FT  05 JAN 94 / Heathrow road link plan dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Pounds 800m plan to improve road and rail links between Heathrow airport
and south-west London has been dropped by the government two months before
the end of the consultation deadline.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said there had to be a
strong case for a plan which would mainly benefit local communities at a
time when there was pressure on public spending.
The Department of Transport would consider more limited measures if local
authorities were prepared to make suggestions, he said.
The decision was criticised by Movement for London, a pressure group headed
by the British Road Federation and including organisations such as the
Automobile Association, the Confederation of British Industry and the Road
Haulage Association.
It said: 'Government-appointed consultants have spent years and millions of
pounds looking at the problems of road and rail access to the world's
busiest airport. For the Department of Transport to reject proposals before
consultation has even finished is a disgrace.'
The group said transport problems around Heathrow were not a local issue and
were of strategic significance.
Consultants spent five years preparing a report that was published last
August. It recommended a new road link between the A3 at Kingston and
Heathrow, including a new Thames crossing, costing Pounds 580m. It also
proposed a rail link between Kingston, Heathrow and Waterloo station in
central London costing up to Pounds 250m.
The early decision to drop the plans was taken to end uncertainty, Mr Norris
said.
A Pounds 300m rail link between Heathrow and Paddington station in west
London is not affected by the decision. The service is due to start in 1997.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Bus chief queries BR bid guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bus companies interested in bidding for parts of the British Rail empire
will draw little comfort from merger guidelines announced yesterday, one
leading bus operator said.
The Office of Fair Trading published a guidance note intended to help
potential bidders decide whether they would infringe monopolies rules. The
companies most likely to encounter problems are bus companies that operate
in the same region as the rail franchise they are interested in buying.
However, Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman of Badgerline Holdings, a
Bristol-based company, said: 'A lot of it is very broad-brush guidance. They
say they will look at the transport market in an area as one market and not
as several different markets (depending on the mode of transport used). That
makes us more uncomfortable. It is not necessarily helpful in terms of
co-ordinating bus and rail transport.'
In mergers involving rail franchises it is relevant to consider the extent
to which other public transport services compete with or complement the rail
service, the OFT said. But differences in price, comfort, convenience,
availability and speed make it unlikely that the OFT would consider all
public transport services to be substitutes for each other.
'It is not absolute differences in prices, quality, etc. that determine
whether different products are in the same market but the extent to which
customers would switch from one product to another in response to changes in
prices and other conditions,' the OFT said.
The OFT pointed out that while a 25 per cent market share was the statutory
threshold for determining whether a merger qualified for a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, this did not automatically trigger a
reference. Market structure, the degree of competition between the two
companies before the merger and competition from other companies would also
be considered.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Leftwing hopes for NCU poll hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top job in the National Communications Union, the main union in British
Telecommunications, looks less likely to swing to the left after the
intervention of a Workers Revolutionary party member who is likely to split
the hard-left vote.
The NCU already has a left-dominated national executive. Mr Bill Fry, the
union's leftwing president, is expected to mount a strong challenge to Mr
Tony Young, the general secretary, in the vote for his job later this month.
But Mr Fry's chances may have been damaged by the last-minute decision of
the Trotskyist Mr David Wiltshire to stand. Mr Fry is also handicapped by
having spent most of his working life at Royal Mail rather than at BT, where
the bulk of NCU members work.
During the next few months the finishing touches will be put to a merger of
the 130,000-strong NCU and the rather larger postal workers union, the Union
of Communication Workers. Some NCU activists fear that Mr Fry's postal
background would make him too favourably disposed to the UCW in the
negotiations.
The result of the election will be known by mid-February. If Mr Fry does win
it is likely to signify a tougher fight over the next wave of redundancies
being sought by BT.
In his election address Mr Fry attacks the 'low profile' of Mr Young's
leadership and calls for more passion and protest. Mr Young, general
secretary since 1989, says there is no point recalling an 'industrial era
which no longer exists'.
Mr Young's low-profile style can claim some successes. BT has one of the
best redundancy packages in industry and last month the company agreed to
withdraw a controversial system for assessing which staff should be made
redundant.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Women managers progress faster than male counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Women who break through into top managerial posts possess attributes
enabling them to progress faster than their male counterparts, the British
Psychological Society's conference heard yesterday.
Mr Tuvio Melamed, a lecturer in occupational psychology at the University of
Central Lancashire in Preston, said women who rose above the 'glass ceiling'
managerial barrier had the sort of qualities that marked them out as top
executives.
However the price of success could be associated with a risk to mental
health. He said: 'The struggle of getting there makes them more introverted
and anxious than men because the environment in which they have to work is
so hostile.'
Mr Melamed said career success for men was related to qualities of extrovert
behaviour, dominance and confidence but this was not reflected in women
high-flyers. Women needed to be 'more men than men' but also needed to
fulfil additional criteria for success.
'Managerial women have to deal with extreme pressure and experience more
severe degrees of tension and instability than their male colleagues,' he
said.

Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, has had its current procedures and
auditing controls cleared by its professional body.
The Audit Registration Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales said yesterday that it had decided to propose no
regulatory action.
Its conclusion follows a special 'non-routine' visit from members of the
profession's Joint Monitoring Unit which was triggered by the issues raised
by Coopers' audit of the Maxwell groups of companies and pension schemes.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's most senior
regulatory body, is separately conducting an investigation into the Maxwell
affair, including Coopers' role.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Further delays for Iraq arms inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry faces further delays because of difficulties
in arranging the appearance of key witnesses, it emerged yesterday, Jimmy
Burns writes.
Public hearings are now expected to continue possibly into April, with
publication of the final report unlikely before the summer.
Lord Justice Scott began public hearings in May, and had hoped to begin
writing his report last month. The schedule was later revised so that the
hearings would end early this year.
Officials close to the inquiry blame the delays on the problems encountered
in securing ministerial support for a 'rolling programme' of witness
appearances.
Lord Justice Scott is understood to be particularly concerned by the
attitude towards his inquiry of Lord Trefgarne, a former defence and trade
minister, who has not replied to two separate questionnaires sent to him in
September and November. Lord Trefgarne said at the weekend that he would be
letting the judge know during the next two weeks whether he was prepared to
appear as a witness.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Recruiters 'rank honesty highly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses place a far higher value on honesty, integrity and
enthusiasm for the job when recruiting young people and are less worried
about work experience or vocational and academic qualifications, a report
said yesterday.
The study's findings, reported at the British Psychological Society's
occupational psychology conference in Birmingham, appeared alongside other
research which showed that managers preferred job applicants to admit their
mistakes at an interview rather than blame their failings on others.
The study carried out on 498 small businesses by Hull University and Newland
Park Associates, a firm of occupational psychology consultants, investigated
selection methods used when companies were recruiting people under the age
of 20.
The researchers also found that companies in manufacturing and production
placed less emphasis on education and vocational qualifications than those
in the financial and business services sectors.
Many companies in the study were happy to recruit from initial telephone
inquiries or a 'knock on the door' rather than insisting upon written
applications. Job selection was based typically on a single unstructured
interview.
'The smaller the employer, the more they seem to rely on gut reaction and
first impressions,' said Professor David Bartram of Hull University, who
headed the study.
In a second report, Ms Jo Silvester, a Leeds University psychologist, told
the conference that job seekers who admitted their personal failings at
interviews were more likely to be successful than those who hid their
mistakes behind a veneer of perfection.
The research was based on tape-recorded interviews between employers and 45
undergraduates seeking jobs with a City law firm and a national distribution
company. Ms Silvester said: 'People who use excuses or pass the buck on to
others are actually seen as quite arrogant by interviewers and create a bad
impression.'

FT  05 JAN 94 / Peasant army embarrasses Mexico: The insurrection in Chiapas
may alter government policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attack by up to a thousand armed peasants on four Mexican towns in the
southern state of Chiapas presents the government of President Carlos
Salinas with an acute political problem.
Despite the negligible military threat from the rebels, who were last night
reported to be retreating, the uprising comes at a time when the government
is keen to project Mexico as a peaceful and stable country ready to become a
member of the first world of rich nations. The insurrection offers a very
different image, and underscores the social and political difficulties ahead
as Mexico joins the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The troubles coincide with the beginning of the campaign to elect Mr
Salinas's successor this August. If the violence continues, Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's candidate, may have
to go further in making social development rather than economic reform the
key element of his political platform.
The uprising has already led to nearly 90 deaths, and countless more victims
have been wounded. The rebels have ceded control of three of the four towns
seized on New Year's Day - San Cristobal, Las Margaritas and Ococingo -
while reporters visiting Altamirano, which had been held until early
yesterday, said they saw no sign of them.
Known as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the guerrillas declared
war on the government on behalf of the country's indigenous people. They
said they timed the New Year's Day insurrection to coincide with the formal
enactment of Nafta, a treaty they said would be a death sentence for
natives.
Their fight was for 'work, land, housing, food, health care, education,
independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace'. Most of the rebels are
poor Maya natives from the region, although some of the leaders are reported
to be from the centre of the country. They appear well-financed and
organised, suggesting perhaps links with drug or arms smugglers. The
government quickly painted them as radical groups with little popular base
or support, and bent on violence at no cost. An official said they were
supported by Guatemalan guerrillas and other Central Americans, and had ties
to the leftist clergy in the state.
However, government critics see the violence as the product of the extreme
poverty and repression afflicting Chiapas for centuries. It is by some
measures Mexico's poorest state, with lowest levels of installed
electricity, literacy and school attendance rates in the country. The state
is dominated by political bosses who belong to the PRI, and has one of the
worst records of human rights abuses by the police and army. Disputes over
land have turned into violent clashes between poor peasants and the rich
landowners who control the economy of the state.
Last year the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, an independent US
organisation, accused Mexico's military of torturing indigenous peoples in
the state. Other reports by Amnesty International and Americas Watch have
catalogued similar abuses.
The Minnesota report concluded: 'The lawless practices of the Mexican
military have been increasingly tolerated at the highest levels of Mexican
government.' The charges were denied by the government-controlled Human
Rights Commission, but have long been made by the local Catholic Church,
which actively supports the rights of natives.
While Mr Salinas's economic reforms have made many Mexicans better off, they
have yet to improve the lot of the rural poor, most of whom are found in
southern states such as Chiapas. According to the government statistics
institute and the United Nations, the number of people living in extreme
poverty in rural areas increased from 6.7m in 1984 to 8.4m in 1989 and 8.8m
in 1992.
During the past four years the government has poured billions of dollars
into the Solidarity anti-poverty programme, of which Chiapas has been the
biggest recipient. However, this programme has not been able to offset the
impact of the removal of agricultural and other subsidies, and the decline
in prices of products such as coffee.
The opposition to Nafta reflects a widely held view that the south of Mexico
is unlikely to benefit as much as the north or the centre. Many Chiapas
workers live off corn they produce, or on coffee farms. Under Nafta, Mexico
will gradually open up to corn imports, and demand for farm labour is
expected by most economists to fall sharply.
The government's immediate response to such problems is to pour more money
into the state. The social development minister said on Monday the
government would establish new programmes to address the problems of the
region. It remains to be seen whether such spending will be sufficient, or
if a broader political solution to the rights of indigenous peoples is
necessary.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: GM to sell European luxury car in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors is planning to produce a luxury car in Europe for sale in
North America under the Cadillac brand name.
The project will mark the US carmaker's first substantial export of cars
from Europe to North America since the early 1960s and will be the first
European-produced GM car to be sold under a North American nameplate.
The programme is expected to be approved in the next few months, with the
car going into production in early 1996 in Germany at the Russelsheim plant
of Opel, GM's main European subsidiary.
The three-litre V6 engines for the car will be produced in the UK at
Vauxhall's plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, while automatic transmissions
will be made at GM's plant at Strasbourg.
At the Detroit motor show yesterday, GM unveiled a prototype version of the
car, the Cadillac LSE (Luxury Sedan Euro-style).
It will allow the carmaker to compete for the first time with the Japanese
luxury car brands Lexus and Infiniti, launched in the US at the end of the
1980s by Toyota and Nissan.
The European-built Cadillac is being developed as a derivative of GM
Europe's new top-of-the-range Opel/Vauxhall Omega executive car, to be
launched in Europe soon.
It is understood that GM is aiming to produce in Germany up to 40,000 units
a year of the Cadillac.
The product marks an important step in the globalisation of GM's vehicle
development and engineering, which is seen as a way to cut costs and make
better use of the company's worldwide resources.
GM is also planning for the first time to export to Europe a version of its
next generation US-produced MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the
Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Espace.
Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, yesterday said the programme for a
European-produced Cadillac was 'one of the most significant intern-ational
projects GM had under-taken'.
The new car represented a cost-effective way to integrate the group's global
resources 'with a fraction of the investment' that it would have taken under
the more traditional approach of developing the car in North America.
'It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate
platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region
can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another,' he said.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US turns to Europe for steel needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American steel companies, buoyed by the economic recovery, have been
importing large amounts of European steel to meet rising demand from the
motor industry and other prospering sectors.
With the bulk of the US industry's anti-dumping and countervailing duty
cases now on appeal, US companies have been focusing on production.
According to Mr Horst Buelte, president of the American Institute for
International Steel, producers are now among the largest importers, bringing
in semi-finished steel, because demand is 'so huge that the capacity is not
sufficient'.
'US mills are working 89-90 per cent capacity utilisation,' he said.
'Production bottlenecks and full order books in 1993 have forced US mills to
turn to foreign suppliers for large quantities of semi-finished steel like
slabs and billets.'
The American Iron and Steel Institute, which represents steel companies,
says imports from the EU rose almost 37 per cent between October 1992 and
October last year.
At the same time, imports from Japan fell by almost 33 per cent.
The greatest beneficiary of the surge was Italy, which has been resisting EU
plans to reduce excess production.
Italy's exports to the US rose almost 290 per cent to 156,205 short tons
between October 1992 and 1993. Over the same period Danish imports rose 90
per cent; Greek imports 85 per cent; Belgian, 58 per cent and British, 4.7
per cent.
Imports from Germany totalled 303,893 tons, a 21 per cent increase.
However, while US imports have been rising to accommodate the recovery,
exports have been falling as overseas markets dry up.
From October 1992 to October last year foreign sales dropped 15 per cent to
290,000 tons.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Venezuela oil group's earnings leap
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's national oil company's net earnings climbed to more than Dollars
1.3bn (Pounds 870m) last year, sharply up from Dollars 338m in 1992,
according to official estimates.
The increase came despite weak international oil prices and a heavy domestic
tax burden.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), one of the world's largest oil companies,
had a 1993 operating profit of Dollars 7.4bn on gross revenues of Dollars
21.6bn. However, it paid Dollars 5.6bn in taxes.
In 1992 the group's operating profit was Dollars 7.7bn on gross revenues of
Dollars 21.4bn. It paid Dollars 7.2bn in taxes.
The company's profitability was boosted by greater efficiency and
productivity, reorganisation of some functional areas and less burdensome
taxes, officials said.
Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines, said the company
would make capital investments of Dollars 4.2bn this year, the highest
figure in the company's 19-year history.
Its 1994 investment plan should provide a shot in the arm for Venezuela's
flagging economy, which logged 1 per cent negative GDP growth last year.
Mr Parra said most of the capital outlays this year would go to projects for
increasing PDVSA's crude oil production capacity and for upgrading its two
largest home refineries. Capital outlays in 1993 were Dollars 3.7bn.
PDVSA, which has substantial equity holdings in oil refining and
distribution companies in the US and Europe, is carrying out a 10-year,
Dollars 48.5bn capital investment programme. One of its main goals is to
raise oil production potential to at least 4m barrels a day by the year
2002.
The company planned to contract new international debt of about Dollars 637m
this year to help finance its investment programme, the minister said. It
ended 1993 with total indebtedness of Dollars 4.2bn.
Security was increased in Venezuela's overcrowded prisons yesterday after a
riot and mass breakout at two separate institutions left more than 100
prisoners dead.

'Red' Adair, whom oil producers turned to for decades to fight the world's
worst oil well fires, said yesterday he had sold his business and was
retiring from active duty, Reuter reports from Houston.
Global Industries of Louisiana bought his company, Red Adair Co Inc of
Houston, for undisclosed terms. Pressed on the price, he said: 'I can't
count that high.'
Mr Adair, 78, is retiring from day-to-day operations but Global said he
would provide public relations and business development services to Global
under a personal service contract.
Born in Houston, he won a reputation for fearlessness by fighting oil and
gas well fires and blowouts around the globe in a career that began in 1938
and was capped by his success in bringing 119 burning Kuwaiti wells under
control after the Gulf war.

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Global tourism climbs by 3.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of international tourist arrivals worldwide last year was about
500m, a 3.8 per cent increase over 1992, according to the World Tourism
Organisation.
International tourism receipts rose 9 per cent to Dollars 324bn (Pounds
219bn). The East Asian and Pacific region recorded the highest level of
growth last year, with arrivals up 11.8 per cent to 68.5m.
Tourist receipts in the region rose 15.2 per cent to Dollars 52.6bn.
The Americas recorded the second highest growth, with arrivals up 5.6 per
cent to 106.5m and receipts up 14.3 per cent to Dollars 95.5bn.
Travel within North America fell as a result of difficult economic
conditions but tourists from Europe compensated for the shortfall. The
Caribbean and Latin America had a successful year, the organisation said.
Europe remained the world's largest tourist destination, with 296.5m
arrivals last year and receipts of Dollars 162.6bn. This represented growth
over 1992 of 2.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively.
Northern European countries had a difficult year, while eastern and central
European destinations recorded strong growth.
The eastern Mediterranean held up well.
Growth in tourism to Africa was also limited, with arrivals up 2 per cent to
17.9m. Tourism receipts were healthier, however, growing 8.7 per cent to
Dollars 6.4bn.
The losers last year were the Middle East and south Asia. The organisation
said the Middle East had failed to maintain its post-Gulf war promise, with
arrivals down 8.4 per cent to 7.2m. Receipts fell 7.4 per cent to Dollars
4.9bn.
In south Asia, arrivals fell by 1.4 per cent to 3.4m, with receipts down 2.9
per cent to Dollars 2bn.
The organisation said it expected international tourist arrivals to rise to
661m by 2000 and to 937m by 2010.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's leading power engineering group, has won
a Dollars 150m (Pounds 101.3m) order to supply spare turbine parts over a
nine - year period to Midland Cogeneration Venture (MCV) of Midland,
Michigan, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
MCV is a limited partnership formed in 1987 to acquire the useable part of
an unfinished nuclear power plant at Midland and to complete it as a
gas-fired combined heat and power plant. The plant, which started up in
1989, is powered by 12 ABB gas turbines producing 1,370MW of electricity and
up to 0.6m kilograms per hour of process steam.
MCV is 49 per cent owned by CMS Energy, the local electric utility, with
smaller stakes held by industrial companies in the area, including Dow
Chemical and Fluor, and ABB.
ABB said the order was signed last week and so would be booked in 1993.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Offer to clear Falkland mines
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has offered to fund the clear-up of about 30,000 mines still
littering the Falkland Islands 12 years after the conflict with Britain,
writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, said Argentina would pay an
unidentified 'third country' to remove the mines, which dot large swathes of
land outside Port Stanley, the islands' capital. A Foreign Ministry official
said this might be done in co-operation with the UN.
British officials have welcomed the offer 'in principle' but said it raised
complex questions. They noted that Argentina kept no maps of minefields or
records of the quantity of mines laid.
Furthermore, the plastic mines are difficult to detect, and their detonators
deteriorate with time, making explosion unpredictable.
The offer is part of Mr Di Tella's so-called 'charm offensive' to overcome
the Falklanders' deep suspicion of Argentina. He has broadcast to the
islands, met Falkland councillors in London and sent Christmas gifts to
inhabitants.
However, on Monday, the 161st anniversary of the British occupation of the
Falklands, the Foreign Ministry restated Argentina's 'inalienable rights to
sovereignty' over them.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Gun dealers in US face tighter curbs: Sharp rise in licence
fee aims to eliminate 80% of 'traders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration plans to follow up its initial success in winning
restrictions on gun sales by pressing for tougher controls on gun dealers.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, yesterday outlined plans for a sharp
increase in the fee charged by the government for a gun-dealing licence,
with the aim of eliminating 80 per cent of those now licensed to trade in
firearms.
It has been so easy and so cheap to obtain a federal licence that many
people go through the minimal paperwork required just so they can order guns
from outside their home states and benefit from manufacturers' discounts.
Most of the 244,000 dealers now licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, a division of Mr Bentsen's Treasury department, operate from
their homes. Many do not comply with state and local licensing requirements,
but the bureau has been barred from refusing a licence for such
non-compliance.
Mr Bentsen said he would ask Congress to raise the licence fee to Dollars
600 (Pounds 405) a year from its current level of Dollars 10, which he
described as not just ridiculous but 'all the way to reckless'.
The annual fee is already due to rise in February to Dollars 66 for a new
licence and Dollars 30 for a renewal, as a consequence of the Brady law -
passed in December by Congress - which would impose a waiting period on
handgun buyers.
Higher fees 'should eliminate 200,000 dealers, leaving only the actual ones
in place,' Mr Bentsen said. By reducing the number of dealers, the bureau
could monitor remaining dealers more closely.
Mr Bentsen also promised measures to improve the bureau's computerised
records.
Fear of crime and violence has become the most prevalent concern cited in US
opinion polls, and this has given fresh momentum to efforts to control gun
sales.
Besides the Brady law, other measures are under discussion in Congress that
would ban the sale of certain categories of assault weapon and ammunition.
At the same time, sales of firearms, especially handguns, have soared. Many
people who favour gun controls have bought weapons for their own protection,
while others have sought to stock up to pre-empt any ban that Congress may
pass.
The idea of a national registry of guns has also been floated, although with
an estimated 200m guns already in circulation in the US this would probably
prove fruit-less.

Expansion of Hong Kong's port, already hostage to approval from the Chinese,
faces further delay as the colony's government and private consortiums
building the new Container Terminal Nine (CT9) thrash out agreement on
funding and land availability.
Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), a subsidiary of Hutchison, and the
other Kwai Chung container terminal operators yesterday urged the government
to tackle outstanding problems, or risk capacity shortfalls of 1m TEUs
(20-ft equivalent units) by 1997.
Mr John Meredith, managing director of HIT, said the government should
allocate an additional 34 hectares of back-up land, which would let
HIT boost its capacity by 1m TEUs a year from its existing quay waterfront.
Mr Mark Leese, managing director of Modern Terminals, one of the three
contractors to the CT9 project, claimed the government was short-changing
operators on attached infrastructural work. Operators agreed to undertake
certain infrastructural work - for which the government is to reimburse them
 -in exchange for the development rights.
He claimed the actual cost of this work was HKDollars 3bn (Pounds 263m)
higher than government estimates, and said the discrepancy would be a hurdle
to reaching agreement.

Venezuelan authorities said that two rival bands of prisoners began fighting
late on Monday afternoon and set fire to prison buildings. Units of the
National Guard were called in to crush the ensuing riot.
Meanwhile, 40 prisoners escaped and nine were killed while trying to flee
Tocoron prison, 75 miles south-west of Caracas, while government officials

FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Colombia finds friends in drive to open up
 -Two free trade deals are blazing a trail which the government hopes will
end in Nafta membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombia advances further on the road toward regional economic integration
this month as it enters two important free trade agreements.
A trade accord with Chile came into operation at the start of the year,
while the Group of Three agreement between Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela is
due to be signed later in the month. President Cesar Gaviria is also pushing
hard to make Colombia one of the first South American countries to join the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
'In practice, we can be eligible for Nafta on all conditions - democratic
tradition, economic stability, foreign investment legislation and
deregulation,' said Mr Juan Manuel Santos, the foreign trade minister. 'The
Group of Three and our other regional integration accords are preparing the
ground for this step.' Although Colombian products already enjoy special
access to the US, the treaty would provide a more permanent trade framework
and other benefits.
The internationalisation of the economy has moved fast in the last three
years. Colombian producers are no longer limited to an inward-looking market
of 33m people, but can plan for an expanded community of 180m, says Mr
Santos. Average tariffs have come down from 40 per cent to 11 per cent and
imports are soaring. Foreign investment has also begun to grow in response
to the government's efforts to sell Colombia abroad.
The US is Colombia's most important trading partner - in 1992 imports from
the US jumped by 40 per cent and they continue to rise. This year Colombia
will have an overall trade deficit of more than Dollars 500m (Pounds 337m),
something which does not alarm government economists because international
reserves are more than Dollars 8bn, equivalent to at least a year's worth of
imports.
Colombia - already a member of the Andean Pact which groups it with
Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia (Peru's membership has been temporarily
suspended) - is already boosting exports among Andean Pact countries and
trade between Colombia and Venezuela rose to Dollars 1.1bn in the first nine
months of 1993, about 30 per cent up on 1992.
The agreement with Chile will quickly lower tariffs on a wide range of
agricultural and industrial goods - non-tariff barriers are being eliminated
immediately and tariff levels on nearly all traded goods will be down to
zero by 1999.
The Group of Three agreement, planned to come into effect in April, will
reduce tariffs gradually over 10 years and encourage investment flows
between countries. The combined gross domestic product of Colombia, Mexico
and Venezuela adds up to Dollars 310bn and Ecuador and Bolivia have shown
interest in joining the group.
Next year Colombia also expects to formalise trade accords with the
Caribbean community (Caricom) and with central American countries.
The excitement generated by such moves has infected the private sector
which, after hanging back rather fearfully, has become enthusiastic about
new trade and investment opportunities. Improved policy co-ordination
between government and industry is already apparent now that businessmen
accept the official view that the opening of the economy is irreversible.
Decades of protection from imports have stunted industrial development and
competitiveness. Colombia has relied on its advantages - including
resources, climate, location and cheap labour - to export products largely
based on natural resources.
Poor transport, energy and telecommunications put companies at a
disadvantage, in particular those based in Bogota and the centre of the
country. However, the government has begun to tackle some of these problems:
for example, the restructuring of the ports has already speeded up
operations and improved turnaround time.
Violence plays a large part in discouraging investment, but for those who
look at Colombia in more detail, 'it implies a cost and is a manageable
risk', said Mr Armando Vegalara, director of the Colombia investment
corporation, Coinvertir.
'The guerrillas are the most important factor for the foreign investor
because they're against private property . . . but Colombia has political
stability and a stable legal framework too. People often find this
extraordinary.'
Foreign investment - excluding the oil sector - rose by 55 per cent to
Dollars 395m for the January-December period. The US and Venezuela topped
the list and the most popular sectors were chemicals and finance. 'There's
great interest in telecommunications, power plants and services associated
with oil,' said Mr Vegalara. 'We've had several visitors from Japan, I think
there's a change of attitude.'
Colombians often blame the low rate of foreign investment on the country's
bad image, ignoring the disturbing reality of assassinations, human rights
abuse, terrorism and corruption. 'I tell people that everything they read
about the violence is true - but that they should look at all the other
things Colombia has to offer,' said a foreign economic expert.
One of Colombia's principal advantages is its economic track record and
outlook. Debts are being paid, economic growth is steady and inflation has
not been allowed to run wild. The 1993 growth rate was about 5.2 per cent,
and similar growth is expected in 1994.

A Chinese city and a Russian one have agreed to build a cross-border free
economic and trade zone, Reuter reports from Beijing. In the first such
venture between the two countries, Heihe in China's northeastern province of
Heilongjiang and its neighbour Blagoveshchensk in the Russian Far East will
set up the zone from either end of a pontoon bridge to be built over the
river separating them.
The zone, 10 sq km of land from each country, is expected to become a
transit centre for goods and passengers.

India yesterday rejected Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue to a
change in New Delhi's stand on the Kashmir issue, and cautioned that this
might cause a delay in settling other bilateral problems such as control of
the Siachen Glacier, the demarcation of a maritime boundary in the Sir Creek
area, nuclear non-proliferation, and stabilisation along the line between
the two countries, Shiraz Sidvha reports from New Delhi.
Mr JN Dixit, India's foreign secretary, said yesterday a stalemate on the
Kashmir issue had not been broken in talks with Pakistani officials in
Islamabad but India was prepared to continue talks as long as no
pre-conditions were set.

A British warship is being sent to South Africa this month for the first
time in 27 years, symbolising the revival of official military contacts
between the two countries, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. One of
the Royal Navy's latest frigates, HMS Norfolk, is to visit Cape Town and
Simonstown from January 27.
UK officials said the visit was not directly linked to military sales,
although Britain has begun sounding out opportunities and South Africa is
known to be interested in offshore vessels.

Government jets bombed fighters loyal to warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum
while Mr Rabbani's infantry made advances, pushing back the front line in
the south of the city. Fighting spread in the north around Gen Dostum's base
of Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of Balkh province, in the battle for supremacy
between the president and Gen Dostum, backed by Mr Rabbani's arch-enemy,
Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
The Iranian embassy has meanwhile offered to negotiate a peace settlement.

Britain yesterday ordered Sudan's ambassador to leave the country within 14
days in retaliation for Khartoum's decision last week to expel the British
ambassador, Reuter reports.
Britain had given Sudan until yesterday to reverse its decision to expel the
British ambassador, a move triggered by a visit by the Archbishop of
Canterbury to mainly Christian areas in rebel-controlled southern Sudan. Mr
Mark Lennox-Boyd, junior foreign office minister, summoned Sudanese charge
d'affaires Abdurrahman Bakhit and told him Britain was expelling the
ambassador, Sayed Ali Mohammed Osman Yassin, with regret and disappointment,
the Foreign Office said.
The expulsion was a consequence of the Sudanese government's unsatisfactory
explanation for its action in expelling Mr Peter Streams, the British
ambassador. Mr Yassin is also Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, and
is now in New York.

<TEXT>
Zambia's Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga resigned yesterday, saying he
wanted to give the government time to investigate allegations of drug
dealing by cabinet members, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
Mr Mwaanga, 49, denied he was involved in drug trafficking or corruption
scandals swirling around President Frederick Chiluba's beleaguered
government.
But he told a news conference: 'I want to inform the nation of my decision
to stand down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect.' Mr
Mwaanga said he wanted to give the government time to investigate
allegations of corruption, drug trafficking, misuse of public funds and
abuse of office by civil servants. His successor has yet to be announced.
Zambia's leading western donors demanded an end to alleged high-level drug
trafficking and corruption as a pre-condition for financial aid at a
consultative meeting in Paris last month. Zambia already has a
balance-of-payments financing gap of Dollars 96m (Pounds 65m) for 1994,
which donors said they would not cover until the government rid itself of
'corrupt individuals'.
Three 'clean' government ministers claimed last week that four of their
colleagues, whom they did not name, were involved in drug dealing. Most of
the deals were said to involve shipping highly addictive Mandrax sedatives
from India, where they are made, to South Africa.
A western diplomat described Mr Mwaanga's resignation as 'a welcome first
step' but said it was not enough.
Mr Mwaanga is a founder member of the ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy. He entered politics in 1960 and served as a diplomat of the
former United National Independence party government of Kenneth Kuanda and
in various cabinet positions including finance and foreign affairs.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Mideast talks in stalemate with resurgence of mistrust:
Arafat and Rabin are playing a dangerous game; the winners could be the
opponents of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have slumped into a dangerous stalemate with
the resurgence of mutual mistrust, suspicion and misunderstanding. The two
sides are so far apart they are only communicating intermittently by
telephone and fax.
With implementation of the accord already delayed more than three weeks and
little prospect of an immediate breakthrough, there is open talk on both
sides of the process falling apart.
Palestinians and Israelis still realise they have more to lose than gain
from allowing the peace process to fail; but both sides appear at a loss to
find a way of climbing out of the pit they have dug for themselves.
At the heart of the dispute is a fundamental misunderstanding on the accord
reached in secret talks in Oslo and signed on the White House lawn in
Washington last September.
To reach agreement, after years of bloodshed, both sides purposely left huge
areas vague and open to interpretation. The accord was supposed to provide
the Palestinians, after a five-year interim period, with 'something more
than autonomy in Gaza-Jericho but less than statehood'. Between those two
political poles lay a wide and murky grey area.
From the beginning both sides sold the agreement differently to their own
sceptical constituencies. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, argued - in the face of widespread internal
criticism that he had sold out the Palestinian cause - that the accord did
lay the basis of statehood.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, assured an Israeli public deeply
concerned about security and the PLO's violent past that the accord did not
concede a Palestinian state. Conflict was inevitable and different
perceptions of the two leaders on the Oslo accord eventually came to a head
over the two main obstacles to an agreement: control of borders and the size
of Jericho.
For both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin the same principle is at stake: how much
sovereignty the Palestinians will exercise in Gaza-Jericho once Israeli
troops withdraw. The latest compromise proposal by Israel, decribed by
Israeli officials as a 'final offer' which must be accepted by the PLO as a
basis for further talks, has been rejected by the PLO. For Mr Arafat,
Israel's border proposals fall short of the sovereignty he wishes to
exercise.
The PLO chairman wants four main changes: Palestinian police and flags
should be clearly present on the crossings; residents of Gaza-Jericho should
not have to be examined by Israel except by remote computer control; there
should be an international presence on the border; and the PLO should take
control of roads leading to borders.
On the size of Jericho, Mr Arafat's main demand is that the area should
include a strip of land at the Dead Sea - vital for its tourist and mineral
potential and for the possible development of a separate entry point into
Gaza-Jericho by ferry from Jordan.
Both sides know that whatever is gained or conceded now cannot be reversed
at later negotiations, due to begin within two years, on a permanent
settlement. Mr Arafat's demands are designed to bring Palestinian statehood
one step closer, a prospect firmly rejected by both the Israeli government
and Israeli public.
'If Arafat doesn't return in the coming days to the original Oslo track it
will be worthwhile for the government to take time out in the talks to
reassess the Oslo agreement and its meaning, to check whether Arafat is a
man with whom we can do business, and ask ourselves where this process is
leading,' Mr Yoel Marcus, a leading Israeli commentator, wrote yesterday.
Exacerbating the stalemate is Mr Arafat's mercurial negotiating strategy,
the deepening leadership crisis in the PLO and the calculation on both sides
that the other will be forced to give in. Mr Arafat has a long history of
reneging on accords and using oral promises or offers made by senior
lieutenants to extract compromises from negotiating partners which he can
later reject.
The veteran Palestinian leader also has the problem of building sufficient
consensus inside the PLO and among Palestinians who feel Mr Arafat has
surrendered too much.
For the moment, each side is waiting for the other to wave the white flag.
Mr Rabin believes Mr Arafat's waning support and internal pressures will
force him to give in.
Mr Arafat believes rising domestic Israeli opposition, pro-Palestinian
international sympathy, and linkage of the Palestinian negotiations to
progress in peace talks between Israel and other Arab neighbours will force
Mr Rabin to strike a deal.
For both men it is a dangerous game of brinkmanship whose ultimate winner
could be neither Mr Arafat nor Mr Rabin but the opponents of peace on both
sides.

FT  05 JAN 94 / New Japanese party to support reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political hand of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, was
strengthened yesterday by the formation of a small political party pledged
to help his coalition.
Five rebel members of the lower house of parliament, most of whom left the
opposition Liberal Democratic party last month, yesterday formally founded a
party, Kaikaku-no-kai, or Reform Group.
It aims to support the coalition's attempts to reform the discredited
political and electoral system. Yet the new group offers little immediate
advantage to Mr Hosokawa, as political reform plans are currently blocked by
LDP delaying tactics in the upper house, where the new group has no members.
This does, however, nearly double the coalition's slender majority in the
lower house to 10 to 11 seats.
It can now count on the support of 266 out of 511 lower-house members. The
coalition has a five-to-six seat majority in the upper house, with 131 of
the 251 seats there.
Mr Takeo Nishioka, a former education minister who heads the Reform Group,
said it would co-operate with, but not join, the coalition and would seek
support from LDP upper house members. The four reform bills passed the lower
house in November and need to get through the upper assembly before the
extended session ends on January 29.
This is the latest small stage in the break-up of traditional political
groupings, which began with last June's collapse of the former LDP
government, after a rebellion by members disillusioned over LDP failure to
achieve political reform. The general trend of this seemingly chaotic
fragmentation is towards two groups of parties, Japanese political
commentators believe.
There are liberals, similar to US Democrats, grouped around Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
the coalition's behind-the-scenes power-broker and former LDP heavyweight;
and centre-right groups, similar to US Republicans, aligned around Mr
Hosokawa's Japan New party and the moderate stream of the Social Democratic
party, the seven-party coalition's largest partner.
This follows the formation last month of a study group by 40 Social
Democratic party parliamentarians, accounting for about a third of the
upper- and lower-house seats held by the coalition's largest member.
The study group, called the Democrats, aims to distinguish itself from the
left wing, and is seen as the precursor of a new party. It is now courting
as a possible leader Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, governor of Hokkaido and a
former Social Democrat member of parliament.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Protest at Pakistan bank curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three directors of Pakistan's central bank have submitted their resignations
over new legislation which partly reduces the bank's recently-established
independence from the government.
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former caretaker prime minister who made the bank
independent last year, said last night that the latest move could create
difficulties for Pakistan in its negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.
'I am concerned over their loss of credibility if they take away such an
important step,' Mr Qureshi, a former World Bank official, told the
Financial Times from Washington. Pakistan is negotiating with the IMF and
World Bank for up to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in assistance over the next
three years.
A new presidential decree seeks to curtail the powers of the central bank
governor in setting monetary policy. The governor is also required to
consult the federal government and the four provincial governments on the
limit of credit extended to them, while the earlier law introduced by Mr
Qureshi allowed him independently to establish the limits. The governor's
term of office has been reduced to three years from five.
A provision allowing the government to appoint a new governor within 180
days from commencement of the new law has generated speculation that Mr
Mohammad Yaqub, the present governor, who is known as a strict financial
disciplinarian, may be replaced.
One of the seven members of the bank's central board has resigned in protest
at the presidential decree and two more have submitted resignations which
have not yet been formally accepted, senior officials said.
Mr Qureshi's steps to make the central bank autonomous had been praised by
western economists. He said yesterday: 'In my view, the ordinance I had
issued was one of the cornerstones (of policy) to ensure financial
discipline.'
He said: 'It is extremely important to give the central bank the feeling
that if they take a stand on principles, the governor will not be fired.'
The government defended the move as a step requiring the bank to set policy
in consultation with the government, rather than interference in his
functions.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister, pledged to continue economic reform when
she was sworn in in October, without committing herself to the changes
introduced by Mr Qureshi. After her election victory Mr Farooq Leghari, a
trusted aide, was elected president.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Abacha faces test on reform: Nigerian budget offers chance
to point the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first budget speech of Nigeria's new head of state General Sani Abacha,
delayed since New Year's Day and now expected on Sunday, may be his only
chance to convince observers at home and abroad that he is serious about
economic reform.
Nigerian budgets have been more notable for good intentions than accurate
forecasting. In a candid budget speech a year ago, Mr Ernest Shonekan, the
last prime minister under General Ibrahim Babangida's regime, said: 'The
lack of fiscal discipline is the bane of our economy.' He looked forward to
eight months of spending restraint in preparation for the handover to
elected civilian rule in August.
If Mr Shonekan's interim national government had lasted until now, he could
have made the same speech, pointing to even worse figures. Both the promised
fiscal controls and the democratic handover were quickly discarded as Gen
Babangida increased extra-budgetary spending to try to buy an extended term
of office.
Mr Pius Okigbo, a former economic adviser to the government, reflected the
mood of many in Lagos when he complained last month that Nigeria's per
capita income was now lower on some estimates than it was in 1965, before
Nigeria had any oil revenue.
Inflation is near 100 per cent and the year-end budget deficit is estimated
at N75.3bn (Pounds 2.5bn), two and a half times the forecast deficit,
two-thirds of budgeted revenue and 15 per cent of gross domestic product.
Gen Abacha's government, Nigeria's fourth in just more than a year, is in
its second month but lacks an economic policy.
The extension of military rule has brought condemnation and a ban on fresh
aid from western donors. And unless Nigeria makes progress in reducing its
citizens' role in the illicit traffic in drugs, the US could vote against
International Monetary Fund and World Bank funding for Nigeria after next
April.
The military takeover has delayed talks with the IMF until after the budget,
probably mid-month, which could have been the key to long-awaited relief for
its Dollars 33bn external debt. After two years of default, Nigeria's
arrears to its main creditor, the Paris Club of official creditors, stand at
Dollars 6bn and the payments crisis is now threatening the country's only
big source of revenue, oil exports.
Bad debts at the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation are
mortgaging the country's falling revenue. The arrears have passed the
Dollars 500m limit beyond which its joint venture international partners are
entitled to recover the funds in allocations of crude oil.
The NNPC is liable for arrears to foreign contractors running into billions
of dollars for projects which are over-budget and may never yield a return
on capital.
The NNPC's failure to maintain its refineries has forced up fuel imports and
the company has used nearly Dollars 2bn of petroleum revenue to cover its
losses from selling domestic fuel at heavily subsidised prices.
Nor can the government afford to bail out the NNPC. Every day that the oil
price stands at Dollars 14 a barrel, Nigeria earns Dollars 6.3m less than it
had budgeted and the 1993 total oil revenue will fall about Dollars 800m
short of the forecast Dollars 6.3bn.
Despite the depressed oil market, Nigeria has the resources to turn its
economy around.
The new finance minister Mr Kalu I. Kalu favours a package of reforms which
would be the basis for a medium-term programme to be agreed by the IMF
leading to debt relief and fresh funds. The plan would involve a 'realistic
rate' for the naira through a devaluation of the official rate, low
inflation, and balanced budgets through cuts in spending, fuel price
increases and tax reform.
Cuts in bureaucracy and corruption, especially in customs and foreign
exchange procedures, would be aimed at increasing growth and inward
investment.
The plan also would involve reduction of the NNPC's expenditure on joint
ventures, possibly through a cut in the government stake, privatisation of
all the big parastatal companies, and withdrawal from all industrial
projects which could be run by the private sector or cancelled.
There are opponents to reform in the cabinet in spite of the fact that
distortions in the foreign exchange and domestic fuel markets deprive the
government of about Dollars 60m at the weekly exchange auctions and much of
its 300,000 barrels a day of refined products through smuggling. The
opponents argue that the foreign exchange reforms would be inflationary and
those to the fuel price system would be harmful to ordinary Nigerians.
Private sector advisers warn that, if Mr Kalu does not win the argument,
there may be a return to the system of import licences and foreign exchange
allocations which would make Gen Babangida's regime seem like a heyday for
market reforms.

The six lay members of the monetary policy council of the newly independent
Bank of France were chosen last night after a brief disagreement between
Socialist president Francois Mitterrand and the conservative government,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, initially resisted Mr
Mitterrand's nomination of the former Socialist finance minister, Mr Michel
Sapin, but finally agreed. Two other nominees formally accepted were named
as Mr Michel Albert, chairman of the state-owned Assurances Generales de
France, and Mr Jean Boissonnat, a leading economics commentator. Officials
said three other candidates, whom they did not identify, had been more or
less agreed.
The six will join the Bank of France governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, and
his two deputies on the council. The central bank was due to have become
autonomous on January 1, but the delay in naming the council has meant that
it does not yet have formal independent control of interest rates.

<TEXT>
Germany's governing coalition faces further strain following rejection by
the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner, of proposed legislation to
widen the use of electronic bugging devices in the fight against crime,
writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Such a measure would require an amendment to Germany's constitution. The FDP
has argued against increased electronic monitoring on the grounds that it
would be an infringement of individual rights. But the Christian Democrats
believe the measures are needed to act as a deterrent against growing crime.
The proposal, put forward by Mr Manfred Kanther, the interior minister, was
intended to present Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, as champions of law
and order ahead of this year's local, state and federal elections.
Internal security, the fight against crime, and unemployment are the main
themes on which the parties will campaign. The opposition Social Democratic
party has indicated that it will support the bugging proposals.
However, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and chairman of the FDP, and Ms
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, justice minister and his party
colleague, have refused to have anything to do with the bugging proposal.
The FDP has argued consistently that any change in the law must be coupled
with tackling the reasons behind crime.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Opel airs more VW evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence on the events surrounding the controversial defection of
General Motors executives to Volkswagen last March is expected to be aired
in a Frankfurt court today.
The civil hearing represents a renewed attempt by Adam Opel, the US group's
German subsidiary, to have seven former GM employees suspended from their
present jobs at VW on the grounds that Volkswagen used anti-competitive
methods to lure them away.
Opel lawyers are likely to try to support their case with hitherto
confidential information in the files of criminal prosecutors investigating
allegations of theft of documents and industrial espionage against Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and three of those who followed him to VW.
Two previous attempts to have the men suspended failed in summary hearings
at which no evidence was heard in public. One bid to win a temporary
injunction early last year was rejected on the grounds that Mr Lopez's
'charisma' had drawn his seven colleagues in his wake. An appeal against
that ruling failed on a technicality last month.
Mr Horst Borghs, an Opel board member, said at the time he expected a
different result after today's hearing.
Although the criminal investigation and today's civil case are formally
separate issues, both revolve around GM's fundamental claims of concerted
attempts to undermine its German business.
Opel also appears intent on pursuing all legal avenues partly to keep the
issues in the public eye until the completion of criminal investigations,
started in Germany last May and in the US during July.
The German probe is bogged down by a meticulous investigation of
computerised data seized last summer in a raid on VW headquarters and the
homes of Mr Lopez and his colleagues.
Opel won the first significant round in the protracted controversy last
April when a court barred VW from any further attempts 'systematically' to
poach GM staff. Opel had sought the temporary injunction on the grounds that
approaches to some 40 staff constituted an attempt to damage its business.
In that case Opel presented affidavits from around 20 senior employees,
mainly in key component purchasing and production departments, who said they
had been approached by Mr Lopez and others. Some were allegedly offered
double their salaries to change sides.

France is considering adding two digits to all telephone numbers,
lengthening them to 10 digits, to keep ahead of an unexpected surge in
demand for new phone lines, the Industry Ministry said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Paris.
The move, tentatively planned for the end of 1995, would prevent France from
running out of phone numbers one decade after it added an eighth digit to
all lines.
Between 1985 and 1993, the number of lines surged to 31m from 23m as fax
machines and mobile phones took hold. Under the plan, the first digit would
be 0, with the second being a new area code.

Danyard, the shipyard owned by the Lauritzen shipping group, has signed
contracts to build seven double-bottomed and doubled-hulled chemical
carriers of 37,000dwt each for the American-Norwegian Stolt Nielsen Group,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The contract carries an option for Stolt Nielsen to order a further three
vessels, which have a value of between Dollars 65m (Pounds 44m) and Dollars
70m each. Danyard claimed that this is the biggest single order ever
received by a Danish industrial company. The first vessel is for delivery in
1995 and six more in 1996-97, with the three additional vessels delivered in
1998 if the option is exercised.
The order will provide Danyard, in the North Jutland town of Frederikshavn,
with 2,800 full-time jobs a year between now and 1998.
The ships will be built to a new design, with tanks built in stainless
steel. Automatic steering and navigation equipment and unmanned machine and
control rooms will reduce crews to a minimum.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Italian PM seeks negotiated future: Ciampi continues
consultations ahead of no-confidence debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, today holds a second round
of talks with political leaders which may determine the fate of his
eight-month-old government.
The discussions come before a vote of no-confidence next week which has
divided members of the four parties supporting the government.
Today's talks follow inconclusive discussions yesterday with leaders of the
majority Christian Democrats and opposition parties to sound out
parliamentary opinion.
Prices on the Milan stock market fell by 1.74 per cent yesterday as a result
of the political uncertainty, although the lira gained ground.
Next week's no-confidence vote should be the last hurdle before President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro calls new elections to replace the present parliament,
which has been largely discredited by the long-running political corruption
scandal.
Although an announcement on new polls had been expected in the president's
end-of-year address to the nation, a decision was postponed after the
no-confidence vote was tabled last month. According to political leaders, an
election announcement prior to the debate would have been premature.
The holiday period and the prime minister's international commitments mean
the debate will not start until January 12, and could last some time. In the
meantime, speculation has been mounting over Mr Ciampi's intentions, amid
suggestions he could resign during or immediately after the parliamentary
discussions.
Matters are complicated by the sharp divisions in parliament regarding the
timing of new elections. Parties expecting to perform strongly, such as the
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Northern League and the neo-fascist
MSI, have been pressing for an early decision on new polls as the existing
legislature was no longer representative of public opinion.
Mr Achille Ochetto, the PDS leader, said yesterday: 'The government's
political period is over, in that this parliament is over. In our opinion
any moment after January 12 is good for the president to dissolve
parliament.' By contrast, many members of the four-party coalition
notionally supporting Mr Ciampi would like to postpone the election as long
as possible. Some Christian Democrats have even suggested it should be put
back from mid-March, as widely expected, to June, when it could coincide
with European parliamentary elections.
A third camp, largely behind the no-confidence vote, would like to see Mr
Ciampi remain as prime minister, but preferably with broader parliamentary
support. A new lease of life for Mr Ciampi, who has been placed in an
awkward position by the manoeuvrings, could postpone the polls long enough
to give the divided centre more time to regroup and fend off challenges from
the PDS and the League.

FT  05 JAN 94 / W German production drops sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German industrial output fell by an unexpectedly sharp 2.1 per cent in
November, and was 4.5 per cent down on the same period a year earlier, the
Economics Ministry reported yesterday.
The ministry put part of the blame on bad weather and snow. However, the
figures have raised doubts about the economy's recovery.
Nonetheless, economists said that while the weather-induced downturn could
not be discounted, rising orders and confidence in many industrial sectors
still suggested that the recession had bottomed out.
Construction work dropped 6.5 per cent, while gas and electricity production
rose about 1 per cent.
A two-month comparison, favoured by the ministry because it reduces the
impact of short-term influences, showed total production in October and
November down 1.5 per cent on August and September, and 4.5 per cent lower
than in the comparable period in 1992. Within the overall two-month figure,
capital goods output was down 3 per cent on the previous two months and 9
per cent lower than a year earlier.
Raw materials production was unchanged compared with August and September
and was up 1 per cent on October and November 1992.
Demand for housing is particularly strong, and with falling interest rates
expected to continue bolstering order books, construction output is forecast
to rebound after the winter.
However, prospects for domestic demand in other sectors remain dim,
especially among automotive and investment goods manufacturers. Their
expectations have been reduced by falling real incomes and under-use of
existing plant capacity, although rising productivity and competitiveness -
thanks to payroll cuts - have raised hopes of a better export performance
this year.
A further sharp increase in German corporate insolvencies will take the
total to 19,000 this year compared with 15,000 collapses in 1993, according
to the Burgel credit inquiry agency.

FT  05 JAN 94 / In search of lasting cure for ailing health systems / Review
of the problems and reforms in care regimes across the world's wealthier
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across the advanced capitalist economies, governments are struggling to
control the rising costs of healthcare. Average health expenditure in the
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has risen from 3.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1960 to
7.8 per cent in 1990.
The main drivers of medical cost inflation over this period have been
three-fold, according to the OECD:
The extension of healthcare to whole populations with the provision of
universal coverage.
The increasing generosity of healthcare systems, which expanded to include
dental benefits, recuperative treatment and new medical techniques such as
grafting and transplants.
Rising costs, such as the salaries of doctors and nurses.
There are, of course, considerable variations between the experience of
different countries. Growth in healthcare costs have been much higher than
average over this period in the US, and lower than average in the UK.
But overall, there is a close relationship between a country's health
expenditure per capita and overall income per capita. Healthcare is a merit
good, in economists' terms: as people become wealthier, they wish to spend
more on health.
The good news for policymakers is that there is growing evidence that the
growth in healthcare costs can be contained. Reforms in several European
countries appear to have been successful in improving the quality of
healthcare while controlling costs.
More interesting, the means adopted to achieve this have been very similar,
despite considerable differences between the health systems in these
countries. The key to containing healthcare costs appears to lie in what
health economists describe as 'managed competition'.
This aims to introduce market-type incentives to raise efficiency, through
greater competition among hospitals, doctors and other health organisations.
At the same time, health remains largely publicly funded, allowing the
government to regulate competition to ensure equity among all citizens.
Typical features of managed competition include:
Separating the financing of healthcare from delivery - the
'purchaser/provider split' at the centre of the UK health reforms.
Strengthening the role of family doctors in controlling access to treatment
in hospitals and in providing more treatment without involving hospitals -
an important tool in rationing healthcare in President Bill Clinton's plans
for US healthcare reform.
Contracts for the provision of healthcare rather than paying fees for each
service, which leads to 'over-treatment' - Germany and France have both
moved towards this.
Many countries are looking to provide greater incentives for efficiency in
their health services, especially where treatment is currently free at the
point of use. Payments by patients, for example, are on the agenda in
countries such as the US to encourage them to behave more like consumers in
balancing demand against cost.
In the Netherlands, the current reform plans will offer citizens a choice of
insurance funds, all offering a basic healthcare package but charging
different premiums according to the quality of service and additional
benefits.
Even if the delivery of healthcare becomes more efficient, however, upward
pressure on costs will remain a daunting challenge. Medical technology is
expensive, but a more basic explanation for rising health costs is
demographic change. The proportion of elderly people in the populations of
advanced industrial nations is increasing, and the old have insatiably
greater healthcare requirements than the young and middle-aged.
It is not a picture of unrelieved gloom - elderly people in advanced
countries are becoming fitter - but the demands of an ageing population will
nonetheless present healthcare systems with severe spending pressures until
well into the next century.
Apart from trying to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems,
governments are responding to rising costs and demand in two ways. One is by
encouraging healthier lifestyles on the lines of the World Health
Organisation's Health for All strategy and the UK's Health of the Nation
campaign.
If people can be encouraged to reduce health risks by stopping smoking,
adopting healthier diets and taking exercise, the potential financial
savings for healthcare systems will be considerable.
The more controversial of the two responses is the introduction of rationing
for treatment. Healthcare has always been rationed - by waiting list, lack
of access to medical insurance, doctors' decisions in individual cases, and
other ways - but the financial pressures of recent years have led to the
issue being approached more explicitly.
Health authorities in parts of the world have involved the public in
rationing decisions, most notably in Oregon state in the US, which has
developed proposals to withdraw funding for some medical procedures under
its Medicaid programme for those on modest incomes.
An 11-member commission ranked treatments in priority order according to
doctors' opinions of their medical value and public opinion surveys. This
produced a list of 688 procedures of which, the state decided, it could
afford to fund only the top-ranked 568. Some expensive operations including
liver transplants were excluded, alongside cosmetic treatments and fertility
and obesity counselling.
Introduction of the plan was vetoed by the Bush administration after
complaints that it infringed the rights of disabled people, but the Clinton
government approved an amended version last year. Authorities in Oregon hope
to introduce the scheme - which would bring poor people within the cover of
Medicaid - this year although it still faces the possibility of legal
challenge.
Most governments are unenthusiastic about having such a clear set of
excluded treatments, but the purchaser-provider splits introduced by
organisational reforms in the UK, New Zealand and elsewhere are pushing
policy in this direction. Health authorities must now make explicit
decisions about spending priorities, and some have begun testing public
opinion through surveys and meetings.
Doctors have questioned the value of treating, for example, lung cancer
victims who refuse to give up smoking, or performing expensive operations on
the very elderly. Many governments have commissioned analyses relating the
cost of treatment to improvements in the quality of life.
The decisions are moral as well as financial, and many people would prefer
that they did not have to be made. But they are being made, and involving
the public in them is likely to prove an important element in the
development of democracy.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Russian oil output set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil output is expected to continue falling this year in Russia but more
slowly than last year, while debts between state-owned enterprises will
remain a problem for years, according to the economics ministry's forecast
for the year ahead.
It expects gross domestic product to fall just 5 per cent this year compared
with 12 per cent in 1993, and industrial production to decline by 6 per cent
compared to 16 per cent last year.
Goods traffic is forecast to decline by only 6 per cent against 29 per cent
last year. Oil and gas condensate production, an important source of hard
currency for the country, would total 327m tonnes compared to 354m tonnes
last year.
The ministry is also predicting an increase in unemployment from its present
level of around 1 per cent to 5 per cent of the population next year.
The forecast, assuming roughly similar policies to those pursued last year,
with a few improvements such as an end to free loans to other former Soviet
republics, clings to the government's goal of driving inflation down to 5
per cent a month by the end of 1994. This compares to 15 per cent last
month.
The ministry expects the budget deficit will not exceed 6 per cent of gross
domestic product next year - close to the 5 per cent target which the
government has set itself ever since the launch of radical reforms in
January 1992.
However, the report, which does not explore the implications of the
successes of ultra-nationalists and Communists in last month's parliamentary
elections, also points out that achievement of the government's goals
depends on its improved performance - including the more effective use of
state funds for investment in industry, and improved tax collection.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Frenchman who helped transform IMF: Obituary of Pierre-Paul
Schweitzer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, managing director of the International Monetary
Fund from 1963 to 1973 and the first of three Frenchmen to put their
distinctive stamp on the institution, has died at the age of 81.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Michel Camdessus, the current managing
director, paid tribute to Mr Schweitzer's 'leadership and foresight and his
spirit of innovation at a time when the international monetary system and
the IMF itself had to undergo profound transformations'.
The most obvious legacy of Mr Schweitzer's term was the creation of IMF
special drawing rights (SDRs), designed as an international reserve asset to
meet the exigencies of the growing instability of the US dollar in the late
1960s.
In the event, concern about the US deficit did not abate and the Nixon
administration was first, in August 1971, forced to close the official gold
window and impose an import surcharge and domestic wage and price controls.
In December, the Smithsonian agreement heralded the beginning of the end of
the fixed exchange rate system by realigning currencies and increasing the
official price of gold to Dollars 38 an ounce.
Mr Schweitzer, deeply involved in all these negotiations, also presided over
a great expansion of the IMF's membership and, therefore, of its influence
over national economic policies through the conditions it imposed for making
available financial assistance.
Mr Schweitzer was born in Strasbourg to a distinguished family; his uncle,
Albert Schweitzer, was a Nobel Peace Prize winner. He joined the French
inspectorate of finance before the war, fought in the Resistance and was
interned at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Before moving to the IMF, he
served as director of the French treasury and as deputy governor of the Bank
of France.
After his IMF tenure, he served as chairman of Petrofigaz, the state energy
concern, and on several company boards, among them Unilever and Robeco. His
son, Mr Louis Schweitzer, is currently president of Renault.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Lithuania applies to join ranks of Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lithuania yesterday became the first former Soviet republic to apply to join
Nato, accentuating the alliance's sensitive dilemma over whether and when to
accept new members.
President Algirdas Brazauskas said in a televised address that he had
written to the Nato secretary-general, Mr Manfred Worner, formally
presenting Lithuania's membership application.
Mr Brazauskas's statement comes at an embarrassing time for Nato, just ahead
of the organisation's summit in Brussels next week.
Allied leaders are looking for a way to provide former Warsaw Pact countries
which have already applied for membership - such as Poland and the Czech
Republic - with a clear prospect of one day joining Nato without
antagonising Russia, or providing fuel to extreme nationalist opponents of
President Boris Yeltsin.
Estonia and Latvia are also regarded as potential long-term candidates for
Nato membership. Although Russian troops were withdrawn from Lithuania last
September, they remain in the two other Baltic states.

<TEXT>
Bank of America yesterday became the first financial institution to settle
claims stemming from the diversion of over Pounds 440m from pension schemes
controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, raising expectations that others will
follow.
The San Francisco-based bank said it had agreed to pay Pounds 25m, while not
admitting any liability, into the Mirror Group Pension Scheme.
'This has thrown the situation into a new realm where it may be possible to
talk about a settlement,' said an official at one investment bank alleged to
have helped divert pension scheme assets.
After receiving a writ in June 1992, Bank of America approached the pension
fund trustees about six months ago to discuss a settlement independently.
The writ alleged that Bank of America, which acted as a safekeeper for a
portfolio of securities, passed them to Credit Suisse on the instructions of
individuals who were not authorised to give such instructions.
The securities were later used as collateral for a loan to Mr Robert
Maxwell's private interests, the writ alleges.
Sir John Cuckney, appointed by the government to encourage financial
institutions holding pension scheme assets to return them, had no part in
the Bank of America move.
Mr Tom Brooks, Bank of America's assistant general counsel, said: 'We view
this settlement as an appropriate means of contributing to the restoration
of the pension funds without the delay and uncertainty to pensioners and the
bank of lengthy court proceedings, and of putting this claim by the trustees
behind us.'
The Mirror Group Pension Trustees had sought Pounds 38m from Bank of America
and Credit Suisse jointly. That case is scheduled to come to court in
October and the pension trustees said they will continue to seek the balance
of the funds plus accrued interest from Credit Suisse.
The writ also names Invesco MIM, Lehman Brothers International Ltd and
Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management. It seeks Pounds 200m, of which roughly
Pounds 50m relates to assets alleged to have been passed to Robert Maxwell's
private interests by the fund managers. The other Pounds 150m relates to
negligence charges for failing to inform the trustees of improper
activities. That case is due in court on January 25.
Mirror Group Newspapers has pledged to make up the shortfall from the
diversion of assets to its own pension scheme members.
It recorded a charge of Pounds 174m - to be paid over the lifetime of its
scheme members - in its interim report last June to cover this. The Bank of
America payment will reduce Mirror Group's liability by Pounds 25m.
Mr Colin Cornwell, chairman of Mirror Group Pension Trustees (MGPT), said he
hopes the Bank of America settlement will encourage others to seek a similar
solution. 'I think it makes sense commercially,' he said, noting that the
expense and adverse publicity of a public trial are likely to be damaging to
many financial institutions.
Yesterday, other financial institutions which handled assets missing from
the pension scheme said the Bank of America move had no bearing on their
cases.
Lehman Brothers said it was only prepared to consider a 'global settlement'
in which all financial institutions participate.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Money supply rise signals a strengthening recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence that the UK economic recovery is picking up pace came yesterday
with a sharper-than-expected rise in the most narrow definition of the money
supply.
The Bank of England said M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent
year-on-year to December, supporting recent anecdotal evidence of an
excellent Christmas season for the retail sector.
The M0 measure consists of notes and coins in circulation, plus banks'
operational balances with the Bank of England. It is often a good indication
of activity in the retail sector.
The money supply figures did little to help sentiment in the UK government
bond market, where long gilt prices fell by 1 1/4 points. Analysts felt the
apparent buoyancy of the consumer sector may have dampened hopes of an early
cut in UK interest rates.
Gilts and equities were also affected by New Year profit-taking after strong
December rallies. The FT-SE 100 index, down 38 points at one stage, rallied
in the afternoon to close 9.9 points lower at 3,408.5.
The 1 per cent month-on-month rise in M0 was well ahead of market
expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. However, the figure was partly
foreshadowed last week by a sharp rise in bank notes in circulation, which
rose an annual 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29.
The 5.8 per cent year-on-year rise in M0 compares with a 5.1 per cent
increase in the year to November. It is the highest since June 1990 and is
well outside the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per cent.
Yesterday's figures may have been distorted by temporary factors, such as a
relatively high level of operational bank deposits and a surprisingly high
rate of increase in Scottish and Northern Irish notes in circulation.
Also, the sheer scale of consumer spending at Christmas, and the pattern of
bank holidays, make the December M0 figures more volatile than other months.
The unadjusted figures showed a less significant annual rise of 5.5 per
cent, creating the possibility that there might be a problem with the
seasonal adjustments.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, described the figures as
'erratic'. He said the market would monitor closely forthcoming figures on
December retail sales and on January notes-in-circulation for more
substantial evidence of the strength of consumer spending.
M0 is only one of the inflationary indicators studied by the government.
Others, such as M4, the broad money measure, are giving little sign of a
rise in inflation, although Nationwide's house price index, published
yesterday, showed a higher-than-expected 3.3 per cent annual increase.
But there was speculation that the M0 rise might dissuade the government
from making an early cut in base rates. Seasonally adjusted M0 has been
rising at 7.9 per cent, on an annualised basis, over the last three months.
'This is the first piece of hard evidence that points to strong retail
performance in December and that will push back the timing of a base rate
cut to February or March,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg
Securities.
Sterling strengthened slightly against the D-Mark as traders felt an
imminent base rate cut had become less likely. The pound closed 0.6 pfennigs
higher at DM2.578 and gained a tenth of a cent to Dollars 1.4815. It also
gained a little further in New York.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Companies plan to hire more graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are planning to increase graduate recruitment this year for the
first time since 1989, the Association of Graduate Recruiters said
yesterday.
Its survey of 271 large recruiters found that 7 per cent more graduates will
be offered jobs this year than in 1993. Only 4 per cent of employers have
any plans to cut recruitment over the next three years, while 39 per cent
expect increases.
But the sharp rise in university enrolment over the past five years means
that more new graduates will be unemployed this year than at the end of
1993.
The strong supply of graduates is also likely to prevent any significant
increase in starting salaries.
Employers began boosting recruitment programmes during 1993 as optimism
about the economy increased, and graduate recruitment ended only 3.5 per
cent lower than in 1992. At the start of 1993, employers had expected a fall
of 21 per cent, following a cut of 14 per cent in 1992.
Mrs Kate Orebi Gann, recruitment manager for Marks and Spencer and chairman
of the association, said many companies needed extra recruits because they
had 'pared to the bone' during the recession.
'Once more organisations start to prepare for the recovery, this improvement
in graduate recruitment should accelerate. The country cannot afford the
waste of talent evident over the last few years,' said Mrs Orebi Gann.
Traditional heavy recruiters, such as chartered accountants and management
consultants, are expected to step up recruitment, but there will be no
return to the levels of the mid-1980s, she said.
Industry has borne the brunt of cuts in recruitment, and is recovering more
slowly than other sectors. In 1993, industry recruitment fell by 18.6 per
cent, a faster fall than in 1992, while the average for all other sectors
was a 1.4 per cent increase.
Industrial companies are also less optimistic for the future, planning a
recruitment rise of only 4 per cent this year.
Students leaving university this year still face a harder fight to find a
job. Vice-chancellors expect the total number graduating to increase by 14
per cent, double the 7 per cent rise projected in the number of vacancies
for them to fill.
The median starting salary paid to graduates last year was Pounds 13,004,
only 1.6 per cent higher than in 1992.
For the second year running, this was less than half the increase in average
earnings over the same period. For this year, starting salaries are expected
to rise to Pounds 13,500, an increase of 3.8 per cent.
The average salary now being paid to a graduate recruited in 1990 is Pounds
17,000, although the top 10 per cent are being paid more than Pounds 22,000.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Danes clean up at home with state subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark is to subsidise businesses supplying domestic staff by about Pounds
6 an hour, in a radical effort to reactivate a labour market hit by high
taxes.
Danish consumers of personal services, such as domestic cleaning, cooking
and gardening, have largely turned to the black market, because of high
income taxes and a 25 per cent value added tax, the highest in the European
Union. Income taxes are due to fall this year, but only from 68 to 62 per
cent at the top end, and from 53 to 44 per cent for the lowest bracket.
Such rates have put domestic services, on which VAT is charged, out of the
reach of most families, with an hour of domestic cleaning costing the
equivalent of three hours of net pay for an average wage earner.
At the same time, the Danish government - battling with a 12.4 per cent
unemployment rate - believes consumer services is one of the main areas in
which jobs could be created.
If every household bought two hours of domestic services a week, the
government says, this would produce 10,000 full-time jobs. This would be a
small dent in Denmark's 350,000-strong dole queue, but a start.
The subsidy, to be paid to businesses supplying domestic services, will
amount to DKr65 an hour. This compares with black-market rates for domestic
services of DKr50-60 an hour and legal rates ranging from DKr90 to two or
three times that figure.
So far about 1,600 companies, mostly one or two-person businesses, have
registered for the scheme. It will run for an initial three years, with a
budget of DKr1bn for 1994. The government hopes that the real cost to the
exchequer will be relatively small, however, as tax-paying service staff
replace their black market counterparts.
Businesses are complaining the subsidy is not big enough. 'The idea is
great, but we cannot supply a service of the standard we aim to supply with
a subsidy of only DKr65', said Mr Knud Reckweg of ISS, the Danish
international cleaning group.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Hume urges republicans to back Ulster peace initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Hume urged republican leaders yesterday to embrace the UK-Irish
peace initiative but said it would require 'one of the greatest acts of
moral courage of this century' for the IRA to renounce violence.
The leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party
argued in a passionate five-page statement that last month's Downing Street
declaration satisfactorily addressed the IRA's stated reasons for its
25-year armed struggle.
He said: 'I do believe that the declaration makes very, very clear that the
traditional reasons for the use of physical force no longer exist that the
republicans have given.'
But Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, later made clear he
thought the IRA had already, in effect, rejected the joint declaration. This
in turn prompted a sharp response from Mr Hume who said: 'Some people'
thought Mr Molyneaux was 'trying to provoke' the IRA into saying no.
Their comments came as a letter bomb exploded at Sinn Fein's Dublin
headquarters without causing injury. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force
claimed responsibility.
Republican leaders have yet to make a definitive response to the
declaration, although recent comments have suggested they are edging towards
rejecting it.
Mr Hume's statement was interpreted as an attempt to influence the intense
debate thought to be raging inside the republican movement on the response.
In remarks made less than a day after Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president,
had poured scorn on Northern Ireland's right to self-determination, Mr Hume
appealed to everyone affected by the peace process to avoid 'insensitive and
unhelpful language'.
He said: 'With peace, the border will in fact be gone. Let us commit
ourselves to spilling our sweat and not our blood.'
Mr Hume said the joint declaration was not in itself a settlement of the
province's troubles. That would come only 'at the next stage of the process
involving both governments and all parties, hopefully in a totally peaceful
atmosphere'.
Interviewed later Mr Hume appealed to Mr John Major, the prime minister, to
respond to Sinn Fen's calls for clarification of the joint declaration.
He said it was not yet appropriate for him to publish details of the
initiative he launched last year with Mr Adams and pledged to consult the
Sinn Fein president before doing so.
In a speech in Lisburn to fellow Ulster Unionists, Mr Molyneaux urged the
government to combine tougher security measures against terrorists with a
drive to inject fresh impetus into talks involving Northern Ireland's four
constitutional political parties.

Perjawa, the Malaysian government-controlled steel company, has awarded
contracts for the construction of two steel plants on peninsular Malaysia's
east coast to a consortium of Japanese companies, writes Kieran Cooke in
Kuala Lumpur.
The consortium - made up of Itochu Corp, Nissho Iwai Corp, Tomen Corp, NKK
Corp and Kawasaki Heavy Industries - is due to start work on the two plants
this month. The consortium said the contracts were worth around Y76bn
(Dollars 689m).
One of the plants to be built will produce steel sheets and other flat steel
products. The other will produce steel bars.
Malaysia is expanding its steel industry and aims to achieve
self-sufficiency in steel products by 1998.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Rights group damns both sides in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government and the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)
are both to blame for a human rights crisis gripping Algeria, Middle East
Watch said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The North African nation 'is now mired in a virtual civil war in which the
rights of no one are inviolate and the democratic process has been all but
abandoned,' the human rights watchdog group said.
The report by the organisation, a division of Human Rights Watch, was timed
to coincide with the second anniversary of the cancellation of Algeria's
last elections. The country has been gripped by political violence since
January 12 1992, when the authorities cancelled the general election which
the FIS was poised to win.
The FIS was later banned, and since then at least 1,800 militants, security
officers and civilians have died in politically related violence.
Middle East Watch said the human rights record of Mr Redha Malek's
government 'has done little to distinguish itself from the FIS-led
repression and human rights violations the coup-makers claimed to have acted
to prevent.'
It singled out for criticism the government's special court system, accusing
it of subjecting fundamentalist suspects to mistreatment, torture and other
judicial abuses and urging that all those convicted by these courts be
released or given new trials.
It also blamed fundamentalists for political violence and urged FIS leaders
to condemn unequivocally all such violence and to use all means at their
disposal to end violent attacks on civilians by fundamentalist groups.
Middle East Watch said the FIS and the government also share the blame for
muzzling Algeria's media.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Treuhand chief outlines aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German business has
secured contracts committing DM184bn (Dollars 106.9bn) in investment and
guaranteeing 1.6m jobs, the agency said yesterday. It has sold 11,700
enterprises.
However, in the course of fulfilling these contracts the jobs figure could
fall to 921,000 permanent posts, while investments could be reduced to
DM100bn, according to Mrs Birgit Breuel, the agency's president.
Depending on the contract, an investor can gradually reduce the workforce,
ending up with a final, permanent, figure agreed with the Treuhand. Mrs
Breuel said implementation would be monitored by a management holding
company, or VRA, in which private investors would be able to hold stakes of
at least 25 per cent.
In assessing the agency's targets for the next 12 months, Mrs Breuel told a
news conference she was convinced the Treuhand had set up 'the framework for
the economy in eastern Germany'. She said its main task this year would be
privatising the remaining 266 enterprises, which employ about 100,000
people, or 2 per cent of eastern Germany's labour force.
Seventy-three of these enterprises have already been hived off to five
management groups, whose western German managers will restructure them
before sale. The agency will try to restructure and sell by the end of the
year the remaining 193 enterprises.
However, Mrs Breuel could not confirm the level of subsidies required to
prepare the enterprises for privatisation and keep the workforces employed.
But she confirmed that by the end of 1994 the Treuhand would have spent
DM275bn and earned DM68bn from sales.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Yeltsin pledges tough foreign policy to please nationalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will adopt a more assertive foreign policy
following the serious setback for radical reformers in last month's
parliamentary elections, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said yesterday.
The president's priorities for 1994, set out by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov,
underline Mr Yeltsin's intention to try to accommodate the hardline
nationalists in the new parliament. The tough foreign policy line will be
combined with continuing market reforms.
Mr Kostikov told Itar-Tass news agency: 'Undisputed emphasis in foreign
policy will be given to protection of Russia's national interests and the
rights of Russians and Russian-speaking people . . . on the basis of
pan-national solidarity.'
The far right and nationalists have campaigned for the protection of ethnic
Russians living abroad. About 20m Russians live outside Russia in other
former Soviet republics. Some have been deprived of the vote and of the
right to sell their housing, or have felt threatened in their jobs.
Mr Kostikov added that the Russian leader, armed with sweeping new powers to
override parliament if necessary, was prepared to co-operate with deputies
'who are interested in the protection of Russia's interests and the
promotion of reforms'.
But he warned that such co-operation with the new parliament would depend on
its respect for the new constitution and its ability to 'draw lessons from
previous experience' - an unmistakable reference to the old parliament,
shelled out of existence on October 4 after a protracted power struggle with
Mr Yeltsin.
On economic policy, Mr Kostikov said: 'Securing financial stabilisation,
lowering inflation, strengthening the rouble and support for healthy
production forces will be among the priorities of economic policy next
year.'
But Mr Sergei Vasiliev, a radical economist who heads the government centre
for monitoring economic reform, was cautious yesterday on prospects for
further progress. He said that the electoral success of Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist, would frighten away investors, including
Russian ones, and promote further capital flight.
'In the next two years no large-scale foreign investment will come to
Russia,' he told the Russian Information Agency, referring to the
uncertainty that is likely to prevail until new parliamentary and
presidential elections are held as planned in 1996.
Mr Vasiliev also expressed doubt, given the pressure of from a parliament
dominated by nationalists and communists, that Russia would achieve a
standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Russia's Choice, the
radical reform alliance, drew up plans and for other radical steps in
anticipation of better results in the elections. But Mr Vasiliev said
yesterday: 'There is now little chance of any large-scale agreement with the
IMF.'
A standby agreement setting tough reform conditions for further financial
assistance from the Fund already looked in doubt before the election. It now
looks even more unlikely that the IMF will step in to compensate for western
failures to influence Russian reforms.
Russian reform prospects should become clearer with the appointment of a
revamped cabinet, expected before the new parliament gathers on January 11.
Yesterday the government began its move into the White House, the old
parliament building, after repairs were completed.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Markets across world surge ahead to hit record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stock markets in Europe and south-east Asia have begun the new year in the
same record-setting style with which they saw out 1993.
Bourses in Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Madrid, Brussels and
Stockholm rose to record highs. London returns today after the new year
break.
The surge in European stock markets stretched from the fledgling markets of
Athens and Istanbul, in the south, to Vienna and Warsaw in central Europe.
Hong Kong led the Asian advance with a 1.7 per cent rise, while new peaks
were set in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Manila and Jakarta. Bombay and
Karachi completed the record-breaking run in Asia.
The recent sustained rise in Asian and European markets has been underpinned
by outflows of money from the US, where many investors believe equity
markets have less potential for growth than those abroad.
In contrast to the surge elsewhere, Wall Street was subdued yesterday. The
market there largely ignored a positive report from the National Association
of Purchasing Management and instead took its lead from a weak bond market.
At noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was 5.31 lower at 3,748.78.
A surge in US demand for German stocks helped Frankfurt's DAX index up 1.30
to 2,267.98 after an early, 30-point fall, in a show of confidence that many
traders believe the market still has further potential to rise.
Some investors were also building their hopes that Thursday's meeting of the
Bundesbank Council will cut interest rates. However, many analysts believe
that the authorities are unlikely to act this week, with some German
financial centres closed on Thursday for the Epiphany holiday.
Paris picked up after a quiet start, the CAC-40 index adding 22.34 to
2,290.56, while Amsterdam was led higher by technical considerations in
otherwise quiet conditions. The new AEX index made its debut yesterday,
having replaced the EOE index, and closed at 420.37, up from a rating of
414.27 last Thursday.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer, an analyst at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich,
confirmed that European markets were being spurred higher by inflows of US
money. He said: 'US fund managers . . . are buying in the European markets,
because it is the current trend.'
With the Tokyo market closed, Hong Kong remained the main Asian focus for
buying by foreign investors. US institutions continued to fuel the market's
rise, which saw turnover of more than HKDollars 9.2bn (Pounds 805m) during
the session, compared with HKDollars 7.4bn last Friday.
The Hang Seng index, which rose by 115 per cent in 1993, added 198.10 to
close at 12,086.49. Many traditionally superstitious Chinese investors had
seen the Hang Seng's final tally for last of 11,888.39, as a good omen: the
Cantonese equivalent of 'three eights' is taken as a portent of growth and
prosperity.
A break through the 12,000 level in the Hang Seng had been seen as
inevitable after the market's recent surge but many analysts had not
expected the barrier to be breached until the run-up to the Lunar New Year,
which this year runs from February 10-13.
Yet even at the market's current levels, many investors are reluctant to
take profits, setting their sights instead on a further rise in the Hang
Seng to the 14,000 level.

TUESDAY
Funding for the tunnel
The deadline for Eurotunnel, which is to operate the channel tunnel, to
complete negotiations with its bankers for additional funding to cover
start-up costs. The company has raised about Pounds 8.95bn, but has said it
needs at least another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt servicing before the
tunnel begins to break even on a cash basis. This is expected to happen in
1998.
Italian politics: Informal soundings are due to begin between Italy's
political parties and the government of Carlo Ciampi to prepare for a
planned vote of no-confidence in the government on January 12.
The European Commission meets ahead of its consultations in Athens on
Wednesday with the Greek government, which has assumed the presidency of the
European Union.
UK economy: The Bank of England's provisional estimate of the growth of the
monetary base (M0) last month is likely to back up anecdotal evidence of
strong retail sales before and after Christmas. Bank notes in circulation
rose by 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29, compared with the same week
in 1992.

WEDNESDAY
Greek agenda for the EU
The European Commission meets the Greek government in Athens to devise a
working programme for the Greek presidency of the European Union.
Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and European Commission president
Jacques Delors will try to present an image of workmanlike solidity.
However, Athens is at odds with some member states over EU policy towards
the former Yugoslav republics.
Bank of France: The names of six members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy
Council, which will be responsible for interest rate policy at the newly
independent Bank of France, are due to be announced today. The other three
members will be Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and
his two deputies.
UK education: Sir Ron Dearing is expected to publish the final
recommendations of his review of the national curriculum in England and
Wales today. The report will influence industrial relations in schools and
should also establish an educational blueprint for the next two decades.
Noise: New regulations on noise nuisance come into effect in the UK. Local
authorities will be able to take action to stop noise, including entering a
car to silence a wayward alarm.

THURSDAY
Bundesbank council meets
The policy-making council of the German central bank holds its first session
of 1994. With interest rates on German government bonds finishing 1993 near
their lowest levels since the second world war, there are strong
expectations of a cut in the coming weeks in the 'official' Lombard and
discount rates from the current levels of 6.75 and 5.75 per cent
respectively. The Bundesbank may act today.
George Soros, the international financier, concludes a three day visit to
Israel during which he is expected to announce a series of investments in
the country.
UK new vehicle registrations: The figures for November are due to be
released by the Department of Transport. They are expected to confirm that
the British market remains a healthy exception in a depressed Europe.
Anchors away: The 40th London International Boat Show opens at Earls Court
exhibition centre (to Jan 16).
Holidays: Markets are closed for the Epiphany holiday in Austria, Cyprus,
Finland, Germany (Munich and Stuttgart only), Greece, Italy, Spain, and
Sweden. Russia celebrates Orthodox Christmas (to Friday).

FRIDAY
Franco-Saudi co-operation
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur (left) arrives for a two-day visit to
Saudi Arabia. The talks are expected to cover political, economic and
military co-operation. Mr Balladur will be hoping to promote the sale of
French arms and military equipment. In particular, he will try to finalise a
contract for the supply of frigates, worth an estimated FFr20bn (Dollars
3.4bn).
US employment figures for December will be keenly watched to see if they
provide further evidence of robust fourth-quarter economic growth. A recent
poll of economists points to expectations of a 225,000 increase in non-farm
payrolls last month.
Paramount bid: The deadline for rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network to
increase their offers for the US film and publishing group.
Holidays: Christmas for Coptic Christians of Egypt and Ethiopia.

Clinton goes to Europe
US President Bill Clinton sets off for his first European trip since taking
office. It takes him to Brussels for the Nato summit (Jan 10-11). He then
travels to Prague to meet Polish, Czech and Hungarian leaders.
Next stop is Russia for talks with President Yeltsin, but not with Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the nationalist. Clinton also visits Minsk, in recognition of
the Belarus decision to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Finally, he goes to Geneva, for a session with President Assad of Syria.
They are expected to discuss the Middle East peace process.
Japanese-Chinese relations:
Japan's foreign minister Tsutomu Hata (left) begins a two-day visit to
China. He will discuss with his opposite number, Qian Qichen, economic
assistance, human rights issues, and North Korea's nuclear programme.

Sumo fortnight: The 15-day New Year Grand Sumo Tournament begins in Tokyo.
NEXT WEEK
A two-day summit of Nato leaders begins in Brussels on Monday January 10.
The organisation has been seeking a role since the end of the cold war. The
trend of events in the former Soviet Union may give it a new sense of
purpose.
The council of the European Monetary Institute holds a formal inaugural
meeting in Frankfurt on January 11. As the institute still lacks premises in
the city, the council will assemble in the town hall.

He has said he will focus on the problems associated with financial
derivative instruments.
Footloose and duty-free: The value of duty-free gifts travellers within the
European Union can bring home doubled to Ecu90 (Dollars 100). For those
returning from outside the EU, the allowance has risen to Ecu175 from Ecu45.
Alcoholic drinks, tobacco or perfumes are excluded, being subject to volume
limits.
Duty-free shopping on journeys within the EU is set to end on 30 June 1999.
Road hauliers in the European Union will be freer, but slower. Restrictions
on cabotage, the right of a haulier from one member state to pick up and
deliver a load in another, have been eased.
Rules have also come into force requiring new trucks of 12 tonnes gross
weight and more to be fitted with speed limiters restricting them to 56mph
(90kph). The UK already requires trucks of 7.5 tonnes or more to be limited
to 60mph.
Germans grit their teeth: Taxation on oil products rose by up to 20 per cent
(for petrol) and 13 per cent (for diesel), which means an extra 16 pfennigs
on a litre of petrol.
Child allowances were cut to DM70 (Dollars 41) per child per month, and are
to be means-tested. Unemployment benefit has also been cut, by some 3
percentage points.
Pension contributions rose to more than 19 per cent of gross income, to
prevent the state pension funds sliding into the red.
Trains set: Germany's rail companies, the Bundesbahn in the west and the
Reichsbahn in the east, united as Deutsche Bahn. The railways are no longer
a statutory body, which paves the way for eventual privatisation, some 10
years down the tracks.
The government has agreed to assume the railways' debts, to be paid for by
increased oil taxes.
Commercial agents: The English Commercial Agents Regulations 1993 came into
force, along with equivalent enabling legislative orders for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
These implemented the 1986 EC Directive 86/653, giving commercial agents who
act for UK principals in countries of the EU (formerly EC) greatly increased
rights. These include greater security of contract, compensation for loss of
office, and disclosure of confidential information concerning their
principals' business.
Many British companies took the precaution of sacking their commercial
agents in advance of the new regulations. The Irish Republic also brought
the directive into force. The other EU states have already implemented it.
Lloyd's goes corporate:
For the first time in its 300-year history, the Lloyd's of London insurance
market (left) is to accept corporate members. Previously, only wealthy
individuals, the Names, who have put all their assets at stake in supporting
the market have been members. Now, companies, institutions and private
investors of more modest means will be able to benefit from limited
liability.
EIS supersedes BES: The Enterprise Investment Scheme came into being. It
replaces the the Business Expansion Scheme, set up in 1983 to encourage
investment in trading companies. The BES became an easy tax break for higher
earners, raising more than Pounds 3bn. Its successor is designed to be less
generous.
500-year malt: Scotland's distillers have decided to designate 1994 the
500th anniversary of malt whisky, on the basis of a document dated 1494,
which mentions materials supplied to a certain Friar John Cor 'wherewith to
make aquavitae'.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday: The German Federal Labour Office is expected to announce that
unemployment continued to rise last month, both in western and eastern
Germany. Economists fear that the recent spate of lay-offs announced by
companies means unemployment will keep rising until mid-year, even though
the economy may be stabilising.
US data on factory orders in November is expected to show a slight
quickening of growth compared with October. This would be consistent with
data published earlier by the National Association of Purchasing Managers.
Friday: The UK housing market comes under the spotlight with publication of
the Halifax Building Society house price index for December. The Bank of
England also publishes figures on mortgage lending in November. Last week,
the eight biggest British banking groups announced a 2.6 per cent drop in
their gross mortgage lending between October and November, caused by
seasonal factors.
Canadian unemployment is expected to have risen in December to 11.1 per
cent, despite a steady economic growth performance in 1993.

FT  04 JAN 94 / New UK Share Classification: New All-Share sectors reflect
changes in UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN and ADRIAN DICKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When today's stock market results are totted up at the end of trading, they
will be reported for the first time under the revised FT-SE Actuaries
classification, write Peter Martin and Adrian Dicks.
The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough
overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the
shape of today's market. Sectors have been merged or subdivided as their
relative importance has changed. And the former Miscellaneous stocks have
been given proper homes of their own.
The new classification system is of special interest to FT readers, because
it shapes the layout of the paper's share price listings, the London Share
Service. As a result of the changes, to be implemented in tomorrow's
edition, several hundred of the 3,000 or so securities quoted on the pages
will change sectors.
To ease the transition, today's FT provides a full alphabetical listing of
shares carried in the London Share Service. Readers may wish to keep it for
reference, so as to find their way easily around the pages. Today's
listings, reporting Friday's dealings, are the last in the old form.
From tomorrow, there is one particular change worth noting. Foreign stocks
which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as
Americans, Canadians, etc - will be moved from the beginning of the
classification scheme to the end.
The normal daily table reporting All-Share and other FT-SE Actuaries indices
has been reprinted here just as it appeared in Saturday's edition, showing
the performance of sectors on the last day of the year under the old
classification system. Alongside it is a version showing how that data would
have looked if the new classification system had been in operation.
The usual end-year tables which show the market capitalisation of each
sector will be published in a few days' time.
We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and
hope that it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar.
Though we believe that the service to readers is improved, we are conscious
that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs. After this
burst of activity, we hope for a period of greater stability.
Change of name
The reclassification of the All-Share sectors provides an opportunity for a
change of name. From now on, the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index will be called
the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index. This reflects the fact that the
All-Share has been part of the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices since 1992.
The series is sponsored by the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange,
the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
Since the last review of the SE and FT-A systems in 1970, the UK's
industrial base has evolved considerably, reflecting both the growth of the
service industries and the Government's privatisation programme for
utilities. In contrast, basic industries and capital goods manufacturers in
the UK have suffered a relative decline.
The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification System has three tiers:
Economic groups. The non-financial groups will be replaced by the following
range of industrial groups: Mineral Extraction, General Manufacturers,
Consumer Goods, Services, Utilities, Financials and Investment Trusts (Note:
Capital Goods, Consumer Group, Other Groups and Oil &amp; Gas have all been
replaced).
Industry sectors. The old FT-A industry sectors have been revised to fit
into the new economic groupings. This has resulted in the creation of new
sector descriptions, some being merged and larger sectors further
sub-divided. Examples are: Electricals and Electronics, which are merged;
Engineering General and Engineering Aerospace, also merged.
Oil &amp; Gas is sub-divided into Gas Distribution, Oil Integrated and Oil
Exploration &amp; Production; Health &amp; Household is sub-divided into
Pharmaceuticals, Household Goods and Health Care.
The new industry sectors created include Extractive Industries and
Distributors. Several others have been renamed.
Sub-sectors. The old Stock Exchange sectors have been reviewed and
integrated within the industry sectors. Where appropriate, sub-sectors have
been defined to provide homogenous industry groupings, eg Extractive
Industries into Gold Mining, Other Mines and Mining Finance.
Each company has been allocated to the industry sub-sector whose definition
most closely describes the nature of its business. The primary consideration
when classifying companies is the proportion of profits arising from each
industry area. In order to maintain stability in the classification system,
temporary fluctuations in the profitability of individual classes of
business are generally disregarded.
Classifications are normally determined using the annual audited accounts of
the company. Where a company carries on two or more different classes of
business, the audited segmentation of profits is used.
More detailed information on the new FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification
System, including a set of the Classification Ground Rules, can be obtained
by writing to: The Secretary, FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification
Committee, Financial Times, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.

FT  04 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Weakening bonds hold Dow to
narrow gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks edged higher yesterday but the broader indices slipped,
as a weak bond market overshadowed two favourable readings on the economy,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.51 ahead at 3,756.60,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.02 at 465.43. In the secondary
markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.09 to 477.24, but the Nasdaq
composite dropped 6.04 to 770.76 in a decline exaggerated by thin trading.
NYSE volume came to 279.2m shares.
The initial trading day of the new year brought one of the first tangible
signs of sustained economic expansion in the first quarter. The National
Association of Purchasing Management said its December composite index of
manufacturing conditions, an important leading indicator, rose to 57.9 per
cent from November's 55.7 per cent reading. It was the highest since January
1993.
Separately, the Commerce Department announced that construction spending in
November had climbed 1.8 per cent, for the seventh consecutive gain.
However, the report carried less significance for the bond market, which is
looking ahead for signals of mounting inflationary pressures.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was down a point to 97 13/16 ,
hovering at its lowest level since August. In reaction to the downturn, an
early 10-point gain in the Dow Industrial index was eroded quickly and many
issues finished well off their opening quotations.
Among a handful of blue chips showing solid gains, Du Pont was up Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 49 1/2 , Philip Morris Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 57 5/8 ,
Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 5/8 and IBM Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 57
3/4 .
A like number of issues showed substantial declines. Ford retreated Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 63 3/8 , Allied Signal Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/4 ,
Goodyear Tire Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 .
Federated Department Stores jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 after
revealing plans to seek control of the bankrupt RH Macy, and create the
largest US department store chain.
Toys 'R' Us shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 in spite of better than expected
Christmas sales. The fall followed the announcement of a management
transition at the company.
Mining issues gained ground on higher gold prices. Placer Dome added Dollars
2 3/4 at Dollars 27 5/8 , American Barrick Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 30 1/4
and Newmont Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 49 1/4 .
The Toronto market was closed.

Mexican equities went into 1994 with a sharp retreat as investors reacted to
the uprising by armed peasants in Chiapas over the weekend by taking profits
on the strong run-up of last year.
After breaking through 2,600 with a new high last Thursday, the IPC index
fell 100.40, or 3.86 per cent, to 2,502.23. It was the biggest one-day
percentage drop since August 24, 1992.

Eight markets saw new highs. Tokyo, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand were

The index climbed 198.10 to 12,086.49. Continuing strong US demand was
particularly evident, helping to expand turnover to a heavy HKDollars 9.22bn
from Friday's HKDollars 7.36bn.
On the futures market the January index contract ended with a sizeable
premium to the physical market at 12,315, up 355 points.
Bank of East Asia, which will be among the first of the major banks to
announce its profits, climbed HKDollars 4.50 to HKDollars 57.50. Liu Chong
Hing was up HKDollars 2.20 at HKDollars 18.20 on expectations that it will
spin off its banking arm.
Sino Land jumped 80 cents to HKDollars 12.90 in active morning trade and
Tsim Sha Tsui Properties gained 70 cents at HKDollars 10.80 before they were
both suspended pending an announcement.
SINGAPORE saw strong retail demand, on expectations of more gains in coming
weeks, which took the Straits Times Industrial index up 15.85 to a peak
2,441.53.
Profit-taking was overwhelmed by a flood of new money. However, Rothmans
Industries plunged SDollars 1.20, or 11.9 per cent, to SDollars 9.70 when
the stock resumed trading after the announcement that plans for a regional
holding company were vetoed by its Malaysian associate.
KUALA LUMPUR registered further institutional and speculative buying and the
composite index advanced 13.53 to a record 1,288.86.
Rothmans fell MDollars 4.60, or 17.7 per cent, to MDollars 21.40 after the
merger proposal's rejection.
SEOUL saw buy orders which boosted financials and recent laggards such as
construction and low-priced counters, taking the composite index 13.14
higher to a peak of 879.32.
Blue chips were held back, however, by news that the Korea Securities Market
Stabilisation Fund planned to liquidate Won800bn of stocks later this month.
MANILA hit a new high as demand for blue chips kept the market up amid
profit-taking in other issues. The Composite index added 75.43 at 3,271.51.
JAKARTA edged ahead to a record close, the official index firming 0.88 to
589.65.
KARACHI, powered by strong demand for financials, polyesters and
pharmaceuticals, saw the KSE 100 index rise 7.89 to finish at a high of
2,178.09.
BOMBAY's 30-share index moved ahead 119.80, or 3.6 per cent, to a peak of
3,465.86 amid increased foreign buying on hopes for improved economic and
political stability in the coming year.

Golds were softer in Johannesburg in response to a generally lacklustre
bullion price, but industrials pushed higher in generally quiet conditions
as the earlier dampening effects of the strong financial rand disappeared.
The golds index dipped 10 to 2,154, industrials added 23 at 5,596 and the
overall index put on 16 at 4,909. Anglos rose R2.50 to R223, Barlows

The Continent was peppered with new highs, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw US buying late in the session, overcame a weak start and
closed with the DAX index 1.30 stronger at a new closing high of 2,267.98.
Trade was quiet after Thursday's DM11.2bn turnover.
Construction shares, savaged by some analysts in mid-1993, broke resistance
levels and blossomed. Hochtief and Holzmann both rose by DM60, to DM1,200
and DM1,045.
PARIS said domestic bank rate cuts were neutral in effect but good for
sentiment, and that futures-related buying was behind a rise in the CAC-40
index of 22.34 to a new high of 2,290.56. Turnover amounted to FFr3.2bn.
Eurotunnel gained FFr1.90 at FFr54.40 on its tariff structure. CCF fell as
low as FFr290 on its rights issue at one point, recovering to close still
FFr5.60 down at FFr297.40: it talked of higher 1993 profits.
ZURICH returned to record setting territory, the SMI index registering an
advance of 38.6 at 2,996.2, with the best per-formances coming in cyclicals.
MADRID peaked 4.39 higher at 327.16, with construction stocks in the lead.
Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, viewed as the most cyclical stock among
chemicals, put on SFr29 at SFr929.
COPENHAGEN gained 2.2 per cent in active buying by institutional investors,
and the KFX top-20 index climbed 2.39 to 109.19 in big turnover of DKr854m.
AMSTERDAM saw enthusiastic local buying which took the new AEX index 6.1
ahead to a high of 420.37. A rise of Fl 2.50, or 5.3 per cent, to Fl 49.40
in Ahold, the retailer, was attributed to favourable press comment on the
outlook for the group's US supermarket chains. BRUSSELS moved ahead, the
Bel-20 index adding 8.68 at a peak 1,481.78.
STOCKHOLM put aside political worries over an impending decision on the
Oresund Bridge between Sweden and Denmark and the Affarsvarlden index rose
22.1 to a record 1,424.9.
OSLO shrugged off continued low prices for Norway's North Sea oil and the
all-share index moved forward 4.83 to 617.91 in active turnover of NKr672m.
VIENNA rose by 1.8 per cent, the ATX index closing 20.78 higher at 1,149.56
on a lack of sellers. WARSAW's WIG index climbed 606, or 4.9 per cent, to
13,045 in active turnover of 1,400bn zlotys.
ISTANBUL hit its third consecutive peak, the composite index ending at
21,788.1, up 1,105.3 or 5.3 per cent.
ATHENS scored a new high with a 3.3 per cent gain on institutional buying,
the general index closing 31.55 stronger at 990.21.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: A seamless transition to the new year - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After plodding ahead for most of the year, it was somewhat ironic that Wall
Street finished 1993 with a flurry. The final hour of trading brought a wave
of program-related selling, and an 8-point gain in the Dow industrials was
transformed into a 21-point decline in minutes.
If the swing seemed to presage a more mercurial tenor for 1994, the first
day of trading in the new year brought reassurance. Blue-chip stocks were
inching ahead yesterday, resuming the steady course that characterised the
market through most of last year. Analysts generally anticipate a seamless
transition from 1993 to 1994.
In contrast to years past, there were no flights of euphoria in the waning
days of December, when investors traditionally load up on their winning
positions and pick up bargains among under-achievers.
A 35-point jump in Dow Jones Industrial Average last Monday 'its biggest
gain since July ' may have whet appetites for a strong year-end rally. But
true to current form, the advance was followed by two miserly days when the
Dow added just fractions of a point.
The road became rockier on Thursday when the US Treasury market, after weeks
of resilience, suddenly grew skittish on news of a burst in new-home sales.
The inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond took a pounding. In turn,
the Dow dropped 18 points, and a further 21 points on the last day of the
year.
Bond prices weakened further yesterday after the National Association of
Purchasing Management revealed a strong December composite index, and
equities were again constrained.
Nevertheless, the Dow could very well reach the 3,800 level for the first
time ever in the next few days. One of those who takes this view is Mr Laszo
Birinyi, a Connecticut-based market strategist, who says the focus on the
fixed-income markets has been overplayed. 'The bond market really has been a
very convenient excuse. When we want to ignore it, we do so.'
He believes the cautious optimism that helped the market last year will
continue to push stocks forward in the early part of 1994. 'The market must
accept the importance of faith at this point,' he says.
Mr Birinyi sees more steady gains across the board, with particular
improvement in some of consumer non-durable issues, such as Eli Lilly,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products, which have largely been
overlooked in recent months.
Mr Greg Nie, technical analyst for Kemper Securities in Chicago, agrees that
the market will maintain a positive bias. He says the it should survive the
first quarter without a big correction, but he sees stocks as growing
increasingly vulnerable as the quarter progresses.
'The market will have a tough time handling mistakes. Any surprises -
whether political or economic - will cause problems,' he warns, citing a
string of technical danger signals.
His theory may be put to an early test Friday, with the release of December
non-farm payroll figures.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Cautious note may temper the bull run -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first trading week of the new year will bring more than the usual crop
of doubt, optimism and wild surmise on the London stock market. The
beginning of January has often been a highly productive time for investors -
even if this did not always last for the rest of the month. Until the very
end of the old year, it looked as though nothing could prevent a happy new
year from following a very merry Christmas.
There is no shortage of bullish forecasts for 1994. Mr Nick Knight, the
super bull at Nomura, is predicting a further rise of more than 8 per cent
on the Footsie by the end of January, and while not many would be in such a
rush, there is plenty of optimism in the City.
Nor is this confined to the big institutions and their rated advisers. A
survey by ShareLink, the Birmingham execution-only stockbroker, indicates
that UK private investors, of whose business ShareLink claims the lion's
share, are 'clearly taking a bullish view of prospects'.
But a note of caution has been heard in stockbroker trading rooms since
details have emerged of the reasons behind the huge upsurge in stock index
futures during December, which itself lay behind the rise in the Footsie
Index.
The futures buying, it appears, was related to expiry of a Pounds 4bn
over-the-counter share option programme by a very large UK institution. The
programme, put in place just ahead of the November budget, went badly wrong
and the hapless fund manager had to run for cover to the Footsie futures
market. The expiry of this deal withdrew support from futures and thus hit
the stock market, probably robbing Mr Knight of fulfilment of his Footsie
3,500 target for 1993.
OTCs are a fairly new and highly specialised animal on the stock market,
encased in mystery because they are private deals between one, usually very
large securities house, and one, also very large, client.
Whatever may be the benefits and perils of OTCs, they can have a significant
effect, via futures, on share prices. Traders are convinced that there are
more OTC deals very close to expiry and wary of seeing the futures market
turn round and bite the stock market in return.
The other area where market views are shifting is on the timing of the next
cut in base rates. Once again, there is general agreement that a base rate
cut there will be; perhaps the Bundesbank will lead the way, or perhaps the
low inflation scenario in the UK will be enough to guarantee further falls
in rates.
However, some analysts now warn that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor,
may choose to keep rate cuts in reserve for next spring when the UK economy,
and the voters, will be taking the strain of the Budget tax increases. The
same factors could also be putting the stock market under pressure by then.
What the stock market would like to see this week is a base rate cut and no
OTC expiries. But what if these heartening images are transposed? No rate
cut and a OTC expiry might be another story.

<TEXT>
Little in the way of corporate results is due this week. Instead, attention
will once again return to the outlook for lower European interest rates.
However, NatWest Securities does not believe that Germany will provide a
lead by cutting the Discount rate when the Bundesbank Council holds its
first meeting of the new year on Thursday, because of the Epiphany holiday
in Catholic Lander. Instead, it believes that January 20 is a better bet.
Other continental European markets closed on Thursday will include Athens,
Milan, Madrid, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vienna.
FRANKFURT
November industrial production figures during the week are expected to show
a further monthly decline while James Capel forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in
November industrial orders, reflecting a seasonal bounce in domestic orders.
The broker notes, however, that in underlying terms, only export orders are
staging a recovery.
PARIS
The French government is expected to announce this week its decision on the
terms of the sale of the cable operations of Caisse des Depots et
Consignations (CDC) cable unit, ComDev, for which Generale des Eaux and
France Telecom are said to be in contention.
October trade figures on Friday are expected to reveal falling exports and
rising imports, resulting in a FFr6bn trade surplus, sharply down from the
FFr9.6bn surplus in September.
AMSTERDAM
The Amsterdam stock exchange has this week adopted the European Options
Exchange index of 24 leading Dutch shares. The index, unchanged in content
and calculation, will be called the Amsterdam EOE Index (AEX).
TOKYO
Small-lot buying by investment trust managers and financial institutions
will support the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues this first week of 1994.
Chart analysts expect Japanese equity prices to trade in a narrow range of
17,000 to 17,700.
Brokers predict limited stock gains and moderate trading volume amid an
absence of compelling reasons to enter the market.
Investors will also be awaiting further details on the timing and content of
the government's proposed economic stimulus package.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Risk and Reward: An independent stands up to the pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Locals, the independent traders who once dominated the futures pits of
Chicago, are gradually being squeezed out of the market by the weight of
capital of the world's largest banks and securities houses.
However, a few of these traders, whose business grew rapidly in the
profitable years before the arrival of the mainstream investment banks, have
been able to expand into new areas.
One such trader is Thomas Baldwin III, a self-made multi-millionaire who
built his fortune and his reputation in the competitive rough and tumble of
the Chicago Board of Trade's US Treasury bond futures pit.
In a business where 80 per cent of new arrivals fail within a year, the
37-year-old son of a St. Louis, plumbing contractor is a heavy-hitter who
regularly swaps Dollars 50m positions in the bond futures pit. Fellow
traders say that Baldwin, who risks his own money in the pits, is one of the
few locals who can stand up against the waves of trades made by
international banks. Smaller locals often mimic his actions trade-for-trade,
hoping to profit from his strategies.
He came to Chicago 10 years ago with a degree in biology, Dollars 20,000 in
savings and no experience in financial markets. After six months trading
T-bond futures, he had rung up Dollars 8,000 of losses and was near quitting
when his luck turned. Today, he declines to comment on his net worth,
although friends estimate it at Dollars 50m.
The road to riches hasn't been entirely smooth. For instance, on March 17
1989, he began an early-morning bond-buying spree that left him holding
6,000 T-bond futures contracts, or Dollars 600m worth of Treasury bonds. He
expected US inflation data released later that morning to support bond
prices and add to his profits. Instead, bond prices plunged, and he had to
work frantically to reverse his position. By the time he had sold out,
Baldwin was holding trading cards with Dollars 5m in losses. He returned to
the market the following morning unruffled, and continued with his business.
Baldwin has made enough money to allow him to retire from the strains of the
pit. Instead, he is diversifying his business. He heads The Baldwin Group,
comprised of a property developer, several charitable ventures, and a series
of offshore futures funds. Last year he also became a director of the
Chicago Board of Trade.
Baldwin will continue to trade, he says, in part because the game is
addictive, and in part, because he finds the chaos of the pit relaxing.
There is a saying in Chicago that locals are only fit for the pits. Baldwin,
however, has a taste for international business. In his first property
venture with ING Bank of the Netherlands and Chevron Oil to purchase and
develop a LaSalle Street landmark, the Rookery Building, for Dollars 100m.
Seeing that managed futures was a growth industry with steady cash returns,
Baldwin entered a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation in 1989 to form
MC Baldwin Financial, which administers six futures funds in Japan with
collective assets of about Dollars 100m.
Last month MC Baldwin was appointed trading manager of a Luxembourg-based
futures fund to be marketed in Germany by Hypo-Bank. Hypo has committed
DM35m to the fund in the first such venture of its kind in Germany. MC
Baldwin also administers a futures fund for Heinhold in the US. Together,
Baldwin says his funds are up 22 per cent for the year.
He doesn't personally handle the funds' assets, but oversees the selection
of trading advisers. He plans to keep the business small, picking partners
such as Hypo and Mitsubishi to market the funds, and concentrating his
management on risk control.

The new year has brought a rude reminder that the US Treasury market's
tolerance to bad news is not inexhaustible.
Dealers had grown accustomed to report after report showing the economy
expanding at a stronger-
than-expected rate in the fourth quarter. Yields on longer-dated bonds
remained fairly stable through most of December.
However, as the first quarter begins, the market seems to have lost some of
its composure. Last Thursday, news of a surge in new-home sales rekindled
fears of inflation and sent the yield on the 30-year issue up 10 basis
points to 6.34 per cent.
The jump was somewhat exaggerated by the low volume of trading.
Yesterday, the market was hit with a further blow. The National Association
of Purchasing Management said its December composite index, an important
leading indicator, rose to 57.9 per cent, from November's reading of 55.7
per cent. It was the third straight increase and the index's highest level
in a year.
In reaction, the benchmark 30-year issue dropped a point to 97 13/16 , and
the yield jumped to 6.41 per cent in late trading. On the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/8 to 99 7/8 , to yield 4.299 per cent.

FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: 1993 will be a hard act to follow -

Falling interest rates, rallying bond markets, yield-hungry investors and
further liberalisation of regulatory constraints helped make 1993 the best
ever year for the Eurobond market. The volume of new issues rose to a record
level of nearly Dollars 400bn in 1993, up 45 per cent on the previous year,
according to Euromoney Bondware, and many securities houses and investment
banks posted record profits on the fixed income side of their business.
The number of borrowers from emerging markets increased substantially as
investors became more willing to take on lower-rated debt in return for
additional yield and in the hope of realising capital gains as the
creditworthiness of these borrowers improves. Latin American issuers more
than doubled their borrowing to Dollars 45.7bn and South East Asian issuance
rose by nearly 20 per cent to Dollars 50.4bn.
At the other end of the spectrum, sovereign borrowers stepped up their
activity in order to plug widening deficits resulting from the prolonged
economic slowdown or to replenish foreign currency reserves in the wake of a
series of currency crises.
The dividing line between Eurobonds, international and domestic bonds - and
between bonds and medium-term notes - became increasingly irrelevant, as
international investors broadened their horizons to take advantage of
opportunities, wherever they appeared.
The 'global' bond became more widely used. Last year saw the first D-Mark
denominated global bond, as well as the first global offerings for emerging
market borrowers.
Most currency sectors showed strong growth. In Europe, only the Ecu market
moved in the other direction, with a drop in volume from Dollars 21.7bn to
Dollars 7.1bn.
The search for higher yields encouraged investors to lengthen the duration
of portfolios. The proportion of new issues maturing in 10 years rose to 26
per cent and 11 per cent were even longer-dated.
While the fixed-rate sector of the market remained predominant, expectations
that US interest rates are bottoming out encouraged interest in the
floating-rate note market, which represented 17 per cent of new deals.
The growth of the Eurobond market across a broad range of currency sectors
favoured the large US houses, which have tried to developed trading and
sales across the whole spectrum of currencies.
Goldman Sachs displaced Deutsche Bank as the top bookrunner in 1993. Other
Wall Street firms which performed well last year were Morgan Stanley in
third place, up from a poor 16th in 1992, Lehman Brothers which rose from
14th to 6th and Salomon Brothers, which recovered from 13th to 8th place.
Against the trend, J. P. Morgan dropped from 5th to 10th place.
The Japanese securities houses, which dominated the league tables in the
late 1980s, lost further ground, with Nomura managing only 7th position,
down from 2nd, and Nikko and Daiwa falling to 13th and 14th respectively.
Although the sterling market recorded the fastest growth of any currency
sector last year, the highest ranking for a UK house was 17th position for
S. G. Warburg, up from 19th the previous year.
The recovery of investor interest in floating-rate notes allowed Kidder
Peabody to edge back into the top 20, up from 23rd last year.
While the market is expected to remain active in 1994, dealers do not expect
a frenzy of activity in the first few weeks of the year, as there was at the
start of 1993. Tight swap spreads are likely to limit arbitrage
opportunities. Further, as interest rates stop falling later in the year,
the climate for heavy issuance could become less favourable.
The Eurobond market has grown steadily throughout its 30-year history,
posting record volume in many years, but 1993 could prove a hard act to
follow.

FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Caution on scope for further gilts rally
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the staggering rally in the UK government bond market last year, fixed
income investors can be forgiven for wondering whether the party in the gilt
market is well and truly over, or whether there are further gains to be
made.
Last year was a bumper year for the gilt market: investors saw returns of
about 20 per cent in what turned out to be one of the top performing
government bond markets of the year. The redemption yield on the UK
medium-term benchmark bond - which was 10 per cent in April 1992 - started
1993 at 8.33 per cent and ended the year at 6.1 per cent.
The gilt market rally was driven by expectations of a much improved
inflation background and the prospect of cuts in the base rate, and took
place despite initial concerns about the huge volume of gilts that the Bank
of England would have to sell in order to fund the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement.
The November 30 Budget provided a further boost for the UK government bond
market, as it emerged that net sales of gilts would be lower than expected
in the next financial year.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, forecast a diminishing PSBR
over the next few years, implying a decline in supply in the gilt market.
The Budget announcements, coupled with more good news on the inflation
front, helped to spur another burst of activity in the gilt market in
December.
Mr Jonathan Francis, head of global strategy at Putnam Investments of the
US, says he has been enthusiastic about the prospects for gilts for several
reasons: 'After the Budget, we felt greatly encouraged by the funding
requirement being lower. We also like the inflation outlook, which has
turned around quite substantially in the last quarter.'
Added to this, Mr Francis believes the UK looks attractive in 'the
pan-European context, as Europe could see some widespread political
uncertainty, with elections in Germany and a general election in Italy (in
1994), which means that we see the UK as a relatively benign political
environment.'
However, while some UK and overseas investors see limited scope for further
gains in the gilt market, others believe the market is now over-valued.
One leading European fund manager, who preferred not to be named, said: 'The
Budget, if you believe it, was good for gilts - it makes inroads into the
PSBR. But there is a serious questionmark over whether tax increases and
spending cuts can go through unamended in the years to come, given the
nature of politics. A lot of the proposals are to be drawn over time so the
question is whether the government will come up with other compensatory
measures nearer the time.'
Many fund managers admit that the gilt market has already surpassed their
forecasts and targets. Ten-year gilts were yielding 110 - 120 basis points
over comparable German government paper at the start of 1993: towards the
end of December 1993, the yield spread had narrowed to around 50 basis
points, defying earlier forecasts and expectations in the market.
Says one UK fund manager 'As a house, we've been bullish on the gilt market
all year, and the market has already hit our target, going through our
forecast of 10-year yields at 6.5 per cent. But we are still very positive
on the inflation front and that should give the market some support even if
it goes sideways for a bit. We think the spread over other European bonds
should continue to decline.'
Mr John Hynes, global bond analyst at Fidelity, the big US fund manager,
remains bullish on the gilt market for several reasons, and maintains that
'even though there has been a rally since the Budget, there is still further
to go and we feel there is value in the curve in the five to 10-year area.'
He points out that the positive shape of the yield curve means that
investors can borrow cheaply at the short end to fund their longer
positions: 'The hedge cost is low because you can borrow at the short end
and invest at the long end, whereas with Germany, the shape of the yield
curve means it is more expensive to hedge. There are a lot of good stories
out there in Europe, and we'll see a lot more rate cuts in Europe (in 1994)
but the gilt market is the cheapest one in which to participate.'
Mr Hynes adds: 'In the UK, we expect to see a US-type situation of slow
growth and low inflationary pressures which is good for the long end.'
Mr Larry Teitelbaum, portfolio manager for global and international bonds at
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, points out that 'gilts are attractive versus the
US and other Europeans, but we're not inclined to think the market will run
away from the other Europeans as it has already outperformed'.
In other words, even the more optimistic are cautious about just how much
further the gilt market can rally. 'There's been an enormous rally in gilts:
the party is nearly over, but the punch hasn't quite run out yet,' says Mr
Ceris Williams, director of fixed income investments at Rothschild Asset
Management.

Yields on German government bonds ended 1993 close to an historical low.
This reflects investors' clear expectations that the Bundesbank will
continue with its programme of cuts in 'official' short-term interest rates
during 1994.
The first chance for the Bundesbank to cut rates will come at the meeting of
the central bank's policy-making council scheduled for Thursday this week.
A public holiday in some parts of Germany means that many regional banks
will be closed, so for that reason alone it is unlikely that the Bundesbank
will cut the Lombard and discount rates from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent
respectively.
But if January 6 is difficult from a timing point of view, so is January 20,
the council's second meeting in 1994.
At around this time the January inflation figures will appear. The
annualised inflation rate is likely to be 3.6 per cent - unchanged on the
previous month as a result of tax increases - and the Bundesbank is said to
be unlikely to send the wrong signals by making a cut in its headline rates.
Should monetary policy ease in January, it is likely to be via slow, small
cuts in the securities repurchase rate - the repo rate - with which the
Bundesbank guides money market rates.

Growing expectations that the Bank of Japan will lower the nation's official
discount rate this month to boost the domestic economy will lift the No 157
10-year benchmark government bond this first week of 1994.
The argument for lower interest rates was strengthened recently with
economic data that revealed a 6.9 per cent year-on-year decline in the
nation's retail sales for an 18th consecutive monthly drop, and a 2.8 per
cent rise in Japanese unemployment, the worse figure in six years. Bleak
corporate earnings reports will add more evidence to the case of easier
credit.
A cut in the ODR rate, which is already at a record low of 1.75 per cent, is
likely to prompt investors to move money from short-term debt into higher
yielding, long-term securities.
Some investors still worry, however, that bond prices, after months of an
extended rise, will soon decline on profit-taking. But this kind of anxiety
is countered by the widely held view that weakness in the Japanese economy
will continue, and that long-term interest rates will remain low. And
brokers expect buying on dips.
Even an end to the bond gains will hardly result in an automatic transfer of
monies into stocks.

The UK government bond market continued its rally at the year-end and is
likely to be buoyed by interest rate speculation this week, especially as
all the European bond markets will be focusing on the Bundesbank Council
meeting this Thursday in the hope of seeing a cut in the key German interest
rates.
Hopes are high of a cut in the UK base rate - currently at 5.5 per cent -
early on in 1994, and dealers say a 50 basis point cut has already been
discounted by the gilt market.
Although trading was quite thin over the Christmas and new year break, the
gilt market still made some headway and was the best performing government
bond market in the week ending December 30, according to Salomon Brothers
bond data.
Much of the focus was on the index-linked sector and the Bank of England
took advantage of the interest, announcing four index-linked tap stocks on
Thursday. The Pounds 750m of stock available consisted of Pounds 150m of 2
1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2001; Pounds 250m of 4 3/8 per cent
index-linked stock due 2004; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked
stock due 2013; and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due
2030.
Although the market was only open for half the day on New Year's Eve, the
Bank sold out of the first two tap stocks.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Wary eyes focus on bullish Asian markets -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost anybody who invested in emerging markets in 1993 will not be
regretting the decision. Spectacular increases in many markets were well in
excess of gains to be found in most developed countries. The combination of
rapidly growing economies, solid earnings growth, and weight of new money
was extraordinarily powerful.
But as the new year gets under way with a bang - eight Asian markets hit new
records yesterday - investors may ask how long the good times can go on.
Aren't emerging markets just a fad? Won't they soon come crashing down? Old
Asia hands might say that the only new factor in their region has been the
attention suddenly paid by foreign fund managers: dependably rapid
development has been under way in Asia for a long time - even China, of
which everybody wants to get a piece, has been reforming for over 15 years
now.
The suspicion that it's just a game to the fickle foreigners was fuelled in
1993 by pronouncements about China from Morgan Stanley, the US investment
bank. First it extolled China as the place to be (via Hong Kong). But a few
weeks later the portfolio weighting was reduced to below the level of before
the bullish remarks. What had appeared an important strategic statement
turned out to be a short-term, profitable play.
Apart from underlying fear that international cash will flow on into the
next investment wave, leaving emerging markets behind, there are signs
causing concern in some markets - such as an abnormally high level of retail
activity. Alarm bells should start ringing when brokers' analysis argues,
however plausibly, that normal standards for price/earnings ratios do not
apply because of the peculiarities of a particular market. Remember Japan?
How then should the investor approach emerging markets? A few points are
worth bearing in mind by the investor who wants to be sure of making a
strategic decision intended to bring benefits over the long term. The first
is that, as the word 'emerging' implies, the markets are not fully developed
and are thus more risky than those in the industrialised world. This does
not necessarily mean that the economic and political risks are greater,
though they may be. The markets are smaller, less liquid, more volatile.
They may be lacking in key areas of infrastructure: management of the stock
exchange and its settlement mechanisms, standards of regulation and
disclosure, transparency of corporate accounts, development of associated
financial markets, restrictions on foreign investors, and the taxation
system. Part of the investor's bet is that these handicaps will be removed
over time.
Second, the term 'emerging markets' covers a wide range of economies and
political systems. No two countries can be regarded as essentially the same,
even neighbours. Knowledge of individual countries - and of the companies
within them - is vital. So is an ability to step back and examine the wider
picture, analysing potential returns compared with other emerging as well as
developed markets. Like the markets themselves, the information flow about
emerging markets is still very much in the development stage.
The message from these points is that the ride is likely to be long and
bumpy. In exchange for greater risk and need for costly specialist
expertise, investors naturally expect a higher, sustained return. Rapid
rates of economic growth maintained over many years will help to provide
that.
But the effect of capital flows cannot be ignored. The plain fact is that,
until now, sharp price gains have been seen partly because the amounts of
foreign money, though perhaps quite small to the owners, are large for the
markets into which they have been flowing.
Baring Securities estimates that a net Dollars 38bn (Pounds 26bn) was
invested by foreigners in 1993 in the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) and
Latin America, double the amount in 1992. It expects a modest increase to
Dollars 45bn in 1994. Even although it expects a tightening of US monetary
policy eventually to trigger a scaling back of US investment abroad, it
still forecasts that US investors will put Dollars 15-Dollars 20bn into
emerging markets this year. Nevertheless, it warns that 'it is prudent to
scale down exposure to those markets which have been fuelled exclusively by
foreign money of late.'
Salomon Brothers argues that pension funds, which it classifies as 'patient'
investors in contrast to those with 'hot' or 'momentum' money, are likely to
allocate a growing proportion of their growing pool to Asia. It says that
this new money is unlikely to be removed quickly and 'is a meaningful
proportion of the current free float of these markets and could rise to a
substantial percentage of the available equity.'
While this would aid confidence if it proved true, it still means that the
foreign investor who is in emerging markets for the long term has a problem.
The impact of the capital flow to which he is contributing is an important
factor in the strong performance of his portfolio. Only continued
development of emerging economies and markets can correct the imbalance. But
governments can help by allowing markets and the surrounding infrastructure
to develop so that foreign investors, with better information and security,
are less likely to pile out as quickly as they have piled in.

Taiwan
Taiwan's proposed stock capital gains tax is expected to have only a limited
impact on the bull run which saw the market rise by 80 per cent in 1993.
Mr Lin Chen-kuo, finance minister, has proposed a complex tax with different
rates for institutions and individual investors. If approved it would take
effect on July 1.
Pakistan
The privatisation commission is to offer 'a substantial number' of state
industrial enterprises for sale in the next two months and is also examining
the feasibility of privatising all public firms through the stock market.
South Korea
The Economic Planning Board has drawn up a reform plan to streamline
management of dozens of state companies through privatisations and mergers.
The EPB said 42 state-run and funded companies would be privatised between
1994 and 1997.
Indonesia
Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, investment minister, has said that domestic
companies can go overseas to list shares, selling up to a maximum of 30 per
cent of their stakes, as long as proceeds are to be reinvested in Indonesia.
Philippines
The merger of the rival Manila and Makati stock exchanges should be
completed this month, in spite of a sharp disagreement in financing a single
equities market.
Hong Kong
The Stock Exchange has said it will be more strict in enforcing rules
requiring stock issuers and their advisers to submit documents on time.
The exchange did not set new penalties for tardy compliance, but warned that
listings could be delayed.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling and dollar strength to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of foreign exchange trading to normal this week after the
Christmas and new year market closures will put the new-found strength of
the dollar and sterling to the test, write Peter Norman and Alan Pike.
Sterling ended last year close to its year's high when measured on the Bank
of England's trade weighted index and is expected to be well supported so
long as economic recovery is sustained.
The dollar last week came close to its 1993 high against the D-Mark and was
pushing against the Y112 barrier.
Many dealers expect that the US currency will continue to move upwards as
liquidity in the market returns to normal and investors take account of
recent favourable economic indicators and growing expectations that the
Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary policy.
By comparison, poor growth prospects for Germany and Japan have undermined
the D-Mark and yen.
The dollar's strength poses a dilemma for the German authorities. Although
hopes were high in December that the Bundesbank might decide at its first
council meeting of the year on Thursday to lower its 5.75 per cent discount
rate, the D-Mark's recent weakness could encourage a more cautious approach.
Last Friday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, reaffirmed the
importance of a stable D-Mark and said the central bank would resist
pressure for 'generous' cuts in Germany's official interest rates.
He underlined that Germany would have trouble attracting foreign capital to
finance its deficits if the stability of the D-Mark were jeopardised.
Yesterday, with the London markets shut, trading elsewhere in Europe was
quiet with low volumes. The D-Mark firmed slightly, and Mr Tietmeyer revived
speculation of a German interest rate cut with comments in Sunday's Welt am
Sonntag newspaper.
The Bundesbank president expressed the expectation that German inflation
could fall below 3 per cent this year and commented: 'Our policy also
includes the possibility of further interest rate cuts in the event that the
expansion of money supply weakens.'
In France, the decision by banks to lower base rates from tomorrow fueled
speculation that official rate cuts may follow soon.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Economic Notebook: UK inflation: a snake scotched but not
killed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, the idea was radical: now it is commonplace. Pick up any
brokers' circular or attend a City investment seminar, and the chances are
that a key part of the message will be that the days of high inflation are
over.
In Britain's case, the drop in inflation was certainly the surprise story of
last year. In spite of sterling's steep devaluation after September 1992,
headline inflation has fallen to 1.4 per cent - about the level in the early
1960s.
The latest figures, for November, put the government's chosen underlying
rate of inflation, measured by the retail prices index less mortgage
interest payments, at 2.5 per cent, the lowest level for 26 years and
exactly in the middle of its 1-4 per cent target range.
Other recent price indications have been encouraging. Both the Confederation
of British Industry and Income Data Services, an independent pay monitoring
body, last week reported further slowing of pay increases in the private
sector. The CBI's pay data bank showed manufacturing pay deals averaged only
2.2 per cent in the three months to November. Government figures show
average earnings rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, lower than at any
time since a temporary incomes policy in the late 1960s. Although
manufacturers' selling prices rose faster last year than in 1992, the
post-devaluation rise in the cost of inputs has gone into reverse in recent
months, aided by a sharp drop in oil prices.
But at the risk of sounding gloomy, it is too soon to declare an end to
inflation. The disinflationary forces that built up during the recession and
the long period of high interest rates and a strong sterling exchange rate
that precipitated it have almost certainly passed their peak. It is as yet
unclear whether last year's unexpectedly good price performance has
eradicated the UK's long standing inflation mentality.
Adjusting after more than 20 years of high inflation is not easy and there
are one or two straws in the wind to suggest that inflation is suppressed
rather than dead.
The indicative rates of return on investments of 6 and 12 per cent per year
that are currently quoted by personal pension providers appear ambitious if
the government is to be taken seriously when it says it aims to have
underlying inflation in the lower part of its target range by the end of
this parliament.
The tendency for companies to push up their margins aggressively wherever
possible has troubled the Bank of England, which sees this as an example of
behaviour that is out of tune with permanent low inflation.
The increase in margins coupled with higher activity as Britain recovers
from recession should be reflected in improved profits this year. It would
be characteristic, after a period of extended pay restraint, for the
coincidence of improved profits, greater output and employment, and higher
personal taxes from April to be reflected in increased pressure for higher
pay. It would be equally in character for British managements to bow to such
pay pressures.
A cautionary tale emerges from the accompanying chart prepared by Ian
Harnett of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. This shows how UK
inflation, relative to the average of the 24 members of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, has fallen to its lowest level since
August 1963. This suggests that domestic rather than global factors have
been responsible for Britain's good inflation performance last year.
But Mr Harnett points out that such a good relative inflation performance in
the past has been unsustainable. The UK and OECD inflation rates have
typically equalised within a year of the trough, and usually through British
inflation rising, rather than world inflation slowing.
There are grounds to hope that this pattern will not be repeated.
International competition in the traded goods sector is intensifying, thanks
partly to the rapid industrialisation and integration into the world economy
of former developing countries in east Asia and Latin America. This trend
will be enhanced by the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade liberalisation negotiations.
There is probably still a considerable amount of slack in the UK economy.
Last month, the OECD estimated that the gap between the UK's real and
potential gross domestic product last year was 5.5 per cent: the second
highest of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The UK Treasury,
according to Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser,
has come to a broadly similar conclusion. It estimates the output gap at
between 3 and 7 per cent.
But the wide range cited by Mr Budd at a post-Budget Commons Treasury and
Civil Service Committee hearing also highlights the statistical uncertainty
surrounding the UK economy. If you look at industrial output figures, the
picture is one of a painfully slow and faltering recovery. Look instead at
the 175,000 drop in unemployment in the first 11 months of last year or the
steady rise in retail sales (which preceded the reports of buoyant trade in
the shops before and after Christmas) and the picture is brighter.
Such uncertainties help explain why Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and
the Bank of England have not shared the City's enthusiasm for a rapid
lowering of interest rates over the past few months. The inflation figures
for the latest two months make it unlikely that the top of the government's
target will be breached in the short term and give the authorities more
scope to ease monetary policy in the event of a sudden slowdown in the
economy. But the government and Bank are targeting inflation two years into
the future.
Until we have seen how the economy in general, and wages in particular,
respond to the higher taxes announced in last year's two Budgets, it will be
too early to consign above average inflation in Britain to the history
books.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Markets: The big question is not where but when - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four questions hang over the developed world's investment outlook for 1994.
What will happen to US interest rates? Is Germany really on its way out of
recession? Will Japan's deflation take the economy into a black hole? And
what does the future hold for China?
Answering these questions is easy. The tricky thing is estimating when the
answers take effect.
Thus, I can say with complete confidence that US interest rates have seen
their lows, and will move higher. Germany will recover from recession, and
when it does, its economy will look much healthier than now seems possible.
Japan's deflation will end short of a melt-down of the financial system, and
will give way to a period of sustained growth, thanks to wide-ranging
economic and social restructuring. And China will become the world's
industrial powerhouse.
But when?
America first
The US story illustrates how hard it is to spot the end of a trend.
Long-term US interest rates peaked at roughly 8 1/2 per cent in 1990, and
fell steadily till they brushed the 6 per cent level last autumn. Since then
they have risen slightly. Short-term rates, also down to historically low
levels, have not yet shown any signs of moving upwards.
At some point, the interest rate cycle will turn. European analysts
generally think that, for long-term US rates, the turning point was last
autumn. US analysts tend to think that the small run-up in yields since the
autumn is a false signal, soon to be reversed.
This phase of the interest rate cycle still has a good few quarters to run,
they say.
The pessimistic view would have you out of the US treasury market now,
looking for bonds with a better chance of capital appreciation, such as
Europe's high-yielders. The optimistic view would keep you in treasuries to
profit from the reversal of the autumn's run-up in rates.
The outlook for short rates is subject to equally conflicting views. The
fourth quarter seems to have been a period of strong economic growth, though
we will have to wait till Friday's payroll and unemployment numbers to be
sure. Inflation is still quiescent, though, and Thursday's money supply data
are unlikely to pose any immediate threat.
Still, the Federal Reserve will probably start easing short-term rates
higher by spring. By how much?
If the Fed plans a speedy return to traditional real interest rates, US
short-term money could soon be anything up to 2 1/2 percentage points
dearer, with much of the rise occurring this year. That would trigger a
wholesale rush by individual investors back into savings instruments,
leaving this year's favourites, bond and equity funds, looking badly mauled.
If rise in rates is largely symbolic, to show the Fed's determination to
keep inflation down, short-term rates are likely to be no more than half a
point higher by year-end. Individual investors will still find almost
anywhere a better home for their savings than banks and money funds. And any
fresh bond rally would be helped by the realisation that the Fed is keeping
a watchful eye on inflation.
The balance of probabilities suggests that long-term rates have seen their
lows for the cycle, but that the rise in short-term rates will be slower
than the pessimists fear. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, is a master of
gradualism. US rates, at both ends of the yield curve, are likely to be
higher in December than they are now - but only a little higher.
Germany's challenge
Just before Christmas, Germany's economy presented a similar clash of views.
The optimists - mostly inside Germany - argued that the recession was, in
statistical terms, already over. Growth, still faltering, would resume
solidly from the middle of the year. The pessimists saw a further
contraction in the first part of 1994, with little sign of recovery before
year-end.
Since then, a fierce confidence offensive by the optimists - especially by
Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister - has swayed opinion their way.
From the point of view of Germany's equity market, this debate is all rather
academic. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, predicted a strong
rally among German blue chips in 1993, on the back of lower interest rates
expectations, high liquidity, completion of the Gatt talks and so on. He got
it, in spades. The 47 per cent rise in the Dax index in 1993 understates the
performance of some of the biggest companies: Mannesmann rose 86 per cent,
Deutsche Babcock rose 83 per cent, Volkswagen, despite its legal wrangle
with Opel, rose 82 per cent.
Mr Frahm is still positive about 1994, but the challenge for Germany -
political worries apart - is to manage the shift from a liquidity-driven
market to an earnings-driven one. He thinks this shift will start in the
autumn, round about the time he expects the economy to pick up. He does not
necessarily expect the market to make the transition smoothly, predicting a
hiccup for share prices before investors focus on the much happier profit
outlook for 1995.
That view, and the Dax's performance in recent months, both assume that the
German economy is heading, sometime this year, into a normal cyclical
recovery. If, instead, 1994 is as unhappy a year for the average citizen as
1993, then the voters will have every opportunity to show their distress:
there are 20 national, European and regional elections this year. The timing
of Germany's recovery is perhaps more critical than the stock market's
insouciance suggests.
Japan's new consensus
Calling the bottom in the Japanese economic cycle is just as hard. Quite
apart from the still-not-properly digested effects of the 1980s bubble,
Japan faces a structural issue. If German output is threatened by the
millions of eastern European workers starting to be unleashed on the market
system, Japan's is threatened by the growth of south-east Asia as the
workshop of the world. Like Germany, Japan has been over-reliant on
manufacturing.
Change is coming in both countries. Germany's private sector is responding
faster than the public sector; in Japan, the reverse may be true. Large
Japanese companies seem frozen by the crisis, unable to believe that
manufacturing excellence alone is not enough.
The new Japanese government, despite its inherent weakness, is making a
bolder stab at facing up to the new realities. The governmental paralysis in
Tokyo - a prime cause of the stock market's dreadful performance in late
1993 - may in fact be preparing the way for the emergence of a new
political/bureaucratic consensus. That is only part of the precondition for
another stock market boom; some sign that corporate Japan is also embracing
a new era is also required. Optimists will be watching for the first
indications of both in 1994; either would be better news than the market was
able to count on in 1993.
China's myths
US investors were buying foreign equities at the rate of Dollars 2bn a week
in the third quarter of last year, according to figures released yesterday
by the Securities Industry Association. That's the equivalent, during the
quarter, of all the shares available for purchase by foreigners in the
Barings indices for Chile, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Much of the money went into Asia's soaring equities, analysed in more detail
by Alexander Nicoll later in this section. But investors are attracted to
the region not just because of the rapid growth of the south-east Asian
tigers. Arguably a more powerful attraction, not for the first time this
century, is the lure of China.
Its vast population enables anyone with a calculator that will handle
billions to create fantasies of infinite growth. As the Lancashire textile
barons said during their slump at the turn of the century: if every Chinaman
added a foot to his shirt-length, there would be enough work to keep the
mills of Oldham humming forever. (That, of course, was before the mills of
Oldham were replaced by the mills of Guangdong.)
Up till now, western investors have had to buy into this proposition by
proxy. But the most significant development of the turn of the year was the
announcement of China's new unified exchange rate for the yuan, an important
step on the road towards conventional portfolio investment in China.
As it gradually becomes possible to invest there directly, instead of
through proxies, China will move out of the realms of myth and become a
straightforward investment proposition. That will help it to become, as it
surely will, the main force for economic growth sometime in the 21st
century.
Getting there won't be easy, however: there is every sign, for example, that
the current growth rate will provoke another overheating crisis sometime in
the next 18 months. Opening up China to real investment will expose
investors directly to the risks, as well as the rewards, of a giant economy
growing at breakneck speed. It will make investing in the rest of the
Pacific Rim a bit more exciting, too.
Shiny new ritual
The City's army of monetary economists have always lacked the sense of
occasion created by the regular meetings of the Fed's Open Market Committee
and the Bundesbank Council. Until now. The new sort-of-semi-independent
status of Bank of England means that, in theory, monetary policy will be
settled at the monthly meetings of the governor and the chancellor of the
exchequer. The Bank will then be free to implement any changes at a time of
its choosing, but before the next meeting.
The two next meet on January 12. Expect a flurry of excitement before each
meeting, and an orgy of anticipation afterwards as the markets wait to see
what, if anything, was decided.
But what's to stop the chancellor picking up the telephone any day he
chooses?
The total return tables which usually appear on this page were unavailable

FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Vote hits Rothman's E Asia
merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Malaysian subsidiary of Rothmans International, the British
tobacco giant, fell sharply on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange yesterday
following a weekend vote by Malaysian shareholders rejecting a plan to merge
Rothmans operations in East Asia.
Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) shares, which opened at MDollars 26
(USDollars 9.70), closed down more than MDollars 4 at MDollars 21.40.
'There's a lot of speculation now about what Rothmans International intends
to do,' said a Kuala Lumpur broker. 'In the short term, shareholders in the
Malaysian company will see the value of their shares go down - but no one is
too upset at the moment.'
The shares have been trading strongly recently, rising from MDollars 13.50
last November.
Rothmans International had planned to merge subsidiaries in Malaysia and
Singapore with company operations elsewhere in East Asia. Rothmans planned
to use the combined financial muscle of the new company for a big marketing
drive in China and north-east Asia, where Rothmans still lags behind its
competitors.
While shareholders in the Rothmans subsidiary in Singapore voted for the
merger plan, Malaysian shareholders raised objections, saying that Rothmans
intended to take cash out of the highly profitable local unit to finance a
big marketing campaign in China and Japan.
Rothmans-made cigarettes now control about 55 per cent of the Malaysian
market.
In the year ending March 31 1993, Rothmans Malaysian and Singapore units
made a combined operating profit of Dollars 150.6m while Rothmans made
combined losses elsewhere in the region of Dollars 30.3m.
Permodalan Nasional (PNB), a state controlled investment company and one of
the biggest institutional shareholders in Rothmans (Malaysia) said it was
against the new plan because 'with the merger, the focus will . . . be
diverted to East Asia'.
Shareholders are now awaiting the next move by Rothmans International.

FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us has a better
Christmas than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Toys 'R' Us, the US children's retailing chain, yesterday announced that
sales in the crucial Christmas shopping period were slightly better than
expected.
The company also said that its founder and chairman, Mr Charles Lazarus, was
relinquishing some of his responsibilities in what he described as 'an
integral part of our succession planning process'.
In his place, Mr Michael Goldstein, vice-chairman, will take over as chief
executive, responsible for overall corporate strategy, while Mr Robert
Nakasone will assume the duties of chief operating officer, in charge of the
company's day-to-day activities.
Sales for US stores opened at least a year were up 7.4 per cent in the eight
weeks ended December 25, while title revenues showed a 14.9 per cent
improvement to Dollars 3.4bn. Year-to-date sales climbed 10.8 per cent to
Dollars 7.46bn.
International sales were not as buoyant, particularly in Germany, Japan and
Spain, where economic conditions were sluggish.
Toys 'R' Us attributed the overall improvement to its 'everyday low pricing'
policy as well as several merchandising initiatives. A 70-page catalogue
mailed to 52m homes this autumn was especially effective in boosting sales.
The announcement ended the company's traditional year-end blackout on news
related to its performance in the Christmas season, when most toy retailers
are anxious to feed the market sales data. As a result, its stock is often
volatile in the first half of January.
In the event, Toys 'R' US not only beat the forecasts of most analysts, but
turned in an admirable showing 'if viewed in the context of what anyone
would describe as challenging Christmas environment this year,' said Ms
Maureen McGrath, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York.
Nevertheless, Wall Street responded to the news by marking the stock down
Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 40.
Ms McGrath said the stock's decline reflected disappointment with the
executive changes, even though Mr Goldstein, 52, and Mr Nakasone, 46, were
well respected by the investment community. 'Anytime a machine is working
and there is a change, the market will react negatively.'
Mr Lazarus, 70, is expected to maintain an active role in the company,
concentrating on its aggressive international expansion programme.

FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Apple plans worldwide on-line
service

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer, the personal computer maker, plans to develop a global
on-line service called eWorld that will be a key element in its strategy to
increase profits after a troubled year of layoffs and top management
changes.
The on-line service will be available in the US during the second quarter of
1994 and will be expanded to European and Asian markets later. Within five
years Apple expects eWorld to produce annual revenues of several hundred
million dollars and to attract several million subscribers.
Apple's eWorld will compete directly with market leaders Prodigy,
Compuserve, America Online and Genie. The on-line service will offer
different types of services and a special graphical user interface in which
users can more easily gain access to services and find information.
Almost all Apple Macintosh computers sold in 1994 will contain eWorld
communications software and a version for Windows systems will be available
at the end of 1994. Owners of Apple's hand-held Newton MessagePad system
will use eWorld to send electronic messages and to subscribe to news
services.
Apple declined to say how much it is investing in eWorld which will be
financed mostly from profits from the AppleLink on-line service which
generates annual revenues of about Dollars 32m and has 60,000 subscribers,
mostly software developers and Apple dealers. Mr Joshua Harris, on-line
services analyst at New York based consultancy Jupiter Communications, said
that Apple was late entering the market.
Sprint and British Telecom will provide Apple with communications links to
its data centre in Napa, California, which will host the on-line service.
Rival on-line services company American Online has licensed key software to
Apple as part of a cross-technology licensing agreement.

<TEXT>
Creditanstalt Bankverein (CA), one of Austria's three biggest banks,
yesterday reported record provisional operating profits of Sch5.3bn (Dollars
434m) for 1993, an increase of more than 55 per cent on the Sch3.4bn
achieved in 1992.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, managing board chairman, said the results were 'the
best the bank has ever posted,' signalling a 'clear trend reversal' after
difficult years.
The improved earnings performance was due mainly to a steep rise in trading
activity and profits which doubled to Sch2.4bn last year. It also benefited
from favourable developments in the securities market.
Partial operating profits - interest plus fee income minus operating
expenses - rose from Sch2.1bn in 1992 to Sch2.7bn last year. As other
Austrian banks, CA has been under pressure to reduce operating costs which
rose by 1 per cent last year to Sch8.5bn. Personnel has been reduced by 272
employees to 7,457.

FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS in aircraft leaseback deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAS, the Scandinavian airline group, yesterday announced a SKr3bn (Dollars
359m) sale and leaseback deal for six of its Boeing 767 passenger aircraft
with an unnamed external partner and the sale of its SAS Royal Hotel in
Cologne to a German investor group.
The aircraft transaction, which leaves SAS with a SKr800m capital gain, is
an important step towards the airline's financial consolidation, SAS said.
The group is carrying out a tough programme to cut costs by SKr2.5bn by the
end of 1994 following a SKr1.1bn loss in the first nine months of 1993. The
loss included unrealised exchange rate losses of SKr1.15bn, reflecting the
depreciation of the Swedish krona since it was floated in November 1992.
A rise in the value of its aircraft of approximately the same order,
however, was not entered into the profit and loss account, SAS said.
SAS said the SKr800m capital gain from the arrangement is 'primarily a
foreign exchange gain, which will neutralise most of the foreign exchange
loss in 1993'.
The group is still considering its options following the collapse of the
Alcazar project at the end of November, which was to have brought about a
merger between SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines to form a leading
new European airline.

FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: De Crespigny hits a rough patch
 -A rare Australian corporate 'tall poppy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last week, the corporate career of Mr Robert J. Champion de Crespigny
almost seemed to be fashioned by the gods. The Australian mining executive,
head of the flourishing Normandy Poseidon gold empire, rejoiced in the
oft-bestowed title of the country's only surviving entrepreneur.
The title has been well-earned. Since 1985, Mr de Crespigny has parlayed a
ADollars 500,000 position in an obscure Australian resource company into a
web of companies which are today capitalised at close to ADollars 5bn
(USDollars 3.3bn) and control annual gold production of well over 1m oz.
This heady growth record seemed set for another spurt in mid-December when a
Normandy offshoot launched a ADollars 260m takeover bid for Aztec Mining,
the Australian affiliate of Alumax, the US metals group. But just days
later, all was thrown into doubt with notification that Mr de Crespigny and
one of his former executives were to be charged by the Commonwealth Director
of Public Prosecutions.
Consistent with the aggressive style that has become his trademark, Mr de
Crespigny took the unusual step of foreshadowing the charges himself through
a note to the Australian Stock Exchange. The note said the charges would
allege that Mr de Crespigny and then fellow executive Mr Thomas Meiklejohn
failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that takeover documents delivered
in 1989 did not contain misleading information.
Mr de Crespigny maintains that he is innocent of the charges and will defend
them vigorously, but he admits they are bound to cause him 'enormous
personal damage'. So far, no charges have been formally laid, but commercial
judgment was swift, with initial falls in the share prices of most listed
entities in the Normandy Poseidon group.
Pronounced 'de krepney' and dubbed not so affectionately 'discrepancy' by
some of his gold industry rivals, Mr de Crespigny is one of the few
surviving corporate tall poppies in a land renowned for lopping them off.
No-one builds an empire like Normandy Poseidon without making some enemies.
Those on the receiving end of his many takeover forays have often accused Mr
de Crespigny of being a front for Anglo American, the South African mining
group. The Anglo group is Normandy Poseidon's biggest shareholder, with just
under 20 per cent of the capital.
But few realistically dispute that de Crespigny, with the title of executive
chairman, effectively controls the group with a personal interest of just 11
per cent. Other large shareholders include the AMP Society and the National
Mutual group, Australia's two largest investment institutions.
This structure forms the basis of another snipe from de Crespigny's rivals -
that he sits atop a convoluted corporate web much in the style of Mr John
Spalvins' failed Adsteam group, with control often based on interests of
less than 50 per cent.
Mr de Crespigny's aristocratic name is itself sufficient to make him an
oddity in the rough and tumble Australian mining industry. But his
aristocratic connections are distant. Mr de Crespigny's forbears lived in
Normandy, hence the name of his flagship company. His family migrated to
Australia via England in the 1850s, making Mr de Crespigny a
fifth-generation Australian and the first to move from the family base in
conservative Victoria to the racier atmosphere of Western Australia.
His group's current bid for Aztec has its ironies because Mr de Crespigny
got his start in the mining industry as that company's finance director
before going solo with a company called Amad.
Mr de Crespigny has always seen himself as a financial manager rather than a
miner or explorer. His companies have grown through takeover rather than
minerals discovery. He is seen as one of the most frugal managers in the
business, shrewd in hiring top resource specialists.
Among a string of corporate deals since 1985, two stand out as shaping
today's Normandy Poseidon. One was the successful raising of ADollars 114m
through equity issues just before the 1987 share crash. This financed the
purchase of Poseidon, the most enduring remnant of Australia's infamous
1969-70 nickel boom. Poseidon now controls some of the country's lowest cost
gold mines.
The other deal involved Mr de Crespigny in the ADollars 350m sale of some
key gold interests in 1987 to Mr Alan Bond, now a bankrupt. Mr de Crespigny
was able to repossess the assets because an ailing Bond group could not meet
the terms of the arrangement. This allowed Mr de Crespigny to emerge as a
pivotal stake holder in Kalgoorlie's Golden Mile, at the centre of
Australia's gold mining industry.
Mr de Crespigny has made a specialty of taking on some of the world's
leading mining houses in corporate battles. Apart from the current joust
with an Alumax associate, Mr de Crespigny has also locked horns with
Freeport McMoRan and Newmont of the US and Germany's Metallgesellschaft.
As if to show he is an all-rounder, Mr de Crespigny has also performed on
the defensive side, having fought off the unwanted attentions of TNT, the
Australian transport group.

FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: How Serco became Cinderella's Prince
Charming - A look at one of the stock market's best performers through the
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winning a business enterprise award recently presented a ticklish logistical
problem for Serco, the contract management group - how to show the prize to
as many employees as possible, given that they operate on more than 400
sites worldwide.
The 9,500 staff who work for the group and its associates perform a
bewildering variety of tasks: everything from servicing RAF helicopters to
looking after buildings for corporate customers such as Marks and Spencer
and Barclays.
Yet the range of Serco's work has not prevented the low-profile company from
being one of the stock market's best performers through the recession. Since
flotation in late 1988, the group's market value has increased more than
seven-fold to its present level of Pounds 146m. Pre-tax profits are this
year expected to top Pounds 9m, compared with Pounds 3m in the year it came
to market.
Serco has successfully ridden a wave which has swept both the public and
private sectors, first in the US and more recently in the UK and beyond.
Variously dubbed contractorisation, outsourcing, or - in the case of the
public sector - privatisation, it involves organisations concentrating on
their core functions by farming out peripheral activities, normally cutting
costs in the process.
Mr Richard White, Serco's managing director, says coping with the consequent
diversity of activities within the group is simple: 'Essentially it is a
management question. We build strong teams and then maintain tight financial
control.'
Serco was established in 1929 by RCA to service the US group's British
cinemas, and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1987, a year before
flotation. Mr White says the most important legacy from RCA is Serco's
tradition of strong financial reporting disciplines.
What Mr White describes as Serco's big break came in 1964 when RCA was
awarded the contract to look after the RAF's Fylingdales missile
early-warning station in North Yorkshire. The contract, which Serco has
retained, involves the operation of the radar system, as well as cleaning
and maintaining the base.
This track record - and subsequent substantial contracts with the European
Space Agency - meant the RCA offshoot was well placed when the Ministry of
Defence started contracting out more services in the eighties.
Defence-related work still accounts for about 40 per cent of Serco's
business. Mr White says he is not unhappy with that balance - indeed the
pressure on defence spending seems likely to increase the pace of
contracting out of MoD services.
Serco has, however, widened its field operations beyond the defence field,
although public sector contracts still account for about 90 per cent of
business. The group now runs sports centres for local authorities, road
management schemes and air traffic control systems. Mr White estimates his
group can save most clients up to 30 per cent of the cost of any contract.
Although Serco does normally end up employing fewer staff, he says there is
a lot more to their approach than cutting numbers.
'Often the functions we take over were the Cinderellas of an organisation.
We get a tremendous response from workforces because suddenly the thing they
do is the main attraction, which we focus on.'
All Serco's full-time employees have staff jobs, even though the group's
contracts run from one to 10 years, with five being the average. About half
the workforce is unionised. Mr White says the group is not anti-union: 'We
like unions which can negotiate long-term agreements and stick to them.'
Serco tends to avoid contracts with low added-value, such as cleaning or
security services. However, the group manages British Rail's Victoria and
Liverpool Street stations. Mr White said these contracts were taken mainly
to establish a close relationship with BR in the run-up to privatisation.
Although Serco's organic business has achieved an underlying growth rate of
nearly 20 per cent, it does not enjoy huge profitability - the operating
margin is just over 5 per cent. Mr White says: 'We are not greedy on price,
so as to increase our chance of getting renewal and thus ensure continuity
of business and stability for our staff.'
Serco now operates in 29 countries and about a fifth of the group's business
is outside the UK, with continental Europe marked as its most immediate
opportunity. Longer-term, the group is organising the 2,200 staff who work
in the Asia/Pacific area into a separate business, and aims to use existing
operations in Australia and New Zealand as a springboard into east Asia.
Organic growth has been increased to 30 per cent by acquisitions. In 1992
the group entered a new area, air traffic control, when it bought
International Aeradio, the civil aviation specialist, from BT for Pounds
12.3m.
The civil aviation services market has continued to develop well, with new
contracts including consultancy work in central and eastern Europe. The
company is now operating the Scatsta air terminal in Shetland for BP
Exploration's Sullom Voe terminal.
In July last year , Serco paid Pounds 3.5m for BM Scotland, part of the
Property Services Agency, the government's property management body. The
company said this deal brought a further 278 contracts with existing
government customers, which considerably strengthened its core business and
enhanced its position in the separate Scottish market.
Mr White believes the principle of market-testing is now relatively
non-controversial, so Serco will not suffer uncertainty when a general
election approaches. He also says the group is ready to take on a large
opportunity, although group gearing of 50 per cent means a large acquisition
would seem likely to require a rights issue.
The government's recently restated determination to press ahead with
subjecting more parts of the civil service to market forces bodes well for
companies such as Serco. Mr White says of the BM deal: 'These government
sell-offs are almost a new form of privatisation.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airport operator, said Lynton, its property development and
investment arm, had more than doubled the amount of office, retail, and
industrial space it let last year to 815,000 sq ft - more than 18 acres.
In addition, 27 acres of development land were sold, and planning consent
was achieved for a new 325,000 sq ft business park at Gatwick Airport.
Mr John O'Halloran, a director of Lynton, said he was delighted that the
business had performed so well in what was still a very difficult letting
market.

FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Good year for occupational pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British occupational pension funds performed impressively in 1993, with
buoyant equity markets largely responsible for estimated real rates of
return of more than 20 per cent.
In its initial estimates, World Markets Company, the Edinburgh-based
performance measurement specialist, says that funds made total investment
returns - capital gains plus income - of 27.8 cent last year, compared to
18.6 per cent in 1992 and an average return of 15 per cent annually over the
last 10 years.
World Markets measures the investment performance of 1,900 UK pension funds
with assets of Pounds 380bn, more than 80 per cent of the UK pension fund
market.
Emerging stock markets in east Asia, such as Hong Kong and Malaysia,
provided the most exciting growth with returns in excess of 90 per cent.
Overall, overseas shares earned returns of 37 per cent, compared with 19.7
per cent in 1992.
Returns from North America amounted to 12.9 per cent down from 32.4 per cent
in 1992. However, Japan and continental Europe both showed improvement on
1992, with increases of 35.3 (18.3 per cent) and 27.6 per cent (decline of
0.9 per cent) respect-ively.
In Japan strong growth in the first half of the year offset a sluggish
performance in the third quarter and a 13.5 per cent decline in the
finalthree months of the year.
In the UK total equity returns of 28 per cent were half a percentage point
below the FT-A All-Share Index. Investment managers also saw a strong
performance by UK bonds with returns in excess of 23 per cent on the back of
falling bond yields and declining inflation.
The 21 per cent return from index-linked gilts is the best annual return
since their launch in 1982.
The recovery in property values pushed returns up to 12.4 per cent after
three years of losses.
Returns increased steadily, rising from 0.3 per cent in the first quarter to
6.1 per cent in the final three months of the year.
In contrast, returns from both overseas bonds (16.4 per cent compared with
29.1 per cent last year) and cash/other investments (7.1 per cent compared
with 13.2 per cent) were both down.
New money flowing into the schemes amounted to only 1 per cent of total
assets - an amount equivalent to about Pounds 3.8bn. Some 82 per cent of
fund assets are invested in equities, with 25 per cent in overseas shares.
Money continues to be allocated to Europe and the Pacific at the expense of
North America and Japan.
Pension funds now have 4.8 per cent of total assets invested in east Asian
emerging markets, compared with 4.7 per cent in Japan.

FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet agrees terms over Absolut US
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, said it had agreed
terms over the early transfer of its US distribution rights for Absolut
vodka, the Swedish-owned premium brand, to Seagram, the North American
drinks group.
Vin &amp; Sprit, the Swedish wine and spirits company which makes Absolut,
shocked GrandMet's IDV drinks division in October by announcing the transfer
of the brand from September 1994. The reason for the switch appears to have
been growing doubts at V&amp;S about the future development of Absolut alongside
GrandMet's own Smirnoff and Popov brands.
IDV yesterday said it had agreed to bring forward to February 1 the transfer
of its distribution rights to Absolut in the US, Puerto Rico and the US
Virgin Islands. A confidential settlement between the three parties
compensated IDV for all the profits foregone between February and September.
Mr John McGrath, chairman and chief executive of IDV, said: 'We consider it
in everyone's best interest to agree the early transfer of the Absolut brand
in the US to Seagram.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / Investors upbeat on US retail takeover
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Federated Department Stores rose by more than 10 per cent
yesterday as Wall Street reacted favourably to its plan to take over
troubled rival RH Macy through an unusual bankruptcy court manoeuvre
involving the purchase of Macy's debt.
Federated, with revenues of Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) annually, operates
219 stores, including the up-market Bloomingdale's chain, and a takeover of
Macy's, best-known for its 111 stores of the same name, would create a
retailing colossus with annual sales of more than Dollars 13bn and
operations in most areas of the US.
Macy's has been operating under so-called Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection from its creditors since 1992 as it works on a plan of financial
reorganisation.
Federated, which itself emerged from bankruptcy protection last year,
announced on Sunday that it had acquired for Dollars 449.3m half of
Prudential Insurance Company of America's secured claim on Macy's. It has an
option to buy the remaining 50 per cent within three years.
The Prudential has been Macy's largest single creditor, and the deal
therefore gives Federated a significant say in the outcome of the company's
bankruptcy court reorganisation. Total claims against Macy's exceed Dollars
6bn.
Federated said it had acquired the claim 'with the ultimate objective of
working toward a combination of Federated and Macy's into a single,
nationwide, multi-billion dollar department store operation, with the
potential for greatly enhanced operating efficiencies'.
It is extremely unusual for a company to try to take over another by
acquiring its debt and pressing for a deal in bankruptcy court proceedings.
Mr Allen Questrom, chairman of Federated, said that 'none know better than
we that this will be a challenging process, with no guarantee that we will
be successful in accomplishing anything more than having made a sound
business investment'.
However, the debt deal also puts it in a strong position to block any bid
for Macy's from rival retail chains.
To succeed with a bid, Federated will need the support of Macy's other
leading creditors, such as the large fund management group Fidelity
Investments, as well as the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case.
Mr Myron Ullman, chairman of Macy's, said yesterday that it was still going
ahead with its own reorganisation plans and 'it would be inappropriate at
this juncture . . . to discuss with any particular creditor the role they
would play in our reorganisation'.
Shares in Federated closed at Dollars 23, up Dollars 2 1/4 , while Macy's
bonds also rose significantly.

FT  04 JAN 94 / French bank group in capital increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Commercial de France (CCF), the French banking group, is the latest
company to take advantage of the buoyant state of the Paris stock market by
unveiling plans for a FFr1.3bn to FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital increase.
Mr Charles de Croisset, who last year took over as CCF's chairman, said the
capital increase was intended to strengthen the balance sheet and finance
expansion.
CCF, best known in France as a retail bank, has been mooted as a potential
investor in Banque Hervet, the medium-sized investment bank the French
government has put up for sale. The group yesterday confirmed it was
interested in acquiring Banque Hervet.
The capital increase, the first by CCF since privatisation in May 1987, will
be divided between existing investors and a market placing. CCF said the
issue will increase its total equity by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent.
CCF is staging its issue at a critical time for the French banking industry
which hopes to begin its recovery this year after two difficult years in
which banks have come under intense pressure due to the economic recession
and depressed demand for credit.
However CCF has fared better than competitors and has emerged relatively
unscathed. It has already announced a 10.7 per cent increase in net interim
profits to FFr541m for the first half of 1993 against FFr489m in the same
period the previous year.
Mr de Croisset said CCF was on course for continued growth in the full
financial year of 1993 and in 1994. He anticipated a 'moderate increase' in
1993 profits from FFr978m despite a sharp increase in provisions.
He also forecast further profits growth for 1994 saying that CCF had began
the year 'in a healthy position'. Mr de Croisset said the group's
traditional banking business should show an improvement over 1993.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Revised All-Share classification takes effect
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's stock market trading will be the first to be reported under the
revised FT-SE Actuaries classification of industry sectors.
The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough
overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the
shape of today's market.
From tomorrow's edition, the new arrangement will also apply to the FT's
share price listings, the London Share Service. Several hundred of the 3,000
or so securities on the page will change categories, and a number of sectors
change their names.
A full alphabetical listing of stocks from these pages, together with the
new sectors in which they can be found is contained in a special two-page
guide to the new classification, inside this issue.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Rival bidders weigh up final moves
 -Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The four-month Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for Paramount
Communications, the film and publishing group, should reach a climax by
Friday, the last date for rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network to increase
their offers.
QVC, a cable television home shopping channel, has the edge. It is offering
Dollars 92 a share in cash for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock and a
mixture of securities for the remainder. Viacom, a cable television company,
is offering Dollars 85 a share in cash for 51 per cent, plus a blend of
securities.
However, Viacom is expected to announce a higher bid this week after
negotiations with two backers - Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment. They
are believed to want improvements in the terms of their investment, as well
as a greater say in the running of Viacom-Paramount.
The central question is how much control Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of
Viacom, is prepared to give up. The current takeover terms would leave him
with around 70 per cent of Viacom-Paramount's voting stock. He could boost
his bid by selling voting shares to partners.
Assuming Viacom bids again, QVC will have to decide whether to go still
higher. The stock market doubts it, since it has been depressing the share
price of whichever looks the victor. The winner, in other words, may be the
loser.

Tomorrow the troubled Frankfurt-based conglomerate will meet its bankers to
spell out the extent of the liquidity difficulties arising from the futures
trading activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary. With gross
debt for the group at DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn), there are rumours in Frankfurt
that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new hard-hitting chief executive, will ask for
a moratorium on debt repayment as a means of staving off insolvency. It may
not go so far but the fact that the meeting has been brought forward from
January 10 suggests that the problems are worse than originally expected.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Renault - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday the French state-owned car group will announce details of its
commercial performance for 1993. This will include the volume of the
company's sales, an analysis of its share of international markets and plans
for the launch of new products.
Like other European car manufacturers, Renault is expected to report a sharp
fall in sales. But the success of new models, such as the Twingo small car,
should see the French car group maintain its share of the European car
market at about 10.5 per cent.
Renault's ability to remain profitable despite the downturn in its markets
will facilitate its privatisation. The sale of the government's controlling
stake is due to take place in the second half of this year despite the
failure of the planned merger with Volvo.

Before the end of the week, Boots is expected to be the first of the big UK
retail groups to make a statement on how it fared in the all-important
Christmas trading period. Analysts expect sales at Boots the Chemists for
the quarter to the end of December - when it usually makes about half its
annual profit - to be about 7 per cent up on last year, helped by the recent

FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Investors find fresh hope after
digging deep - Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Trafalgar House have risen sharply since the troubled conglomerate
announced a Pounds 404m rights issue while posting a Pounds 347.2m annual
pre-tax loss. The huge deficit followed a review of the balance sheet which
led to write-downs and other charges totalling Pounds 467.7m.
However the share price gain since mid-December appears to reflect greater
shareholder confidence in the group, now firmly under the sway of Hongkong
Land Holdings, Trafalgar's 25.3 per cent stakeholder.
This new-found optimism will be tested again on Friday when shareholders
will be asked to approve the one-for-three convertible preference share
issue and placing described by Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar and
Hongkong Land, as providing a 'fresh start'.
Hongkong Land, which has invested about Pounds 200m in building up its
equity stake over the past year, has said it will take up its full rights
entitlement at a cost of about Pounds 90m, as well as applying for shares
under the placing. Its grip on Trafalgar's management will be further
strengthened by the appointment of Mr Nigel Rich as chief executive from
next August. Mr Rich is currently Hongkong Land's managing director and a
key member of the Jardine Matheson team.
Without Hongkong Land's support there is little doubt that Trafalgar would
have been subject to a painful debt rescheduling. Nevertheless shareholders
 -who have been asked to reach into their pockets on three occasions over
the past three years for a total of Pounds 964m - have little to look
forward to in the short term.
The Trafalgar board has already forecast a much reduced 1p (3.5p) dividend
this year and analysts believe it will be several years before the group is
able to achieve a barely-respectable 5 per cent pre-tax margin on its Pounds
4bn in annual turnover.

FT  04 JAN 94 / A new way of dealing with risk: Revised US capital rules for
insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are risk-based capital rules about to do to the US insurance industry what
they have done to the country's commercial banks?
From this year, US property and casualty insurers will have to set aside
minimum levels of capital, based on risks they run. This nationally applied
system replaces a patchwork of state-level regulation under which most
insurers had to meet only a simple solvency test.
Similar capital rules for commercial banks, developed internationally in the
late 1980s, forced banks to scale back their ambitions to conserve and build
their capital. This helped drive borrowers and depositors away from the
banks and towards the capital markets.
As with the banks, the new regulations are likely to have two effects. The
first is to reduce most property/casualty insurers' appetite for risk and
encourage them to raise premiums more quickly than would otherwise be the
case.
The second is that insurance business will begin to by-pass the insurance
companies' balance sheets altogether. Through off-balance sheet transactions
and the use of derivatives, insurers could find ways to shift part of their
risks to the capital markets.
The new risk-based capital rules have been developed by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, a grouping of state insurance
regulators. Made jittery by the collapse of the Executive Life and Mutual
Life companies in 1991, the commissioners decided to impose a more stringent
system for measuring an insurer's financial health.
Risk-based capital rules for life insurers, in force since the start of last
year, have intensified the pressure on life companies to strengthen their
balance sheets. As a result companies such as Equitable, in which Axa of
France owns 49 per cent, have been busy rebuilding their capital.
Also, the new rules have reduced the life companies' appetite for risk, says
Ms Shelly Harris, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's. This has given extra
impetus to the growth of variable life products, under which the investment
risk is born by the customer, in preference to whole life products, where
the insurer guarantees to pay a fixed amount.
A similar response can be expected from the property/casualty insurers. They
could also become more risk-averse, pushing up premiums and encouraging
buyers of insurance to find other ways to cover their risks.
'Certain liability lines are heavily penalised (under the risk-based capital
rules),' says Mr Steven Bolland of Gill and Roeser, a New York-based
insurance broker. 'Premiums in some of the businesses which require heavy
capital will need to get higher.'
The complex regulatory regime agreed by the NAIC last month requires
insurers to set capital aside against four types of risk.
Credit risk, for instance, is defined as the risk that a reinsurer will
default and not pay money due under a reinsurance policy. Insurance
companies have to provide capital equal to 10 per cent of amounts covered
under reinsurance arrangements - higher than the broad 8 per cent rule for
credit risks established by bank regulators. That builds an extra cost into
the insurance mechanism. In addition, insurance companies face capital
charges to cover underwriting risk (the risk that their reserves will prove
inadequate to meet future claims); investment risk (higher charges apply to
more risky investments, like junk bonds or commercial property); and even
growth risk (insurers which grow at more than 10 per cent a year are taking
bigger risks and should set aside more capital, says the NAIC).
Taken together, these rules are likely to constrain growth. Given that they
come at a low point in the traditionally cyclical insurance industry, when
many companies are already struggling to rebuild their capital, the rules
may well bite with extra force.
Last year, US property/casualty insurers raised Dollars 6.4bn (Pounds
4.32bn) of new capital between them. They also realised a record Dollars
10.4bn of capital gains. But with record catastrophe insurance losses and
premium income hardly rising, they ended the year with only a Dollars 5.1bn
addition to their combined capital base, a rise of just over 3 per cent.
With the exception of 1990, every other year since the mid-1980s has seen
double-digit growth.
To try to protect their balance sheets, insurers could turn to derivatives
as a way of shifting part of their risks to the capital markets.
A number of derivatives houses are circling on the fringes of the insurance
industry. At the forefront is said to be Bankers Trust, the commercial bank
which has done the most to foster the use of derivative financial
instruments, and Center Re Financial Products (CRFP), an offshoot of Zurich
Re. Mr Richard Sandor, head of CRFP, argues the capital markets will one day
provide a mechanism for transferring underwriting risks, just as they now
transfer interest-rate risk.
Given the revolution that has taken place in other areas of the capital
markets, this does not seem a far-flung claim. Twenty years ago, the only
way to participate in the mortgage industry was to buy shares in a company
that made home loans. Now, a Dollars 1,500bn mortgage-backed securities
market has opened up the mortgage industry to capital markets investors. A
multi-billion dollar interest-rate swap market has revolutionised
interest-rate risks.
Mr Sandor, former chief economist at the Chicago Board of Trade who was
instrumental in the launch of interest-rate futures 20 years ago, argues
that the capital-constrained insurance industry will eventually go through
the same process, with off balance-sheet vehicles and derivatives
transforming the way risks are transferred.
A trillion-dollar market in securitised car insurance policies may be some
way off. But with tighter capital rules on insurance companies, such a
development looks far more likely.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Yeltsin pledges tough foreign policy to please nationalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will adopt a more assertive foreign policy
following the serious setback for radical reformers in last month's
parliamentary elections, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said yesterday.
The president's priorities for 1994, set out by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov,
underline Mr Yeltsin's intention to try to accommodate the hardline
nationalists in the new parliament. The tough foreign policy line will be
combined with continuing market reforms.
Mr Kostikov told Itar-Tass news agency: 'Undisputed emphasis in foreign
policy will be given to protection of Russia's national interests and the
rights of Russians and Russian-speaking people . . . on the basis of
pan-national solidarity.'
The far right and nationalists have campaigned for the protection of ethnic
Russians living abroad. About 20m Russians live outside Russia in other
former Soviet republics. Some have been deprived of the vote and of the
right to sell their housing, or have felt threatened in their jobs.
Mr Kostikov added that the Russian leader, armed with sweeping new powers to
override parliament if necessary, was prepared to co-operate with deputies
'who are interested in the protection of Russia's interests and the
promotion of reforms'.
But he warned that such co-operation with the new parliament would depend on
its respect for the new constitution and its ability to 'draw lessons from
previous experience' - an unmistakable reference to the old parliament,
shelled out of existence on October 4 after a protracted power struggle with
Mr Yeltsin.
On economic policy, Mr Kostikov said: 'Securing financial stabilisation,
lowering inflation, strengthening the rouble and support for healthy
production forces will be among the priorities of economic policy next
year.'
But Mr Sergei Vasiliev, a radical economist who heads the government centre
for monitoring economic reform, was cautious yesterday on prospects for
further progress.
He said that the electoral success of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
neo-fascist, would frighten away investors, including Russian ones, and
promote further capital flight.
'In the next two years no large-scale foreign investment will come to
Russia,' he told the Russian Information Agency, referring to the
uncertainty that is likely to prevail until new parliamentary and
presidential elections are held as planned in 1996.
Russian reform prospects should become clearer with the appointment of a
revamped cabinet, which is expected before the new parliament gathers next
Tuesday.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Japan to shelve Boeing airliner venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is to suspend an 11-year-old joint airliner development project with
Boeing, the US aerospace group - a setback to Japanese efforts to create a
world-class aerospace industry.
The spur is Boeing's decision, late last year, to modernise its best-selling
737 short-to-medium-range airliner before developing the new aircraft
jointly with Japan - known as the YXX. The move is a reflection of the
pressure on costs imposed by the weakness of demand from airlines.
Tokyo has decided to shelve work on the 150-seat YXX and to reduce spending
this year to the minimum needed to tie up the project, according to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
The YXX, as originally planned, would be so close to the upgraded 737, known
as the 737-X, that the joint project would no longer work in its present
form, Miti officials said. However, Boeing has not formally cancelled the
YXX.
The discord over the YXX is reminiscent of the squabbles between Japan and
the US over the development of a joint air fighter, the FSX, in the 1980s.
Japan's trade partners, particularly the US, are ambiguous over its attempts
to create a competitive aerospace industry. It is one of the few
manufacturing sectors where the US can achieve a trade surplus.
Both the YXX and the FSX were overshadowed by US fears that Japan was
acquiring technology too cheaply.
Boeing and Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, a consortium of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy
Industries, signed a memorandum of understanding for a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds
1.14bn) development plan for the YXX in 1984.
Of that, the Japanese side was to pay 25 per cent, with the rest covered by
Boeing and other partners.
Instead, the Japanese aerospace consortium is now seeking to supply
components for the 737-X, on which it might be offered contracts for wing
parts.
It is also pursuing a separate Y80bn (Pounds 479.04m) plan for a smaller
passenger aircraft, with international partners. That project, known as the
YSX, is for a 70-to-80-seat short-range aircraft, to be in service by the
end of the decade.
The consortium started a feasibility study with Miti in 1989 and has
approached several potential partners, including Boeing, Saab-Scania of
Sweden, Aviation de Transport Regional, a Franco-Italian joint venture, and
Aviation Industries of China. But no final decision has been made, a Miti
official said.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Two banks at odds over value of Banesto assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US bank that advised Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto)
before the Bank of Spain ousted its management last week, thought that
Banesto was in a better financial condition than the Spanish government has
claimed, according to an unpublished official document.
The document, prepared by the central bank to justify its sudden
intervention, shows that JP Morgan believed that Banesto's assets had been
overvalued by at most Pta372bn (Pounds 1.76bn). That is Pta131bn less than
the Bank's estimate of a Pta503bn overvaluation, disclosed last week.
The Bank last Tuesday im-posed a new management at Banesto, Spain's
fourth-largest bank with assets of Pta7,000bn. The intervention is not
thought to have been expected by Morgan, even though it had been sharing
information with the Bank.
Morgan executives are believed to accept that the Bank's action was
justified when Banesto's share price fell sharply and a run on deposits
began. However, they had thought until then that Banesto could absorb a
gradual Pta372bn downward revaluation of its assets if it raised extra
capital to compensate.
Morgan, which had invested Dollars 175m (Pounds 118.20m) of its and other
investors' capital in Banesto through its Corsair investment fund, wrote to
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, hours before the
intervention to express confidence in Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's president.
The overvaluation of assets was discovered by Bank of Spain inspectors in an
audit that continued until September. Morgan thought Banesto could raise
capital to cope through measures in-cluding a bond issue and the sale of
half its controlling stake in Banco Totta y Acores of Portugal.
The document shows that the Bank believed that Banesto's loans were
overvalued by Pta 223bn after rapid growth in loans 1988 and 1991. It also
estimated that there was a Pta 66bn pension fund shortfall, and a Pta81bn
overvaluation of La Corporacion, its industrial holding company.
The other overvaluations listed by the Bank of Spain in the document were
Pta72bn relating to an equity portfolio, Pta25bn for Banesto's 50 per cent
holding in Oasis International Group, listed in Banesto's accounts as a
hotel company, and Pta36bn overvaluation of capitalised costs.
Banesto and JP Morgan gave lower estimates for each category. They were:
Pta166bn for loans, Pta52bn for La Corporacion, Pta 55bn for the pension
fund shortfall, Pta61bn for the equity portfolio, Pta23bn for capitalised
costs and Pta15bn for Oasis International Group.
The Bank of Spain said in the document it might have overestimated the
overvaluation of Banesto's assets by Pta48bn. It said said Banesto's
management 'has not given sufficient documentation to justify' a downward
adjustment to the Pta503bn assessment of the overvaluation.
In its letter to Mr Rojo, Morgan said it believed that Banesto's 'prospects
for future profitability are strong'. It said it 'fully supported' a capital
restructuring plan it drew up with Banesto, including a Dollars 400m
convertible bond issue due in the second quarter of this year.
The letter was written by Mr Roberto Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman, who
represented Corsair on the Banesto board.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: International flows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As for international flows, much depends on the behaviour of US markets. A
striking aspect of last autumn's peak in the US bond market was that
equities continued to gain. This could be natural for this stage of the
cycle. If the bond market is rattled by the pace of the recovery, that
should be positive news for corporate earnings and therefore equities. If
the UK follows this pattern, equities should start outperforming gilts again
once a firm economic recovery brings a halt to base rate declines.
Yet the UK is much more dependent on international flows than the US, and
the risk remains that a market upset there will cause US investors to
retrench across the board. They, too, have been seeking to escape low
returns on cash, but even cash becomes attractive when other markets are
falling. With luck, the Federal Reserve will tighten just enough to preserve
the recovery while protecting the bond market from long-term inflation
worries. Such a soft landing would allow other markets to continue upwards.
But it requires delicate judgment as regards the timing and amount of any
interest rate rise. One false move and the reverberations would be felt
across the world. Then even the UK's relatively good economic prospects
would not protect its equity market from sharp correction.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The nagging worry, though, is that such arguments are simply a justification
of a rise driven primarily by liquidity. Such a conclusion seems indicated
by the propensity of share prices to crumble when any leading company
announces disappointing profits. That was the fate of GEC and Hanson a month
ago. Beguiling as the re-rating argument is, there is also some underlying
nervousness.
Companies must produce some fancy earnings figures to justify present
multiples, especially in sectors such as building materials where economic
recovery has been most strongly discounted. Dividend growth is also unlikely
to keep pace with earnings, given the level to which cover sank during the
recession.
That may explain the appeal of utilities which can offer relatively
attractive yields and the prospect of some dividend growth. Banks have also
benefited because dividend cover is likely to grow particularly fast as
provisions come down after the recession. But the selectivity of investors
again suggests their primary aim is yield enhancement, against the
background of lingering scepticism about earnings.
Such worries will come to the fore if the economic recovery does falter as
taxes go up in the spring. Even then, though, the equity market could be
saved by further cuts in interest rates. Relative to cash the attraction of
equities would improve again, provoking further liquidation of retail bank
and building society deposits.
It is the switching of this money into equities and gilts coupled with large
inflows of foreign capital which sustained the market in 1993. The resulting
liquidity has not only enabled the government to fund its deficit at lower
and lower interest rates. It has also seen the equity market absorb more
than Pounds 11bn in rights issues and Pounds 5bn in new issues.
The central question for 1994 is to decide how long liquidity is likely to
stay abundant. On the domestic front the flow of retail cash may slow
somewhat, simply because the largest part of the fall in base rates has
already taken place. A combination of previous over-funding and tighter
fiscal policy will also substantially reduce the supply of gilts. The end to
pension holidays may create additional investment flows but these will be at
least partly offset by a fall in income available for reinvestment as
institutions are receiving smaller tax credits on their dividend income.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Price multiples
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull case for equities rests heavily on the assumption that a historic
market p/e of around 22, somewhat higher than that which preceded the 1987
crash, is perfectly acceptable when inflation is low. Since that reduces
investors' requirements for return, and since the quality of earnings should
improve as inflation comes down, shares should naturally trade on a higher
multiple.
This argument is lent additional weight by the way in which historic
earnings have been depressed by restructuring charges which nowadays have to
be carried above the line. Strip these out and the market multiple does not
look so high. Nor, given expectations of earnings growth of between 15 and
20 per cent this year, does it look particularly stretched on a prospective
basis.
On some other measurements too, equities look attractive. Thanks to the fall
in interest rates, the yield on cash is only 1.5 times that on shares,
whereas it was as high as 3.5 times at the start of the decade. At just
under two times, the gilt/equity yield ratio is on the low side by recent
historic standards. That suggests equities could not rise much further
without a corresponding fall in gilt yields, but the relationship may also
have undergone a structural change as inflation has been wrung out of the
system.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Shared interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year will go down in UK stock market history as one in which all but
the most optimistic expectations were exceeded. The starting point was not
auspicious. Worries about inflation after sterling's humiliating exit from
the ERM were compounded by fears that the economic recovery would falter.
Above all there was widespread scepticism about the government's ability to
finance its surging deficit.
Having been so badly wrong-footed - most expectations a year ago, including
those of this column, were that the FT-SE 100 would end 1993 closer to 3,000
than to 3,400 - forecasters are naturally reluctant to pour cold water
again. Nor are they short of positive arguments. Inflation has fallen to the
lowest point in a generation; interest rates are still moving downwards; the
recovery is reasonably well established; and two budgets have restored some
semblance of order to government finances.
Yet the market must overcome a number of obstacles to justify its present
level, let alone to achieve further price increases. Will enthusiasm for
equities wither in the face of any further US bond market or Federal Reserve
tightening as the recovery gathers pace? How will the UK economy react to
the tax increases that start to bite in April?

FT  04 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein 'desperate to avoid choice on peace': Major adds
to pressure on republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government last night accused Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, of being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the
UK-Irish joint declaration on peace in Northern Ireland.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, sought to increase pressure on
republicans by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly
desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts
them'.
Mr Major's comments overshadowed concern on both sides of the Irish border
about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for
'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland.
Officials in London and Dublin played down Mr Reynolds' remarks, which drew
an angry response from unionists and a cautious welcome from Sinn Fein.
Downing Street said there was no disagreement with the Irish government.
Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr
Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded
talks which began in 1992.
Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional
parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994.
Sinn Fe'in is excluded from the three-stranded process, but Mr Major
confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a
cessation of IRA violence.
In a passage aimed at the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line
Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint
declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'.
Unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the
time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern
conflict'. Mr Reynolds also said both governments should be 'persuaders for
a new agreement on the future of the whole island'.
Mr Reynolds' remarks were welcomed by Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading member
of Sinn Fein, which in the past has used similar language.
But hard-line unionists insist that the British government should defend the
status quo rather than seek to persuade them of the need for change. Mr
Paisley said Mr Reynolds' words made clear that the joint declaration was
'marked with the bloody thumbprints of the IRA'.
The Rev Martin Smyth, a senior spokesman for the moderate Ulster Unionist
party, said Mr Reynolds' choice of words was 'highly insensitive'. However,
he indicated that the UUP was comfortable with the prospect of British troop
withdrawals relatively soon after a permanent halt to IRA violence.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Diversify and die
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These are hard times for conglomerates. The leading UK examples of the form
all underperformed the stock market last year, while Imperial Chemical
Industries broke itself up on the grounds that it had become too like a
conglomerate to be manageable. Italy's giant state holding company, IRI,
said one reason for being privatised was that the conglomerate principle was
outdated.
The argument falls under two main headings. First, as ICI observed,
technology is becoming ever more sophisticated and fast-moving. As a result,
it becomes increasingly hard to make informed choices on investment across
different industries.
This may be why many companies which might once have qualified as
conglomerates have in recent years chosen to narrow their focus. In the UK,
even the remaining true conglomerates like Hanson and BTR have stuck to
relatively low-tech industries. The last old-style conglomerate bid battle
in the UK, between Hanson and Tomkins, was for a manufacturer of sliced
bread.
The second part of the argument might be termed evolutionary. In the
developed world, conglomerates are out of fashion. In developing countries,
the reverse is the case. In many Asian countries, large chunks of the local
economies are controlled by private conglomerates. In a transitional economy
like South Korea, the landscape is still dominated by vast and sprawling
groups such as Samsung and Hyundai.
At the same time, such companies are increasingly criticised in Korea as
having outlived their usefulness. In short, runs the argument, conglomerates
work best at a certain stage of economic development. When growth rates are
high and management talents scarce, it makes sense for those who have the
skills to spread themselves widely. The more mature and sophisticated the
economy becomes, the greater the need for specialisation.
So far, so good. Yet 1993 was also the year when the title of America's
largest company by market value was decisively claimed by a conglomerate,
General Electric. On the face of it, this is all wrong. America is the
world's most advanced economy and it is stuffed with large, specialised
companies.
GE is no low-tech company. To be sure, it is exceptionally well-run, and its
chairman, Mr Jack Welch, is perhaps the most admired manager in America. But
the exception need not prove the rule; and it is striking that GE defends
its conglomerate status in terms which in other quarters became
unfashionable a decade ago. Conglomerates have a breadth of experience and
talent: and above all, they operate in different business cycles, so that
one business can balance out another.
As the past year has shown, specialisation is not without its risks. The
pharmaceutical industry, hitherto a model of high-tech focus, has scrambled
to diversify in the face of the administration's attack on healthcare costs.
In the UK, specialist food retailers such as Sainsbury and Tesco have seen
their share prices weaken in the face of low-cost competition.
The old-style conglomerate is probably on its way out. But managers should
not come to believe uncritically that a focused business is necessarily a
safe one. As Mark Twain observed, having all your eggs in one basket may be
no bad thing: but you had better watch that basket.

By some standards the Asian emerging markets were standing still last year.
Birinyi Associates in New York points out that shares in Poland rose by
1,095 per cent in 1993. The Polish index passed the 13,000 mark yesterday
for the first time.
There are only 21 quoted companies, and dealing is, um, frothy. 'Trading in
Irena SA glassmaker was suspended as demand soared on last week's report
that the company got a substantial tax refund,' said Reuter.
New definition of an emerging market: one that moves on the news that the

Who is going to win control of Everton, the luckless Liverpool football club
controlled by the family of the late Sir John Moores, the pools millionaire
and founder of Littlewoods?
Will it be Everton's home side led by Bill Kenwright - whose courageous
production of Blood Brothers has defied the New York critics and is packing
them in on Broadway? Or will it be the self-made millionaire Peter Johnson,
who has rejuvenated neighbouring Tranmere Rovers?
All eyes are on Lady Grantchester, Sir John's daughter, who chairs the
family's interviewing panel. Her detailed knowledge of the game's finances
has surprised contenders. So surely she will not let her family's loyalty to
Everton be affected by the fact that Johnson has had a season ticket for
Liverpool, Everton's arch rivals, for the last 25 years.

Carlo de Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, has been banging on for ages
about the company's move out of manufacturing into more profitable
computer-related services.
But Olivetti's latest deal, worth about L26bn - helping re-educate officers
of the Russian armed forces for civvy street - seems a radical move even for
him.
Olivetti won the contract from the European Commission. Along with German
and French partners it will provide management training to about 16,000 of
the 200,000-odd Russian officers deemed to be surplus to requirements since
the Berlin Wall came down. Some of the demobbed will even be shipped to
Europe for six months, to see western business at first hand.
De Benedetti's business savvy is justly renowned. Competitors are thus
asking themselves whether Olivetti's latest venture reflects hopes of
acquiring potential new staff, or is just a useful bit of advance networking
for future Russian sales.

The Mini car, the late Sir Alex Issigonis's 'flying shoebox', is entering
its 35th year of production with its largest market no longer Britain but
Japan, where it has achieved a cult status. There are even Japanese
magazines devoted to it.
To help the enthusiasm along, Rover Japan, the Japanese publishing house
NEKO and several other Japanese business concerns are entering one of the
tiny machines - a 100 horsepower Cooper version - in January's Monte Carlo
rally.
Not even Rover seriously suggests that the Japanese Mini - or three others
being entered from the UK - will mount a credible challenge to the 300
horsepower monsters of the modern rallying world.
The winner is far more likely to be a Toyota.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Contenders in the main events: FT writers identify the faces
to watch in '94, as Europe's political leaders face bruising election
battles

A nomination as a front runner for high political office can become a
poisoned chalice; it alerts opponents and can cause expectations to become
inflated. But if 1993 was the year in which faith in European political
leaders slumped, this year offers a plethora of chances for unseating
incumbents across the continent.
There are important elections in Germany, Italy, eastern Europe and the
Nordic countries, and the run-up to the 1995 French presidential election
begins in earnest. Where there are no elections, the ebb and flow of public
opinion offer the chance for new faces to emerge; upsets of the established
order are probable.
Germany, for instance, could have a new chancellor if Helmut Kohl cannot
turn around his Christian Democratic Union's waning fortunes by the general
elections in ctober. The man most likely to succeed is the cautious, sober,
neatly bearded Rudolf Scharping of the Social Democratic party.
First, however, Scharping has to prove to his party, and the electorate,
that it is an organisation 'fit for government'. Eleven years in opposition
have given the SPD the image of a collection of squabbling preachers and
academics, more inclined to philosophical disputes than questions of power
politics.
Since he became party leader last June, 46-year-old Scharping has moved
swiftly to build the necessary pragmatic platform from which to launch his
bid for power.
Whether or not Scharping succeeds, the other German politician likely to cut
a new dash this year is Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound
parliamentary leader of the CDU, and the crown prince in the ruling party.
The only question is whether he has the physical strength to take on the top
job, since he was partially paralysed in an assassination attempt in 1990.
Schauble is the consummate politician: quick-thinking, articulate, ruthless
in debate and in negotiation, and yet charming. Sometimes he seems like the
fast-talking second in the boxing ring, whispering tactics into the ear of
his lumbering heavyweight champion, Kohl.
In France, the same old cast of politicians threatens to dominate television
screens and newspapers. Fighting to carry the conservative colours into the
presidential election will be Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and leader of
the RPR Gaullists, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and ex-President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing. On the left, Michel Rocard has no real rival to carry the
standard of his depleted Socialist party into the presidential election,
with one exception - Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
But younger French politicians will be jockeying to establish themselves as
possible prime ministers in 1995 and/or contenders for the presidency in
2002. One to watch is Alain Juppe, the 48-year-old foreign minister who is
also the RPR's secretary-general. He played a crucial part in France's
international and domestic negotiations on Gatt. Long close to Chirac, he is
now indispensable to Balladur.
Gerard Longuet, the vigorous, 47-year-old trade and industry minister, leads
the Republican party, the UDF's largest single component, and might make a
suitable coalition prime minister under a President Balladur. Also striving
to make his mark will be Nicolas Sarkozy, the 38-year-old budget minister
and government spokesman. Extremely close to Balladur, he has become the
prime minister's medium for controlling economic policy and his principal
spin-doctor.
It is the left that looks likely to make the running in Italy. Achille
Occhetto, leader of the party of the Democratic Left (PDS), starts the year
well ahead of the political field. With early general elections almost
certain in March, the mustachioed former communist turned social democrat is
set to head a broad 'progressive' coalition. The PDS has inherited the
formidable organisation of the old Italian Communist party (PCI) and has
formed a series of highly effective alliances at local level. If this can be
repeated at national level, Occhetto stands a good chance of being the next
prime minister, if not a leading element in the next government.
Other Italian politicians have been slow to realise the need under new
electoral laws to mould alliances among the fragmented parties. But media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi sees himself as a catalyst for a coalition built
from Italy's dismembered centre and on the right. In November Berlusconi
voiced his ambition to forge a coalition to block the PDS's rise to power.
He must now decide whether he continues to shout from the sidelines or
crosses the Rubicon from business to politics by forming his own party.
Elections to the European Parliament in June are likely to bring a fillip
for prominent leftwingers. Elisabeth Guigou, the former French minister for
European affairs, is relaunching her political career with a bid to enter
the parliament under the socialist flag. She seems assured of a seat, and
could be one of several women taking their place on the Strasbourg/Brussels
benches, including Glenys Kinnock, wife of the former British Labour party
leader.
At the European Commission, Jacques Delors is expected to serve out his term
as president until December. But Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner
responsible for competition policy and state aid, is forecast to raise his
profile. Popular inside the Commission, he has taken a less rumbustious
attitude to his job than his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan. But he is
quietly proficient and handled the steel crisis last year with aplomb, even
if the final solution was less tough than he would have liked.
In contrast, the tendency of Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister,
to shoot from the lip has landed him in trouble. He called Germany 'a
bestial giant with a child's brain' because of its desire to open diplomatic
ties with Macedonia, while the British press had 'an almost racist tendency'
to portray Greeks as mindless hedonists.
In central Europe, three young, ambitious politicians, two of them with a
communist past, will be aiming for the political big-time.
Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old leader of Poland's Democratic Left
Alliance (SLD), came a long way in 1993, when his coalition of 21 leftwing
political groups became the largest political party in the new parliament
after September's elections. This year Kwasniewski is expected to lock horns
with President Lech Walesa, challenging the latter's control over the three
vital ministries of the interior, foreign affairs and defence, and
positioning himself for the big prize - the presidency of Poland - which is
up for grabs in 1995.
In Slovakia, Mr Petr Weiss, the Slovak equivalent of Mr Kwasniewski, is
preparing for a similar challenge to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the introverted,
unpredictable prime minister who led Slovakia to independence but gives the
impression of having little idea of how to create a modern, democratic state
in a region fraught with ethnic rivalries.
But it is in Hungary, where voters go to the polls in May, that the
challenge to the region's communist past is greatest. Viktor Orban, one of
the most impressive of the younger generation of politicians, dreams of
lifting Hungary free from its communist history by bringing in a new
generation of political leaders. Prime Minister Peter Boross - who replaced
Jozsef Antall, the veteran Democratic Forum leader who died before Christmas
 -is 65; Orban, the leader of Fidesz, the youth party, is not yet 30.
At the opposite end of the age scale, the man who took over as Swedish prime
minister when Olof Palme was assassinated by a still-unknown gunman in 1986
could be back in office by the end of 1994. Ingvar Carlsson, 59, leader of
Sweden's venerable Social Democrats, survived the party's worst election
defeat in more than 60 years in 1991 and will spearhead its attempt to
unseat Prime Minister Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition in a general
election due in September.
Mr Carlsson insists the ideological pendulum is swinging the Social
Democratic way again after three tough years of recession.
In neighbouring Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, a bluff United Nations diplomat
whose main attraction is his lack of political baggage, should be the
country's president by the end of February. Although he has slipped in the
opinion polls, Mr Ahtisaari, who led the UN operation that brought
independence to Namibia, is still favourite to win the presidential
election. The first round is on January 16.
As an enthusiastic advocate of Finland's application to join the EU, Mr
Ahtisaari is set to play a prominent role in persuading the country to back
membership in a referendum expected before the end of the year. The task
should be made easier by the rise of the far right in neighbouring Russia,
which has made the EU's embrace seem much warmer than before.

<TEXT>
1993 was hardly the year of the politician, and nowhere was the lack of
inspirational leadership more apparent than at Westminster. But amid the
pedestrian greyness of the cabinet and its Labour shadow, some staked a
claim to a brighter future.
The cabinet's stars, of course, are the Treasury's dynamic duo Kenneth
Clarke and Michael Portillo. Clarke, 53, is now firmly established as heir
apparent and Portillo, 40, as the next prime minister but one.
Sorting out the rest of the runners in the next government reshuffle is more
challenging. Stephen Dorrell, 41, a reformed wet and another member of the
Treasury team, seems promotable. But there is little to choose between David
Curry, 49, at environment, Jonathan Aitken, 51, at defence, Brian Mawhinney,
53, at health, David Heathcot-Amory, 44, at the foreign office, and David
Davis, 45, in William Waldegrave's department.
For Labour, Tony Blair, 40, the party's leading moderniser, and Robin Cook,
47, from the more traditional soft left, would lead the pack in any contest
to succeed John Smith, 55. George Robertson, 47, the hero of the Maastricht
debate, is less in the limelight now that he is shadow Scottish secretary,
but a bravura performance by John Prescott, 55, at his party's conference
confirmed him as a man of influence at the top.
Men to watch one rung down are: Alistair Darling, 40, in the Treasury team,
Brian Wilson, 45, Labour's rail privatisation expert, Geoffrey Hoon, 40,
Robertson's sharp-witted ally in the Maastricht manoeuvrings, and Mike
O'Brien, 39, an even younger version of the youthful Blair. But after that
the field thins out.
Unlike the Tory party, Labour's real stars remain an increasingly elderly
bunch of backbench oldies. Peter Shore, 69, Tony Benn, 68, and, of course,
Denis Skinner, 61, last year put many of their colleagues to shame.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A resumption of history
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation gather for their
summit in Brussels next Monday, they will have to work hard to make up for
lost time. Four years have passed since the end of the cold war division of
Europe. In that time, an important part of the former Soviet bloc has made
giant strides towards democracy and market reform, while another part has
slid towards fragmentation, political demagoguery and civil strife.
Yet the western alliance has thus far seemed curiously unequal to the
challenges and opportunities thrown up by the rapidly changing map of
Europe. The Brussels meeting offers an opportunity to begin the task of
renewing Nato's sense of purpose.
The leaders need to map out a strategy both to consolidate the advances of
the last four years and to guard against possible dangers in the future. If
they fail, they will be condemning eastern Europe to a security vacuum that
could easily invite a resumption of old European power games.
The spectre at the summit is Russia, and in particular the strong showing in
its recent parliamentary elections by the neo-fascist party of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky. Is President Boris Yeltsin now strong enough to pursue economic
reforms that will offer tangible benefits by the next presidential election?
Or will he continue to mark time, and thus condemn himself to fail?
The countries of central Europe - most clamorously Poland, the Czech and
Slovak republics and Hungary - are too anxious to wait for the answer.
Fearful of a reawakened Russian imperial urge, they want Nato to give them
immediate membership and extend to them its security guarantee.
So far, Nato has prevaricated, offering all the countries of the former
Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact uniform and much looser association accords -
first in the so-called North Atlantic Co-operation Council, now in a not
dissimilar arrangement which President Bill Clinton has christened
'Partnership for Peace'.
Buy time
The prevarication is understandable. It is based in part on Mr Clinton's no
doubt correct calculation that Congress would baulk at any precipitate move
to extend the US defence umbrella to the east. It seeks to buy time while
Nato and its would-be new entrants think hard about the scope of the
alliance, and while events in Russia take their course. And it is an attempt
to duck the awkward questions - how far east? what about the Baltics? what
about Ukraine? - that the task of selecting new Nato members would throw up.
None of these matters can be taken lightly. Nato could do nothing worse than
extend its security guarantee without the ability to implement it if
necessary. Nor is membership a panacea for central Europe, whose short to
medium-term fortunes depend more on being able to trade freely with the west
than on sheltering under Nato's nuclear umbrella.
But prevarication is still not enough. What is needed is a more hard-headed
assessment of the prospects for success in Russia and the broader
consequences of failure. What is needed, too, is a more differentiated
approach to Nato's eastern supplicants: one that offers countries that fit
the bill a real prospect of joining when the time is right.
Great opportunity
Without such an approach, Nato will be a contradiction in terms: in effect
telling the east Europeans they have little to fear from Russia, while
insisting on its own continued need for collective protection against a
Russian threat. It will also be missing the greatest opportunity since the
second world war to consolidate and enlarge the realm of freedom in Europe.
Certainly, a reforming Russia is still the main prize. If Mr Yeltsin allows
a market economy and democracy to take root, then European security will be
assured, and in the long term Nato will not need to exist. And it remains
possible that he will succeed. Mr Zhirinovsky's forces are still outnumbered
by pro-reform parties. So the west should focus its efforts on convincing Mr
Yeltsin that continued reform is his only hope, and on helping to shore up
other forces that sup-port it.
This has a bearing on current Nato policy. For it is clear that an immediate
offer of membership for the central European countries would be seen in
Russia as a devastating rebuff for those who favour closer ties with the
west, and a commensurate boost for the xenophobes. It would be unfortunate
if in extending its guarantee against a possible Russian threat, Nato helped
create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
A sensible approach for Nato would lie somewhere between the woolly
'Partnerships for Peace' proposal and immediate central European membership.
It would involve a reaffirmation of Nato's desire to intensify military
co-operation with Russia; a clear statement of the criteria for membership
(fully democratic political system, market economy, wide support for both
among the populace); and confirmation that the alliance will at some point
in the future be open to new members in central and eastern Europe. Finally,
it would entail a solemn proclamation that Nato will make contingency plans
to admit those applicants that meet the criteria immediately in the event
that the nightmare of an expansionist Russia were to return. That way, the
alliance would be working for the best, while simultaneously preparing for
the worst.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Dolls make their way to the market: Reforms at east German
toy factories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until unification, there were few children in east Germany who did not want
a toy made in Sonneberg. The small town, tucked away in southern Thuringia
close to the borders of Bavaria and the Czech Republic, was renowned for its
craftsmanship and its century-old tradition of making soft dolls and
hand-carved wooden toys.
But German children only got one in 10 of the toys - 90 per cent of
Sonneberg's output was exported to the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and
European Union countries. Ms Connie Rudat, a 33-year-old office manager with
a nine-year-old son, says when she was a child, she always asked for a
Sonneberg doll, or a 'Sonni Puppe' as they were known, for her birthday.
'They had lovely clothes. At the same time, the dolls were simple and
old-fashioned,' she says.
Until 1990, the clothes of the hand-painted dolls were made by women working
at home, on contract. 'Before the Wall came down, almost the entire 30,000
population of Sonneberg was connected with the toy industry,' says Ms
Gundrin Hentschel, 40, responsible for production at the Sonni Puppen und
Spieltiere factory, the town's largest manufacturer of soft toys and
traditional dolls.
In those days of a divided Germany, factory managers had little need to
think about costs or marketing. The toy industry was state-controlled.
Subsidies were plentiful, orders from the east abundant. But like other
industries in east Germany, Sonni Puppen could not escape the impact of
unification and the collapse of its main buyers, the Soviet Union and
eastern Europe. Thuringia's dolls were confronted by the market.
In late 1990, east Germany's toy industry was placed under the Treuhand
privatisation agency, which spent more than two years working on a
restructuring strategy for Sonni Puppen and two other factories at
Sonneberg. Mr Siegfried Sorgel, employed by the agency for the task,
originally planned to amalgamate the factories and privatise them en bloc.
There were few takers.
'The toy industry is a tough business. It was impossible to find a buyer for
the whole lot,' he says. The Treuhand finally abandoned its plan and sold
the factories separately - but not before it had cut the combined workforce
of the three from 5,000 to 233 employees, and accumulated losses and
provided subsidies totalling DM30m (Pounds 11.7m).
Sonni Puppen's own payroll has been reduced from 1,800 to 65, and its
output, which before 1989 totalled 10,000 dolls and 5,000 soft toys a day,
has been cut to 30,000 items a month. Mr Peter Bieber, who with two partners
from Nurnberg last month bought Sonni Puppen from the Treuhand, is
determined to make the factory a success. 'My priority is to keep costs
down,' he says. To do this, some of the dolls' clothes are being made across
the border in the Czech Republic. 'Labour costs are DM4.50 an hour in the
Czech Republic compared with DM30 at the factory,' says Mr Bieber. 'I reckon
I am cutting costs by about 20 per cent.'
Ms Hentschel says: 'If it means we can become competitive, not only in
western Germany, but in other European countries by using cheaper labour in
the Czech Republic, then so be it.'
She knows that the toy market is cut-throat. The turnover of west Germany's
toy industry was DM2.1bn last year, while the east German figure was a mere
DM122m. Combined east and west German exports totalled DM3.2bn, a slight
fall over 1991. However, imports increased by 3.6 per cent to DM3.2bn as
south-east Asian penetration of the market gained pace.
Ms Corinna Printzen, an official at Germany's Association for Toys,
representing the industry, admits manufacturers are under pressure,
particularly from electronic and video games being exported by Hong Kong,
China and Taiwan. She reckons that German toy exports declined by 15 per
cent in the first nine months of 1993. However, 'there is a gradual but
nevertheless noticeable shift away from electronic toys to the more
traditional, creative models', she says.
Back in Sonneberg, the workers have accepted the demands of a market economy
stoically. 'I suppose all the changes will have been worth it if Sonni
Puppen can succeed as a privatised company under our new owner,' says Ms
Hentschel. With luck, a doll from Sonneberg, which Connie Rudat yearned for
as a child, might still make a gift for her grandchildren.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Forecast '94: A rich harvest - The UK economy will continue
to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM CONGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy is like the little girl in the nursery rhyme. When conditions
are bad, they are horrid; and when they are good, they are very good.
The historical record shows that low inflation and interest rates coincide
with rapid growth of output and employment; and high inflation and interest
rates are associated with slow growth or even falls in output and
employment. Good figures for 'real' and 'financial' variables tend to be
bunched at the same time - as, too, do poor figures for both types of
variable.
The latest boom-bust cycle has illustrated the pattern to perfection. In
1987 and 1988 non-oil output grew by more than 4 per cent a year, while the
annual rate of retail inflation remained at about 5 per cent until mid-1988.
By contrast, in 1990 output went up by  1/2 per cent and in 1991 it fell by
more than 2 per cent, but inflation was more than 7 per cent and in late
1990 it peaked at more than 10 per cent.
At first glance, this is rather strange. Common sense tells us that
inflation ought to be worst when demand is strong, not when the economy is
growing at an above-average rate, while inflation ought to be low when
demand is depressed. The real variables ought to be good when the financial
variables are bad, and vice versa.
Does not the actual experience of the economy - that real and financial
variables are good and bad together - seem anomalous? Don't the facts
contradict common sense? Isn't there a puzzle here?
Actually there is no puzzle. The economy's behaviour is fully consistent -
with both common sense and economic theory. The vital distinction is between
levels and rates of change, and the key to understanding is to recognise
that the direction of inflation depends not on the rate of change of output
(relative to trend) but on the level of output (also, relative to trend).
Consider the economic situation in late 1989. Output had grown continuously
since mid-1981 and, for three years - 1986, 1987 and 1988  - it had grown
above the long-run sustainable rate. As a result, the level of output was
higher than the trend figure, perhaps by as much 4 per cent.
The economy was over-stretched. Companies found it difficult to find workers
with the right skills at the right price, machinery was being fully utilised
and commercial property was in short supply. So pay and price rises were
accelerating, and rents soared by 30-40 per cent a year.
The government's agenda was plainly to curb demand and to bring the level of
output back towards its trend. But one year of slow growth was not
sufficient. Although the  1/2 per cent output growth in 1990 was 2 per cent
beneath the trend rate of change, it still left the level of output 2 per
cent above trend in late 1990.
Inflation was therefore still rising at that time. Only with the sharp drop
in output in 1991 was enough spare capacity created in the economy for
inflation to start falling. The year from mid-1990 to mid-1991 saw the
combination of the highest inflation in a decade, a slump in output and a
steep climb in unemployment. The economic situation was horrid.
What does this analysis imply for 1994 and, by extension, for the mid-1990s?
The answer is that 1994 and the mid-1990s should be a complete contrast to
the miseries of the recession from which we are now emerging. They could be
the best years for the British economy since the 1960s.
The rationale for forecasting a benign phase of the cycle is similar to our
description of the last recession, except that the argument runs in reverse.
Whereas in late 1989 the level of output in the economy was 4 per cent above
trend, in early 1993 it was at least 4 per cent beneath trend. Logically the
excess of trend output over actual output was associated with strong
downward pressure on inflation. By late 1993 the figures for the 12-month
change in retail prices were the lowest for 30 years.
Demand and output grew in 1993, possibly by more than 2 per cent. But this
was not an above-trend figure for the rate of change. So in early 1994 the
level of output will still be 4 per cent beneath trend and inflation will
continue to decline. Indeed the only way to stop inflation falling yet
further is to boost the level of output to the trend figure, which implies
that the rate of change of output has for a time to be well above trend.
Thus growth in 1994 and 1995 of 4 1/2 per cent in each year (that is, 2 per
cent above the 2 1/2 per cent trend for two consecutive years) would
eliminate the excess of trend output over actual. If rapid growth persisted
in 1996, this might reignite inflationary pressures from early 1996 onwards.
However, it is much more plausible that growth in 1994 and 1995 will be only
a touch above trend at, say, 3 or 3 1/2 per cent. The level of output would
then still be beneath trend in early 1996. Incredible though it may sound,
inflationary pressures ought to go on weakening in 1994, 1995 and 1996.
The latest news on inflation and growth has, in fact, been much better than
generally expected. Not only has inflation tumbled to low levels, but output
and employment have made solid gains in recent quarters. The provisional
national accounts statistics indicate that gross domestic product rose by a
little above  1/2 per cent in the third quarter. But separate data on
employment show that the workforce in the service sector soared by the
astonishing figure of 149,000, or by 1 per cent (that is, by an annualised 4
per cent).
Part of the explanation may be the buoyancy in City financial services,
connected with surging turnover in foreign exchange and bond trading, and
high prices in bond and equity markets. With the latest surveys from the
Confederation of British Industry suggesting that demand and output in
manufacturing is satisfactory, the economy as a whole may be expanding at
slightly above trend.
The year ahead is starting on the right note - in spite of the adverse
effect on spending power of the tax increases announced in the two Budgets
of 1993, and in spite of the continuing recession on the Continent. The
mid-1990s may prove to be not just good, but very good for the UK economy.
For the next two or three years inflation comfortably within the official
1-4 per cent range can be reconciled with above-trend growth and falling
unemployment.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Forecast '94: Locomotive out of puff - US economic growth
will slow down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIORDANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US economic growth accelerated substantially in the second half of 1993.
From less than a 1.5 percentage point annual pace in the first six months,
real gross domestic product growth jumped to an estimated 3.5 per cent, and
an even stronger rate in the fourth quarter. Hopes are high that the economy
has finally moved on to a path of consistently higher growth and job
creation. The reality in 1994, however, is more likely to be deja vu. As
with earlier intermittent periods of accelerated expansion, such as the
second half of 1992, this one should also prove transitory, despite the drop
in long-term interest rates in the summer.
Resurgent growth never lasted earlier in this upturn because its source was
short-lived, and the factors restraining the economy never dissipated.
Growth seems likely to slow again for the same reasons. The recent spurt is
being driven by a once-onlyreturn of vehicle inventories to desired levels
and an unrepeatable sharp drop in the household saving rate.
At the same time, a poor trade balance is a drag on growth, structural
factors are suppressing the economy's spirit, and policy is barely
stimulative.
The surge in vehicle output and its spillover will account for about half
the growth in fourth-quarter GDP. But production glitches and excessive
industry caution kept output below rising sales in the summer of 1993.
Without these influences, the production surge would have been more evenly
spaced.
Households will be unable to sustain their consumption binge because it
cannot be financed. Outlays have been rising at a 4 per cent annual clip
since early 1993 while real disposable income growth averaged only 2.5 per
cent.
To keep up this spending spree, either employment gains must rise to 350,000
per month to generate income growth, or the household saving rate must fall
by another 1 1/2 percentage points to about 2 per cent. Yet companies are
keeping a firm rein on head count, and stock and bond prices would have to
rise by another 15 to 20 per cent over the year to justify such a negligible
savings rate. By late winter, vehicle assemblies will be synchronised with
sales, and consumer expenditures should be more in line with income. Thus,
by the second half of 1994, economic growth should return to the slower
trend implied by three fundamentals.
First, foreign trade prospects look bleak, despite completion of the Uruguay
Round. A deteriorating trade balance has restrained growth and should do so
in coming months. US exports are still cheap, but not as cheap as they have
been over the past few years, because the dollar's effective exchange rate
appreciated 3 per cent last year. Moreover, even if the price is right,
demand in industrial countries is stagnant, with little chance of
improvement before late 1994. Export expansion will thus be weaker than the
8 per cent rise over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, import penetration is
rising as domestic demand leaks abroad. Since the US is the only economy
expanding with gusto, foreign companies will push for US market share.
Second, the economy is still adjusting to structural changes that have
helped consign the US to a slow, bumpy growth course. Corporate
restructuring is most commonly mentioned. It has short-circuited the
interplay of employment and income so crucial for economic expansion.
Moreover, the 30 per cent reduction in the rate of household formations
since the early 1980s to about 1m annually, together with an excess of
apartments, is dampening the response of housing construction to lower
interest rates. Housing starts already exceed the rate that would be
consistent with the underlying demand for living space, so the likelihood of
much further expansion is low. Finally, the private sector's adjustment to
defence cuts is incomplete, and future military retrenchment will be even
deeper under the latest budget cuts.
Third, monetary and fiscal policy are only marginally accommodating, and
less so than required to elevate underlying growth to a sustainably higher
plain. Tax rises and spending restraint in the next year are genuine. The
structural deficit relative to GDP should fall by at least 0.5 per cent in
fiscal 1994. In addition, the freeze on nominal discretionary spending will
produce significant real reductions in these outlays over the next year at
least.
With fiscal tightening and structural adjustments, neither a zero real cost
of short-term money nor double-digit growth in the monetary base should be
seen as evidence of significant monetary policy stimulus. Real short-term
interest rates are closer to their cyclical equilibrium than policymakers
fear.
Moreover, inflation-adjusted short-term rates understate the true level of
real financing costs for households and businesses. They pay less than they
did five years ago when the cost of all their forms of borrowing is
considered, but two to three times more than in earlier expansions.
Similarly, rapid growth in the monetary base is misleading. Its spurt in
recent years has been due to changes in the private sector's portfolio
preferences, not to the central bank's creation of excess liquidity. It also
has not led to high growth in bank loan demand. Thus it would be surprising
to see materially higher growth than the 2.5 per cent average so far in this
recovery.
There should be no economic need for the Federal Reserve to put up interest
rates before autumn, and then, initially, by only 50 basis points or so. A
pre-emptive anti-inflation tightening seems unwarranted and unlikely. Excess
capacity should be sufficient to keep inflation low for another year.
Even if growth averaged 4 per cent in 1994, it would probably take more than
a year before actual GDP reached or exceeded its potential level. Barring
shocks, inflation should stay in the 2.5 to 3 per cent range, if not lower.
Hence, monetary policymakers will have time to react before the economy hits
its inflation trip wire. If the Fed raises interest rates soon, the rise
would have to be small to stick, and be followed by another extended period
of stability.
Economic officials in other industrial countries have been counting on the
US to be the world's locomotive for growth. For nearly three years, however,
they have waited in vain; in 1994, they are likely to be disappointed again.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Business backs unitary local
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILLIP G YUILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article on local government reorganisation ('Local
difficulties', December 22), claims that 'business leaders have . . .
reacted with horror to plans to create small single-tier authorities'.
I am chairman of the Yuill Group of Companies, a construction group with a
turnover of more than Pounds 50m and Cleveland's third-largest independent
business. My company welcomes the recommendation of the Local Government
Commission to create four unitary all-purpose authorities in Cleveland and,
as a director of the Teesside Training and Enterprise Council, I know that
this view is shared by many of my business colleagues in this area.
Such opposition as exists to the commission's recommendation comes mainly
from small groups within the local branch of the Confederation of British
Industry and the Teesside Chamber of Commerce which, together, represent
less than 20 per cent of local businesses.
Set against this, 400 letters of support for unitary district government
have been sent to the commission by individual local businesses.
In addition, the commission's recommendation has been endorsed by key
business agencies, including the Teesside Development Corporation, the
Teesside Training and Enterprise Council and the northern branch of the
House-Builders Federation.
This support is not surprising when you consider that the four existing
district councils in Cleveland have an excellent track record of working in
partnership with local businesses, for example through the City Challenge
Initiative. The enthusiasm and support for an extension of the partnership
between council and private sectors was clearly in evidence at the recent
launch of the Tees Valley Development Company, which is a joint district
council/private sector initiative aimed at providing a focus for inward
investment and job creation. More than 120 business leaders attended the
event on a bitterly cold, foggy morning.
The people of Cleveland have made very clear their support for unitary
district local government. The misconception that this view is not shared by
the business community owes more to a concerted misrepresentation of the
facts by those who have a vested interest in influencing the debate. It
needs to be corrected.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A programme for Russia's revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFF SCHUBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Debate about the appropriate economic policy for Russia will continue
in 1994. As an economist and businessman, I spent a large proportion of 1992
and 1993 in Russia and would make several points.
First, high and variable inflation is certainly a problem but has not been
as instrumental in keeping foreign investors away (including from the
privatisation process) as political instability and lack of progress in
commercial legislation and administration.
Second, there is need for great caution in significantly tightening
macro-economic policy in rapid pursuit of very low inflation. The high level
of debt leverage and low level of 'marketisation' of the economy increases
the risk of further large falls in production. Very tight macro policies
also deny producers the financial resources, the market demand, and the time
needed to undertake structural change.
Third, the experience of other countries offers little support to those who
seek to 'shock' Russia into low inflation. Despite its high level of
'marketisation', the New Zealand economy stagnated in the second half of the
1980s while the rest of the world grew because a tight macro-economic policy
and the after-effects of excessive debt leverage offset the positive effects
of a generally excellent structural reform programme.
Poland began its reform programme with a much less market-orientated economy
than New Zealand and consequently found it much more difficult. Russia,
however, is even further behind, so any eventual successes in Poland will
not be easily repeated.
As for Ukraine, it may be that very tight monetary and budgetary policies
would have made things even worse. That country's problems stem from it
being an energy importer at increasing prices, the loss of experience in
dealing with itself and the world, which came with its separation from
Moscow, and the almost complete lack of micro-economic reform.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reality of Edouard Balladur's France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN FURNIVALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I note with some surprise your choice of Mr Edouard Balladur as the
FT's 'Man of the Year' ('Sang froid in the heat of battle', December 31).
May one presume that your editorial staff have little experience of living
in France? That not too many members of your staff have felt directly the
effects of what is probably the most inappropriate monetary policy dreamt up
by a postwar European government? Not too many friends or relatives among
the 3.3m unemployed? Not much contact with the 5,300 businesses a month
which have failed as business investment last year collapsed to its lowest
level since the official Insee state statistics institute records began?
Is it safe to suppose that relatively few of your editorial staff have a
current account with the state-owned Credit Lyonnais, insure their homes
with the state-owned insurance companies, or that you equip your offices
with the technology supplied by the nationalised Bull?
Is it your view that the re-structuring of burgeoning state bureaucracies
such as Air France should be sacrificed, in your own words, because 'one
crisis at a time was enough' and it was more politic at the time to keep the
riotous farmers off the streets?
Finally, would your editorial team feel so well disposed towards the French
prime minister were its members taxed at the top French marginal rate or
56.8 per cent?

FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Borrowing may not be indicator of
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN WARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your report, 'Recovery hopes dented by weak bank lending' (December 21) may
contain a possibly erroneous assumption: that increased lending to companies
must imply increased growth, and per contra.
Companies have been so badly burdened by debt in the late 1980s that many
are vowing 'never again' to resort to bank borrowing, at least on a
substantial scale.
This need not mean that they are starved of funds, merely that they get them
from a different source. Given the greater sophistication that recession has
(commendably) forced on them, their most readily available sources of course
are increased (retained) profits and better control of working capital.
Companies can 'bootstrap' growth without resorting to former levels of
borrowing.
Restricted borrowing does not therefore necessarily mean restricted growth
and it may be quite wrong to draw such an, inevitably pessimistic,
conclusion.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Football? kick it around - Opera in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1994, as in the year past, acres of Carmen, Tosca, Fledermaus, Figaro and
Magic Flute revivals are set to bulk out the schedules of the main British
opera companies - in other words, long runs of the easy-to-mount popular
favourites, forced on most of them as a means of survival in hard times. If
you look hard enough, though, there are genuinely exciting things in
prospect, tucked away in the midst of those schedules.
Among these I would instance the Royal Opera's first-ever account of
Rossini's Mose in Egitto (opening May 23) - that is to say, Rossini's Moses
opera in its shorter, more consistent original (1818) Neapolitan form,
rather than in its more familiar, looser-limbed later (1827) Parisian one.
At Covent Garden this marvellous work, at once neo-Classical and
early-Romantic in tone, is promised the fine cast - Anna Caterina Antonacci,
Ann Murray, Bruce Ford, and Ruggero Raimondi in the title role - which all
rare Rossini works need to persuade the unconvinced of their great merit.
At the English National Opera the latest opera premiere is likely to be of
special interest: Blond Eckbart (opening April 20), the third opera by
Judith Weir. Her previous two - A Night at the Chinese Opera and The
Vanishing Bridegroom - each gained a popular success unknown to the general
run of new opera, and with just cause: Weir's is not just an original view
of the musico-dramatic medium, but a captivating, commanding, utterly fresh
and personal one, capable of creating in each dramatic work a whole new
world and transporting even the most 'innocent', unlettered opera-goer into
it.
Another new opera that whets the appetite, this time from Opera North, is
being touted as the first-ever 'football opera' - Benedict Mason's Playing
Away (Leeds, from May 31), on a libretto by playwright Howard Brenton.
Already Mason, a young English composer, has shown in a series of
concert-works a quirky, madcap sense of humour that augurs well for his
first venture into the opera house; and, even for those with no interest
whatever in the subject, the hints of Faustian bargains-with-the-devil that
are said to underlie the conception will surely add to the fascination.
1994 is, of course, the year that the new Glyndebourne Theatre opens its
doors. It has 300 seats more than the old, and enlarged stage and audience
facilities; but, in spite of that increased seating provision, for
non-festival-members there is already probably small hope of getting seats
(the festival repertory is made up of Figaro, The Rake's Progress, Peter
Grimes, and new productions of Don Giovanni and Onegin), except by the usual
stratagems of haunting the box office for returns.
As times in Britain get ever harder for mounting fully fledged opera
stagings, the attractions of concert performances are likely to increase for
promoters. In London alone, in the first few months of the year, there is an
unusual amount on exceptional fare offer. The BBC Symphony promises concert
performances of Berg's Lulu (conducted by Andrew Davis) and, as part of a
Luciano Berio festival, the first British outing of Berio's second opera, La
vera storia. Verdi's Ernani comes on at the Festival Hall in March, given by
the group Opera in Concert.
Perhaps most welcome news of all, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra plans to
continue its recently-forged, outstandingly successful link with the St
Petersburg Kirov Opera and that company's remarkable chief, the conductor
Valery Gergiev. Concert performances of two Rimsky-Korsakov rarities -
Kashchey the Immortal and The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh - are
in prospect next May, and impatiently awaited.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Sexy, daring and dramatic - Theatre in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A journalist once asked de Gaulle to name the three greatest European
writers. 'Dante, Goethe - and Chateaubriand', came the reply. 'What] Not
Shakespeare?' exclaimed the journalist. 'But you asked for European
writers', said de Gaulle.
It is that great divide which makes European theatre an exotic, heady
experience for us English. It grows out of different roots; its future will
be different. It is multi-cultural and multi-lingual. Keynotes are high
stylisation, boldly revised texts, surreal, post-modern settings.
Intellectual debate on stage is sexy, daring - dramatic gods are figures
like Sartre and Brecht. The results can be dazzling, or dire.
Ironically, it is an American, director Bob Wilson, now working in Paris,
who towers over Europe's stages. Wilson's genius is to turn tradition upside
down, extracting the mythic essence of a piece through a contemporary,
minimalist aesthetic all his own. This year he fixes on two very traditional
areas. In April, he stages Grimm's fairy tales in Munich; in June he directs
two Noh operas in Florence. Both are tightly-controlled art forms, for which
his brand of chill artifice - jagged sets; miming, cardboard characters;
jangling tunes - offers exciting possibilities. Vintage Wilson - musicals
The Black Rider (an update of William Tell), and Alice in Wonderland - will
be revived at Hamburg's Thalia Theatre. Both mix high tech razzle-dazzle
with nursery rhyme soulfulness, and confirm Wilson as a star entertainer.
In Europe, the musical, with its roots in cabaret and Brecht, has an
intellectual respectability which attracts pioneering directors. In the
1980s, Germany's prophet of surreal aesthetics, Gunter Kramer, produced a
legendary steel-and-neon Threepenny Opera at Cologne which influenced all
subsequent productions. This New Year Cologne's extravaganza is Kramer's
Anatevka, a radical revision of Fiddler on the Roof. The Vienna
Burgtheater's New Year show is The Caucasian Chalk Circle, directed by
veteran Brechtian Ruth Berghaus, with her hallmark of mechanised
choreography and menacing cityscapes, to Paul Dessau's original music. In
June, another former east German, Katharina Thalbach, offers The Threepenny
Opera in Hamburg. East European influences now hold firm sway over western
drama. Big daddy at the Burgtheater is Hungarian satirist George Tabori, who
directs his own new play next month.
Highlight at the Comedie Francaise is Alexander Lang, formerly of the
Berliner Ensemble, directing Kleist's Prince of Homburg. A good night at the
Burg or the Comedie, the two oldest houses in Europe, is perfection. Across
the Seine at the Odeon Theatre, the Russian season will be this theatre's
most exciting foreign festival for years: watch for Lev Dodine's Cherry
Orchard and Lluis Pasqual's doing Tsvetaeva's The Phoenix.
Too few foreign shows visit Britain, although Peter Brook's famed L'homme
qui, about the psychology of madness, arrives from Paris in the spring.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Some dreams come true - International opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international musical year makes its most dynamic start on the other
side of the Atlantic, with three world premieres over the next six weeks.
America's most experienced opera composer, Dominick Argento, evokes the
spirit of the legendary 1920s Hollywood actor Rudolph Valentino in his new
opera The Dream of Valentino, which will be unveiled by the Washington Opera
(Jan 15). The other two premieres are orchestral: Kurt Masur conducts the
New York Philharmonic in Schnittke's Eighth Symphony (Feb 10), and Daniel
Barenboim conducts a new Elliott Carter work in Chicago (Feb 17).
In Europe, the spotlight falls initially on the Bavarian State Opera in
Munich, where Peter Jonas has launched a British invasion in his first
season as intendant. Tom Cairns designs and directs Un ballo in maschera
with a cast including Dennis O'Neill and Julia Varady (Jan 31), while
Richard Jones and Charles Mackerras tackle Giulio Cesare, with Ann Murray in
the title role (March 21).
Zurich also makes a rare foray into Handel with Alcina (Feb 5), one of two
new productions conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt - the other being a very
Viennese-looking La Belle Helene (May 28). The highlight of the Geneva
season promises to be Francesca Zambello's new staging of Billy Budd, with a
cast headed by Robert Tear, Rodney Gilfry and Samuel Ramey (March 15).
Claudio Abbado's Faust series with the Berlin Philharmonic reaches its
climax with Mahler's Eighth Symphony (Feb 12/13), but the event likely to
generate most excitement in Berlin is saved for the end of the season - when
Carlos Kleiber emerges from seclusion to conduct the federal president's
charity concert (June 28).
Nothing in the Milan programme arouses undue interest - except perhaps
Riccardo Muti's Rigoletto (May 14). French tenor star-in-waiting Roberto
Alagna sings the Duke, before moving to Paris to join Nuccia Focile in Romeo
et Juliette at the Opera-Comique (June 24). Apart from a showing of Harry
Kupfer's 1987 Stuttgart production of Die Soldaten at the Bastille (Jan 22),
the only big-scale opera project in Paris is a new Ring at the Chatelet,
conducted by Jeffrey Tate and staged by Pierre Strosser (June-Nov).
That may be overshadowed by the new Ring at Bayreuth - a curious marriage of
arch-radical producer, Alfred Kirchner, and arch-conservative conductor,
James Levine. But Bayreuth faces strong competition from this summer's
Salzburg programme, which promises to be Gerard Mortier's strongest yet: a
Barenboim-Chereau Don Giovanni, two cycles of Beethoven symphonies conducted
by Harnoncourt, a Stravinsky series featuring a Nagano-Sellars Oedipus Rex,
and plenty of Stockhausen and Boulez.
Lovers of operatic rarities will seek out Lalo's Le Roi d'Ys at Marseille
(March 16) and Reyer's Sigurd at Montpellier (May 6). But the most
intriguing of all is the revival of Hans Krasa's Dostoyevsky opera Uncle's
Dream at the Prague State Opera - formerly Prague's German theatre, where it
was premiered by George Szell in 1933. Krasa was gassed at Auschwitz, and
the opera has not been heard since - unlike his children's opera Brundibar,
which was performed last year at London's South Bank. When a young Israeli
conductor, Israel Yinon, recently asked Universal Edition for the score, he
was told it had been lost. He persisted, and eventually found Krasa's
manuscript, complete with Szell's pencil markings, in the basement of the
publisher's Vienna premises. Yinon conducts Uncle's Dream in Prague on March
27. (The production transfers to Mannheim in June.)

FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Just avoid 'Swan Lake' at all costs - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking forward into the year's dance, does not, alas, imply looking forward
to it. Much looks predictable, and I cite only those dates that seem to be
worth a diary entry. Please note that Irek Mukhamedov joins forces with Kim
Brandstrup's Arc Dance troupe for a bold venture at Sadler's Wells (February
9 - 12) when he will appear in a new Othello that Brandstrup is to make for
him.
Other Wells events include a 'Spanish season' in March with Cristina Hoyos
and then the Compania Nacional de Danza in two programmes by Nacho Duarto.
At Covent Garden, Mayerling will be revived at the end of January, and again
in March for two performances with Mukhamedov and Michael Nunn - both
admirable as Archduke Rudolf. Birmingham Royal Ballet will come to Covent
Garden in March/April with a triple bill including a new acquisition, Fall
River Legend, Agnes de Mille's jolly old barnstormer about Lizzie Borden
('You can't chop your Momma up in Massachusetts, And then blame all the
damage on the mice]'). Lizzie should turn her axe on the company's
lamentable new Sylvia.
If you are in Paris in February, the Opera Garnier will present a
fascinating Nijinsky programme which includes a 'reconstruction' (optimistic
term) of Nijinsky's Tyl Eulenspiegel, last seen for a handful of
performances in New York in 1916, together with the 'reconstruction' of his
Rite of Spring. In March the Palais Garnier will also show a triple bill of
brand new works by Roland Petit - good news - and in July the San Francisco
Ballet will appear there with two programmes.
Meantime in New York, New York City Ballet will have its April/June season
at the State Theater, and American Ballet Theatre will presumably pay its
traditional visit to the Met in that annual across-the-Plaza rivalry with
NYCB.
Good news from the Edinburgh Festival is that both Mark Morris and Merce
Cunningham's troupes will be on offer with a large repertory. London ballet
dates are unknown, though English National Ballet will play a week at the
Coliseum (with its new Sleeping Beauty) and then on to the Festival Hall
with Beauty and Coppelia.
One other thing is sure: somewhere, someone is going to rush in with Swan
Lake. I remember in New York one lunch-time a decade ago finding the NY Post
front page devoted to a traffic-stopping head-line of just eight letters:
Pope Shot. I'm not at all sure nowadays whether Swan Lake's eight letters
are not more calculated to strike terror into the heart.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Jazz tunes in to anniversaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Important anniversaries are celebrated in 1994 by two jazz record labels
which each represent distinct and different aspects of the music. Expect
much retrospection, recorded and live, to mark the occasions.
Norman Granz's Verve label was founded in 1944 with the launch of the Jazz
At The Philharmonic shows in Los Angeles. JATP stars who found a home on the
Granz labels which later became Verve included Charlie Parker, Lester Young,
Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday. On April 6, survivors Illinois Jacquet
and Flip Phillips will be joined by current stars Joe Henderson and Betty
Carter in a concert at New York's Carnegie Hall for the start of the
year-long celebration. The reclusive Granz may even put in an appearance on
the first night.
ECM, the German label which encapsulates all that is new and spiritual in
jazz, is 25 this year and founder Manfred Eicher is thought to be organising
appropriately ascetic and European events. Fans of Jarrett, Garbarek, Surman
et al would do well to watch the listings in the autumn for signs of
European Contemporary Music activity in a city near them.

<TEXT>
Ballet on television is problematical. Point cameras at the stage and the
dancers often look tiny. Get choreographers to create for the medium and the
results are frequently embarrassingly pretentious. This week BBC2 makes four
attempts in Dance For The Camera starting today with Shobana Jeyasingh's
'Duets With Automobiles' which brings together Indian classical dance and
London office blocks (7.30).
BBC1 devotes time to the 30th anniversary of Top Of The Pops with a
retrospective at 8.00 and, at 10.50, in Pan's People: Digging The Dancing
Queens, a fond glance back to the days when physically well endowed women
were allowed to strut their stuff just as readily as the mentally well
endowed.
Kind Of Blue (9.00 C4) is a 60-minute documentary about
melancholia/depression which suggests the condition need not be regarded as
all bad. 40 Minutes, which the BBC has announced it is scrapping, looks at a
bizarre habit among the richer natives of Britain: they send their
eight-year-old sons away to institutions called boarding schools (9.50
BBC2).

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Only connect, for a more reliable
ride - Better ways of flying to eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers' tales from eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union, of
overcrowded aircraft, of being flown to the wrong destination or of
passengers having to club together to buy the fuel, make good table talk.
But yesterday's fatal air crash in Russia is a reminder that safety, as well
as comfort, should be taken seriously when you venture east of the Elbe.
One way of increasing the safety of your trip - recommended by the UK
foreign office - is to seek out western airlines that fly to smaller cities
in the east.
Several European carriers are making a virtue of their central European
bases and are offering quick connections to destinations such as Bucharest
and Timisoara in Romania, Kiev and Odessa in Ukraine, Minsk in Belarus, Alma
Ata in Kazakhstan and half a dozen other hard-to-get-to cities.
Your first choice should be Austrian Airlines. It flies to 10 cities that do
not have direct links from London, Paris, New York or Tokyo, and it also
offers short, same-day connections. Travellers receive boarding passes at
their home airport for the onward flight and can check baggage through to
their final destination. Austrian guarantees baggage transfer at Vienna even
if there is only half an hour between connecting flights.
Although a direct flight might be faster, the extra time needed for the
stopover in Vienna is usually short, and the difference in comfort and
convenience great. Going to Kiev via Vienna, for example, you leave London
at 07:35 and arrive at 14:50. The connecting flight from Paris leaves at
08:10, from Milan at 09:20 and from New York at about 19:00 the previous
day.
The direct alternative from London, on Ukraine International Airlines, flies
three times a week in the late afternoon, arriving at the inconvenient hour
of 21:45.
Running a close second to Austrian Airlines is Lufthansa, the German
carrier. It flies to many of the same cities, but some departures are too
early for a same-day connection when starting from London, Paris or New
York.
However, Lufthansa does fly to some cities that no other western carrier
reaches. They include Alma Ata and Tashkent, the capitals of Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan, both important for the oil and gas industries.
Some oil executives are not so lucky. Cities such as Baku in Azerbaijan have
no direct flights from western Europe. But it is possible to avoid flying
via Moscow on THY, the Turkish airline. THY also flies to Ashkhabad, capital
of Turkmenistan, and if there is no same-day connection in Ankara, THY will
pay for a night's accommodation.
Travellers to the Baltic states have a wider choice. To Riga or Tallinn, you
can go via Frankfurt or Munich on Lufthansa, via Copenhagen on SAS, or
Helsinki on Finnair. For Vilnius, pick from SAS, Lufthansa, Austrian or
Hamburg Airlines.
Some of these connections do not appear in airline guides such as ABC. And
new destinations are continually being added: Austrian will fly to Odessa
from this spring, for example.
However, all connections and additions should be on electronic booking
systems.
But it may be wise to stimulate the imagination of your travel department or
agency to check all the options.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Airline bars foie gras - Travel
Update
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First-class passengers on a Canadian airline will have to live with lobster
and filet mignon now that pate de foie gras is being dropped from the menu,
an animal rights group said.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a Washington-based
organisation, said Air Canada had confirmed that it planned to stop serving
the expensive pate in May.
To produce the French delicacy, ducks and geese are force-fed so their
livers expand to several times their normal size, PETA said. 'Many birds die
in the process as their internal organs fuse together or explode from the
crude feeding procedure.'
English actor Sir John Gielgud has lent his name to the fight against the
pate. The animal group has asked airlines around the world to halt foie gras
service, and Air Canada is the first to act.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico: The situation around San Cristobal de la Casas in southern Mexico is
still tense, following clashes between armed peasants and the army. An
estimated 200 Mexican soldiers patrolled the streets and warned residents to
stay inside for safety.
The peasants, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army and
say they are fighting for indigenous rights, took over what the government
now says was six cities in the southern state of Chiapas in New Year's day
raids.
A rebel commander identifying himself as Comandante Marcos also told
reporters that the uprising was tied to the North American Free Trade
Agreement, the pact linking the US, Canada and Mexico in a free trade zone.
'The North American Free Trade Agreement is the death certificate for the
indigenous people of Mexico. We rose up in arms to respond to (President)
Salinas's death sentence against our people,' he said.
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued the following advice
to travellers to other regions:
Philippines: Power blackouts of up to eight hours happen daily. Violence is
a serious problem in parts of north Luzon and the Visayas.
A curfew is in force in Azerbaijan and all border areas should be avoided.
Non-essential visits to Baku should be postponed. All visits to Tajikistan
should be postponed because of political and ethnically based clashes.

Smokers travelling on British Airways' longest-haul flights now face up to
24 hours without a cigarette.
The airline is introducing a smoking ban for a trial period on flights to
and from Australia and New Zealand and says it will become permanent if
passengers are happy with it.
It will apply to all BA services operating to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide, Perth and Auckland, via both Singapore and Bangkok. The airline's
domestic UK flights and European flights of less than 90 minutes are already
non-smoking.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Rouble replaces dollar - Travel
Update
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar is due to disappear officially from Russia's shops in an
attempt to put Russians more in control of their own finances.
Economists said a central bank regulation preventing traders from accepting
foreign cash could help the rouble in the short term. But the real impact
would be psychological.
Russia announced the ban on cash dollar trade in early October, days after
President Boris Yeltsin sent in the tanks to quell a rebellion from the old
conservative parliament.
Central bank officials say they hope the ban on foreign currency trade will
add to the volume of dollars on offer at the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange, increasing the value of the rouble.
The rouble more than halved in value in the first five months of last year,
but the sharp fall ended in June and losses since then have been steady
rather than dramatic. It now trades at around 1,250 to the dollar.
Under the new rules, credit card bills will still be denominated in dollars
but cash payments must be made in roubles.
The dollar had virtually become a parallel currency in the two years since
Russia launched its economic reforms.

FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Banking on a rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' long search for a finance director has finally
ended with the appointment of Rob Abrahamsen, a senior executive at the
airline's main bankers, ABN AMRO, writes Ronald van de Krol.
Abrahamsen, who joins on January 10, comes to the job with extensive
experience in project financing, including the complex financing of new
aircraft, now normal practice for capital-intensive airlines like KLM.
But it is already clear that one of his main challenges in the year ahead
will be to put together a rights issue for KLM now that the Dutch national
carrier's plans for a four-way partnership with SAS, Swissair and Austrian
Airlines have fallen through.
Abrahamsen's task will be made slightly easier by the fact that the Dutch
government, which owns 38.2 per cent of the airline, has already expressed
its willingness to take part in any issue. So far, KLM has refused to be
drawn on either likely timing or size.
The increased importance of finance in KLM's future is reflected in the
decision to make Abrahamsen a member of the executive board. The previous
finance director, Peter Alberda van Ekenstein, who left the airline in
April, did not have a seat on the board.
Abrahamsen, a 55-year-old Dutchman, spent 25 years at the Netherlands Bank
of South Africa, including a three-year stint as chief executive officer.
Returning to the Netherlands in 1987, he spent a short time with the
Netherlands Investment Bank before joining ABN in 1989, a year before its
merger with AMRO. In his last job at the bank he was head of global clients
and asset management and trust.

FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Edsel claws his way up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It cannot be easy having the most infamous first name in US automobile
history, but Edsel Ford II nevertheless seems to be managing pretty well,
writes Patrick Harverson.
The 44-year old Ford, who shares a name with the Ford Edsel, the car that
bombed so spectacularly in the 1950s that its name eventually became
synonymous with failure, has been made a vice-president of the auto
manufacturer. His promotion has sparked speculation that he is being groomed
for the top job at the company his great-grandfather founded in 1903. 'He is
clawing his way to the top,' remarked one Wall Street analyst.
Although the family owns 40 per cent of the voting stock, a Ford has not run
the company since 1980, when Henry Ford II stepped down as chairman. So it
is understandable that the latest promotion of Edsel Ford has attracted some
attention.
Edsel Ford is currently president of the group's finance arm, Ford Motor
Credit; he has previously worked in the company's sales and marketing and
international operations, a breadth of experience that will serve him in
good stead should he ever end up running Ford. His chance may come as soon
as the end of this decade, when the recently appointed chairman, Alexander
Trotman, is expected to retire.
In spite of his nearly 20 years at Ford, however, there are still doubts
over whether Edsel Ford has earned his promotions entirely on merit. David
Healy, motor industry analyst at SG Warburg in New York, says that Edsel
Ford's appointment as vice-president 'really has more to do with the fact
that this is a family company than it does with any normal executive
decision'.
Another, less charitable analyst, concurs, saying of Edsel: 'Look, if his
name wasn't Ford, he wouldn't be a candidate for the top job.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Next step in Galvin dynasty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young Chris Galvin has a tough act to follow, writes Laurie Morse. As
newly-named president and chief operating officer of Motorola, he must
maintain the momentum generated by former CEO George Fisher, who defected to
Eastman Kodak in October. Under Fisher, Motorola became a legendary research
machine with a reputation for quality products in two competitive high-tech
arenas - wireless telecommunications and semiconductors.
In 1992, Motorola's sales were Dollars 13.3bn, twice those of 1988, and
profits in 1993 are projected to be close to Dollars 1bn.
Galvin, at 43, seems young to take over; but his whole life has been
training for the job. The grandson of Motorola's founder Paul Galvin, and
son of Robert Galvin, who chaired the company for 26 years, Chris Galvin
seems destined for the chairman's seat. His family owns 3 per cent of the
company's stock.
Colleagues say he has much more going for him than the Motorola pedigree.
Bright and ambitious, Galvin began working part-time in the family business
in 1967, and joined the company full-time in 1973, peddling portable
telephones. He worked through a series of sales management and marketing
positions, earned an MBA from Northwestern University, and grew the
company's portable paging division in the 1980s.
Galvin shares the chief executive office with Gary Tooker, a 30-year
Motorola veteran who was Fisher's right-hand man, and who now holds the
title of CEO.
With Motorola facing stiff competition from Intel in the semiconductor
market, and from a host of overseas telecommunications rivals, the company
is at a critical juncture. It is just embarking on a number of untried
technologies, including the global communications scheme, Iridium, projected
to cost Dollars 3.4bn.
The task won't be easy. Motorola's stock was flying at a high 33 times
earnings, or Dollars 107 per share just before Fisher's departure. It has
since skidded 19 per cent to Dollars 87.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Russian aircraft crash - Travel
Update
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A blazing Russian airliner crashed in the icy wastes of Siberia yesterday,
ploughing through farmhouses and killing all 120 people on board, including
at least 16 foreigners, in Russia's worst air accident in nearly a decade.
A spokeswoman for the Moscow-based State Committee for Emergencies said the
captain of the Tupolev-154 craft had reported one of its engines catching
fire minutes after taking off from the Siberian city of Irkutsk on Flight
130 to Moscow. As he turned back to the airport, the other two jets of the
Baikal Air aircraft failed.
The airliner was just 12 minutes into what should have been a five-hour
flight to the Russian capital from Irkutsk, an industrial town situated on
Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake and a famous tourist
attraction.
The British foreign office is advising travellers where possible to fly
directly to their destination on an international flight originating outside
the former Soviet Union (see article on this page).

FT  04 JAN 94 / People: The rise of Alfredo Saenz - Last week saw the latest
chapter in the saga of Spanish banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario Conde, sacked last week as president of Banesto, Spain's fourth
largest bank, used to dominate the vast dark green office he had at the
bank's headquarters in Madrid's old financial quarter.
Its current occupant does not. The tall green tapestried folding screens,
the white marble busts over the fireplace and the soft light filtering
through the louvred windows somehow do not suit Alfredo Saenz Abad.
Where Conde was immaculate, forceful and handsome, Saenz seems quietly
dressed, harmless and plain. Smaller too. On the face of it, Conde's removal
and the nomination of Saenz by the Bank of Spain to put in place a rescue
package for Banesto has replaced the extraordinary with the merely normal.
But occupancy of that overdecorated office is a great personal triumph for
an opera buff who is well connected in banking and politics. Alfredo Saenz's
rise to the top of Spanish banking has taken him from a top Jesuit
university through lecturing to a string of senior jobs in the 1980s at
Banco Vizcaya - then one of the most aggressive banks in the country.
Alfredo Saenz has every intention of staying at Banesto now that he is
finally in charge of one of Spain's 'Big Five' banks. Sometime this year the
bank's shareholders should elect a new board and despite a possible
challenge from Conde, the backing of the Bank of Spain would make Saenz a
near certainty for president. He has been made to wait long enough.
Four years ago he came within an inch of securing the co-presidency of Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) the biggest privately owned bank in the country. It was
the intervention of the Bank of Spain that was to blame for his failure. The
Banesto post may be a reward for taking that loss like a gentleman.
The race for the BBV leadership was a spiteful affair and Saenz was one of
the few people to come out of it well. It started when one of the big Basque
banks, Bilbao, made a bid to buy Banesto at the end of 1987. It was partly
foiled by an injection of capital into Banesto by Mario Conde, then 39.
Saenz' career as a banker took off under the patronage of Pedro Toledo, a
clever banker with very close ties to the socialist government, who for many
years ran Banco de Vizcaya, the highly regarded Basque bank. Saenz' rise is
in many ways a posthumous tribute to Vizcaya and to Toledo who died just
over four years ago.
Toledo had a talent for hiring bright, ambitious people. Carlos Solchaga,
the former finance minister, worked for him. So did Francisco Luzon, now
chairman of Argentaria, the big federation of government-owned banks.
Another was Saenz, an alumni, like Conde, of the prestigious Jesuit
university of Deusto in Bilbao.
He had taught management there (a former student is now minister of the
interior), turned down the job of deputy defence minister and worked in
industry in the Basque country, from where Toledo hired him in 1980.
Spanish banking was in deep crisis at the time. The Bank of Spain was
pressing larger banks to take over about 50 troubled smaller ones to prevent
them collapsing. The biggest concern was in Barcelona, where Banca Catalana,
one of the emblems of Catalan banking, had come close to failure before the
Central Bank fired its management just as they did Banesto's last week.
Catalana had overestimated its assets by some Pta800bn (Pounds 3,791m) and
there were attempts to bring charges against the board, including Jordi
Pujol, now leader of the Catalan regional government. They got nowhere. But
after a brief stewardship by a pool of banks at Catalana, Vizcaya took it
over and Toledo packed off Saenz to put it back together. At the time,
Toledo was assumed to have acted very recklessly in buying Catalana.
Yet Saenz' sojourn in Barcelona had a happy ending. By borrowing from the
Bank of Spain and other Spanish banks, he converted Catalana into one of
Spain's most profitable banks and remains its president today. Unusually for
a Basque, he is revered in Barcelona. He made his first speech to Catalana
shareholders in Catalan, which he had learnt in just nine months.
After Bilbao's bid for Banesto failed, it sought and won a merger with
Vizcaya. Toledo and Bilbao's ageing president, Jose Angel Sanchez Asain,
became co-presidents of the merged bank in 1988. The clear implication was
that Toledo, the younger of the two, would rule on his own when Sanchez
Asain retired.
It was not to be. Toledo died suddenly in late 1989 of liver failure. Former
Vizcaya people on the new BBV board quickly nominated Saenz as his successor
as co-president, which the Bilbao side rejected. In the clash of cultures
that followed, former Vizcayans would accuse their new colleagues of being
pen-pushers and counters of paper clips. The other side claimed Toledo had
bred a team of flashy Rambo-bankers, unfit to run a bank as big as BBV.
In early 1990 the then governor of the Bank of Spain, Mariano Rubio, was
asked to arbitrate and name a single president. Sanchez Asain stepped aside
but it was another Bilbao man, Emilio Ybarra, whom Rubio selected. He named
Saenz as first vice president; he has run the BBV's retail side since.
Since then there has been a steady leakage of Toledo's bright young men from
BBV, where former Bilbao managers now hold sway. Many have gone off to
Argentaria with Luzon.
For those that remained behind, biding their time along with Saenz, Banesto
and its 2,600 retail branches is their glittering reward. Within hours of
Conde leaving Banesto, a stream of senior BBV managers began to take control
of its operations. With few exceptions, they were former Vizcaya people;
more are likely to follow. They long to recreate the upbeat, snappy
atmosphere which marked Toledo's reign at BBV.
Mario Conde is unlikely to maintain silence on his ousting for very long. He
owns 4 per cent of Banesto and he may challenge the decision to remove him.
But it will be difficult. The Bank of Spain's blessing is essential to the
survival of any bank president.
Conde cannot win back that approval; Saenz has bucketfuls of it.
Saenz is well qualified to revive the ailing bank. Banesto headquarters
staff warmed to him; he was quick to remember names and let it be known he
was not there as the vanguard of a BBV takeover. He wants Banesto
independent and for himself and his people. Fortunately, his friends run the
country. They will help him.

FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Magic card tricks - How your wish
for simpler and cheaper phone calls from abroad can be granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extortionate hotel telephone bill need never enrage you again. The need
to rummage around for piles of foreign coins to feed a pay telephone is an
irritation of the past. So is the hunt for a kiosk that sells a telephone
card - which you then usually carry home on the aircraft with most of its
value unused.
Most European executives, however, still have not realised that carrying a
telephone charge card is a way to short-circuit many of the hassles involved
in calling home from abroad.
The idea behind 'calling cards' is simple. You make your calls toll free,
quoting a personal identification number, and the cost is charged either to
your home or office telephone account, or to a credit or charge card
account.
The majority of US travellers - at home and abroad - now have a telephone
charge card. AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, alone has more than 27m
in circulation within the US. But it is estimated that only one in five UK
travellers has a card, while elsewhere in Europe the proportion is thought
to be lower still.
'Our main UK competitor isn't British Telecom: it's ignorance,' says Mr
Peter Valentin, AT&amp;T's consumer markets manager in the UK. 'Most travellers
still don't carry calling cards; and their employers don't seem to realise
the cost.'
While a card can reduce the worry, frequent overseas travellers stand to
gain from having more than one phone charge card. Different cards have
different virtues, in terms of where you can call and how much it costs. And
since most of the cards come free, the only drawback is the time it takes to
work out which card to use when.
Calls by card are charged at a premium rate. But a typical hotel call from
the US to the UK costs more than twice as much as using a US telecom charge
card. Similar savings can be made from using cards issued by local telephone
operators when calling between European countries.
All Europe's larger state telecommunications operators issue calling cards.
And in most of the main business destinations you can use any card to phone
home.
Competition between the card companies is fierce, and no two cards are
alike. For the overseas traveller, therefore, three things need to be taken
into account:
Tariffs. For the US traveller, it is almost invariably cheaper to use a
domestic than a foreign card to ring home. Rival US card producers are led
by the three long-distance operators, AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI.
The same does not apply to UK or European travellers. In Europe, you are
usually better off phoning home with a card from your national operator, but
in the US you are likely to find it cheaper calling home with a US card.
From next month, Sprint, the long-distance US carrier, is advertising a
tariff from the US to the UK on its Foncard barely one-fifth that available
on BT's Chargecard.
For UK travellers, Mercury's card generally works out cheaper than BT's. A
10-minute peak-rate call from Germany to London costs Pounds 9.89 with a BT
card, but Pounds 8.99 with Mercury.
Ease of calling. Some cards have wider coverage than others. The main
American, European and Asian destinations are covered by most cards. But
while BT boasts 82 countries from which the UK can be called by Chargecard,
Mercury's Calling Card extends to only 36. AT&amp;T's card can be used by US
travellers almost anywhere: it even offers an online translation service in
140 languages, 24 hours a day.
Billing and calling procedures vary. Some cards allow you to charge the cost
to a credit card; others restrict you to a home phone account. Of the UK
cards, Mercury allows you to call direct, without going through an operator,
while BT obliges you to go through an operator.
Third-country calling. To protect their international revenues, some
countries do not allow you to use a card to call a country other than that
from which it originates. The principal business destinations affected are
Spain, Japan, Singapore, China, Argentina and Brazil.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep it clear, quick and
stress-free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venture capitalists competing for a decreasing number of attractive
management buy-out deals need to become more attuned to their clients'
needs, according to a survey carried out by Warwick Business School.
Managers who have been through the gruelling process of an MBO said venture
capitalists sometimes behaved in a manner that made the deal unnecessarily
stressful.
A particular cause for complaint was the tendency for venture capitalists to
make unilateral changes to the deal at a late stage in the negotiations.
Other concerns included the amount of lengthy documentation, which was often
duplicated by different parties to the deal, and a poor initial explanation
of the nature of the funding process which left managers feeling
ill-informed and frustrated by apparently inexplicable delays.
The research was carried out by Warwick Business School for ECI Ventures,
the venture capital group, from MBOs of Pounds 2m to Pounds 10m between
January 1991 and June 1993.
The survey showed that nearly three-quarters of those interviewed said the
impetus for the buy-out had been the parent company's decision to sell the
managers' enterprise.
Because of time pressures, management teams approached, on average, only
three venture capitalists before deciding who would fund them.
The managers tended to rely on their 'own initiative' in deciding where to
go for external equity. Forty per cent of management teams had already
approached venture capitalist financiers before they recruited a financial
adviser.
Nearly half the teams did not rate their financial advisers as influential
in the selection of a source of equity while only nine per cent said the
advisers were 'highly influential'. Bank managers did not rate as an
important source of advice.
Managers said their ideal venture capitalist would conclude the finance
negotiations speedily and would have resources available for future
expansion.

 -In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small high-technology companies are heavily under-insured in crucial areas
of their business, according to a study by the University of Central
England.
While 95 per cent of respondents took out standard property and liability
insurance, only 5 per cent had key man insurance and 8 per cent professional
indemnity cover, the report said. Fewer than 10 per cent of companies
surveyed were protected against loss of patents and other forms of
intellectual property.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Advice for new exporters
 -In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advice and help for new exporters is fragmented and divided between too many
providers, according to a report by the British Chambers of Commerce.
Marketing of the services is not focused and does not reach the small and
medium-sized companies that should be 'taking up the export challenge', the
report says.
The BCC says national television programmes should be produced to encourage
exporters. Business Link should not be relied on to provide a full service -
instead existing services provided by the DTI, Chambers of Commerce and
Trade Associations should be improved and better co-ordinated. The
government should also back a scheme offering temporary experienced help to
companies developing export markets.
The BCC says there is 'enormous potential' for many British companies in
overseas markets but it says that potential exporters should have been
established for more than 18 months, should employ five people or more and
have sales in excess of Pounds 250,000.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Back to basics on the
factory floor - Richard Gourlay examines the Japanese concept of continuous
improvement and finds that dramatic change can be achieved with employee
co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a brave man to allow consultants to tear up his factory and
re-arrange it overnight. It takes employees who are even more understanding
to accept such changes.
At the Paddy Hopkirk car accessory factory in Bedfordshire just before
Christmas, consultants inspired by the Japanese concept of continuous
improvement - or Kaizen - did just that.
One morning the factory was an untidy sprawl of production lines surrounded
by piles of crates holding semi-finished components. Two days later, when
the 180-strong workforce came to work, the machines had been brought
together in tightly grouped 'cells'. The piles of components had
disappeared, and the newly-cleared floor space was neatly marked with
colour-coded lines mapping out the flow of materials.
Overnight, there were dramatic differences. In the first full day,
productivity on some lines increased by up to 30 per cent, the space needed
for some processes had been halved, and work in progress had been cut
considerably. The improved lay-out had allowed some jobs to be combined,
freeing up operators for deployment elsewhere in the factory.
'I was expecting a change but nothing as dramatic as this,' says Hopkirk,
who is chairman. 'It is fantastic.'
A natural marketing man, Hopkirk has successfully established the company on
the back of the name he made for himself 30 years ago when he won the Monte
Carlo rally in a Mini Cooper. Sales of his bicycle racks for cars are
growing and making good margins; even the axle stands are holding their own
against fierce Chinese competition.
But Hopkirk had long known his production processes left a lot to be
desired. 'We were a marketing company that went into manufacturing and could
never get it right,' he says.
Hopkirk discovered the Kaizen approach after an introduction from a US
customer. He invited representatives from the Kaizen Institute, a European
consultancy, and executives from other Kaizen clients to try implementing
improvements in his factory over a five-day period.
In essence Kaizen is the antithesis of the old adage: 'If it ain't bust,
don't fix it'. The theory is that managers lead a relentless drive to
improve the production process, but can only succeed if they win the
co-operation of the company's real 'value-adders' - the shop floor
workforce.
One of many Japanese management practices which have been adopted in the
west, Kaizen is most frequently applied in larger companies. But it is
equally valid in smaller factories. Paddy Hopkirk has sales of Pounds 6m a
year, but with the help of continuous improvement thinks this can reach
Pounds 9m.
Nor does its most simple application appear to require the services of
expensive consultants. Before joining the Kaizen Institute, production
engineer Ross Banarjee doubled production of fire extinguishers in six years
for Thorn Fire Protection with a workforce of about 200 after implementing
what he had studied in books.
Another convert is Brian Francis, managing director of Albion Press Metals
in the West Midlands, who introduced Kaizen practices with the help of
Nissan UK when he had 280 employees. Each year he was having to deliver
productivity improvements because his customers would not agree any pricing
increases.
Like many other suppliers to the motor industry who are in the same
position, Albion has had to find the productivity increases by continually
improving its manufacturing processes.
A central tenet of Kaizen is the elimination of waste. It not only exists in
obvious piles of excess inventory. It is also wasteful when an operator
makes more movements than is necessary to complete a task because his or her
machine is badly positioned.
To reduce one of the biggest sources of waste, Kaizen favours one-piece
production, involving as many processes as possible being carried out on a
single part consecutively rather than one process being done in a big batch.
Parts are only delivered to the next stage of the production or assembly
process when they are needed. This so-called Kamban inventory delivery
system ensures semi-finished goods do not pile up at each stage, tying up
cash in work-in-progress. 'Over-production belongs where it was
over-produced,' says Peter Willats who founded the Kaizen Institute of
Europe with Masaaki Imai, author of a book that popularised the approach.*
Another central theme is the drive to reduce the time wasted in processes
that do not add value, like carrying parts or moving from one machine to
another. Willats says that in an average factory only one second is spent
adding value - like drilling holes, assembling or packing - for every 1,000
seconds spent not adding value. He says he has never seen a factory cut this
ratio to less than 1:200 but that managers and workers should continuously
seek ways to reduce time-wasting effort.
One way of eliminating unnecessary walking is to set up production lines in
a horseshoe shape rather than a straight line; in this way an operator doing
a number of tasks will end up at the starting point for the next cycle.
This can also lead to surprising savings in space, which in Paddy Hopkirk's
case is timely indeed. Hopkirk was wondering how to accommodate the extra
workforce needed to handle this month's seasonal increase in demand on its
cycle rack line. Space savings made during the workshop may solve the
problem.
To a production engineer, much of what Kaizen advocates might seem like
common sense. Much of it is. 'The problem is that in the last 25 years we
have lost the rigour to maintain those basics,' says Pierre Lecocq,
vice-president in charge of radiator manufacture at Valeo, the decentralised
French car components group which has adopted the Kaizen approach. 'It is
not revolutionary in the sense that the tools we are implementing are very
creative, it is just that the Kaizen system forces you to be thorough in
maintaining the rigour,' he says.
Like many good management ideas, Kaizen has spawned its lexicon of
aphorisms. 'Seek to create the obvious factory' is one. A storage shelf, for
example, should be clearly labelled showing what tool should be there, where
it is if it isn't, whether it is ready for use and when it was last
overhauled.
Willats says this procedure can cut set-up times on machines that produce
large batches of parts: the machine has shorter runs without being
uneconomic, reducing work in progress and increasing the factory's
flexibility.
Another article of faith - observed in Japan if not always elsewhere - is
that 'no one will improve themselves out of a job'. This sums up a truth
that companies will only get the full co-operation of workers if the
improvements they suggest do not end in management laying them off.
'Creativity of the workforce does not come naturally even in Japan,' says
Lecocq. 'There is a whole management system there to put pressure on
operators to participate. A shop floor manager is directly judged by the
number of suggestions his people are coming forward with.' Too often,
though, suggestion box schemes fail because the ideas are not evaluated
quickly enough.
It also takes time to change shop floor perceptions. A job takes on a new
dimension with Kaizen - continuous questioning of procedures rather than
slavish adherence to them. But acceptance can be remarkably quick. Andy
Hand, a production welder at Paddy Hopkirk, said of the overnight changes in
his working environment; 'It looks like the bosses had a brain transplant. A
weight has been lifted off our shoulders.'
Hopkirk wishes he had discovered Kaizen 25 years ago. But a better test of
whether his factory has been transformed can only be seen over time. The
Financial Times plans to return to the factory in the summer to see how
continuous any improvement has been.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Graduates 'will be able to demand more'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduates in future will be able to demand more for their skills due to a
dwindling supply of job seekers from universities, a report said yesterday.
Researchers from Sheffield University told the British Psychological
Society's occupational conference that a survey of 176 managers and
personnel specialists had shown a 'considerable degree of ignorance' about
demographic changes in the numbers of young people. The report said this
raised serious doubts about UK businesses' abilities to recruit, train and
develop managers for the future.
Less than a fifth of respondents realised that there would be about a 30 per
cent fall in the number of 20 to 24-year-olds entering the labour force
towards the end of the decade.
Thirty-six per cent of managers severely underestimated the extent of the
reduction and 18 per cent either believed there would be no change in the
numbers of young people entering the jobs market or that there would be an
increase.
The report said better and more reliable selection methods would be needed
for the 1990s. Forty-four per cent said they would readily agree to pay
higher salaries to attract and retain graduates.
The vast majority of the respondents still used interviews in graduate
selection, most used ability tests and almost all followed up references.
Three-quarters of the sample said they would pay greater salaries to attract
and keep high calibre staff. More than a third of employers, however, said
they recognised the potential of redeploying retired people as a means of
overcoming the shortfall in the number of young people.
The report said: 'These findings clearly indicate a growing number of
organisations will undoubtedly seek to raise the financial stakes in an
attempt to attract skilled labour at a time when such labour is in very
short supply.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / Teachers challenge curriculum reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than three-fifths of members questioned by the NASUWT teaching union
said the National Curriculum had failed to improve the standard of
education.
However, the survey of more than 4,000 members of the union, the second
biggest teachers' union, found 60 per cent were in favour of a small core of
compulsory subjects with the remainder determined by schools.
Some 53 per cent were in favour of the principle of a national curriculum,
while 65 per cent said the existing one did not extend pupils' abilities,
and 61 per cent thought it had failed to improve the standard of education
in their school.
Nearly three-quarters said their job had become a lot more stressful, with
the main source of dissatisfaction being the extra workload created by
testing, assessment and the general increase in administration the
curriculum has caused.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, said the union 'wants the National
Curriculum to succeed, having supported the principle of a core curriculum
for over 20 years'.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Delay on Everton bids explained
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Tom Cannon, former director of Manchester Business School and a
principal figure in one of the two bids to run Everton Football Club,
yesterday said that the Cadbury report on corporate governance was one of
the main factors delaying a decision on the bids.
A choice between the bids was deferred by the club's board at the weekend to
another meeting on Friday. Both bids are understood to be worth between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 25m, spread over three to five years.
Neither would buy majority control, which is likely to remain in the hands
of the family of Sir John Moores, the founder of football pools and
Littlewoods, who died in September.
Prof Cannon said 'Cadbury considerations' had made the board hesitate as it
was about to award victory to a consortium headed by Mr Bill Kenwright, the
theatrical impresario who is already an Everton director.
This followed an eleventh-hour telephone call from Mr Peter Johnson,
chairman of the Birkenhead-based Park Food Group and Tranmere Rovers
Football Club, offering to bid more.
Prof Cannon, a member of the Kenwright consortium, said the two bids were
'virtually' the same in terms of overall commitment. An initial Pounds 7m is
needed to clear debts of Pounds 3m and to buy new players, but steady annual
investment would be essential to rebuild the club's prospects.
The final decision will rest with Everton's shareholders. More than half of
the 2,500 shares are owned or controlled by the Moores family.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Business failures drop by 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies and business partnerships becoming insolvent fell by
18 per cent in 1993 from 27,150 to 22,116, providing further evidence of
economic recovery, Richard Lapper writes.
Figures produced by the Austintel Information Group show that the number of
receiverships fell by 37 per cent to 2,900, while the number of voluntary
liquidations fell by 14 per cent from 13,000 to under 11,150.
Austintel obtains its information by attending London High Court and
District Registry Court hearings, as well as by maintaining contact with all
courts with bankruptcy jurisdiction in England and Wales.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, reported last week that
the number of business failures had fallen for the first time since 1988,
with the biggest falls in London, Wales and the east Midlands.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Labour attacks tax rises as threat to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday that Britain's economic
recovery is likely to be hampered by tax increases due to take effect later
this year.
Mr Smith welcomed signs of 'modest' economic growth but he said forecasts
that the growth would accelerate failed to take account of the impact of tax
rises.
Mr Smith's comments signal the beginning of a new year opposition offensive
against the government's taxation policy, which Labour claims is 'unfair' to
the less well-off.
Labour leaders believe that the government is vulnerable to claims that both
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, broke election promises not to increase taxes.
Mr Smith said: 'The Tories told us they would not increase taxes. They have
flagrantly broken this promise in the two Budgets of 1993 and the price is
going to have to be paid in 1994.
'They are huge increases, the biggest increases in British peacetime history
 -and this from a party that won the election in 1992 on the claims that it
would be a low-tax party.'
Mr Smith said that average families would face tax increases of Pounds 10 a
week from April and Pounds 16 a week from next year - equivalent to 7p on
income tax.
Public-sector workers would also face a pay freeze, amounting to an
effective cut in living standards and further draining demand from the
economy.
'I doubt very much if the impact of these tax increases has fully been taken
account of in some of the economic predictions which, of course, are pretty
varied,' he said.
Mr Smith urged the government to put the unemployed back to work by tackling
'the real problems' facing the economy - lack of investment, regional
development, skills and housing.
He urged the government to stimulate demand by allowing local authorities to
spend accumulated capital receipts. 'That would get people back to work and
would contribute to a virtuous recovery in the economy,' he said.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Purchasing managers upbeat about economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing expansion in manufacturing activity is confirmed by one of the
year's first economic indicators from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
&amp; Supply today.
The institute's purchasing managers' index - which measures items including
output, new orders and delivery times - showed an increase in the rate of
manufacturing expansion for the third successive month. It stood at 54.6
last month, compared with 54.2 in November and 53.6 in October.
The institute's new orders index rose from 55.8 to 57.8 between November and
December reflecting, it says, sharp improvement in demand.
The south-east and East Anglia, which the analysis suggests suffered poor
growth between July and October, recorded the highest increase in new orders
last month.
Upward pressure on price levels remained relatively subdued in December,
according to the institute, which says its prices index rose to 51.5 in
November from 50.2, largely because of higher steel prices. Employment
levels were broadly unchanged, with equal numbers of companies recruiting
and shedding staff.
Two other reports published today predict relatively strong growth for the
economy this year. James Capel, the finance house, forecasts in its UK
Economics report that a modest acceleration in activity this year will
produce a 3 per cent increase in gross domestic product - the fastest growth
rate since 1988 - and similar growth next year.
Inflation is likely to remain very subdued in spite of the strengthening
recovery this year, the report suggests. It expects underlying inflation to
hover around 2.25 per cent for most of the year. It also predicts that base
rates will be cut to 4.5 per cent by the end of the first quarter.
Ernst &amp; Young's Item Club, in its forecast based on the Treasury model,
expects the economy to expand by an annual 2.5 per cent this year and next.
It warns that there is a risk of greater caution by consumers. It also warns
that a prolonged period of stagnation in continental Europe could reduce the
strength of recovery in the UK.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Shift work 'leads to health problems'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many shiftworkers suffer sleeping and eating problems, the British
Psychological Society's occupational conference was told, Richard Donkin
writes.
A report by Mr Alexander Wedderburn of the department of business
organisation at Heriot-Watt Business School, Edinburgh, found that only the
hardiest of workers could easily tolerate shift work.
The study also found that some groups of workers were reluctant to adopt
eating and drinking habits that might improve their health. Shiftworkers,
who comprise one in eight of the working population, suffer more digestive
problems than day workers.
Mr Wedderburn said there were insufficient guidelines to help with the
problems.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Analysts predict PSBR will fall to Pounds 37bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and KEITH FRAY, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's decision to raise taxes and cut public spending has led to
sharp revisions in the forecasts of 39 analysts surveyed by the FT last
month.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's measures, announced in the Budget, have convinced
economists from the City, academia and independent think tanks, that the
public-sector borrowing requirement will drop to about Pounds 37bn this
financial year and Pounds 30bn in the next. In the last FT survey, in the
spring, forecasters believed the PSBR would be Pounds 42.5bn in this
financial year.
Economists are sharply divided over what Mr Clarke's tactics will do to the
recovery, particularly in the spring when tax increases are introduced.
Mr Robin Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon, who has the highest forecast for
unemployment both this year and next, said: 'The Budget will stop it (the
recovery) dead in its tracks.'
Mr Gerard Lyons at DKB takes a similarly gloomy view. 'The Budget was too
tough,' he said. 'In view of the weak international environment I thought
the Budget was very risky, the biggest risk being that the savings ratio
remains high and consumer spending is weaker than the Treasury expects.'
Others are less downbeat. Mr Michael Saunders, of Salomon Brothers, said:
'The Budget will not have a dampening effect on growth, provided it is
offset by a long period of low interest rates.'
The state of the housing market also prompts contrasting views. Mr Alan
Davies, of Barclays Bank, said: 'The housing market recovery should
definitely gather momentum, boosted by pent-up demand, the fact that
affordability is at its lowest for several decades and the widespread
availability of fixed-rate mortgages.'
But Mr Richard Freeman and Mr David Thomas, of ICI, said that the slow
growth of real incomes and further cuts in mortgage interest tax relief
would 'retard any recovery' in the housing market.
Mr James Barty, of Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The housing market will not surge
in 1994. It is closely linked to real incomes and these will be squeezed.'
The vulnerability of the economy, according to many of those surveyed, is on
the consumer side. Mr Richard Jeffrey, of Charterhouse Tilney, said: 'The
most important figures to watch will be the monthly retail sales figures.
Should they begin to falter towards mid-1994, it will be a warning that the
recovery, itself, is under threat.'
Mr Peter Warburton, of Robert Fleming, who has the lowest forecasts for
consumer spending both this year and next, said: 'This Budget contains
little encouragement for employers to increase labour use or for households
to borrow more confidently. If neither employment nor credit growth has
revived in six months' time, then Mr Clarke will rue his single-minded
Budget.'
One surprise in the Budget was the Treasury's forecast for the current
account this year. It predicted that the deficit on the current account
would be Pounds 9.5bn this year, roughly half the deficit it was forecasting
in March. Many of the economists have followed suit, although the consensus
for this year is some Pounds 3bn higher than the official forecast.
Cambridge Econometrics, which has one of the lowest deficit forecasts for
this year and 1995 - Pounds 5.2bn and Pounds 1.8bn - expects a big
improvement in earnings from interest, profits and dividends. Indeed, a
sharp improvement in invisible earnings appears to be the assumption behind
most of the more optimistic forecasts for the current account.
But Mr Neil MacKinnon at Citibank said: 'Normally economic recovery is
associated with a widening trade gap. I see no reason to believe that the
balance of payments constraint has become a thing of the past.'
Both this year and next year, the consensus forecast for underlying
inflation - retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments -
falls within the government's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
In line with the generally benign inflation forecasts, most of the
economists surveyed believe average earnings growth will remain subdued.
Average earnings - currently rising at a rate of 3 per cent - are forecast
to be growing by 3.9 per cent at the end of this year and 4.7 per cent by
the end of next.
Optimism here reflects pessimism on the jobs front. Even though unemployment
is falling, most economists clearly believe that the growth forecast for the
next two years will not be enough to make a significant dent in today's high
levels. Mr Peter Dixon, of DRI Europe, said: 'In 1994, better prospects
should lead to a pick-up in employment growth, but this will be constrained
by the need to restore margins.'
Mr David Kern, of National Westminster Bank, expects unemployment to fall to
2.5m by the end of 1995 and to remain above 2.2m during the remainder of
this decade.
Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, who would normally have
contributed to the survey, was unable to take part because of work
commitments in the US.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Wind 'could power 250,000 homes'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wind farms could generate enough electricity to power 250,000 homes this
year, a report from the British Wind Energy Association says.
Its survey found that last year wind energy provided sufficient energy to
power around 150,000 homes - equivalent to a town the size of Brighton.

FT  04 JAN 94 / BP oil finds may yield 1bn barrels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum is involved in two new discoveries in Colombia and the
North Sea which could produce up to 1bn barrels of oil between them.
The company has just acquired a 54 per cent stake in the Recetor acreage, in
Colombia's eastern Andes, from Maxus, a US company that discovered gas and
gas condensate when it drilled a well there late last year. The gas find
suggests the presence of oil and, according to estimates in Colombia, the
Volcanero well may contain up to 500m barrels of oil.
BP carried out the initial seismic survey of the acreage for Maxus and
started with a 10 per cent stake.
The Recetor field lies just south of Piedemonte, a 5,000 sq km block owned
by BP. The Volcanero find is believed to extend into Piedemonte, although
limited early drilling elsewhere in the block has as yet found nothing.
In the second of the two discoveries, BP's explorations between the Orkney
and Shetland islands have produced a second find which could equal the 250m
to 500m barrels estimated for its first discovery last March.
The two wells are in blocks acquired with the purchase of Britoil in 1988.
The area has been described by the government as a possible 'new province'
of the North Sea.
BP has an 80 per cent share in the first discovery and Shell 20 per cent,
while the two groups have 50 per cent each of the latest find.
The two also have 50 per cent each of five blocks awarded by the government
last summer to encourage exploration in the area.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Services seen as main job creators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employment growth will become more firmly established in 1994 and 1995, with
private-sector services leading the way, a report predicts today.
Cambridge Econometrics says in its latest Industry and the British Economy
report, that 206,000 jobs will be created in private-sector services in the
period. Much of the growth will come in business and miscellaneous services
 -including estate agents, recruitment, security, recreation, media,
dry-cleaning and hairdressing - which will produce an expected 141,000 jobs.
Professional services, among them accountancy, legal, architecture and
advertising, should contribute another 40,000, and hotels and catering
37,000.
In spite of these new jobs, the report warns that structural unemployment
will persist. It expects unemployment to still be 2.4m by the turn of the
century, and 2.2m by 2005.
The report expects the jobs growth in many service activities to be offset
by losses in transport, communications and the public sector. Many of the
new jobs will be in sectors characterised by a high ratio of part-time,
self-employed and female workers, while full-time, predominantly male jobs
will continue to disappear in manufacturing. Cambridge Econometrics expects
that another 68,000 manufacturing jobs will be lost by 1995.
GDP growth will, the report expects, strengthen from 2.1 per cent in 1993 to
2.6 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1995. Growth this year will be
led by an upturn in investment spending, slightly stronger growth in
consumer expenditure and a continued positive contribution from net trade.

FT  04 JAN 94 / BT claims training saves Pounds 227m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has calculated that Pounds 7m spent on training
junior managers saves it Pounds 227m a year.
Two occupational specialists at BT have conducted what they say is one of
the first projects to quantify the savings achieved by training.
Mr Keith Coley, manager of competency, development and applications, and Mr
Geoff Lee, manager of management development processes, carried out a
three-year training evaluation which discovered that mistakes made by 159
junior managers cost the company Pounds 2m.
They said that a similar level of mistakes by the whole area of junior
management would have cost more than Pounds 227m.
In a report to the British Psychological Society annual occupational
psychology conference in Birmingham yesterday, the specialists said that
in-house training courses had raised performance to a level that earned the
company a further Pounds 71m on top of that which it would have lost through
poor performance.
Mr Coley said: 'At the time that we started this study we found no method
available which gave us a financial approach to the development of
training.' The formula they applied, they said, satisfied the company's
accountants.
The researchers said they assessed the direct costs of mistakes, the time
taken to rectify them, the indirect costs of time wasted and the costs of
loss of business. These were balanced against the added value of training
and its cost.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Portillo leads race for Tory chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, emerged
yesterday as a leading candidate to replace Sir Norman Fowler as chairman of
the Conservative party.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is understood to be considering four
candidates to replace Sir Norman when he stands down in the summer.
Mr Major would like the job to go to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, who is regarded as the government's best communicator,
in spite of a heart attack last year.
However, Mr Heseltine has told friends he is not interested in the job. He
wants to continue at trade and industry at least until the next elec-tion.
Mr Major's second choice is Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who is
a leading cabinet standard-bearer for the Conservative left. But Mr Hunt has
also let it be known that he would rather remain in a departmental post.
The reluctance of the two frontrunners leaves the field to Mr Portillo and
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, who is seen as attractive to
women voters. Lord Archer, the novelist and former deputy party chairman,
would like the job, but is regarded as an outside candidate.
Mr Major has given Mr Portillo an opportunity to display his organisational
skills by putting him in charge of the Conservative campaigns in London and
the south-east for this year's local and European elections.
The government expects to be trounced in both elections. But the polls will
allow Mr Portillo to raise his public profile and demonstrate his
campaigning ability.
A better-than-expected result would provide a sound platform for promotion
to the party chairmanship, seen as a key role in the run-up to a general
election.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Operators braced for Channel price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first shots in the long-awaited battle for the lucrative cross-Channel
travel market will be fired next week when Eurotunnel announces its fares
structure for the Channel tunnel.
The tunnel opens in May and its operator is expected to offer return tickets
for about Pounds 160 a car in the off-season. This is expected to rise to
between Pounds 220 and Pounds 260 in the summer with premiums for busy
weekends.
Eurotunnel yesterday refused to comment on the prices for using the Pounds
10bn tunnel, describing the figures as 'pure speculation', but the company
was expected to price its service competitively in an attempt to lure
passengers away from the ferry companies. The Channel ferries carry about
18m passengers each year.
The fares structure will be announced by Sir Alistair Morton, Eurotunnel's
chief executive, on January 11. Tickets will go on sale the next day.
The ferry companies, which have already announced reduced prices for 1994,
are expected to offer further incentives to passengers once the cost of
using the tunnel becomes clear.
P&amp;O European Ferries said yesterday that the speculation about tunnel prices
was in line with what it had been predicting - fares comparable with ferry
charges plus a small premium for speed. The shuttle service will take about
30 minutes to travel between terminals at Folkestone, Kent, and Sangatte
near Calais.
A car and up to nine passengers travelling with P&amp;O, and returning within
five days on the Dover to Calais route, costs between Pounds 77 in the low
season and Pounds 160 at the height of summer. A standard return of six days
and over costs between Pounds 139 and Pounds 289.
Stena Sealink said it would review its prices after the Eurotunnel
announcement.
Sally Line, which operates between Ramsgate and Dunkirk, appeared
unconcerned by the threat from the tunnel. The company said yesterday it
concentrated on the 'family leisure-traveller, not the businessman, which is
what the Channel tunnel is all about'.
It said it had never engaged in price wars with other ferry companies and
was not attempting to compete on speed. Its niche in the market was a
two-and-a-half-hour leisurely crossing with on-board facilities such as a
creche.
In common with the other ferry companies Sally Line has just begun its
traditional post-Christmas discounts enabling foot passengers to travel for
Pounds 1 and offering a day-trip fare for a car and up to five passengers of
Pounds 16.
It has also launched a ski-drive package allowing a car and up to five
people to travel for Pounds 139. The ferry companies believe heavy discounts
and incentive schemes such as this will enable them to retain a large share
of the market.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Travel industry predicts record holiday sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travel agents have reported brisk sales of holidays following the
introduction of price discounts after Christmas, saying yesterday that
business increased faster than originally reported.
Lunn Poly, one of the three largest chains, said it sold 120,000 holidays
last week. This accounted for just under half the total sold by travel
agents, it estimated, and compared with the 112,000 holidays Lunn Poly sold
in the same period a year ago, it said. Of the bookings, 30,000 were for
winter holidays and 90,000 for summer ones.
'We sold 20,000 on the first day, compared with 12,000 on the same day last
year when we had a 10 per cent discount,' said Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle,
marketing director.
The 11 per cent price discounts came into effect on December 27.
Mr Bowden-Doyle said there have been record bookings for the whole industry
of about 2m package holidays for this summer since brochures came out in
August. That compared with under 1.5m at the same stage last year.
The top three travel agency chains - Lunn Poly, Going Places and Thomas Cook
 -have extended the discount period, due to end yesterday, until the close
of business next Saturday, and Lunn Poly yesterday said it would offer
further savings on winter holidays booked until Saturday.
'The market is up because people have a little bit more confidence about
their future,' said Mr Keith Betton of the Association of British Travel
Agents. He suggested that sales overall last week could be considerably
higher than 250,000.
However, he emphasised that two bouts of discounting last autumn and over
Christmas had simply encouraged people to buy earlier and that sales levels
were unlikely to be sustained. Although this year would produce a third
consecutive record for package holidays, with sales likely to reach 13.5m to
14m, this would be up only 5 per cent to 10 per cent on last year, Mr Betton
said.
Initial figures from the industry last week indicated little overall
increase resulting from the winter price war compared with the same period a
year ago. But yesterday Thomas Cook said it had sold about 50,000 holidays
in the past week, 'slightly higher than last year'.
Mr Betton said that small independent travel agents appeared to be surviving
in spite of the battle for market share between the leading travel agents.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Auditors wanted to stay at BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernst &amp; Whinney, the accountancy firm that is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, was
willing to continue as auditor to Bank of Credit and Commerce International
in 1987, according to documents obtained by the Financial Times.
Many had believed that the firm resigned from its work for BCCI, which was
closed by banking regulators in July 1991. Ernst &amp; Whinney, however, wrote
to BCCI on April 15 1987 saying it was 'entirely willing' to continue, as
long as it could audit all of the group's principal companies.
The Ernst &amp; Whinney letter appears to modify the stance taken by the firm
just two days earlier, when it expressed concerns over financial and
managerial controls as well as over its restricted involvement in the audit
of subsidiaries.
The details emerge as both Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse prepare their
defences against legal actions estimated to total Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.4bn)
brought by the liquidators to BCCI for allegedly failing to detect fraud
within the bank.
The latest estimates suggest that there was a 'black hole' of untraced
assets in BCCI totalling Dollars 12.4bn at the time of its closure. Most of
that went on supporting bad loans and internal treasury losses, or simply
never existed.
The two firms shared the audits of the main operating companies and
subsidiaries to the bank until the 1986 financial year, with Ernst &amp; Whinney
as group auditor but PW responsible for some audits.
BCCI's board considered both PW and Ernst &amp; Whinney for the sole worldwide
audit, but chose PW at a meeting at the end of April 1987 just after the two
letters were sent.
The letters are addressed to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief operating officer
of the bank, who is being tried in both criminal and civil actions in Abu
Dhabi, which became the BCCI majority shareholder.
A letter in May 1986 highlights Ernst &amp; Whinney's concerns over inadequate
financial controls, limited accountability and excessive control in too few
senior managers' hands.
The firm said it was willing to audit the 1986 accounts but would refuse to
be reappointed for 1987 if the management changes were not made.
In spite of some subsequent improvements, the letter of April 13 1987 says
the concerns remain and it looks forward to seeing strengthening management
resources and improvements in board reporting.
But two days later Ernst &amp; Whinney said it did not 'wish to make any
conditions' on 'future aspects of management and reporting to the board' in
accepting reappointment for 1987. Its only proviso was to resolve 'the
problem of group audit coverage'.
Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, confirmed yesterday that
the firm did not resign from the audit.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Tyre crisis swept under carpet: A recycling joint venture
that tackles part but not all of a scrap mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A collaborative venture between a subsidiary of BBA, the motor components
and engineering group, and Colway Tyres, the UK's largest independent tyre
remoulder, is turning 3m scrap tyres a year into carpet underlay.
The venture represents one of the latest ways of dealing with the mountains
of discarded tyres now regarded as a major environmental problem.
About 25m tyres are discarded each year in the UK and about 250m a year in
western Europe. With serious attempts at recycling only just starting to
gain momentum, several hundred million tyres have collected throughout the
countryside.
One large dump of tyres in Wales is still burning after eight years, all
attempts to extinguish it having failed. Even without fire, pollutants leech
from the tyres, poisoning soil and endangering waterways.
The BBA-Colway venture has involved building a tyre-shredding and storage
facility next to Colway's remoulding plant on the outskirts of Durham, which
produces more than 1m tyres a year and employs about 250 people.
Four million discarded tyres a year are collected from distributors and
retail outlets. Only about a quarter are fit for remoulding and the
remainder are shredded, with the resultant rubber 'crumb' being collected in
large silos.
It is transported to Duralay, BBA's wholly owned subsidiary at Rossendale,
Lancashire, where it is made into underlay. Steel cords reclaimed from the
tyres are sent for recycling separately.
Finding new ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding 'has
become part of our corporate strategy', says Mr Bob Bonomy, managing
director of Colway. The partners stress that underlay can only be a small
part of the recycling solution to the problem of scrap tyres.
Research commissioned from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand has identified the
inclusion of rubber crumb in asphalt as one potentially major way of dealing
with the problem. Inclusion of about 15 per cent crumb in road construction
would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years, the research
says.
'But the bad news is that, as things stand, the cost of the asphalt rises by
50 per cent to 100 per cent so the actual payback is marginal,' said Mr
Bonomy.
However, the picture might improve if Europe were to follow the example in
some states of the US. There it has become law to use crumb to improve
drainage and skid resistance.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Half of exporters 'fail to gain from single market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of British exporters have failed to reap any benefit from the
European single market says KPMG, the accountancy firm.
A survey of 6,400 companies found that almost 50 per cent of respondents
felt they had not received any benefits from completion of the single market
on January 1 last year.
Any benefits that companies might have received had been wiped out by
increased bureaucracy, the firm reported yesterday.
Mr George Michie, a partner with KPMG Tax Advisers, said: 'The aim of the
single market was to foster more efficient trade through the abolition of
fiscal and physical barriers.
'These benefits seem not to have yielded any marked improvement for
companies and indeed savings in time and money were reported as negligible.'
The survey found that deliveries were neither faster nor cheaper. More than
50 per cent of companies said cross-border delivery times had not improved.
Only 19 per cent had experienced quicker deliveries, and of those, 56 per
cent said no savings had been made.
Companies had also experienced problems with red tape in dealing with other
member states.
In particular there were difficulties in obtaining numbers for value added
tax and in coping with paperwork.
The survey found that manufacturers and wholesalers bought more goods from
Germany and France than from any other member country. Retailers reported
that they dealt mostly with Italy, France and Spain.
Mr Michie said UK Customs and Excise had done its best to educate and advise
businesses on how to cope with the single market regulations, but it was
clear that the rules were still too complicated.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Private bill-drafters urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parliament should consider employing private-sector lawyers to help draft
bills rather than relying on Whitehall, a report published today by a
leading think tank urges.
The report, written by Mr Graham Mather, head of the cross-party European
Policy Forum, attacks the current system under which the government mostly
relies on the expertise of 26 government parliamentary lawyers.
Mr Mather believes that these lawyers are indulging in 'monkish seclusion
and restrictive practices'.
According to Mr Mather, a number of recent pieces of legislation have been
ill-thought-through and required significant early amendment. These included
the Dangerous Dogs Act, the Criminal Justice Act and the Child Support Act.
He also cites research by Lord Howe showing that by the end of the 1980s the
government was tabling an average of 2,668 amendments to its own bills in
the House of Lords in each parliamentary session.
Mr Mather says that the use of private-sector barristers, solicitors and
other specialists would widen the range of drafting talent available to
Whitehall departments and speed up the parliamentary process.
'Because they are not inured to some of the bad habits of governmental
practice, they would be more likely to insist on reasonable timetables and
proper consultation,' says Mr Mather. 'It would more clearly be in their
interests to draft legislation earlier.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / Unions attack utility chiefs' pay increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions yesterday attacked pay rises averaging more than 10 per cent for
senior executives of privatised utility companies last year.
Salary increases for the highest-paid directors of the privatised water, gas
and electricity companies averaged 13.9 per cent in the year to March 31
1993, but lower bonus payments pulled down the average increase to 10.8 per
cent, says Incomes Data Services, the independent research organisation.
Inflation was 3.5 per cent over the period.
The Trades Union Congress said yesterday that the increases would fuel the
growing sense of unfairness felt by public-sector workers.
The TUC estimates that the government's freeze of public-sector pay combined
with April's tax increases will result in public-sector workers facing cuts
of 6 per cent in living standards this year. Its figures assume a zero
increase in pay, a loss of 2.75p in the pound as a result of the tax
increases in last year's two budgets and a 3.35p loss because of inflation.
The January issue of the IDS Management Pay Review bases its findings on the
latest annual reports of the 10 water companies, 16 electricity companies
and British Gas.
The review says almost all the utility companies are largely complying with
the Cadbury committee's recommendations by separating salary and bonus
information for their top directors in annual reports.
IDS says pay growth was fastest in the water sector, where salary increases
for the highest-paid directors averaged 16.4 per cent. Total earnings rises
averaged 16.9 per cent.
In the electricity companies, salary increases for top executives averaged
12.7 per cent and the increase in total earnings averaged 8.1 per cent.
There were large variations in the figures. The highest-paid director at
Anglian Water had a 52 per cent rise in his total remuneration. In the year
to April last year he received a total package of Pounds 163,000 compared
with Pounds 107,000 in the previous 12 months.
However, a number of top directors saw their overall earnings fall. At
British Gas, the total package of Mr Robert Evans, the chairman, fell by
12.8 per cent. The main reason for this was that he relinquished his role as
chief executive and therefore received no bonus for the year.
Utility executive earnings are still nearly a fifth below the average of
directors of equivalently-sized private-sector firms.

<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government yesterday published proposals for the reconstituted
Airport Corporation, reducing the powers of the body responsible for
developing and operating Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
The White Paper outlines controls aimed at making the reconstituted body
more accountable to the government, in a move seen as seeking to appease
China. Beijing was concerned that the previous body - the Provisional
Airport Authority - had too much autonomy.
Mr Gordon Siu, secretary for economic services, said the bill provided for
monitoring and controlling the work of the organisation in areas such as
strategy, provision of information and financing and investment.
He said further checks existed outside present proposals restricting the way
the corporation exercises its powers, uses public money and discharges its
international obligations.
Progress on the HKDollars 22.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) airport - which was agreed
in a memorandum of understanding signed by the Chinese prime minister, Mr Li
Peng, and his British counterpart, Mr John Major in 1991 - has been
scuppered by a deadlock over the financing arrangements.
China has rejected financial packages put forward by the Hong Kong
government on the grounds that they will leave a financial burden on the
post-1997 government. Any financing for such a big project would straddle
1997, when the colony reverts to China.
The draft legislation published yesterday turns the Provisional Airport
Authority into a corporation, to be run along the same lines as the
government-owned Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC), which also started
life as an authority.
The government hopes to have the bill before the Legislative Council before
the summer recess in July. A public consultation period stretches through to
February 28, after which the bill will be discussed with the Chinese side
and, if necessary, redrafted.
The Chinese yuan, which was in effect devalued by 33 per cent on Saturday
after the government abolished the official exchange rate, yesterday closed
virtually unchanged from Friday at 8.71 to the US dollar on the Shanghai
market.

<TEXT>
Fighters loyal to the president of Afghanistan, besieged by a broad new
anti-government alliance, yesterday attacked rivals in several parts of the
country, including the capital, Kabul, Steve LeVine writes from Tashkent.
President Berhanuddin Rabbani appeared increasingly isolated and powerless
to end the fighting that has consumed the country for almost 15 years. Last
night Iran called for a truce so that the injured could be evacuated from
Kabul. Dozens were reported killed and more than 800 wounded in the city
from rocketing and machine-gun fire in the past three days. About 70 were
said to be injured in the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif, where the UN
responded yesterday by evacuating half its international staff of about 15
people.
One western diplomat called the new round of fighting a 'three-way civil
war', pitting Mr Rabbani against forces loyal to the prime minister, Mr
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the powerful northern Uzbek warlord, Mr Rashid
Dostum. Combatants line up along ethnic lines, with Mr Rabbani's tribal
Tajiks opposed by nearly every other Afghan nationality.
The three-way battle stems from the chaos that enveloped Afghanistan
following the fall in April 1992 of Moscow-backed President Najibullah.
Fighters loyal to Mr Rabbani took control of the capital, but Mr Dostum also
demanded power, since his defection as Mr Najibullah's general triggered the
government's demise. But Mr Hekmatyar, with huge caches of US-made weaponry,
has insisted on a share of power.

<TEXT>
The US and North Korea might be able to complete a deal on the inspection of
North Korean nuclear sites as early as this week, but further talks are
still expected to be needed before agreement can be reached.
The White House and the State Department said in official briefings that
progress had been made in talks between the two countries, and that further
announcements could be made soon.
'Certainly our dialogue has made some progress and we expect to continue our
discussions with North Korea,' said Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department
spokesman.
But a senior official later told news agency reporters that agreement could
come this week. The official appeared to imply that a deal might include
only a single inspection of seven officially declared North Korean nuclear
sites, leaving aside for the time being two sites holding reprocessed
nuclear fuel residues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's demand last February to inspect the
two nuclear waste sites provoked North Korea's threat to withdraw from the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

The main players in the Mideast peace process have passed the point of no
return, British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd said last night as he arrived
in Israel on the second leg of a regional tour, Reuter reports from Tel
Aviv.
In Tunis yesterday Palestine Liberation Organisation leaders rejected
conditions set by Israel for resuming talks on implementing their self-rule
accord. Mr Hurd, who today will meet prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and
foreign minister Shimon Peres, said: 'Going forward, though difficult, is
easier than going back.'
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition chief Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to reverse
an earlier pledge when he said in Jerusalem that his Likud party would not
be bound by the Israeli-PLO peace deal if it came to power.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Japanese Press Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a Japanese news-stand, the high-minded morning dailies are stored in neat
rolls at the front, and the comic books, more for the office worker than the
schoolboy, are tucked away on the lower shelves.
Within easy reach on the counter are the most important sources of
information, the weekly news magazines, where the Bank of Japan governor,
the wayward soccer player and the ambitious politician get equal,
unflattering treatment.
The morning newspapers have a sameness ensured by clubby journalists and
cartel-style reporting, but the weekly magazines generally see their role as
the pursuit of the scoop and the scandal. A few of the dozen mainstream
publications have serious coverage of the sensational or sensational
coverage of the serious, while the less restrained magazines launch
no-holds-barred assaults on public figures, icons included, who have taken a
bribe or been unfaithful or simply slipped over within range of a camera
lens.
It is coverage unflattering to the end. Last week's crop marked the passing
of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister and godfather of the Liberal
Democratic party. Focus magazine (circulation 600,000) sifted through the
archives to find a series of pictures showing the great man hugging
hostesses after an evening of relaxation at a favourite bar.
But the same edition also provides an accessible introduction to the erratic
thoughts of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Russian version of a Liberal
Democratic party. Nearby are photographs of actresses, animals, and
accidents; and in a society restrained by deference to the long-term
relationship, there are few relationships not worth rupturing for the sake
of a garish headline or a mocking caption.
Several weeklies are the alter ego of the serious dailies, run by the same
company but filled with the news not fit for them to print. The Weekly
Yomiuri maintained the Yomiuri newspaper group's sympathy towards Mr Tanaka
by opening the magazine with a pin-up portrait and a short but positive
review of his career. Words are kept to a minimum, as most readers have
waded through newspaper obituaries before reaching for their weekly.
Mr Tanaka's resignation as prime minister in 1974 followed magazine articles
about his personal finances and fund-raising methods. Newspaper reporters
were aware of the unseemly deals done to finance the Tanaka empire, but none
was willing to compromise the relationship by writing the story, fearing
that privileged access would be denied them and their newspaper.
Readers are apparently attracted by the magazines' sudden shifts in mood,
one page smut and the next page a Socialist politician petting his poodle.
The deeply downmarket Friday, the offspring of an academic book publisher,
in its 'Ahh, that person, that question' section asks whether Mr Yasushi
Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, should be paid an annual bonus for
allegedly causing the recession.
Mr Mieno, who has clearly done his best to avoid recession, also appears in
the Weekly Post, where commercial bankers and bureaucrats complain that his
puritanical streak is bad for equity prices. The negative coverage of Mr
Mieno reflects the willingness of the weeklies to print unsubstantiated
sniping, and the inability of the Bank of Japan to handle journalists other
than banking writers conscious of their own reputation.
Publishers are aware that a good reputation and a solid repertoire don't
necessarily work for a weekly. The left-leaning Asahi Journal closed in
1992, when circulation had fallen to 60,000, less than a quarter of its
peak, as readers tired of its well-meaning coverage of important issues. The
Asahi newspaper group still has the Weekly Asahi and Aera, which had a
worthy lead article last week on the costs of a government-sponsored rice
cartel and corporate survival tactics for a recession, but also wondered why
the country's best known golfer went weak at the knees on the final day of a
tournament.
The group dips a little downmarket with the semi-serious Weekly Asahi,
strong on political coverage, but with a starlet on the cover last week, six
pages of Japanese dog photographs and a feature on a dog's life in Belgium.
Its favourite political target (meaning that the rolls of film are carefully
studied for an unflattering angle) is Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the powerbroker who
defected from the LDP to pull together the coalition government.
Asahi magazines tend to sidestep the lewd, but Shukan Shincho manages to
blend the high-brow with the low-cut by running a pictorial investigation of
trends in the international pornography industry, adjacent to a poetic study
of the cherry blossom and the Tanaka funeral as told by photography. The
serious writing starts on page 22 with a well-researched report on the
battle between the bureaucracy and the coalition government, while the rest
of the cast includes IBM, a professional wrestler's heartthrob, Salman
Rushdie, Japan's entrant in the Miss Universe contest, and Chairman Mao
Zedong.

PLO leaders yesterday rejected conditions set by Israel for the resumption

'We reject the Israeli diktat and we wait for Israel's response to our

said.
'They (the Israelis) are responsible for the halt in negotiations,' he said
after an executive committee meeting chaired by Mr Yassir Arafat.
The two sides had hoped to meet in Taba, Egypt, today to thrash out issues
holding up the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank town of Jericho. Under the September peace accord Israel was
to have started its withdrawal on December 13.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Saudis to cut government spending 20%: Budget proposals
aimed at ending long period of pressure on currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia's promise to cut government spending by 20 per cent in 1994 has
eased pressure on the riyal and prompted a 1.5 percentage point fall in
interbank rates over the weekend.
The intended spending cut was the centrepiece of the kingdom's annual
budget, the outlines of which were unveiled at the weekend. It follows
several months of intensified international scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's
public finances, which have been in deficit for more than a decade but under
increased pressure with the recent softening of crude prices.
According to the budget statement, the government intends almost to balance
its books in 1994, with expenditure estimated at SR160bn (Pounds 28.7bn) and
revenues, mainly from oil sales, at SR155.6bn - a figure economists in
Riyadh said implied a price of Dollars 15 a barrel for Saudi Arabia's main
export crude and sustained output at present levels of 8m barrels a day.
The 1994 figures compare with a budgeted deficit in 1993 of SR27.8bn and
spending of SR196.5bn. However, the government has not published actual
figures for last year's overall revenues or expenditure, leaving the true
scale of the Saudi budget deficit a matter of conjecture. Some local
economists believe the easing of the oil price last year may have left a gap
as large as Dollars 15bn, while none believes the government to have met its
budgeted target.
Few other details of the 1994 budget were given at the weekend. There is, in
particular, no indication of how or where government spending cuts are to be
made, although the Saudi Press Agency said the king had banned the signing
of any new contracts which would add to spending in 1994.
King Fahd clearly hoped the announcement of intended spending cuts would end
pressure which has dogged the riyal over the past few months, while
banishing rumours of a possible devaluation.
The king told the council of ministers on January 1 he was determined to
maintain the riyal's present value. But while bankers and economists said
yesterday that pressure had eased on the Saudi currency, many expressed
caution before the London and New York financial markets returned to work
fully today.
Meanwhile, neighbouring Oman said it intended making a 10 per cent cut in
expenditure for 1994 over last year in its new year budget. The budget puts
spending at RO2bn (Pounds 3.5bn), of which 30 per cent is to on defence.
Revenue is estimated at RO1.7bn, leaving a deficit of RO301m.
Mr Qais Al Zawawi, deputy prime minister for financial and economic affairs,
said actual 1993 expenditure was Dollars 5.84bn (Pounds 3.94bn) and revenue
Dollars 4.4bn, leaving a deficit of Dollars 1.4bn. The actual 1992 budget
deficit came to Dollars 1.5bn, according to the central bank.
The government has not so far indicated how it arrived at higher 1994
revenues, though officials have previously indicated the government's
intention to sell some state-owned assets, including the Sultanate's only
oil refinery and the telecommunications agency, to the private sector.
Previous budget deficits have been funded by drawing down reserves and more
recently by issuing government development bonds, for which there has been a
ready domestic market.
Oman last year reached record oil output of 800,000 barrels a day, 96 per
cent of it from the majority state-owned Petroleum Development Oman.
However, PDO cut output by 5 per cent on Sunday in an attempt to help shore
up world prices.

The draft legislation published yesterday turns the Provisional Airport
Authority into a corporation, to be run along the same lines as the
government-owned Mass Transit Railway Corporation, which also started life
as an authority.
Mr Siu said: 'This is a delicate balance to strike between commercial
freedom and accountability to government. We obviously cannot create a
government-owned corporation without controls, but neither can we fetter the
corporation to such an extent that it is unable to raise funds in
international markets, attract investors in airport facilities, and operate
commercially and flexibly.'
The government hopes to have the bill before the Legislative Council before
the summer recess in July. A public consultation period stretches through to
February 28, after which the bill will be discussed with the Chinese side
and, if necessary, redrafted.
The Chinese yuan, which was in effect devalued by 33 per cent on Saturday
after the government abolished the official exchange rate, yesterday closed
virtually unchanged from Friday at 8.71 to the US dollar on the Shanghai
market.
With the passing of the official rate, all currency transactions now take
place at what Beijing terms a floating rate, determined by supply and
demand. This is fixed daily by the central bank according, it says, to
market conditions. It was set at 8.7 to the dollar on Saturday. Transactions
are carried out through foreign exchange centres, of which Shanghai is much
the largest.
Transactions which would previously have taken place at the official rate -
some 20 per cent of total transactions, according to Chinese sources - would
have gone some way to boosting volumes, but Hong Kong economists reckoned
tight controls left little room for speculators.
Beijing's move to unify exchange rates took place ahead of sweeping reform
plans that will embrace trade and the financial and banking sector. Also
coming into effect this month is a revamped indirect taxation system, which
streamlines the old consolidated industrial and commercial tax into a
consumption tax, targeting luxury goods; value added tax; and business tax.
Economists in Hong Kong reckon China's central bank will retain strict
control to keep the yuan stable.

<TEXT>
Business organisations in Japan yesterday called for financial reforms to
ensure the long-term health of the economy, while a survey of executives
found most expected economic recovery late this year or early next year.
The Japan Association of Corporate Executives called for more competition
among financial institutions, echoing the Bank of Japan's advice that
stronger commercial banks should be prepared to break from the policy of
walking in line with weaker institutions. Business leaders have complained
that the lack of distinction between strong and weak banks means companies
lack choice in raising finance and industry standards are set by the weaker
institutions.
Meanwhile, the Federation of Economic Organisations said stability in the
financial system would be a necessary part of an economic recovery. The
federation was reflecting widespread concern about the mounting bad loans of
commercial banks, which helped to fuel the speculative property bubble of
the late 1980s.
A survey of executives at 100 leading companies found 61 expected recovery
late this year, while 22 others were looking for an upturn early next year.
Just over half the respondents to the survey by Kyodo, the Japanese news
agency, expected economic growth of between zero and 1 per cent in the
financial year beginning in April, though 13 predicted that there would be
no growth.

<TEXT>
Drugs with potential annual sales of hundreds of millions of dollars were
approved for sale in the US last week by the Food and Drug Administration.
Among companies whose products cleared the final hurdle are SmithKline
Beecham of the UK, Bayer of Germany and Genentech, the US biotechnology
company 60 per cent owned by Roche of Switzerland.
Success in the US market is essential to the fortunes of a new drug. The US
is easily the world's biggest drugs market, accounting for more than a third
of global sales.
Genentech's drug, DNase, is the first product in 30 years specifically
developed to treat cystic fibrosis, the inherited lung disease. It is not a
cure for the disease, but the FDA found that it made a significant
difference in the quality of life for sufferers.
DNase is likely to be one of the biggest selling products from biotechnology
companies. US stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimates sales at more than
Dollars 250m (Pounds 169m) a year.
SmithKline Beecham saw the approval of Kytril, to prevent nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer therapy. Kytril enters a rapidly growing and
lucrative market. However, it competes with Zofran, made by Glaxo, which not
only has a two-year head start in the US market but is available in an
easier-to-use tablet version.
Zofran already has sales of more than Pounds 300m a year and the tablet
version of Kytril is unlikely to be approved before 1995, said Mr Duncan
Moore, a pharmaceuticals analyst with US broker Morgan Stanley.
Bayer's newly approved drug is aprontonin, which can reduce the need for
blood transfusions in patients undergoing heart bypass surgery. Fewer
transfusions cut the chances of infection.
Other companies that saw approvals in the last days of 1993 were:
Bristol Myers of the US with Dovonex ointment, for the treatment of the skin
condition psoriasis;
Warner-Lambert, of the US, for Neurontin, an anti-epileptic;
Wyeth, of the US, for Effexor, a depression treatment;
US Bioscience for Neutrexin, an alternative therapy for pneumonia associated
with Aids;
Janssen, the Belgian subsidiary of US company Johnson &amp; Johnson, for
Risperdal, a psychosis drug.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Jordanian king hits at Arafat over peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
King Hussein of Jordan has attacked PLO chairman Yassir Arafat's handling of
the Middle East peace talks. In an outspoken statement the king said Mr
Arafat had one 'last chance' to sign an agreement on Jordan's economic role
during transitional Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories.
Otherwise, he said, Jordan would move ahead with its own separate talks with
Israel.
Displaying frustration at being left out of discussions between the
Palestinians and Israelis on limited self-rule, the king complained about Mr
Arafat's constant procrastinations during talks with Jordan. 'We cannot go
on saying there is co-ordination if there isn't or that there is agreement
when there is none,' he said.
The king's ultimatum came amid increasing Israeli dissatisfaction over the
stalled Cairo autonomy talks and within the PLO itself over Mr Arafat's
leadership style.
Senior PLO officials met yesterday in Tunis to try to persuade their
chairman to widen the decision-making process and come up with a coherent
strategy for talks with Israel and Jordan.
An economic agreement between Jordan and the PLO which would give Jordan's
central bank wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied
territories has been ready for months. But Mr Arafat has held back from
endorsing it for fear of relinquishing Palestinian fiscal responsibilities
to the Jordanians.
Jordan has already signed a memorandum with Israel to allow banks in Jordan
to reopen branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And Jordan's central
bank governor recently said the reopening of branches would now not depend
on the economic pact with the PLO.
The king also buried prospects of a Jordanian/Palestinian confederation,
arguing that the idea was premature. 'I have requested that my brother
(Arafat) drop the expression of confederation from his dictionary and not to
discuss it in any form or manner,' he said. The PLO has been at pains to
emphasis that the autonomy agreement with Israel will eventually lead to a
confederation between Jordan and a Palestinian entity and joint committees
had been established to discuss the issue.
Relations between the PLO and Jordan have been strained since the August
announcement of talks between the PLO and Israel in which Jordan played no
part.

<TEXT>
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, attempted yesterday to calm a
diplomatic row caused by his visit to guerrilla-held territory in southern
Sudan, saying he was willing to visit the north if he were guaranteed
freedom of movement by the Islamic government in Khartoum.
Sudan expelled the British ambassador last week after learning that Dr Carey
had cancelled his visit to the capital. Britain has threatened retaliation
unless the decision is reversed by today, a demand Sudanese state radio
described as 'insolence' and 'a naked challenge'.
Dr Carey, spiritual leader of the world's 70m Anglicans, said his purpose in
visiting southern Sudan was to draw international attention to a forgotten
civil war which has dragged on for 10 years.
He said he had cancelled his visit to Khartoum after the Sudanese government
changed the conditions of his visit at the last minute.
'After all the atrocities and the imposition of Islamic law, I could not be
seen, as a Christian leader, to be the guest of an Islamic government,' he
explained. 'I would gladly consider visiting Khartoum as a guest of the
Episcopal church, if I can be assured freedom of movement.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy fighting raged again yesterday between the Mexican military and a
group of armed peasants continuing their war against the government after
taking over six towns in the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's Day,
Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas.
A pitched battle was taking place in Ocosingo, 35 miles east of San
Cristobal. The military said two soldiers and 27 peasants had died. The
official death toll in this increasingly bloody rebellion stood at 86.
However, one state official told Reuter that the toll among soldiers alone
could be as high as 150.
Government soldiers were patrolling San Cristobal, the largest town in the
area, taking control of the centre and all roads in after rebels calling
themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army pulled out on Sunday.
Military helicopters could be seen shooting at peasants in the mountains
surrounding the area. A steady rattle of gunfire came from troops fighting
on the ground.
Chiapas interior minister, Mr Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, claimed in a
television interview that the rebels had pulled out of all but two of the
captured towns, but federal officials said that had not been confirmed.
The official news agency Notimex reported that a former Chiapas governor, Mr
Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, and two family members had been kidnapped
from his ranch on Sunday. It also reported an attack on an army base.
The armed insurrection helped push Mexico's stockmarket down by 3.9 per cent
yesterday. Analysts blamed the sharpness of the fall on events in Chiapas.
The stock price of Telmex, the largest private Mexican company, fell by 3
per cent in trading in New York. In Washington it was announced that the US
ambassador to Mexico had sent a team to the south to assess the situation
and check the safety of US citizens.
The peasants, who declared war on the government following their capture of
the six cities, including San Cristobal, say indigenous people have been
victims of genocide. They are demanding land reforms and a new government.
A rebel leader also told reporters they opposed the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which took effect on New Year's Day, apparently out of fear
that it will harm Chiapas' already poor economy. Chiapas has been the site
of numerous conflicts involving indigenous groups and farmers and ranchers
in recent years.
Estimates of the number of armed peasants range from 600 to 2,000.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in his first public comments since the
uprising began, told legislators that the violent acts in Chiapas 'delay the
real solution to social needs'. But, he added: 'We know that needs and
inequalities persist. We know that benefits and opportunities still are not
tangible realities for many.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / The man who keyed IBM into computers: The impact of Thomas
Watson Jr who died on New Year's Eve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By his own account, the course of Thomas Watson Jr's life changed
irrevocably in the spring of 1945.
He had invited General Follett Bradley, whose aide-de-camp he had been
during the second world war, to dinner. The two men were close friends and
Bradley asked the 31-year-old Watson what he intended to do in peace-time.
A natural and enthusiastic flyer, Watson replied that he had a job lined up
as a pilot with United Air Lines. Bradley, puzzled, replied: 'Really? I
always thought you'd go back and run the IBM company.'
It was a reply that surprised nobody but, it seems, Watson himself. The
eldest son of Thomas J. Watson, the self-willed, self-educated, hard-driving
businessman who created International Business Machines in his own
inflexible image, everybody around him knew he was destined from birth to
run one of the world's most significant business empires.
As a gawky 13-year-old, he was photographed with his father on their way to
an IBM sales convention, both wearing the staid and sombre garb that Watson
Sr encouraged his armies of salespeople to adopt. When himself a junior
salesman, aged 26, he filled his entire year's quota on the first day of the
year thanks to a single order from US Steel Products .
But Watson Jr knew his progress at IBM was a consequence of his father's
position rather than his own ability and his early years with the company
were marred by anger, humiliation and frustration. Throughout his life he
was haunted by the belief that he would never fill his father's shoes, nor
match the old tyrant's expectations of him. The story of his battle for
independence and self-fulfilment is movingly told in his autobiography
'Father, Son &amp; Co' published in 1990.
Tom Watson's lasting memorial, however, and one that owes nothing to his
father, is that IBM is today acknowledged as the world's largest computer
company; it was due to his foresight that IBM moved in the 1950s from
electromechanical punched-card tabulators to electronic computers. It was
his courage and resilience which held the ring while IBM was fighting the
hugely expensive battle in the 1960s to establish the System/360, later to
become the world's most successful family of mainframe computers.
Those who knew the Watsons well believe that IBM would inevitably have moved
into computers - Watson Sr could not bear the thought that any other company
could build machines better than his own - but that without Tom Jr's
perseverance, the company would have had to recover ground lost to the likes
of Remington Rand and would never have been able to dominate the market
through the 1970s and 1980s in the way it did.
With hindsight, indeed, it is likely IBM would not have lost its way so
badly in the early 1990s if it had had a leader of equivalent vision and
courage prepared to cut ties with the past and invest in the future to
exploit fully the personal computer revolution.
Tom Watson was born in 1914 when his father was already 39. He was followed
by two sisters, Jane and Helen, and a brother, Arthur, known for most of his
life as Dick. Watson Sr planned for his two sons to inherit his empire and
Dick was eventually given control of IBM World Trade, IBM's operations
outside North America. He died in 1974 aged 55 after a fall when
recuperating from a heart attack.
Tom Jr's youth and early manhood were spent in hedonistic attempts to escape
the inevitable. Tall and handsome, he was a poor student but a good
sportsman with a special aptitude for yachting and skiing. Shortly after
arriving at Brown University in Rhode Island he learned to fly. Some might
see psychological significance in Tom Jr's enduring love of aircraft and his
skill as a pilot. His father had a pathological fear of flying. It was an
area that was Tom's alone.
Money was no object. He recalled: 'I had plenty of money for fooling around.
My monthly allowance was Dollars 300 - about double the income of the
average American family in those years.' While still a college junior in
1935, he bought his first aircraft, a Fairchild 234. His father was, at the
time, at the the head of the list of highest paid Americans.
Inevitably, any assessments of Tom Jr's achievements have to be seen against
this background of extreme advantage. He had nothing in common with the
ordinary businessman progressing through a company. Every step was
preordained and overseen by his father.
Tom Sr wanted to see his children do well so he could bask in the reflected
glory; at the same time, he had no intention of allowing them to take away
any of his own prestige. When, in 1955, Tom Jr appeared on the front cover
of Time magazine - something his father had never achieved - to mark the
gathering pace of the computer revolution, he felt forced to write an
apologetic note to soften the blow. 'It was a sincere but clumsy attempt to
reassure him, though I doubt it made him feel any less upstaged. He didn't
talk to me about the article at all. He never said 'Great going' and I never
brought it up,' Tom wrote later.
He became a military pilot despite having been turned down for the Air Corps
because of defective eyesight. Here the Watson stubbornness made itself
felt. Tom bought an eye examination machine and practised until he had
trained himself to pass the test.
He was called up in autumn 1940, eventually seeing service in Europe and
flying hundreds of hours across Russia and China. He returned to IBM in 1946
after the end of the war. In the interim period, he had cast off his playboy
image, married Olive Field Cawley and was showing serious signs of wanting
to fulfil his destiny.
It was a critical time for the nascent computer industry. The Eniac, one of
the first electronic digital computers, had been built at the University of
Pennsylvania by Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. Tom Jr, was impressed by
the giant machine with its 18,000 vacuum tubes, but hardly captivated. What
caught his imagination was a suitcased-sized electronic calculator dreamed
up in IBM's own laboratories to tabulate a payroll - and doing it 10 times
faster than IBM's electromechanical tabulating machines. Marketed as the IBM
603 and then 604, it sold in thousands.
Watson had the vision to understand that there would be a tremendous market
for computers, used in shops, offices, and banks as well as scientific
institutions. He believed that technology produces new markets and new
business opportunities; his father found the new concepts hard, but was
prepared to indulge his son. What neither of them could have realised was
the huge amounts of investment required by the new technology.
The company began hiring electronics engineers in thousands. A 'Defence
Calculator' (eventually the IBM 701) costing Dollars 12m to develop, the
most expensive project in IBM's history, was initiated. 'We were essentially
learning a whole new trade,' Tom Jr wrote. 'You had only to visit
Poughkeepsie (an IBM laboratory still important today) to get an idea of the
fundamental change taking place in engineering.'
Tom Jr was appointed chief executive in May 1956. His father died later the
same year at the age of 82. Watson was on his own as he prepared to lead IBM
through its biggest gamble, the development of System/360, the most
influential computer system the world has known - until the development of
the personal computer. It almost broke the company in development, but its
success guaranteed IBM's astonishing growth and development through the
1970s and 1980s.
Tom retired as chairman and chief executive in 1970 following a heart
attack. He cut his formal links with IBM, spent time sailing Palawan, his
68-foot ketch, and indulged his passion for flying. A spell as US ambassador
in Moscow followed; he had come full circle, recalling in his autobiography
that the squalor of the city reminded him of the four months he had spent in
Russia as a pilot and aide to General Bradley. It was not, however, a happy
time for him - he was no diplomat - and he was relieved to return to the US
10 years after he stepped down from the top job at IBM.
He once said: 'The secret I learned early on from my father was to run
scared and never think I had it made. We got highly excited over things that
were not that important. I never felt I was completely adequate to the job
and always ran scared. In June 1957, a year after my father died, I said 'By
golly, Olive, I've made it through 12 months'.'
During his period at IBM, he changed the company's organisation, technology,
even its sense of corporate design, all for the better. He was a decent man
who worked hard to carve out an identity and purpose for himself; it is no
fault of his that his achievements and his father's will always be bracketed
together.
Thomas Watson Jr, born January 8, 1914, Dayton, Ohio. Died December 31,
Greenwich, Connecticut, aged 79.

President Fidel Castro has asked Cubans to continue defying economic
pressures from the US and to be 'ready to go to the grave' defending the
revolution which he led 35 years ago.
Speaking on the anniversary of the revolution at the weekend, he said Cuba
had achieved a feat in 'resisting the imperial power' which 'will not be
able, to defeat us'.
The president reminded his audience that his administration had provided
free health care and education, but had been hit hard by the break-up of the
Soviet Union, Cuba's main trading partner, and by the reinforcement of the
US economic blockade.
The island's mounting economic problems have led the government to implement
a series of changes, including self-employment in some sectors, an increase
in the number of private and co-operative farms, and the free use of foreign
currency.
Mr Castro earlier told the national assembly that the economic changes were
necessary as Cuba had to make 'concessions and take steps backward' from the
construction of a socialist society. 'We are doing it without fear or
vacillation, but without ever forgetting the idea of perfecting this system
of social justice.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / Clinton bangs drum for healthcare reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton started his working year yesterday with a White House
meeting intended to get his plans moving again for reform of the US
healthcare system.
He insisted that legislation to overhaul the healthcare system, several
times postponed in 1993, would be approved by Congress this year.
'I believe that 1994 will go down in history as the year when, after decades
and decades of false starts and lame excuses and being overcome by special
interests, the American people finally had health security for all,' Mr
Clinton said at a meeting of senior advisers.
While concern about the healthcare system remains high among US voters, the
issue has lost some of the urgency that drove the Clinton administration's
proposal, announced last year, for radical legislation that would guarantee
a fixed package of health benefits to all US residents.
The bill faces hard pounding in the congressional committee process. The
delay in pushing the legislation through Congress has given Mr Clinton's
opponents time to muster their forces against crucial elements of his plan,
especially the requirement that all employers pay most of the cost of health
insurance for their workers.
'We'll need a different plan,' Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in
the Senate, said in a New Year's Day address, 'taking the best ideas, if
any, from all the proposals but without price controls, employer mandates,
mandatory health care alliances and massive overdoses of government
control.'
Some Republicans are even betting that public demand for healthcare reform
has died down enough to remove the need for radical change altogether. While
most members of Congress appear still to believe that a substantial reform
law will be enacted, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the senior Republican
on the Senate labour committee, predicted yesterday that comprehensive
legislation would not pass.
Mr Clinton said he remained open to alternatives but that, after weeks in
which his proposals have been dissected, he wanted people to look now at the
details of rival plans and at the cost of the status quo.
'I have said all along what my bottom line is: that we have to have
comprehensive benefits that can never be taken away; that we cannot go on
being the only country in the world with an advanced economy that cannot
figure out how to guarantee health security to all our people.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican federal forces yesterday pressed their hunt for armed Indian
peasants in the southern state of Chiapas after dozens of people were killed
in heavy fighting sparked by a rebel uprising, Reuter reports from San
Cristobal de las Casas.
Officials said the peasants, who have declared war on the government in
their campaign for the rights of native peoples, had not responded to an
offer to negotiate.
The self-proclaimed Zapatista National Liberation Army, a band of about 600
armed peasants, many of Mayan descent, continued yesterday to occupy at
least three of the four small towns where the began uprising on New Year's
Day.
After an overnight lull in the fighting, helicopters yesterday roared over
the forested hillsides around San Cristobal despite heavy early fog as the
full search for the guerrillas resumed. Gunfire and grenade explosions could
be heard in the mountains surrounding the city.
Government soldiers were patrolling the town, the largest in the area,
taking control of the centre and all roads in after the rebels fled on
Sunday. Officials claimed federal forces were pushing the rebels out of
Ocasingo, east of San Cristobal.
The peasants took over the towns, calling for land reform and a new
government, on the day that the North American Free Trade Agreement went
into effect. They accused the government of a history of genocide and said
that Nafta would be a death sentence for Mexico's indigenous peoples.
The rebels are apparently concerned that industrial development in the north
expected to result from the pact could harm their way of life. For (the
government) it doesn't matter that we possess nothing, absolutely nothing;
not a home, not land, not work, not education,' the rebels said.
Mr Rafael Gonzalez, secretary-general of the state government, said the
government was prepared to negotiate, with the Roman Catholic church as
mediator. He also said the death toll was likely to rise: 'We fear the
number of civilian casualties may be higher than we have confirmed.' The
army said 30 people, including six soldiers and 24 peasants, died on Sunday
and that another 27 people had been killed on New Year's Day.
It was not clear whether the civilians the official referred to included the
armed peasants.
Government and church officials in Chiapas said the region's indigenous
people had become increasingly angry in recent years because the economic
changes wrought by President Carlos Salinas have not reached them.
The peasant group apparently takes its name from Mexican revolutionary
Emiliano Zapata, who led peasant uprisings and land takeovers early this
century. Chiapas is a poor rural state that has been the site of numerous
conflicts involving indigenous groups and farmers and ranchers in recent
years.

FT  04 JAN 94 / 2m new jobs seen in US this year

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US companies will create 2m jobs this year, Mr Robert Reich, labour
secretary, predicted yesterday as another batch of statistics confirmed that
the economy ended last year on a strong note.
Spurred by increases in new orders, the purchasing managers' index - a
closely watched barometer of the health of manufacturing industry - rose
from 55.7 per cent in November to 57.9 per cent last month, the highest
level for nearly a year. Readings of above 50 per cent indicate the
manufacturing sector is expanding.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 1.8
per cent between October and November, a larger increase than most analysts
had expected.
Construction spending was up nearly 11 per cent in cash terms from the same
period in 1992, having risen for seven consecutive months.
Speaking on ABC television, Mr Reich said that most of the jobs created this
year would be in service industries, with the bulk in managerial and
professional services. There would also be lower-paid openings in restaurant
and hotel services.
A net increase of 2m jobs would represent an increase in employment of a
little less than 2 per cent, roughly in line with job creation last year,
which was also concentrated in services.
Mr Reich said that, although jobs would be in 'abundant supply', growing
disparities in skill levels would prevent many workers from taking advantage
of new opportunities. Encouraging job training would be a priority for the
US administration this year.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said that the gain in
the purchasing index reflected a strong rise in new orders. The index for
new orders rose to 66.7 per cent against 64.8 per cent in November, one of
the highest readings in 10 years.
However, Mr Bretz warned that continued rapid expansion in manufacturing was
not assured. It would be 'challenging to sustain current growth rates, let
alone exceed them'. Yesterday's figures followed other robust data
indicating economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to an annual
rate of 4-5 per cent.
However, many economists expect growth to moderate to a more sustainable 3
per cent this year because consumer spending has outstripped personal
incomes.
Mr George Eads, chief economist at General Motors, yesterday warned the
Federal Reserve not to 'overreact' to signs of faster growth by raising
interest rates.
The rapid increase in car production between the third and fourth quarters
of last year, which gave the economy a big boost, was unlikely to be
repeated in coming quarters.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Zimbabwe moves to boost foreign investment: The Harare
government's far-reaching package of trade and payments liberalisation
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe has floated its currency, launched a two-tier foreign currency
market and devalued the official exchange rate by 17 per cent to ZDollars
8.2 to the US dollar.
Mr Richard Hove, the acting finance minister, and Dr Leonard Tsumba,
governor of the central bank, also announced the abolition of direct import
allocations, the launch of foreign currency accounts (FCAs) for companies
and an increased ceiling for dividend remittances, all effective from
January 1.
The far-reaching package had been widely trailed and contains no surprises.
For foreign companies, the two most significant changes are the increase in
the ceiling on dividend remittances to 50 per cent of after-tax profits from
25 per cent previously, and the abolition of so-called surplus funds.
These apply to all pre-1979 companies - that is, foreign companies that
invested in the former Rhodesia before the start of the Lancaster House
independence conference in September 1979. Post-1979 companies have long
been allowed the higher 50 per cent rate, while companies investing after
May 1, 1993, may remit 100 per cent.
The abolition of surplus funds means that foreign multinationals with excess
cash can now invest anywhere in the money market. Until now, they have been
required to deposit with their banks, earning a maximum of 5 per cent. They
can now invest at money market rates in excess of 25 per cent.
From this week, exporters will retain 60 per cent of their export earnings
(up from 50 per cent previously) and can hold these for up to 90 days in a
foreign currency account with a Zimbabwe bank. The balance of 40 per cent
must be sold to the central bank at the official exchange rate.
With the abolition of direct import allocations, importers will have to buy
their foreign currency requirements from the new interbank market where
there is likely to be a small premium of around 1.5-2 per cent. Prior to the
weekend devaluation, export retentions were trading in the unofficial market
at a premium of 23 per cent, but most of this will have been eliminated by
the 17 per cent devaluation. The government will use its 40 per cent of the
country's export earnings to pay for public sector imports, fuel and debt
service.
From today, the central bank will no longer provide subsidised forward
exchange cover for importers, who will have to buy it much more expensively
from their commercial bank. All invisible payments - dividends, royalties,
licence management fees - will have to go through the interbank market and
pay the premium. The 10 per cent tariff on imports brought in under the open
licence system has been abolished, and the surtax on imports reduced to 15
per cent from 20 per cent previously.
Individual holiday allowances have been liberalised, with travellers allowed
up to USDollars 2,000 and the tax on such allowances has also been
abolished.
Government officials hope the new measures will boost foreign investment
and, to that end, the regulations covering portfolio investment have been
further liberalised.
Foreign investors can now buy a maximum of 35 per cent of the equity in
companies listed on the Zimbabwe stock exchange - up from 25 per cent
previously. An individual foreign investor may now buy 10 per cent of the
shares of a quoted company, compared with 5 per cent before.
Foreign investors were re-admitted to the Zimbabwe exchange only last July,
since when there has been an inflow of more than ZDollars 100m (USDollars
12m at the new official parity).
Dr Tsumba admitted that the devaluation would be inflationary but, because
import taxes had been lowered, believed the impact on inflation, currently
22 per cent, would be no more than 3 per cent.
There is some grumbling from businessmen, who are unhappy at the further
devaluation (the Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by 70 per cent over the
past three years). But the package is likely to be well-received, especially
by foreign companies which will welcome the liberalisation of dividend
regulations and the greater financial flexibility provided by the interbank
exchange market and the disappearance of the surplus funds requirement.
Zimbabwe has now implemented the bulk of its trade liberalisation reforms
under its five-year structural adjustment programme.
Increasingly, the spotlight will now shift to the area of least progress -
public sector reform. With official figures showing a disconcerting surge in
government borrowing, which will fuel inflation later in the year if it
remains unchecked, the government must now move to restructure the public
sector.

<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday put off a decision on whether to approve construction of a
bridge between Sweden and Denmark after continued wrangling over the project
within the coalition government. The decision threatens the cohesion of the
government, headed by Moderate (Conservative) party leader Carl Bildt, nine
months before a general election.
'We are quite simply not ready,' Mr Bildt said yesterday after a cabinet
meeting to discuss the bridge, which would be the first permanent link
between Sweden and continental western Europe. 'A decision can probably not
be expected before Thursday of next week,' he added.
Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty which commits the two states to
build the 17km road-and-rail bridge by the year 2000 at a cost of about
SKr12bn (Pounds 975.6m).

FT  04 JAN 94 / French banks cut base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's leading commercial banks yesterday announced they would trim their
base lending rates by 0.2 percentage points, from 8.15 per cent to 7.95 per
cent. The cuts will take effect tomorrow.
The reductions reflect a steady decline in money market rates and follow a
series of cuts in official borrowing costs. The Bank of France has lowered
the intervention rate, the floor for money market interest rates, six times
since last July's European currency crisis. The latest cut, at the beginning
of December, reduced the intervention rate to 6.2 per cent.
Yesterday's announcements of base rate cuts - by banks including Banque
Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais - follow pressure
from the government. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has called
for commercial banks to pass on more quickly the reduction in official
borrowing costs.
Economists in Paris said that banks' base rates should continue to fall as
money market rates and official borrowing costs were reduced further. They
said lower base rates, which provide a reference for most consumer credit
and loans to small and medium-sized industry, would help revive the stagnant
economy.
Market interest rates have fallen over the past few months, particularly at
the long end of the bond market. Ten-year government bonds, for example, are
currently yielding about 5.6 per cent, compared with about 6 per cent at the
end of November.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Paris to probe schools' safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will shortly launch an inquiry into physical safety in
the country's state schools, in an attempt to defuse allegations that it is
favouring private over public education.
The conservative government sparked a row with President Francois Mitterrand
and other Socialist politicians when, in the pre-Christmas legislative rush,
it scrapped an 1850 law which limited local authorities to funding only 10
per cent of the construction and repair of private schools, which in France
are mainly Catholic.
Some 70,000 people, many of them teachers, protested against the action on
December 17, and a similar national protest is planned for January 16.
Socialist deputies have asked the constitutional court to rule on the move,
complaining that it will drain money from state education and favour
religious over lay schools.
By setting up an inquiry, which is expected to recommend that more money be
spent on state schools' infrastructure, the government hoped to show 'it is
not robbing the public sector for the benefit of private education', an
official of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday.
But a Socialist spokesman said there was ample evidence already on the state
of safety in public schools, and any inquiry should be directed at how a
government commission managed to conclude last month that half the country's
private schools were physically dangerous.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Letter to Bank of Spain governor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is the text of a letter, dated December 27 1993, from Mr
Roberto G. Mendoza, vice-chairman of JP Morgan, to Mr Luis Angel Rojo,
governor of the Bank of Spain.
Dear Mr Governor,
In connection with discussions I understand that you have had with D Mario
Conde, chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, I am writing to confirm that:
1. J P Morgan has assisted Banesto in developing a plan to deal with certain
accounting and asset quality issues; fully supports both the spirit and
particulars of the plan; and believes that it can be implemented
successfully;
2. Subject to market conditions, J P Morgan intends to lead manage the
underwriting of a Dollars 400m convertible subordinated debt issue for
Banesto during the second quarter of 1994 and believes that, following the
announcement of Banesto's plan and related charges, the issue should be
successful;
3. J P Morgan believes that, if necessary, Banesto could sell half of its
stake (or approximately 25 per cent of the outstanding shares) in Banco
Totta y Acores during the first or second quarter of 1994 and J P Morgan
would be pleased, subject to market conditions, to lead manage the
underwriting of the sale of such stake; and
4. J P Morgan supports Banesto's current management and believes that
Banesto's prospects for future profitability are strong.
J P Morgan has assisted Banesto in developing a written presentation of its
plan, and this. . . has been reviewed by the senior management of J P Morgan
in our role as financial adviser to Banesto. I would welcome the opportunity
to provide you with a copy of that presentation and to discuss with you in
person why J P Morgan believes Banesto's proposed plan is feasible and in
the best interests of Banesto, its shareholders and the Spanish banking
system.

Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, is due to meet Mr Mate
Granic, the Croatian foreign minister, in Vienna today in an effort to
restart talks on the partition of Bosnia, writes Laura Silber.
The two men will discuss territorial disputes and humanitarian issues. Their
meeting follows threats by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and other
senior officials to intervene unless the mainly Moslem Bosnian army halts an
offensive in central Bosnia.
With peace talks stalled, the Bosnian army launched an offensive against
Croat forces to gain control over most of the central part of the republic.
All-party talks are set to resume in Geneva later this month after the
unsuccessful attempt to broker a pre-Christmas agreement.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Belgrade stock market struggles against odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the Serbian nightmare of hyperinflation, sanctions and war, Mr
Branislav Cosic struggles to keep open the Belgrade stock exchange.
No stocks have changed hands for more than a year, explains Mr Cosic, the
exchange's director. In fact, there are only two companies listed on the
exchange because war scuppered the country's privatisation plans.
Instead, between 400 and 500 companies each day try to beat rising prices by
trading commercial paper denominated in dinars, the national currency. But
Mr Cosic fears that with inflation at 1m per cent last month, they face an
impossible task.
'By the middle of January we will have to stop operations. There will be no
more point in trading in dinars,' he says.
The economic chaos, brought on by nearly three years of war and 21 months of
United Nations sanctions, has forced the stock market to adapt to such an
extent, jokes Mr Cosic, that 'we are planning to sell our know-how to the
west'.
The stock market has been tailored to cope with the inflation rate of 25 per
cent an hour; trading, for example, takes place on Saturdays. 'People invest
in securities to protect their money from inflation, even for a couple of
days,' says Mr Branislav Jorgic who, with Mr Cosic, was one of the founders
of the exchange, which opened in 1989.
Annual turnover last year amounted to DM110m (Pounds 42.9m), down from
DM175m in 1992, while the number of transactions soared to 9,000, from
1,600. However, daily turnover is falling, hovering below DM20,000 in
December.
Some companies use their dinars to buy hard currency at the black market
rate, selling it later at the higher official rate.
A fraction of the population of Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise the
rump Yugoslavia, has grown rich from war profiteering and by violating
sanctions, which include an oil embargo.
Last year Mr Jorgic opened his own brokerage firm, switching sides to join
about a dozen traders at the banks of computers and telephones in the
gleaming offices of the exchange, or Berza. 'You can earn more money here
than in western countries. But you are facing great risks,' he says.
In addition to 'wrong government policies', Mr Cosic blames UN sanctions for
the market's woes as they mean ties are severed with international financial
organisations. Mr Cosic and his team hope the government will swiftly
implement a stabilisation programme.
But Mr Jorgic puts it bluntly. 'If the war continues, I cannot see any
future for the stock exchange. But if it stops, and the UN lifts sanctions,
then the exchange and my company have a chance. . . otherwise I'll change
jobs and start trading in petrol or other goods.'
