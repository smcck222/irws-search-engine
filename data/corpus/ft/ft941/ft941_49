FT  04 JAN 94 / Poles see role for Russia in expanded Nato

<TEXT>
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, wants Nato to set up a
mechanism which would eventually enable east European countries to obtain
full membership of the defence grouping.
But he warned that Russia should not be isolated from the process. There
could be no European security 'without the inclusion of a functioning
democratic Russia', he said.
'A democratic and strong Russia would be the strongest guarantee of peace
and stability in Europe.'
Mr Olechowski's remarks came during an official visit to Bonn, and were
detailed in an article in the liberal Frankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper.
He said the 'partnership for peace,' the US-sponsored plan which envisages
more co-operation with the countries of eastern Europe, did not go far
enough in providing them with eventual guarantees of security. 'We
understand that we cannot become Nato members overnight,' he said. 'But we
expect that the partnership for peace is constructive in such a way that
countries which went through a certain process would eventually attain to
full membership.' The plan, he said, fell short of such expectations.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, said Bonn would act as Poland's
'defence lawyer' during next week's Nato summit.
'Because of our geographical situation following reunification. . . we have
a particular responsibility and we bear this. We have a particular
understanding of the countries of eastern Europe in terms of security
needs,' he said.
But Mr Kinkel, in contrast to the federal Defence Ministry which favours
faster integration into Nato of east European countries, said 'a balanced
and cautious procedure' on membership was needed.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Siberian air crash kills 120: Pilots' chief blames Aeroflot
break-up for poor safety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The head of Russia's pilots' union called for 'an end to the mess' in the
domestic airline industry after 120 people died yesterday in the country's
worst air crash for a decade.
A Tupolev-154 crashed in Siberian farmland just after taking off from
Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, for a five-hour flight to Moscow. All 120 crew
and passengers, including 16 foreigners, were killed after the engines
failed and the aircraft caught fire in mid-air. Nine of the 16 foreigners
who died were German, and four Chinese.
Mr Alfred Malinovski, head of the pilots' union, said in an interview with
the Financial Times that the crash was part of a 'harvest of accidents
which, to a significant degree, is being reaped because of the shocks
suffered by the aviation industry'.
He claimed that, with the break-up of Aeroflot into 160 local carriers such
as Baikal Air, whose aircraft crashed yesterday, safety checks had been
weakened and pilots had little control over the over-loading of aircraft
with cargo, fuel and passengers.
'The industry is in a fearful state. Not enough money is spent on repairs,
and enforcing safety regulations. Pilots have to travel with bags of cash to
pay for fuel and tend to load as much fuel wherever they are because prices
are so unpredictable.
'Crudely speaking, things are a mess.'
At its year-end press conference, the Russian Transport Ministry reported
that fatal accidents on Russian airlines had dropped to 10 last year from 24
in 1992.
Mr Malinovski added that ground staff and crew were vulnerable to bribes and
threats to take on extra cargo.
The threats come particularly from small traders who criss-cross the country
reselling goods and transporting them on passenger tickets.
While some of the units that have emerged from the break-up of Aeroflot and
some of the many new airlines have improved services, domestic travel within
the former Soviet Union remains dismal.

Alcatel, the French tele-communications group, yesterday announced it had
won contracts in Australia to modernise the country's telephone switching
network and to provide two new international exchanges, writes John Ridding
in Paris.
The contracts for the switching systems comprise equipment for more than 5m
of the 8.5m lines involved in Australia's telephone modernisation project.
The value of the contract is about ADollars 1bn (Pounds 454.5m).
The contract for the two exchanges, which is worth about ADollars 30m, was
concluded with Telstra, the international arm of Telecom Australia.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Swedes delay decision on bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday put off a decision on whether to approve construction of a
17km bridge between Sweden and Denmark after continued wrangling over the
project within the four-party coalition government.
The decision threatens the cohesion of the government, headed by Moderate
(Conservative) party leader Carl Bildt, nine months before a general
election, due on September 18.
'We are quite simply not ready,' Mr Bildt said yesterday after a two-hour
cabinet meeting to discuss the bridge, which would be the first permanent
link between Sweden and continental western Europe.
Hundreds of demonstrators opposed to the bridge protested outside the
meeting.
'A decision can probably not be expected before Thursday of next week,' Mr
Bildt added.
The bridge is opposed on environmental grounds by the coalition Centre
party, led by Mr Olof Johansson, minister for the environment. He is under
pressure from sections of his party to pull out of the coalition if the
government decides the bridge should be built. If this happened the
government would have to resign, although Mr Bildt could be asked to form a
new coalition between the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian
Democrats.
Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty which commits the two states to
build the road-and-rail bridge by the year 2000 at a cost of about SKr12bn
(Pounds 975.6m). It will cross the Oresund (the narrow strait separating
Denmark and Sweden) between the Danish capital of Copenhagen and the
southern Swedish city of Malmo.
The Centre party has made it a condition for approving construction that the
flow of water through the Oresund is not reduced.
In an exchange of letters last week between Mr Bildt and Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, the two governments promised to ensure
this condition was fulfilled.
Despite Mr Bildt's pledge last week that a decision would be made yesterday,
the coalition continued to dither. A meeting of party leaders on Sunday
lasted until 3am yesterday morning, followed by the cabinet session.
'We need more information on a number of points,' Mr Bildt told a press
conference, denying a government crisis was imminent.
He admitted there was a 'certain tension', but that the cabinet was
determined to find a solution.
'We are close to each other when it comes to the question of the Oresund
bridge.'

FT  04 JAN 94 / Fresh gains push markets to record levels worldwide: Asia
and Europe in buoyant mood as City returns to trading today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London, Europe's main financial market, will return to work this
morning in buoyant mood after stock markets in Europe and south-east Asia
began the new year in the same record-setting style with which they saw out
1993.
Bourses in Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Madrid, Brussels and
Stockholm rose to record highs.
The surge in European stock markets stretched from the fledgling markets of
Athens and Istanbul, in the south, to Vienna and Warsaw in central Europe.
Hong Kong led the Asian advance with a 1.7 per cent rise, while new peaks
were set in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Manila and Jakarta. Bombay and
Karachi completed the record-breaking run in Asia.
Taiwan continued the strong performance as Far Eastern markets opened today,
while Seoul and Singapore also started on a positive note. Tokyo, however,
edged down slightly in initial trading.
The recent sustained rise in Asian and European markets has been underpinned
by outflows of money from the US, where many investors believe equity
markets have less potential for growth than those abroad.
In contrast to the surge elsewhere, Wall Street was subdued yesterday. The
market there largely ignored a positive report from the National Association
of Purchasing Management and instead took its lead from a weak bond market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.51 at 3,756.6.
A surge in US demand for German stocks helped Frankfurt's DAX index up 1.3
to 2,267.98 after an early, 30-point fall, in a show of confidence on the
part of many traders who believe that the market still has further potential
to rise.
Some investors were also building their hopes that Thursday's meeting of the
Bundesbank Council will cut interest rates. However, many analysts believe
that the authorities are unlikely to act this week, with some German
financial centres closed on Thursday for the Epiphany holiday.
Paris picked up after a quiet start, the CAC-40 index adding 22.34 to
2,290.56, while Amsterdam was led higher by technical considerations in
otherwise quiet conditions. The new AEX index made its debut yesterday,
having replaced the EOE index, and closed at 420.37, up from a rating of
414.27 last Thursday.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer, an analyst at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich,
confirmed that European markets were being spurred higher by inflows of US
money.
He said: 'US fund managers who are most comfortable basing their investments
on fundamental analysis, are instead buying in the European markets, because
it is the current trend.'
With the Tokyo market closed, Hong Kong remained the main Asian focus for
buying by foreign investors.
US institutions continued to fuel the market's rise, which saw turnover of
more than HKDollars 9.2bn (Pounds 805m) during the session, compared with
HKDollars 7.4bn last Friday.
The Hang Seng index, which rose by 115 per cent in 1993, added 198.1 to
close at 12,086.49. Many traditionally superstitious Chinese investors had
seen the Hang Seng's final tally for the last day of 1993 - 11,888.39 - as a
good omen; the Cantonese equivalent of 'three eights' is taken as a portent
of growth and prosperity.
Yet even at the market's current levels, many investors are reluctant to
take profits, setting their sights instead on a further rise in the Hang
Seng to the 14,000 level.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Increase in taxes 'will not undermine recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and KEITH FRAY, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax increases in the spring will not blow the recovery off course, but
growth until the middle of the decade will be unspectacular, unemployment
will remain high, and inflation will stay well under control, according to a
Financial Times survey.
The latest survey of 39 independent economic forecasters shows analysts
backing the government view that the economy will grow a modest 2.5 per cent
this year, and by only a little more in 1995.
While the average of growth forecasts is broadly consistent with Treasury
thinking, the survey reveals sharp differences over:
The expected impact of last year's Budgets on the recovery;
The performance of inflation over the next two years;
The extent to which base rates will shift from their present level of 5.5
per cent.
Not one of the economists surveyed believes base rates will fall below 4 per
cent this year or next. Most expect a half-point cut in the spring as tax
increases reduce consumer confidence. But eight expect the government to
raise interest rates this year to counter a pick-up in inflation.
Economists at UBS, the Swiss bank, unconvinced that the UK has shaken off
its boom-and-bust tendencies, believe the intensification of wage pressures,
capacity shortages and a deteriorating trade deficit will push inflation up
to 8.2 per cent by the end of next year, with interest rates rising to 10
per cent.
That contrasts sharply with the consensus which puts retail price inflation
at 3.7 per cent by the end of 1995, and base rates at just over 5.5 per
cent.
Few of the analysts go as far as Mr Roger Bootle at Midland Global Markets
to declare that inflation is dead, but they nonetheless do not expect
inflationary pressures to mount significantly over the next two years.
'Inflation is a thing of the past and of the future, but not of the
present,' says Mr Robert Barrie at BZW, the stockbroker.
Forecasts for government borrowing this year and next have been revised
sharply downwards, but there is scepticism about the ability of Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to restrain public spending as successfully as he
hopes. 'No public-sector pay policy has held for more than a couple of years
without a catch-up wage explosion,' says Mr David Smith at Williams de Broe.
'It is difficult to see pay restraint holding beyond the next fiscal year,'
say Mr Richard Freeman and Mr David Thomas at ICI.
Economists are collectively gloomy on unemployment. Not many expect the
jobless total to drop below 2.7m this year and even in 1995 the consensus
puts it only just under 2.6m. The exception is Mr Patrick Minford at
Liverpool University, who, trusting to labour market flexibility, sees
unemployment dropping to 2.3m this year and to 1.88m next year.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Media review aims to boost UK ownership overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wide-ranging review of UK cross-media ownership designed to encourage
British companies to take advantage of opportunities in international media
markets was announced by the government yesterday.
It is likely that further deregulation of broadcasting ownership rules could
follow, allowing a larger role for newspaper publishers in television
ownership, when the inter-departmental review ends in about six months.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, who promised a wider
review in November when he announced proposals to allow one company to own
two ITV licences, said he wanted to see UK participation 'in an enormously
expanding market'.
The review comes against a background of rapid changes in the industry and
growing internationalisation of media ownership.
Newspaper proprietors, including Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and
Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail, have been lobbying hard to
remove the rules which at present prevent them holding more than a 20 per
cent stake in either commercial television or radio stations.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, said yesterday: 'Assuming it
leads to a relaxation, it is something we would very much welcome. It is a
natural extension of newspaper publishing.'
The review will bring together officials from the National Heritage
Department, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Downing Street
policy unit. After it is complete a further round of ministerial meetings is
expected, suggesting that policy changes are unlikely before the autumn.
'It is intended to examine things looked at at the time of the Broadcasting
Act 1990, but also at the variety of relationships between newspapers, TV
companies, radio stations and the press,' said Mr Brooke.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's national heritage spokeswoman, generally
welcomed the announcement, but wondered whether newspapers would be allowed
greater participation in television ownership in return for accepting value
added tax on newspapers in the next Budget.
Mr Brooke said in an interview on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that
the review would broaden out to look at 'the way the world is developing
much more widely'. This could include everything from television programmes
to films, videos, music, computer games, home shopping and information of
all kinds.
He was determined however to maintain the UK's domestic production base
because, he said, people liked watching things produced in their own country
'through their own national filter'.
It was also important to maintain a plurality of views and a diversity of
choice in broadcasting, said Mr Brooke.

FT  04 JAN 94 / Adams attacks Ulster veto as bar to peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELFAST, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein appeared last night to be moving towards rejecting the UK-Irish
peace initiative after Mr Gerry Adams delivered a strong attack on Northern
Ireland's right to self-determination.
In a speech in the republican stronghold of west Belfast, the Sinn Fein
president said 'genuine' peace in Ireland depended upon the British
government's recognition of the right of the Irish people to determine their
own future.
'Partition and continued support for the loyalist veto are a recipe for
ongoing conflict,' Mr Adams warned.
Downing Street said last night it would study Mr Adams's words carefully,
but 'what the people in Northern Ireland need is a signal that the
terrorists will call a permanent cessation of their violence'.
Mr Adams's speech came as Mr John Major accused the IRA's political wing of
being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the Downing Street
declaration.
The British prime minister sought to increase pressure on republican leaders
by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate
attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'.
Last night's developments overshadowed concern expressed earlier on both
sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland.
Speaking little more than a day after Mr Martin McGuinness, another senior
Sinn Fein spokesman, dismissed as unacceptable any British offer short of
eventual withdrawal, Mr Adams called on London and Dublin to make the
'exercise of Irish national self-determination' their 'policy objective'.
'Partitionist solutions cannot create the conditions of peace and democracy
in Ireland,' Mr Adams said.
'Since the partition of Ireland, the Irish people's right to
self-determination has been denied by the British government and parliament.
Partition represents the most fundamental denial of democracy.'
The Sinn Fein president acknowledged that the joint declaration contained
'for the first time ever' a recognition by Britain that the Irish people 'as
a whole' had the right to self-determination. But he said the 'deadlock' had
not yet been broken.
He also acknowledged the right of unionists - whom he called 'the Irish
minority' - to be consulted.
Downing Street has taken great pains to reassure unionists that the joint
declaration did nothing to dilute their effective veto over any change in
the province's constitutional status.
Addressing MPs on the day the joint declaration was agreed last month, Mr
Major stated specifically that the document contained no suggestion that
Northern Ireland's future status 'should be decided by a single act of
self-determination by the people of Ireland as whole'.
Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr
Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded
talks which began in 1992.
Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional
parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994.
Sinn Fein is excluded from the process, but Mr Major confirmed that the
party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA
violence.
In a passage aimed at the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line
Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint
declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'.
But unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that
'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern
conflict'.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: Rounding up the villains in a big-budget disaster - A
look at the making of Baron Munchausen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSING THE LIGHT
by Andrew Yule
Applause Pounds 12.99 240 pages
The production history of Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen
demonstrates one of the oldest truths of cinema: that big-budget film-making
is the Creation story in reverse.
Give God six days to make the world and he will create order from chaos.
Give a director 60 days to make a film - and almost as many million dollars
 -and chaos will be conjured unfailingly from a carefully costed,
theoretically foolproof gleam of inspiration.
Andrew Yule's book, funny and informative, is the appalling made real. He
never went near the set during the film's making but has been rounding up
the suspects ever since: including director Terry Gilliam, one-time Monty
Python cartoonist turned film director; German producer Thomas Schuhly,
ex-collaborator with Fassbinder and Fellini; and a mixture of international
stars and technicians (Italian designers, Hollywood comedians).
Baron Munchausen began as a Dollars 20m extravaganza, funded by Columbia on
a pick-up basis and to be made in Italy and Spain by a director with a track
record in low-budget inventiveness (The Time Bandits, Brazil).
Then, like Heaven's Gate and Topsy, it just growed. Yule's book begins with
teasing innocence. What could be brighter and safer than signing up a great
modern movie fantasist (Gilliam) to remake a great bygone movie fantasy?
The old Baron Munchhausen, made in 1943, was a living picture-book. Stuffed
with trips to the moon, headless giants and heroes riding cannonballs, it
was one of the few good things to come out of Germany during the Hitler
years.
The 1989-model Munchausen, when it came out, sank without a ripple at the
box office. But long before that it was measuring up for disaster.
The budget reached Dollars 40-50m (ledgers always become blurry after a
movie's initial cost has doubled), and the shooting schedule spun out from
weeks to months as if Scheherezade were in charge of production management.
In such stories there has to be a villain and Andrew Yule's is Schuhly. He
is Losing The Light's dark angel: a vainglorious egomaniac (so alleged) who
spent more time pumping his muscles at the gym or basking in the lights at
Press briefings than he did in making sure sets were built, costs were
controlled and promised international stars (Marlon Brando, Sean Connery)
turned up for work.
Eric Idle, one of the film's performers, comments: 'He told us that what you
need for film-making is balls. And that's all he ever talked - balls.'
In the other corner, we have Mr Gilliam. Gilliam - it is the book's major
failing - is presented with an almost unblotted copybook.
His one mild foible seems to be a lovable absent-mindedness: note the day he
ordered his age-hopping hero (John Neville) to get into Munchausen's
80-year-old guise (four hours in the make-up room) and then realised that
the day's shooting called for a 65-year-old Baron. Neville, already seething
at a schedule that threatened to eat into his next Stratford Ontario season,
duly exploded.
Elsewhere, Yule acts less like Gilliam's portraitist than his defence
counsel. But surely a director must have prime responsibility for the
unravelling disciplines on a movie set - especially if he conceived the
movie and proclaimed its financial viability to begin with.
Instead, Losing The Light finds fault with other parties, some of the
finger-pointing no doubt justified: with Rome's Cinecitta Studios for its
old-fashioned work methods; with Film Finance, the completion bond company,
for insisting on niggardly and false economies; and with the world of
international bacteria for spreading plagues around the cast both animal and
human - African horse fever, dogs struck by liver ailments, actors struck
down by everything available.
The book, whatever the justice of its apportioning of praise and blame, has
its comic momentum horribly correct: once things start to go wrong on a big
movie, they don't stop.
It makes cinema unique as an art: a form of Promethean presumption that
results either in gorgeous artistic conflagrations or in entire creative
enterprises having their innards pecked out. Losing The Light is a book to
learn from, smile at and shudder over.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Upjohn faces Dollars 1bn lawsuit
over Halcion

<TEXT>
Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it was named in a
lawsuit filed on behalf of five people who had allegedly suffered severe
side-effects from using Halcion, a sleeping medication banned in the UK but
widely prescribed elsewhere.
The company said it was unaware of the details of the lawsuit, which is
seeking Dollars 1bn in damages, according to The Houston Chronicle.
The suit contends that Upjohn relied on falsified clinical studies to win
approval of the medication by the US Food and Drug Administration, according
to the report.
Declining comment on the lawsuit, the company defended Halcion as 'very safe
and effective' when used as directed.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Regional divide narrows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has narrowed the north-south divide, figures from the Central
Statistical Office showed yesterday.
Gross domestic product per head in south-east England slipped back while
that in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north moved forward. But an
east-west divide opened up with East Anglia seeing the biggest rise and
north-west England the steepest fall.
Regional figures for 1992 showed that while GDP in Greater London was down
almost 2 per cent on 1991, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north saw
their second successive relative increase. Total GDP in 1992 was Pounds
514bn, up 4 per cent on 1991. More than a third was accounted for by the
south-east, with Greater London alone responsible for 14.7 per cent.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is scheduled to arrive in Djakarta,
Indonesia, this weekend on the second leg of a three-stage trade mission to
east Asia.
He is leading a group of financial services chiefs to promote UK financial
services in Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The Treasury gave few details of Mr Clarke's itinerary and who was
accompanying him. It said that he would return to the UK early in the week
beginning January 10.
Mr Clarke is the first chancellor to head a trade mission for at least 10
years, the Treasury said.
The Department of Trade and Industry, whose ministers normally head such
trips, said that the financial nature of the business concerned meant it was
'logical' that the chancellor should lead the trip.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Founder's son transformed IBM: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Watson Jr, the son of the founder of International Business Machines
and the man who led the company into the computer business, died yesterday
at a hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut, aged 79.
Mr Watson, who died of complications following a stroke, was chief executive
of IBM from 1956 to 1971 and presided over a spectacular period of growth
which catapulted the company to global leadership of the computer industry,
with its revenues rising from around Dollars 700m a year to Dollars 7bn
(Pounds 4.7bn).
His father, Thomas Watson Sr, was the only son of an immigrant Scots-Irish
labourer, who rose through the ranks of the National Cash Register company
before joining in 1914 the Computing-Tabulating-Recording company, a punch
card accounting business which was the forerunner of IBM.
Thomas Watson Jr, born the same year, was a tall, awkward, shy boy. He was
overshadowed by his charismatic father and had no desire to enter business.
However, service as a military pilot in the second world war allowed him to
escape his father's influence.
He joined IBM in 1946, and was appointed president in 1952 and chief
executive in 1956. In his remarkably frank autobiography, Father Son &amp; Co,
published in 1990, Mr Watson said that when his father died six weeks later
'I was the most frightened man in America. . . I'd heard so many stories
about sons of prominent men failing in business. . . I worried I'd end up
the same way.'
Instead, he presided over a remarkable period of growth, thanks largely to
his championing IBM's entry into the computer business in the 1950s. In his
autobiography, he said his father initially thought the electronic computer
would have no impact on the way IBM did business.
Mr Watson stepped down from the chairmanship in 1971 after heart trouble but
became ambassador to the Soviet Union under President Jimmy Carter between
1979 and 1981. He also retained links with IBM, serving as its chairman
emeritus, and was careful to avoid criticism of its management as the
company's profits and share price tumbled over the past two years.

The FT-SE 100 index gained more than 16 points on the London stock market in
early trading yesterday, backed by a buy programme from one of the UK
securities houses. But the day's peak of 3,445.3 was 35 points short of the
year's trading high reached on Thursday. Yesterday's final reading, taken at
12.30pm, showed the Footsie at 3,418.4, down 10.4. The year's closing high
of 3,462 was recorded on Wednesday. Over the year, the Footsie has risen by
20 per cent, or 571.9 points, driven by falling interest rates and growing
confidence in economic recovery.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Mr Blobby for Number 10
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time to put my money where my mouth is and produce a few fearless forecasts
for 1994, even though, on balance, it looks like being a muddling year -
neither memorable nor especially horrible though marked, come autumn, by the
first tangible wisps of PMT (pre-millennial tension).
None of these forecasts is based on econometric modelling or indeed on
anything more highfalutin than hunch and experience. They are serious
predictions, though I am happy to confess - most forecasters never do this -
that wishful thinking has infected most of them.
Off we go:
Stock markets world-wide will endure a nastier ride than most pundits are
predicting. The FT-SE 100 will set a record high of approximately 3,660
before Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone
in September or October, finishing the year below 3,000. I myself plan to go
almost totally liquid on February 24, which happens to be my birthday.
Contrary to what the experts say, gold will glitter in 1994 as it dawns on
market-makers that every 15 seconds another 45 people are born on earth and
that 10 of them, at least, are likely to be gold-bugs. In 1994 gold will
again approach Dollars 500 an ounce (Dollars 391 at present) as a prelude to
startling gains at the end of the century.
It will be a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy columnists will
finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hilary Clinton, her
husband's possible successor as US president in seven years' time.
But it will be a cruel and desperate period for Europe's leaders,
particularly John Major, whose days as UK prime minister are - mercifully -
numbered. Major won't be pushed; he will go voluntarily, late in the year,
probably late at night, his poor wife in tow, deciding, not unnaturally,
that enough is enough and that he has already endured more obloquy than
mortal man can bear. (Why should he worry? He will become a rich and
much-loved pensioner). His successor - but only for a short while - will be
Kenneth Clarke, the Mr Blobby of UK politics. Eventually, however, the
present chancellor's astonishing good luck will dribble to an end and he
will be stabbed in the back - with svelteness, of course - by Michael
Portillo.
John Smith will meander through another low-key year as Britain's Opposition
leader and will (or will not) move towards some form of alliance with
Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. If he doesn't, the Tories
stand a chance of stealing the next election just as they stole the last
one.
Something unpleasant, painful and messy will happen to bossy Virginia
Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I won't say what; it would ruin the fun.
Soccer's World Cup will be tremendously successful, with Norway beating
Brazil 3-1 in the final. The success of the competition will lead millions
of American sports fans to wonder why, all these years, they let themselves
be fobbed off with such girl's-blouse sports as baseball and basketball.
It will be a good year for Prince Charles as more and more people come to
appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British throne.
What could be more fin de siecle, modern or sophisticated? (The divorce
itself will come next year). Behind the scenes, Queen Elizabeth II will be
informing her less-than-close relatives that the gravy train has departed
and that the monarchy is being downsized while revelling secretly in the
knowledge that she and her heirs are safe.
Correspondingly, the Church of England will stumble ever faster towards
disestablishment and outer darkness.
The Grand National steeplechase will again be a fiasco.
People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more and more
like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced.
Newsdesks will realise that people are fed up with coverage of Russia and
China. What people want most is about 30 years' silence from Russia and
China while those two unfortunate countries ponder their mistakes and
smarten up their acts. That is my fondest wish for 1994: that we hear
nothing more from Moscow and Beijing until New Year's Day, 2024.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Private View: Love, marriage and Penrose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is marriage going out of style in the west? On the face of it, the answer
must be yes.
In most west European countries, the marriage rate has declined gently over
the past decade while the rate of divorce has risen sharply. The number of
babies born outside marriage has increased astonishingly. In Sweden, it is
nearly half of all births; in the US, Britain and France, from 25 to 30 per
cent. In 1960, these figures were 10 per cent or less.
The British are (after the Portuguese) the most assiduous marriers in the
European Union and second only to the restless Danes in divorce. Yet, there
is evidence of parental stability. Half of Britain's out-of-wedlock babies
are born to co-habiting couples and three-quarters are declared by the
father and mother together.
To find out more about what is happening to the institution of marriage, I
climbed a shaky staircase to the offices of a leading London marriage bureau
at a 'good' but down-at-heel address just north of Oxford Street.
I walked into what looked like a love nest. A simulated coal fire burned
optimistically under the mantel in the outer room. Beyond was a cosy
parlour, as tasteful as a country tea room, in which, I presume, the lonely
pour out their hearts to the match-maker.
Penrose Halson is a handsome advertisement for her unusual trade. She has a
soft voice, is feminine to the point of girlish, and has a seductively
melodious laugh. It was easy to imagine distraught clients of both sexes
being gathered, metaphorically speaking, to her bosom.
But I was on other business. I quoted the statistics and asked: does this
mean marriage is dying out?
'There are still an enormous number of marriages,' she said. 'The figures
don't mean marriage is not a good institution. Like democracy, it's the best
we've got. It could be modifying and changing but not dying. If it is, it's
the greatest pity.'
Do you say that because you were brought up to think so?
'Yes, but I didn't marry myself until I was 48 (she is 53 now) and I don't
think it's necessarily the answer for everybody. But I do think it's
probably the answer for the large majority, provided it's entered into for
good and solid and proper reasons.'
Why didn't you get married until 48?
'Late developer,' she laughed.
You can't get away with that.
'No, I was much too ungrown-up, I think. I'm jolly glad I didn't. Any fool
can get married. Sure, I thought I wanted to. All my brothers and sisters
did, and all remained so.'
There was a bit of bloody-mindedness in it, too, she said. 'I never wanted
to be Mrs Wife, and I think probably the people who wanted me to marry them
saw things in that way. In reality, I was probably quite frightened of it. I
was very muddled.'
Her mother, a former Girton girl, sent her to this self-same marriage bureau
when she was 27. At 37, she was on the brink of getting engaged, but the man
died. She returned to the agency. She met husband Bill Halson, a divorced
management consultant, years later when advertising for a lodger.
'Bill turned down the room and contacted me several weeks later and asked me
out to dinner. And I was frightfully upset because I thought: if I go out
with this man and like him, then I can't have him living in the flat. And if
I don't like him, I couldn't, either.'
If marriage was less popular, it was for lack of church and family support,
she said. The social cachet had gone, along with the stigma of divorce.
The Church of England no longer gave a positive lead while government
ministers sent confusing signals, saying one thing but doing another, like
cutting the married person's tax allowance.
Marriage was no longer the passport to sex, nor even to child-bearing.
Expectations were higher but 'very woolly,' especially among women. And
people were living much longer, which made a lifetime commitment daunting.
Perhaps people have just decided it's not such a good thing after all?
'But they're not coming up with any good alternative. If co-habiting were a
satisfactory answer, one could kiss marriage goodbye. But I have seen people
who have tried both and they find co-habiting unsatisfactory.'
Why is that?
'I think it's the lack of commitment - the fact that, in marriage, if you
have a bumpy time - which we all do - the commitment is what helps you ride
it out. You're much less tempted to say: 'Oh well, it's not working, I'm
off'.'
Why should they want that depth of commitment?
'A lot don't. But I think it is the only practical way of organising
ourselves as a society. We need structures, just like the infrastructure of
the sewers and the roads and the railways. You can't have a society based on
people pursuing their own requirements and not obeying certain rules.'
According to a London University study, a successful marriage is the best
guarantee of a happy life (a poor marriage, on the other hand, was found to
bring unhappiness). Moreover, as Halson says, stress, illness and mortality
rates are higher among divorced people, even if co-habiting.
Her observations are based on seven years' experience running the Katharine
Allen bureau, which caters for about 1,000 educated, middle-class,
presentable professionals (60 per cent women, 40 per cent men) at one time.
But marriage bureaux are few, while dating agencies have proliferated. Is
this fact alone not significant?
Feminism might have something to do with it. I quoted one feminist theory
that western women are merely reverting to biological type. Do women want a
man, perhaps, but not a husband?
'I suspect they do, however emancipated and successful. They want a husband
in name or effect. Whether they are legally married or not is not really the
issue.'
The bureau, she said, is trying to foster marriage or 'equivalent
relationships'.
So, you are not a marriage bureau but an ongoing relationship bureau?
The match-maker laughed. 'You could call it that. We did consider changing
the name to 'marriage and partnership bureau' - but not too seriously.'
Rather than 'marriage', I suggested, she could employ a more zoological
denotation, such as 'permanent monogamous co-habitation' or PMC. She giggled
at the thought, and said: 'No. PMC stroke M . . . for marriage.'
If PMC became the norm, would that matter one jot?
'But it's a rotten way to live, with the feeling one day you are going to
part. I don't see how you can have a really positive life together.'
Don't married couples live like that, anyway?
'They know they can be divorced but they don't dwell on it. In
co-habitation, the more vulnerable probably will, and, in middle age, that
means the woman. Co-habiting is so difficult to define. And I do think
people need definitions and structures as a basis.'
Penrose Halson, nee Colyer (her first name is from a village in Cornwall)
has an extra-mural degree in modern languages, wrote and edited language
teaching books, and taught Spanish at a school in a poor area of London.
She was also academic headmistress of a recognised but 'very eccentric'
local ballet school.
What are your qualifications for this job? I asked, unkindly.
She was unmoved. 'What would be the qualifications?'
I don't know, I mumbled. Psychology, psychiatry, a PhD in social studies . .
.
'I'm a trained teacher, which is a help.'
Do you think there should be publicly-supported marriage brokers or advisory
agencies?
'Pre-marital counselling would be a very good idea. The problem with that is
people accepting they need it - especially at a time when they're feeling
good about life. One has great doubts about making it compulsory.' And there
would still be the problem of finding partners for the 40 and 50-year-olds,
especially women.
'But I do think if one could make getting married a little bit harder, it
would help.' (It would not help to make divorce harder, she added). 'Maybe
if they had to go and see the registrar for an hour . . . But it's not going
to stop people.
'It's a very interesting idea. If you could get good people to run them, yes
. . . I think I'd need notice of that question.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / This is a prediction-free column: Dominic Lawson does not
trust soothsayers. The fun is not knowing what is going to happen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saint who intermediates between myself and the editor of the Weekend FT
has sent me a letter. It says that this New Year's Day issue shall be a
'special issue' which 'will lay emphasis on the year ahead, using the loose
theme of Boom and Bust. Plenty of top spin and forward bounce.' I think this
means that I am being asked to forecast - something along the lines of Old
Lawson's Almanack.
Can't do it, old chap. Sorry about that but I have extreme difficulty in
anticipating what my own mood will be in 15 minutes' time. I couldn't even
begin to guess the fortunes of the stock market. My only advice is to
remember what the pundits told you would happen to your investments exactly
a year ago and then decide whether you want to read more of the same.
The forecasters I trust are those whose advice is so generalised as to be
almost meaningless. I can see that these writers are troubled souls,
painfully aware of their inability to see the future and, being also
conscientious, unwilling to pretend that they have a clear glimpse of events
beyond the ends of their noses.
Such a man is Jonathan Cainer, dubbed - faint praise - 'Britain's most
authoritative astrologer' by his employer, the Daily Mail. Jonathan's 1994
forecast for us Sagittarians is a masterful example of his evasive art: 'It
may be less easy to maintain a sunny disposition when you find yourself
tackling inner doubts that emerge in 1994 as a result of your ruler's
continued presence in your 12th Solar house. You may soon begin to question
some very fundamental issues and find that this steers you into deep, dark,
uncharted waters. Easy answers are not likely to be forthcoming and are not
to be trusted . . .'
You see? It is impossible to find fault with such vacuity.
Jonathan annoys me only when he presumes to deal in facts. How dare he say,
as he did earlier this week, that 'your home may not be sumptuous'?
Jonathan, sumptuous is exactly what it is. My interior designer would hang
you from our highest chandelier if he read your remark about our soft
furnishings.
These year-end and year-beginning forecasts are based on the idea that the
achievement of the earth in making yet another circumnavigation of the sun
presages some marked change in our lives. It's not true, of course, although
some people attempt to enforce such a change by the adoption of new year
resolutions. Soon afterwards they benefit from the fact that it is not an
offence to break a contract with oneself.
The tedious truth is that, when we have reached a certain age, nothing
changes very much in our lives. Our flaws and strengths are all too well
defined. Worse, our ability to be happy is a constant, almost entirely
unaltered by external circumstances, in which category I include income and
career. A miserable old sod is always a miserable old sod.
It is only among the very young that one finds a character capable of change
and, therefore, progress. I have observed this only by becoming a father, a
year and a week ago. For my daughter, a year is a lifetime and every day is
a new world, to which her reactions are predictable only in their
unpredictability. Some would have it that her character and future are
already set in stone. Intuitively, I know that this is not so.
This summer, she is due to have a brother or a sister, and I shall spend the
next six months futilely forecasting which her sibling shall be, being
unwilling to spoil the fun by finding out. That would defeat the point of
being in the future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in the 12 regional electricity companies who bought their
shares on flotation in 1990 and still held them on December 31 will be
eligible for their bonuses. About 1.25m shareholders are involved, the
Department of Trade and Industry believes.
Those who registered with the share information office as customers will
receive one free share for every ten held, to a maximum of 300 shares.
Non-customers get one share for every 20, up to a maximum of 150.
Shareholders who opted for electricity payment vouchers instead of shares
have to cash them by April 30 next year. About Pounds 1m worth are still
outstanding.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: New issues strain market - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of new London share issues in 1993 was the highest since 1988,
raising around Pounds 5bn, while rights issues brought in Pounds 11bn.
However, the flood of new issues in the autumn strained the market, leading
to the withdrawal of some flotations. The poor quality of some small
companies seeking to float has also been of concern to investors - some
companies floated this year have already issued profit warnings. New Stock
Exchange rules since the beginning of December increase sponsors'
responsibility for ensuring that full disclosure of a company's financial
situation is made in the prospectus.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Asian markets put on a bumper end-of-year show - At
a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock markets in most of Asia put on a spectacular performance during 1993.
Hong Kong, the largest market in the region, was particularly dynamic,
despite political worries in the run up to 1997. Markets in south-east Asia
 -Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand - hit a
series of all-time highs, with predictions of strong economic growth and
heavy demand from both local and overseas investors. Taiwan this week
reached its highest level for 29 months. Japan, however, staged a temporary
recovery only to fall back towards the year-end.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: And now it's time to say goodbye - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the last column I shall write on personal finance, so perhaps
readers will forgive a spot of self-indulgence as I look back over 3 1/2
years in the job. Back in 1990, the first thing that struck me about
personal finance was the gap between the ideal and the reality. Finance is
an incredibly complex subject and few consumers, however enthusiastic, can
be expected to grasp all the details.
In the ideal world, the consumer would know where to go to find objective,
expert advice - just as, in the world of transport, one can summon the AA
man to ask his unbiased opinion on a used car. But, in the real world, there
is a complex structure of salesmen, tied agents and independent financial
advisers plus an alphabet soup of regulators.
It is easy for a consumer to be bewildered if told 'Hello. I'm a
Fimbra-registered IFA.' Even if you understand what that meant, because of
the commission system, you still could not be sure of receiving an unbiased
view.
The FT has consistently taken the line that the system of commission,
whereby an adviser or salesman is paid by the company for selling a product
and not by the customer for the advice given, is open to abuse. The personal
pension scandal puts the problem in a nutshell. Salesmen knew they would
earn lots of money if they recommended a transfer into a personal pension,
but nothing at all if they told people to stay put. Surprise, surprise. They
recommended a transfer, often without completing the paperwork properly.
At last, things are changing. New rules will mean that investors must be
told how much commission salesmen and advisers earn. Not only is this right
in itself, it will give a boost to the system of fee-based advice, which we
believe is much more likely to give consumers an impartial view. Until now,
many consumers have been unwilling to pay fees, because they believe they
are getting 'free' advice elsewhere.
* * *
When I started this job in August 1990, it was a great time to invest in
equities and bonds. But many savers preferred the 15 per cent they could
receive from cash and now are contemplating dwindling building society
incomes.
I have consistently prodded savers to diversify from cash. Alas, I went
wrong this year and under-estimated the scale of the rally which has taken
the stock market from very high historic valuations to even higher ones.
Inflation has fallen much further than I expected; that has made investors
very optimistic about the prospects for falling interest rates and has
caused a massive shift from cash and into equities and bonds.
Nevertheless, I am still nervous about the level of share prices. Are low
inflation and slow economic growth really compatible with soaring corporate
profits? And if we have moved to a low inflation era, should we still value
the market on the basis of the yield ratio used in the inflationary 1970s
and 1980s? After all, for much of the 1950s, equities yielded more than
bonds.
* * *
One thing I did get right this year was to draw readers attention to the
O'Higgins theory. This was developed by an American fund manager who looked
at the 10 highest-yielding shares in the Dow-Jones index and then picked the
five with the lowest absolute share prices. A portfolio consisting of these
stocks outperformed the Dow by an average of around 9 per cent a year
between 1973 and 1991. I applied the theory to the FT-30 index and found it
seemed to work in the UK, too. At the start of the year, the method picked
five stocks: Blue Circle, British Gas, Forte, Hanson and Lucas. The average
gain for the five this year (including gross dividends) was 46.8 per cent;
the All-Share (also including dividends) is up 28.7 per cent.
Of course, the theory does not work every year (it just seems to work over
the long term) and a portfolio of just five stocks inevitably will involve
more risk. Besides which, the FT-30 index is hardly used these days, so that
could affect the theory's success. Still, I am sufficiently encouraged to
apply the theory again to the FT-30's present constituents: Allied Lyons,
Asda, BICC, Blue Circle, BOC, BTR, Boots, BA, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury
Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson,
ICI, Lucas, M&amp;S, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, SmithKline Beecham,
Tate &amp; Lyle and Thorn EMI.
The result is that three of 1993's selections are picked again: British Gas
(344p, 5.2 per cent yield); Hanson (273.5p, 5.2 per cent); and Lucas (197p,
4.4 per cent). The additions are BICC (408p, 5.9 per cent yield) and Tate &amp;
Lyle (397p, 4.1 per cent). All figures are based on the FT of December 30.
One reader asked what the O'Higgins method would choose in the US. Based on
December 29 closing prices, the system would select American Express,
DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Union Carbide and Woolworth.
* * *
Finally, my thanks to all those readers who wrote over the years, with
questions, suggestions and (mostly constructive) criticism. May your
portfolios prosper.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Light at the end of Eurotunnel - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quantification of the unquantifiable, that's what you are asking.' Thus
one analyst summed up the difficulties of evaluating the 10-year extension
of Eurotunnel's concession on running the Channel tunnel. In return,
Eurotunnel is renouncing most of its claims for extra costs, estimated at
between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn, against the British and French
governments incurred because of increased safety, security and environmental
measures.
Eurotunnel will now hold the concession for 65 years, dating from the
Channel Tunnel Act in 1987. 'This largely resolves the outstanding issues
between the French and British governments and Eurotunnel,' said a French
official.
The news came out too late on Wednesday to affect the market. On Thursday
morning, though, investors showed they approved and the share price rose 34p
to 597p. Yesterday, it increased a further 13p to close at 610p, well up on
the week.
The profitability of the tunnel after it opens later this year is an unknown
factor, let alone the value of money in the year 2052. But Eurotunnel looks
on the verge of overcoming most of its troubles. In particular, the deal
with the two governments bodes well for the company's talks with its
bankers.
Eurotunnel still has to fund the whole cost of the project, now estimated at
Pounds 10bn instead of the original Pounds 4.8bn. While it has raised about
Pounds 8.95bn, it needs at least another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt
servicing before the tunnel begins to break even on a cash basis in 1998.
Deadline for a refinancing agreement for the Pounds 1bn is Tuesday. At least
Pounds 500m is expected to come from a rights issue, for which the company
won approval before Christmas.
Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's finance director, said the 10-year extension
would not accelerate the group's progress towards the rights issue, but it
would facilitate it. The issue is expected in spring, possibly as early as
March but more probably late in April or May. 'Once you have decided to go
down that route, the quicker you go the better,' Corbett added.
Further weeks of detailed negotiation lie ahead, even if a deal is reached
with the banks on Tuesday. But winning the extended concession has made the
road ahead look very much smoother.
Looking back just six months, Eurotunnel has resolved a whole raft of
troublesome issues. Among the most notable was the settlement at the end of
July of the long-running dispute with Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French
consortium of contractors building the tunnel, over responsibility for heavy
cost over-runs.
This was followed at the end of November by resolution of a dispute between
Bombardier, the Canadian supplier of trains for the shuttle service, and
Transmanche Link over the same issue. 'All the things that were giving the
banks sleepless nights a few months ago have been resolved - now it's up to
them to do their bit,' said Corbett.
Looked at alongside comparable civil engineering projects of the past,
Eurotunnel has not done too badly. Its cost over-runs pale into
insignificance alongside the Suez and Panama canals, each of which soared
more than 50 times over budget.
More recently, the single bore Seikan rail tunnel connecting the northern
island of Hokkaido to mainland Japan was completed after taking 24 years to
build - 14 more than planned.
The Channel tunnel will be running in March and the state opening by the
Queen and French President Mitterrand is set for May 6. The UK government
has resolved its dispute with Eurotunnel without having to pay out any cash.
With the black clouds disappearing rapidly, from the horizon, it is not
surprising that market sentiment has turned positive. And while investors
will still have to wait until the turn of the century for any dividends,
they can look forward to earnings coming on stream fairly soon - and those
with travel concessions will be able to use them.
As one analyst said yesterday: 'People who have held on this long have no
reason to sell now.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Wishing for even more happy returns - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ring out the old, ring in the new. But before considering future prospects,
investors and fund managers are entitled to indulge in some instant
nostalgia for the year that has just passed.
A period which started amid general foreboding about Britain's rude exit
from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the continuing grip of
recession on the UK economy, turned into a vintage year for both the equity
and bond markets.
During the year, pension funds enjoyed a 28 per cent return from UK
equities, including dividends, according to the WM Company which monitors
investment performance. Middle-sized and smaller companies significantly
outperformed the FTSE-100, with returns of more than 35 per cent.
Bonds provided returns in excess of 23 per cent on the back of falling bond
yields and stable inflationary conditions - the best return from UK bonds
for a decade.
Although the level of mergers and acquisitions continued to fall, merchant
bankers were able to keep busy with corporate restructuring, rights issues
and flotations, which reached a five-year high.
The strength of the market allowed analysts and traders to enjoy large
Christmas bonuses and saw a resumption of the jobs merry-go-round in the
City, after a long period of retrenchment.
However, the unlucky few who came in to staff trading desks in the dog days
between Christmas and the new year holidays had anything but a quiet life.
Arriving on Wednesday morning, they found overseas markets had raced ahead
during the Christmas break, and during the day the FTSE-100 gained 49.7 to
hit a new peak of 3,462. The fact that nearly all of the advance had been
shed by the time dealing closed at lunchtime yesterday was more to do with
technical factors than any underlying change in market sentiment during the
week.
It emerged that many fund managers had been content with the gains they
achieved during the market's autumn surge, and sought to lock these in by
using the increasingly popular derivatives market. However, few had foreseen
that the FTSE-100 would gain another 9 per cent in December, following the
City's relief over the November 30 Budget.
Some big institutions therefore had to scramble to buy shares to cover
positions they had taken in the futures market. Once those contracts had
been unwound, the pressure on prices quickly abated and the FTSE-100
yesterday closed at 3418.4, up a mere 6.1 on the week.
What might have seemed an unusual week in trading terms, demonstrated the
importance of two factors which have dominated UK equities in recent months:
the relative performance of overseas markets and investment decisions by the
big funds.
There are of course more fundamental reasons for the increase in the UK
market: falling interest rates and lower returns on competing investments,
combined with evidence that the domestic recovery is at last gathering
strength.
However, much of the market's recent strength has come from overseas
investors seeking a good return - particularly US investment funds, which
have seen Wall Street perform only modestly in spite of the continuing
recovery.
The chart shows that London has lagged behind the other European markets -
not to mention Hong Kong - even though the UK is expected in 1994 to be the
strongest growing major European economy for the second successive year.
This vote of confidence from overseas sits uneasily besides widespread
concern in London that the UK market's current rating is counting on a
recovery in earnings that companies will find difficult to deliver, given
the fragility of consumer confidence, continuing insecurity over employment,
and the tax burden which will be imposed on the economy when the Budget
increases take effect in April.
Equity strategists at UBS believe that the UK might be about to enjoy a
'golden scenario' - favourable growth and low inflation, crowned by a
substantive fall in the budget deficit, combined with firm sterling and
lower interest rates.
However, they caution: 'The gold turns to dross in later years of this
parliament, a reverse alchemy brought about by the Britain's deeper
structural problems. Although Mr Clarke's Budget clearly recognised some of
the dangers, the chancellor's modest measures will not in our judgment
prevent a medium-term resurgence of inflation.'
Nikko, the Japanese securities house, also sees some scope for further
advance by the UK market in the new year, in response to further falls in
interest rates.
But it cautions: 'As reality dawns, with the bottoming out of interest
rates, lower consumer confidence and a slowdown in the recovery, the market
is expected to stagnate.'
Year-end forecasts range from an unchanged 3,400 up to 4,000, but many
market watchers believe there could be a substantial fall in share prices if
and when the present cycle of low interest rates turns - as it could soon in
the US.
In this rather twitchy environment, investors are likely to seek out sectors
and companies which have so far missed out on the market's advance. Motors
may benefit from the combination of lower interest rates and increased
growth. As the reality of the slow economic recovery sinks in, investors
might also look to sectors which offer more defensive qualities.
Nikko also highlights the food retailers, which have underperfomed massively
and have a captive market, and domestic brewers and health and household
companies, which it believes offers above-market earnings performance after
a period of huge underperformance.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Forget the experts, watch the individuals - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The year 1993 was a record-breaker for the US stock markets, with the main
share indices ending the year close to their record highs. This week alone
the Dow Jones industrial average reached a new peak on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, before some late profit-taking stopped the winning streak.
Profit-taking was started by heavy selling on the Treasury market, which
pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond over 6.3 per cent.
Yet, the jump in bond yields was the result of bullish economic data.
Among the good economic news released this week was a big decline in the
number claiming unemployment benefits (to what was almost a five-year low),
strong existing and new home sales, buoyant retail sales, and healthy
leading indicators.
With share prices buoyant, interest rates still low, company earnings
steadily improving, and the economy showing signs of real and sustainable
strength, 1994 should be another year for the record books on US stock
markets, right? Well, maybe not.
While analysts agree that both the economy and corporate profitability
should grow at a handy pace this year, some fear this will lead to a revival
in inflation and higher interest rates which, combined with investors'
rejection of expensive stock values, will bring the long bull run to an end
in 1994.
Yet, if this year is going to be a disappointment, no one seems to have told
US individual investors. Judging by the rate at which they continue to pour
their money into stock mutual funds, investors are confident that 1994 will
be as rewarding as 1993, when the Dow gained more than 14 per cent, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 8 per cent and the Nasdaq composite climbed 13.5.
per cent.
Analysts estimate that net sales of stock mutual funds last month were up 30
per cent on a year earlier - although official figures for December have yet
to be released. That would take the total of stock mutual fund sales for
1993 to Dollars 220bn. This would easily eclipse the previous record for
sales set in 1992 of Dollars 142.9bn.
These huge flows of funds have driven share prices higher, even though
valuations have looked expensive historically.  Moreover, individuals have
been pouring so much money into stocks that they are beginning to reverse
the established trend of equities ownership in the US.
After the great stock market crash of October 1987, many individual
investors were scared away from equities (some feared for good), and over
the following years institutional holdings of stocks rose steadily while
individual holdings declined.
That trend, however, looks as though it is now being reversed. Figures
supplied by Birinyi Associates, a Connecticut-based financial markets
research firm, show that at the end of the third quarter of 1993, the value
of all US equities was Dollars 5,600bn. Of that total, 71 per cent was owned
by households, either in the form of direct holdings (Dollars 3,000bn) or
mutual funds (Dollars 1,000bn). That is a big increase from the three years
1990-1992, when households on average owned only 66 per cent of the value of
equities, and it is fast approaching the levels seen before the 1987 crash
when households accounted for as much as 75 per cent of equities ownership.
The message from all this is clear: if you want to find out about how the US
stock market will perform in 1994, look at what individual investors do, not
what experts say.
The weight of money into stocks can only keep pushing prices higher, and the
Dow, which has been flirting with 3,800 in recent days, will probably test
the 4,000 mark before 1994 is over. There's a happy thought for the new
year.

casts a satirical eye on the Financial Services Act
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER CAVE

<TEXT>
Since the passing of the FSA (Footwear Services Act), shoe wearers and their
feet are protected from the unscrupulous salesperson. Witness the care and
diligence displayed by the footwear adviser.
Client: I'd like to try on that pair of shoes.
Footwear Adviser: If I may say so, madam, before we investigate that
particular pair, we must establish your foot-wearing circumstances and
objectives; after all, it might be that you need cycling shoes or wellington
boots or silver slippers or . . .
C: Sorry, I haven't time for all that. Those should fit the bill or rather,
my feet.
FA: We must take nothing for granted, madam. After all, you wouldn't thank
me for selling you slippers if you needed mountaineering boots.
C: True, but I know what I want.
FA: But do you know what you need? Do you need what you want? Our duty is to
your needs.
C: Okay, I need those shoes . . .
FA: Standing before madam is an experienced professional adviser - yet madam
prefers madam's amateur hunch? Has madam passed the Footwear Advisers'
Competency Test?
C: Isn't that simply multiple choice - with questions such as where should
shoes be put on? Hands, mosque, bathtub, feet?
FA: Now, now - life under the sole of the FSA is to madam's advantage. No
more pre-FSA days of blisters and bunions - of which-shod businessmen and .
. .
C: Please, can't I just buy those shoes?
FA: I could accept the order as execution-only; but my head's on the line -
or, rather, under the boot. I'm allowed only one a year, but if you insist .
. .
C: Excellent - I'll try one on. One's in the window.
FA: Oops, sorry] By displaying it, we're already advising you, so
execution-only is impossible. Mind you, it's a left shoe in the window; I
could let you have the right one execution-only.
C: But not the left?
FA: No, we'd need a fact-find on your left foot. It will be difficult to
leave the right one execution-only.
C: You win] Let's answer your questionnaire - it can't take long.
FA: Indeed not; we'll have our next meeting in three weeks, when your
personalised footwear report is ready.
C: You mean I can't buy the shoes today?
FA: Think of the complexities - of insteps, style, fashion statements,
laces. What appears right to you might not really be right for you.
C: But why do you need to know about my other shoes and dresses and the
colour of my underwear - and about my carpets?
FA: Footwear affects, and is affected by, all manner of things. Does it
match your clothing, even when you're undressing? Might stilettos damage
your floors?
C: I see . . .
A thousand-and-one weary sighs later, the client stumbles into the street;
she is barefooted. It looks as if she needs shoes, but conclusions must not
be drawn hastily.
Three weeks later, the adviser is explaining his lengthy report . . .
FA: So, we've projected from your current needs, ensuring you are well
foot-clad throughout life.
C: But I came in just for a pair of shoes - not for a lifetime of laces.
Where are the shoes I first saw?
FA: Unavailable, madam. They were in a sale.
C: But they're the ones I . . .
FA: Ah, you were going to use that naughty 'want' word again, weren't you.
Look, here's a pair recommended for you.
C: They're not shaped in the way I . . .
FA: Beware the 'W' word, madam.
C: I mean - their shape fails to satisfy the needs of my desires and they're
far too expensive.
FA: Come, come madam, do not be fooled by price. Prize your feet, not the
cost. You'll also need the winter-wear recommendations on page 18. Your
children must have . . .
C: But this will cost thousands. I don't like this pair.
FA: See how well these shoes are projected to perform for the next 20 years.
C: For so long? Perhaps they are worth buying.
FA: Mind you, the projections are mythical with assumptions about pavements
walked and . . .
C: Still, they must give some idea of what I'd be getting for my money.
FA: Not quite, madam. The illustrations are not based on these shoes and
costs; they derive from an average abstract shoe, unworn by mortals.
C: But it says here that the past is no guide to the future, so why are we
discussing any of this? Why were you asking me about past walking habits? If
the past's no guide, it's all irrelevant.
FA: Ah, the FSA regulatory bodies say . . .
C: I've heard enough. I'm going]
FA: But this form needs completion with your friends' names - purely because
you might walk out together.
Regrettably the client failed to recognise the adviser's professionalism.
But not all was lost for the shoe company.
The next day, she saw a newspaper offer for the desired shoes. Different FSA
advertising rules permitted her to buy the shoes right off the page.
Unable to check the fit, she was lucky; they felt just right. Tragically,
she remains blind to her needs; she merely got what she wanted.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The accent is now on enterprise -
The BES's successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE PARRY-WINGFIELD and NEIL SHARMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From today, the business expansion scheme (BES) will be replaced by the
enterprise investment scheme (EIS), a switch designed to help unquoted
trading companies.
Investors in the new scheme will receive tax relief of only 20 per cent
compared with relief at their marginal rate for BES investments. As with the
BES, the investors must keep the shares for five years to secure the tax
reliefs. Capital gains will be tax-free, but, unlike the BES, capital losses
may be set against income tax or capital gains tax.
From the tax year 1994-95, an investor will be able to get relief on total
investments of Pounds 100,000 - an amount which could secure a tax refund of
Pounds 20,000 (the maximum under the BES was Pounds 16,000). This level of
investment would clearly represent a significant exposure to the high-risk
venture capital market.
An investor can take an active involvement in an EIS company through a paid
directorship. But an existing entrepreneur looking for new funds would not
be able to provide them through the EIS because the scheme applies only to
shareholdings of less than 30 per cent.
How attractive is the EIS?
The risk for investors who are involved in the running of a company may be
less than for those who do not. This underlines the fundamental axiom of new
business ventures: that personal capital has to be put at risk. The EIS
might, therefore, encourage entrepreneurs to risk their own capital, but
only for new ventures and only where they limit their investment to 30 per
cent. The relief against income tax or capital gains tax for a loss on the
first disposal helps only in sweetening a bitter pill.
For the pure investor, the EIS provides the opportunity to invest greater
funds in riskier ventures, with only limited potential for the security of
property backing, while getting lower tax relief. For both new and existing
companies, it provides a chance to raise further equity funds; the maximum
is now Pounds 1m a year.
Details of the restrictions to be placed on the level of property ownership
have not yet been announced. While it is reasonable to restrict the value of
property, such restrictions were a major hindrance to new business ventures
using the BES. Indeed, they caused some operations, such as hotels, to take
an unnecessary offsetting debt burden to allow the scheme to be used. Many
entrepreneurs would welcome an easing of the property restrictions to allow
business decisions to be made on fundamental grounds.
The EIS is likely to result in higher funding costs than the BES as
investors demand high returns to compensate for higher risk and promoters'
fees are increased to reflect the difficulty of attracting investors.
Conclusions
The EIS is welcome. It could provide much-needed equity capital and
investment opportunities, but it needs greater flexibility than the BES
provided for trading companies. The success of the BES was very much limited
to the private rented housing sector.
The chancellor of the exchequer may be optimistic in his estimates of the
sums which could be raised - nearly Pounds 500m before April 1997 -
particularly if the new rules bar many of the features of BES issues, such
as being able to provide a form of assured exit.
As the EIS will be restricted to trading companies, it would be more
attractive if investors could borrow, with full risk recourse, to fund their
investments (this was outlawed for BES issues) and were able to receive
their dividends in a tax-free form. It would be nice to see the EIS
providing the seed for tomorrow's larger companies rather than restricting
horizons.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Farewell, then, to the BES - It
became too much of a tax break for its own good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goats, gymnasiums, whisky, racing cars, hairdressers, hospitals, films,
Oxbridge colleges - you name it and there has been a business expansion
scheme involved. But the BES, which latterly became too good a tax break to
be true, was finally laid to rest last night.
Many will not mourn its demise, particularly those who invested in the many
trading companies which failed in the early years. For others, however, the
transformation of the BES from venture capital to property backed by cash or
bank guarantee means it has been a very good investment.
A major factor in its abolition was mounting unease - expressed most
critically by the Labour party - that the wealthy and BES sponsors were
benefiting at the expense of the state. The BES enabled investors to shelter
up to Pounds 40,000 a year at their top marginal rate of income tax as long
as they held their investment for five years. This meant that a 40 per cent
taxpayer could make a Pounds 20,000 investment in a BES at a net cost of
only Pounds 12,000.
Like its predecessor, the short-lived business start-up scheme (BSS), the
government's original intention was to raise finance for businesses by
providing tax incentives for investors.
But while the BSS, dogged by legislation that was too restrictive, accounted
for only Pounds 40m in its two years of existence, the BES brought in more
than Pounds 1.1bn in its last 10 months alone - more than a quarter of all
BES funds raised.
This should suggest that it was an unqualified success. But the largest
proportion of the money, Pounds 3.4bn, was raised only after 1988 when Nigel
Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, decided to use the BES to increase
the supply of private rented accommodation to improve labour mobility.
In the five years to 1988/9, the BES raised only Pounds 780m in total. The
graphic shows that annual investments increased slowly but steadily from
Pounds 105m in 1983/4 to Pounds 201m in 1987/8. But legislative changes
meant that investment in trading companies fell acutely in the 1988 tax year
and never recovered to the same degree.
Trading companies had a double blow in 1988. Not only did Lawson extend the
BES into a tool of government housing policy, he also capped (to Pounds
500,000) the amount trading companies could raise. But private renting
companies (and shipping) were allowed to raise up to Pounds 5m.
At first, the BES industry did not welcome these changes. In an open letter
to the chancellor, Charles Fry, chairman of the largest BES sponsor, Johnson
Fry - doubted that landlords would consider the scheme a good investment
because the security of tenure afforded to tenants was too great. Moreover
the reduction of the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 40 meant the
BES was a less valuable tax break than before.
Nevertheless, it raised twice as much in the 1988 tax year than in the
previous 12 months.
Financial services groups developed attractive, assured tenancy issues where
a qualifying company could buy houses and rent them for five years, after
which they could be sold and investors could collect any profits free of
capital gains tax. This was attractive in a strong property market and, at
the time, there were few who could predict the scale in the fall of property
prices, especially in the south-east of England.
In addition, 1988/89 was the last tax year in which investors could carry
back tax relief on BES investments to the previous year when the 60 per cent
income tax rate was in force. Sponsors were not slow to capitalise on the
marketing opportunities that this provided and flooded the market with new
issues.
Investors were attracted by brick-based assets where typical returns of 17
per cent a year were cited. This assumed a 10 per cent annual rise in
property prices and 40 per cent BES income tax relief.
Trade funds and trading companies raised only Pounds 29m in 1988/89 of the
Pounds 421m total. But they fared better the following year when the drop in
property prices made investors nervous of putting money into a falling
market.
Enthusiasm for the BES also waned that year when Lawson ended the double tax
advantages of investing in closed companies - those controlled by five
people or fewer. Investors had been able to gain tax relief on money
borrowed to invest in assured tenancies in addition to the usual income tax
BES relief.
If the trading companies thought the fall in property market prices would
mean a mass return by investors who had deserted them, they were
disappointed. Sponsors refined assured tenancy issues to allow exit routes
after five years, with a commitment by companies to buy back the shares from
investors.
Bank guarantees and backing helped to squeeze out the risks associated
normally with the BES, while distorting the spirit of the legislation.
Instead of stimulating the rental housing sector, universities and Oxbridge
colleges were allowed to use the tax breaks.
The notorious loan-back schemes developed in 1992 proved hugely popular,
accounting for two-thirds of BES funds raised in the '92/93 tax year.
Effectively, these allowed investors to leave the BES after only six months
instead of the full five years and were abolished in the March 1993 Budget -
by which time they had soaked up much of the burden of the repossessed
properties.
Arranged exit assured tenancies did not promise the same kind of return that
a successful trading company might offer. But their success in raising large
amounts of funds appears to have been due to a combination of the
attractiveness of the tax break and the asset backing provided.
By contrast, many of the early trading companies have lost investors' money.
BES specialist John Harrison estimates that, of the 227 trading companies
funded by public prospectus issues or collective funds in 1983/94, more than
100 have failed, including some of those which achieved a stock exchange
listing. The riskiest were the smallest - those raising less than Pounds
500,000 - which, up to 1988, showed a failure rate twice that of the larger
companies.
A study* published by the Small Business Research Trust in 1988 concluded
that the BES had fallen well short of the government's aims.
It found that the take-up rate of the BES was low compared with other
sources of equity finance for the small business sector, such as loan
guarantee schemes and the enterprise allowance scheme.
Furthermore, although the BES was intended largely to benefit high
technology businesses, the main recipients were in service sectors or in
asset related businesses, 'reflecting the attraction of the BES as a tax
shelter for higher-rate taxpayers with a predominant concern for security
rather than risk.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Towards a better '94 - The new year
is the time for making good resolutions. Bethan Hutton asks some financial
advisers for theirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again it is the season of good, but often doomed, intentions. Giving up
smoking or taking up regular exercise involves a great deal of effort and,
as January progresses, resolve can slip. But the state of your personal
finances could benefit from rather less stressful initiatives. We asked some
independent financial advisers to suggest 10 personal financial resolutions
for the new year.
Make sure you are getting the best from your bank and building society
accounts.
Some societies have recently started to shift investors' money from obsolete
accounts paying low interest rates into more up-to-date accounts, but many
societies still expect you to find out for yourself if you could be getting
a better return on your savings.
'Despite the recent initiatives from two major building societies, many old
accounts are still paying less than 1.5 per cent gross,' warns David Harris,
of Chantrey Financial Services.
Harris also reminds older savers to keep an eye out for the new income bond
for the over 65s, promised in the Budget and due to be launched by National
Savings in January.
Finally, young and old alike should be taking full advantage of the tax-free
saving opportunities of Tessa and save-as-you-earn accounts.
Either make a will or ensure that your existing one is up to date.
The contents of your will can easily be made inappropriate by changing
circumstances. Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, says potential problems he has
seen in clients' wills include named executors who are no longer in contact;
children possibly inheriting hundreds of thousands of pounds at the age of
18; and no residuary provisions if a spouse fails to survive. See a lawyer
if you think your will needs updating.
Intestacy provisions have been revised recently to give the surviving spouse
the first Pounds 125,000 of the estate if a spouse dies without a will, but
it is still simpler and more tax-efficient to specify in a will who should
get what.
Sit on your pride and ask for a cheaper company car,
says James Higgins, of Chamberlain De Broe. He points out: 'Company cars are
now to be taxed as a benefit in kind according to list price. Be green and
get a bike.'
Maintain a healthy scepticism towards 'risk-free' and high-return
investments that are too good to be true.
Harris warns particularly of investment and savings products offering
'guaranteed' returns in excess of those available from 90-day building
society accounts, and of salesmen promising magic solutions to your tax and
financial planning needs in the run-up to the end of the tax year.
Also, refuse to let yourself be bamboozled by jargon into investing in
complicated schemes you do not understand. 'Never accept that any investment
cannot be explained simply,' advises Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial
Services.
Buy bargains, not markets,
says Higgins. He thinks most equity markets look expensive at the moment,
but there are opportunities for value. 'Look for short-term anomalies (eg,
investment trusts at discounts wider than their sector average) and move
swiftly,' he adds.
Smith feels many good reasons remain for buying equities, but says: 'Timing
is always difficult, and salesmen are always at their most persuasive when
the markets are high.'
His solution is to make regular contributions over six to 12 months or
longer, using unit or investment trust savings schemes, phased personal
equity plans and equity-linked personal pensions, among other products.
Harris adds a recommendation to retain a prudently balanced portfolio
between equities, fixed interest and cash. He advises investors to be wary
of playing 'follow the herd' and switching their entire portfolio into
equities because interest rates have fallen.
Resolve not to put off retirement planning any longer.
'Pensions remain the most tax-efficient form of long-term saving and
security,' says Harris. He recommends maximising additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs) to occupational pension schemes, and contributions to
personal pension plans. 'Remember, in general, it is more beneficial to pay
lump sum single contributions than regular monthly contributions, as the
administrative charges are lower.'
There could still be good reasons to go for a pension transfer, in spite of
recent negative publicity. 'If you have left an employment and have a
deferred pension, there are a number of circumstances in which a transfer
might make good sense,' says Smith. But Harris warns that you should be
certain to get an independent opinion before making such a switch.
Even if you already have pension arrangements in place, review them
periodically. 'You might have another serious look at just how much you are
going to need to be able to retire,' say Robert Noble-Warren and Keivan
Borhani, of Murray Noble.
'With the state retreating from benefits in a number of areas - college
funding, state earnings-related pension, and provision for long-term care -
and the impact of lower interest rates and lower investment returns,
individuals now need to have much more available to them at retirement than
we have got used to.'
Don't expect your financial adviser to do all the work for you - keep
yourself informed,
advises Smith. 'We have noted a heartening trend that many clients these
days, especially those seeking fee-based advice, are much better informed.'
He recommends keeping up to date by reading the FT and publications such as
Money Management, Money Which? and Moneyfacts. 'While the trend seems to be
to penalise faulty advisers hard and ensure (rightly) that they comply with
the Financial Services Act, the best protection for the client is to know
what he or she is talking about, and have demanding requirements.'
Be a little European,
suggests Higgins. The French government is planning to privatise about 20
state-owned companies over the next couple of years, and UK investors can
apply for shares. 'As in the UK, it may be better to hold on rather than
just stagging these issues,' he says. 'Only relatively small amounts will
get in, so spread the applications around the family.'
Several stockbrokers are offering a special service using French currency
accounts to make it easier for you to apply for shares, while Mercury and
Kleinwort are both launching trusts which will specialise in European
privatisations.
Consider paying off your mortgage.
The returns could be better than keeping your money on deposit, now that tax
relief on mortgage interest is being cut to 20 per cent. 'If you can't pay
off the mortgage, at least switch to the best fixed rate you can find -
fixed lending rates are unlikely to come down much more,' says Higgins.
Try to make good use of your capital gains allowance, and other tax
allowances where possible.
This is something on which all the advisers agree, but Boyton cautions
investors never to make an investment decision for tax reasons alone.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Too cautious by half - Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson admits that he missed big profits by not trying anything
new in his dealings last year / Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON

<TEXT>
The young fox picked up the morsel of meat and took slow, deliberate bites,
with an expression rather like that of a small boy forced to eat over-boiled
Brussels sprouts. Then, it dropped the chewed meat and looked around for
something else. Watching from my study window the other day made me reflect
suddenly that, in 1993, my investment decisions had been rather like the
fox's behaviour.
It lives in a den in the wooded part of my garden, and the meat for which it
had shown its distaste had been used in a curry. Despite huge profits which
I could have made from investing in emerging markets such as Indonesia,
Pakistan and Malaysia, I ignored them completely in 1993 in favour of rather
more predictable fare. I had tried nothing really new.
At one time, foxes had a reputation for being clever and shrewd. They were
fast movers which had to seek out and catch much of their food. They also
ran the risk of being hunted and were said to be active mainly at night.
Now, many have moved out of the wild and into people's gardens. Housewives
look after them by leaving kitchen scraps. Foxes no longer have to get up at
dusk to forage for food. In my garden, they can be seen having fun from
morning to night. They have a comfortable lifestyle knowing there is plenty
to eat.
With a plentiful supply of profitable investments, I had no need to be
clever or shrewd in 1993. Although I hunted out a number of exciting
investment opportunities, I generally avoided putting any money into them -
preferring, instead, to sit back and let my existing investments provide
regular profits while backing other, well-known companies like Associated
British Ports (up from 373p at the start of the year to over 530p in
December).
My most 'daring' move probably was buying more shares in Lonrho at Pounds 1
each in May, although I believed the price was well-supported by assets. I
am not surprised it has now risen to around 130p.
Ashanti Goldfields, in which Lonrho has a large shareholding, is expected to
be floated soon on the stock market and this should highlight the value in
Lonrho - assuming there are no last-minute hiccups or unexpected
announcements.
In 1993, there were many suppliers of financial information. The FT's free
annual report service, detailed on the paper's share price pages, operates
24 hours a day so my 'hunting' hours no longer were confined to the business
day.
One of the most attractive dishes was set before me at the end of 1992 when
stockbroker Neilson Cobbold offered shares in a placing of OIS International
at 50p apiece. I sniffed around the placing document for this technical
inspection and testing services company and liked what I saw - but then
risked only a very modest amount for my personal pension scheme. OIS shares
are now around 77p each.
I missed one especially tasty dish in January. Early that month, an FT
reader overseas noticed I had written about my holding in a small company
called Treatt. He wrote to ask if I would be interested in buying a rather
large number of its shares from one of his relatives for around Pounds 1
apiece.
Unfortunately (for me), by the time the letter arrived - it took nearly
three weeks - the share price had risen to 130p.
It is now 145p. Although this gives Treatt a market capitalisation of only
Pounds 13.8m, I still like the company, which has carved a profitable niche
in the flavourings and fragrance industry. But I have not added to my
holding.
In 1993, I was far too cautious. I did not take the risks that I used to
take - such as wild gambles on the Vancouver exchange or large positions in
very small UK companies. While I was comfortable, I played safe.
None of my investments was shot-at in 1993. I avoided investing in Queens
Moat Houses; and although I used to have a holding in property company Mowat
(now in receivership), I sold that at a profit in 1989.
The worst thing for me was the sharp drop in the share price of Toye &amp; Co.
In January, the shares were 165p each but, after dreadful 1992 results, they
hit a low of 100p. Fortunately, I had only a very small holding and I sold
most of that for 128p in May. Its effect on my portfolio was less than a
flea bite.
Like a fox, I was very protective of my young children. That is why, as 1993
progressed and interest rates fell, I took most of their money out of
low-yielding bank and building society accounts (some of which now pay 1.5
per cent or less) and placed it in more profitable havens. This included
opening Young Sovereign accounts with the Skipton building society which
will, eventually, reward them with up to 8.5 per cent gross.
My wife and I used to hold Pounds 10,000 each in premium bonds, but their
performance was even more dismal than in previous years. Up to late
November, when I reduced my holding to Pounds 8,000, I had won only five
Pounds 50 prizes during the year.
But the Ernie computer, continuing to show its sexist nature, allotted my
wife seven Pounds 50 prizes. This meant that in every year but one since
1987, my wife had won more money than me. Meanwhile, my two daughters, who
each hold less than Pounds 200 worth of bonds, both won Pounds 50.
Page 549 of the Teletext service on Channel 4 gives the main bond-winning
numbers each week. Noticing that the winners tend not to have holdings that
end in three zeros, my wife reduced her holding to Pounds 7,980. So, we hope
we will be more successful in 1994. Indeed, in view of the coming changes to
bond prizes, we could well review our holdings again.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: New investment trusts target Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Investors who profited from the UK government's privatisation offers may be
tempted by two new investment trusts which offer small shareholders a chance
to take part in the coming European privatisation programme, writes Philip
Coggan.
Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation investment trust, to be launched
on January 11, will offer the chance to buy partly-paid shares, with 50 per
cent payable on application and the rest six months later. The minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000.
According to Kleinwort, around Pounds 100bn of privatisation issues are
expected to be launched on European stock markets over the next five years.
The main issuers are expected to be France, Italy and Spain. As well as the
expected utilities, companies in industries such as banking, insurance and
airlines will be available.
There are, however, a number of problems for UK private investors who want
to buy such issues - for example, the foreign currency risk, the need to
open an overseas bank account, and witholding tax on dividends. An
investment trust takes away these barriers.
Mercury Asset Management's European Privatisation trust will be launched in
February. Like the Kleinwort issue, it will have warrants attached on a
one-for-five basis and will be Pepable.
Full details of the Mercury offer are not yet available but the offer price
will be 100p and the annual management fee less than 1 per cent; Kleinwort's
fee will be 0.75 per cent.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Investment bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could you clarify the following points about single premium investment
bonds?
1. In calculating the gain referred-to in section 547(1) of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988, can the cost of a bond be increased in
accordance with the retail prices index (ie, in the way that the cost of an
asset subject to capital gains tax may be increased)?
2. Is the tax due subject to 'top-slicing' relief and is what I say in (a)
and (b) below correct?
For example, suppose that in 1992-93 John Smith cashed a bond he had held
for 17 policy years and realised a profit of Pounds 17,000. Apart from this
Pounds 17,000, he had taxable income of Pounds 15,000.
(a) With top-slicing relief, his taxable income would be increased by Pounds
1,000 to Pounds 16,000; thus, he would pay no tax on the profit of Pounds
17,000.
(b) Without top-slicing relief, his taxable income would be increased to
Pounds 32,000. He would then pay tax at 15 per cent on Pounds 8,300 of this
(viz, Pounds 1,245).
3. What precisely is meant by indexation losses?
1. No.
2. Yes, for the purpose of giving relief from the 15 per cent surcharge for
potential higher-rate taxpayers, but not for relief from the 12 1/2 per cent
age surcharge for basic-rate taxpayers over 64 (at the beginning of the tax
year); and, yes, your example is right.
3. If an asset within the scope of CGT (and not specifically denied the
benefit of indexation relief) was sold before Budget day for the same amount
as it cost originally (after April 5 1982), there will be an allowable loss
equal to indexation relief on the cost for the period of ownership: such an
allowable loss is generally called an indexation loss (ie, a loss which
simply represents indexation relief).

FT  01 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Losses can go forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have noted the Budget proposal to remove the indexation of capital losses,
with immediate effect, but I have not spotted any mention of change to the
carrying forward of previous losses.
For the past two years I have, with the Revenue's agreement, carried forward
losses for use against future gains and, to date, have not used them up
against gains during the present tax year. May I continue to do this?
Second, I have an enhanced scrip dividend and have read a number of
different explanations as to how it should be declared to the Revenue. The
Budget proposals affect only (a) actual or deemed disposals after November
29 and (b) deemed disposals before Budget day which result from
negligible-value claims made after November 29.
Your allowable losses which arose in earlier years are unaffected, as are
any allowable losses which arose before Budget day in the present tax year.
In view of your remark about 'the agreement of the Revenue,' perhaps we
should point out there is no procedure for the agreement of allowable losses
until after the end of the tax year in which potentially taxable gains arise
against which the old losses are to be set.
The courts have confirmed that any informal agreement of potentially
allowable losses, in anticipation of the realisation of subsequent
chargeable gains, is not binding on a tax inspector. You should, therefore,
retain all the papers needed to prove the amounts of past years' allowable
losses, at least until they have been deducted in future years' assessments.
Regarding the enhanced scrip dividend: it should be declared twice on your
tax return. First, it has to be declared as deemed income equal to 125 per
cent of the market value.
If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, for example, you will be charged to
income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on 125 per cent of the market value.
Second, the dividend has to be declared in the capital gains section. The
sale of the scrip is treated broadly as if it were a sale of a fully-paid
rights issue (taken up at a cost equal to the market value) by virtue of
section 141 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
This means that it must be related back to the shareholding from which it
arose, and the calculation will depend upon whether, for example, some or
all of your existing shares were acquired (or deemed to have been acquired)
before April 6 1982.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance
for quoted shares) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after April 5
1988).

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: M&amp;G's fee surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G is eliminating the 4.5 per cent initial charge on its Managed Income
fund personal equity plan and will introduce 'back end' charges instead. It
is leaving its 1.5 per cent annual fee unchanged.
Peps allow investors to shelter up to Pounds 6,000 in a general plan during
a tax year and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan, free of
income and capital gains tax. The tax benefits of a Pep have to be weighed
against the charges which plan managers levy. Since M&amp;G is the largest Pep
provider, the move is bound to heat up an already competitive market.
Explaining the reasons for removing the initial charge, marketing director
Peter Emms said: 'We believe that as well as providing good value, this move
will make the Managed Income Pep a more straightforward investment and,
thereby, provide an added attraction to people who have never invested in a
Pep.'
Those who are used to deposit-based investments can be put off when they see
that their initial investment of, say, Pounds 1,000, would fall to Pounds
955 as soon as they made the Pep investment. M&amp;G is hoping to make the Pep
more attractive by investing the full Pounds 1,000 and imposing early
withdrawal fees instead.
These are common in the US and were introduced for the first time on a UK
Pep by Fidelity 18 months ago. Since equities are a long-term investment,
back-end charges are a better idea than initial charges for investors; by
holding on to the Pep for long enough - usually only five years - it is
possible to escape the charge altogether.
Those who sell their M&amp;G Managed Income fund Pep within the first year of
taking it out will have to pay a 4.5 per cent charge, which falls to 4 per
cent in the second year. The charge drops by 1 percentage point each
successive year, so that those selling in the fifth year of investment will
not face one at all.
Under present rules, unit trusts cannot impose an exit fee, but this is not
the case under Pep regulations.
Although this is the first initial Pep charge reduction by M&amp;G, plenty of
other investment houses have implemented reductions. When M&amp;G launched the
fund last February, Cazenove and Fidelity also released high income funds,
both with lower charges. The Cazenove Bond Utility fund had an initial
charge of only 0.2 per cent and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent, although
those wanting to hold the fund in Pep form paid a further initial charge of
Pounds 35.
The initial charge for Fidelity's High Income fund was 2 per cent, in line
with the front-end reduction it had introduced several months earlier,
although the annual charge remained relatively high at 1.25 per cent.
The initial charge on Murray Johnstone's unit trust Pep is 1 per cent; at
Gartmore, it is 2 per cent (Gartmore's UK index fund, which tracks the FT-A
All-Share Index, has no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge).
Scottish Equitable replaced the initial 5 per cent charge on its Peps with a
flat-fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT, and introduced withdrawal charges for those
who sell in the first five years. But it also imposed an annual Pep fee of
0.875 per cent on top of its annual management fee.
Among investment trusts, Touche Remnant's Smaller Companies Pep has no
front-end or annual fees. Martin Currie has flat-fee Peps, based on four of
its investment trusts.
Although cutting the initial charge does not eliminate the bid-offer spread,
it will be reduced to only 0.5 per cent (the level of stamp duty) in M&amp;G's
case.
M&amp;G says it has not yet decided whether to remove the initial charge on Peps
in its other funds. It says it chose the Managed Income fund because this
has been its most popular Pep. At the end of November, 10 months after its
launch, the Pep had pulled in Pounds 95m.
The performance of all three income funds launched last February has been
similar. In the six months to December 1, M&amp;G Managed Income and Cazenove's
Utility &amp; Bond fund have grown by 13.6 per cent, while Fidelity's High
Income fund has increased by 12.6 per cent (offer to offer, income
re-invested; source: Hardwick Stafford Wright).
In the end, performance is more important than charges. But if two fund
managers are equally good, the one who runs the fund with the lower charges
will provide a better return to the investor.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: An upbeat outlook for private
investors - Philip Coggan finds that leading fund managers see declining
interest rates and increasing economic growth as the keys for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will 1994 be a good year for private investors? The Weekend FT asked four
leading fund managers for their views on prospects for the major stock
markets - the UK, US, Japan and Europe. All were fairly optimistic, with the
main themes being declining interest rates and an increased pace of economic
growth.
MICHAEL HART, of Foreign &amp; Colonial
'I am hopeful that the major markets can again make progress in 1994, even
after the good rises of 1993. The big question for investors at present is
to what extent declining interest rates in Germany will be offset by higher
interest rates in the US. The depressed state of the German economy means
that interest rates there have further to fall.
'Recently, the US economy has been recovering strongly. If this were to
continue, higher rates would be inevitable - and markets are already
discounting a 1 per cent increase. However, there are good reasons to
believe that US economic growth could moderate soon. Higher taxes are in the
pipeline and consumer savings are low, while debt is high. These factors,
coupled with a low inflation outlook, may stop interest rates rising much
further.
'It is possible that with a favourable interest rate background and
improving profits, and dividend prospects based on rationalisation and lower
financing costs, the FT-SE 100 index could climb further despite present
high valuations.
'For Wall Street, I am concerned that the market has been rising without a
10 per cent setback for the longest period in its history. Inevitably, some
bolt from the blue will upset the applecart, if only temporarily. But low
interest rates, low inflation and rising profits could see the Dow 5 per
cent above present levels at 3,900 by the end of 1994.
'Although share price valuations are high, falling interest rates, good
prospects of profits' recovery and the greater enthusiasm of local investors
for equities could take the major European markets higher - possibly 15 per
cent above present levels.
'At present, confidence is completely lacking in Japan and the market is low
 -it could be a good time to buy . . . Japan may be one of the better
markets in 1994, with a possible gain of at least 20 per cent.
'In the emerging markets, Mexico and India are probably the best bets, with
gains in excess of anything achieveable in the major markets.'
TIM THOMAS, of Guinness Flight
'In 1992 and 1993, it was easy to advise what to do with spare cash. Take it
out of the building society and put it into any financial asset - bonds or
equities - in the UK or overseas. But does that advice still hold true as we
enter 1994?
'In my opinion, as regards main-line markets, the answer is yes. But it is
possible that markets will reach levels this year which would make them
vulnerable to significant setbacks (more like the fall of October 1989 than
the crash of 1987). Markets are high but interest rates are low; and with
the exception of the US, where we expect rates to start to rise in the first
quarter of 1994, are likely to go lower on a world-wide basis. This will
keep equity and non-US bond markets rising as investors shift portfolios
away from cash.
'Following the sharp rise since the Budget, the UK equity market should put
in a steadier performance in 1994, possibly reaching 3,750 on the FT-SE 100,
while interest rates fall to 5 per cent. Europe, where the economies have
not yet started recovering, should rise 15-20 per cent over the year, with
Italy possibly being the best performer.
'Japan should see some hopeful economic signs and this could lift the market
substantially; but the currency should slip against the US dollar, although
it will enjoy a small rise versus sterling. The Far Eastern markets are
likely to continue to attract money as the 'hot' growth area of the world
and price/earnings multiples may expand several points, providing 25 per
cent-plus returns in local currency and more in sterling terms.
'The US market, with the economy strong and rates starting to rise, may be a
relatively poor performer (offering returns of, say, 10 per cent) but should
benefit from a resurgent dollar, which could reach Dollars 1.25/Pounds . So,
1994 should be another good year for investors; but, by 1995, the easy money
will have been made.'
DAVID ROSIER, of Mercury Asset Management
'In 1994, we believe that, for the fourth year in a row, there will be
modest overall world economic growth. We expect inflation to remain low and,
consequently, believe there is more scope for falls in interest rates. We,
therefore, expect further progress in both equity and bond markets.
Nevertheless, there will be periodic worries that either growth will abort
or that inflationary pressures are emerging. Volatile stock markets are
likely.
'There remains further up-side in the UK stock market. In the context of
moderate but sustained economic growth and low inflation, the market is
attractively valued relative to continental Europe.
'Clearly, the forecast of a lower than anticipated public sector borrowing
requirement in the recent Budget benefited gilts. With gilt yields
declining, the attraction of equities also increased. However, after its
recent progress, it is likely that the UK market will consolidate in the
short term until further evidence emerges of a recovery in corporate
earnings.
'We would recommend an under-weighting in the United States, where the
market will no longer be assisted by interest rate falls. Indeed, interest
rates there may edge upwards as the Federal Reserve Board seeks to control
the rate of US economic growth, so allowing the dollar to strengthen.
'In Japan, it is probable that corporate profits will show little recovery
in 1994, even before major corporate restructuring. We believe the
authorities there may not respond sufficiently quickly to avert a further
deterioration in the economy. In this situation, yen bonds remain a
preferred asset class and there could be some delay in the anticipated
weakness of the yen.
'Continental European markets should benefit from further interest rate
declines. However, valuations are high and there is scope for disappointment
with both economic growth and corporate earnings.
'Finally, we believe that the outstanding growth prospects assisted over the
medium term by the recent Gatt agreement will continue to justify investment
in the Pacific basin and emerging markets areas. Evidence suggests that
investors will want to increase their exposure to them, providing further
support.'
COLIN McLEAN, of Scottish Value Management
'I think 1994 will confound the pessimists, since growth in the global
economy is accelerating and there is little sign of inflationary pressures.
Most of the surprises should be favourable - with Japan eventually
responding to a massive economic stimulus, and interest rates continuing to
fall in continental Europe. The weak oil price gives a further boost to
global growth prospects, while underlining the deflationary pressures.
'Lax US monetary policy is feeding dollars into financial assets rather than
the real economy. This has been the right policy to pull the US out of
recession, but it has also boosted other dollar-based markets, such as south
east Asia.
'Even so, liquidity-driven stock markets are not yet a recipe for a repeat
of 1987. Indeed, one of 1994's surprises could be that US growth will pick
up further - but without the inflationary signals that would require the Fed
to tighten. In this environment, US share valuations do not yet seem
over-stretched.
'The search for growth should see investors continuing to pile into Far
Eastern markets. Not only should the tiger economies perform well, but Japan
also has the potential for a rebound.
'It took some time to kick-start the US economy, and so Japan's sluggishness
is not surprising. Japan's restructuring will be a long haul, but the
present level of the Nikkei under-values the economy's inherent strengths
and the likely turnaround in the coming year.
'With unemployment still the major issue in Europe, further interest rate
cuts are likely. This prospect should underpin most European markets, such
as Germany and Italy. And US money will flow into Europe - attracted by
privatisations and the region's potential as a late cycle investment.
'I also believe that UK shares will have a good year, although many more
profits warnings will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall
outlook of slow growth and optimistic company forecasts.
'The risks are in sectors that seem bargains - such as food retailing -
where profits estimates are still too optimistic. 1994 could remind us what
an earnings-driven market is like. After easy gains from widespread
re-ratings, investment performance is now likely to be driven by earnings
surprise.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Property: Profits replace purges as demand explodes - The
booming housing market in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most famed block of flats in Moscow is a vast grey block across the
river from the Kremlin. Known as the Government House, or the House on the
Embankment (the latter after the novel by Trifonov), it was built for
ministers and high government officials in the 1930s.
The flats are large, airy, high and light. They were at once the summit of
Soviet achievement and among the most dangerous of living quarters: when the
Communist party purges started in the 1930s, the NKVD cars would, early in
the morning, slip quietly into the courtyards to collect this or that senior
comrade for a journey from which he did not return.
No more of that today. The stairways echo now to the self-confident
conversation of expatriates speaking in English, German, French and
Japanese. Many of the flats have been renovated, the wood polished, the
imported Scandinavian and Italian furniture placed to best advantage.
For Dollars 3,000 a month up, you can look out on the Kremlin at night and
thrill to the vicarious fantasy that the black Volga idling on the street
below waits for you. But the mad scramble for profit in the Moscow housing
market has replaced the NKVD as the main disturber of the peace in this and
other elite blocks.
Most people in Moscow pay very small rents to their local municipality for
their flats: a rent of Dollars 5 a month is high. Those who can move in with
parents/children and rent their flat to foreigners for Dollars 300-plus a
month thus make huge gains, and many do. But when the parents/children get
fed up, the landlord usually tries to eject the tenant. The only recourse
the tenant has (if he is savvy) is to threaten to enquire of the Inland
Revenue whether the landlord is declaring his income. The dispute usually
ends in violence, or the threat of it.
This, though, is the low end of the market. The higher end is big money.
Already, says one UK lawyer who specialises in Russian property work, elite
districts are emerging in a Moscow which was officially (and, in part,
actually) monochromatic as to class and income differentials.
'Patriarch's Pond (near the centre) is coming up nicely,' he says, 'and the
Lenin Hills area (where the town houses of the party bosses were). Also the
Stalin Buildings (vast, neo-Gothic fantasy blocs of which two were apartment
complexes) at Vosstaniya and Taganka are much sought after.'
For foreigners who want to live the suburban life, purpose-built estates are
now available: 'communities' constructed outside the Moscow outer ring road
which, typically, are well-protected against increasingly self-confident
criminals and have their own services and shops. Rossinka, one of the first,
was pounced upon by American companies but later ones are more mixed, while
the newest are largely for the emerging Russian rich.
This new class - conspicuous in its top-of-the-range foreign cars with
personal guards and luxurious clothes - constitutes a small but significant
section of the population. However it gets its money, it wants to spend it
rapidly. The houses - or kottedzhi, after English cottages - it buys on new
estates, like the Moscow Country Club or Istrinskoye, are at least Dollars
180,000 and can be three times as much.
The old ruling class had dachas, usually of wood, on secluded estates round
Moscow. The first wave of the new rich, and the first foreign dachniks, took
over many of these as the former tenants were ejected or retreated to their
Moscow flats. Now, those in the new wave want to make a break with the
decorous and languid routine of long dacha weekends: their brick houses are
for their families, out of the Moscow danger and dirt. The two-car garages
are for the Mercedes and the Jeep Cherokees; the smaller house at the foot
of the garden holds the driver, cook and maid.
Like other foreigners in Moscow, I rent a dacha about an hour from Moscow.
It stands on an Academy of Sciences estate which once was reserved for
physicists. An academy deputy-president, Konstantin Frolov, who led the
wholly unsuccessful Dignity and Charity Party in the recent election
campaign, has the dacha next door, with brick walls and a drive.
For a reasonable sum (no one talks about rents), I have a six-room,
two-storey wooden house in about two acres of ground, mainly wooded, sloping
down to the Moscow river. It has fierce gas central heating, erratic light
and (a great comfort this, distinguishing the elite from the proletarian
dacha) an indoor flushing toilet.
The landlady is the wife and daughter of an academic: she inherited 'my'
dacha from her late father, while using that of her present husband. She and
he, in late middle age, are not creatures of another age; they are
fascinating and sympathetic people. But they are, typically and
uncomfortably, poised between regarding what they are doing - renting a
house - as distasteful and trying to get as much as possible for it.
Moscow property is in the same no-man's land as all of Russia. The rawest
free market principles, backed by obvious and always-present threats,
prevail in the midst of a ruined socialism. Activity is intense; on my
estate, with some 40 original wooden dachas, there are half as many again of
new brick ones being thrown up. The remaining academics, like Frolov, hate
it. What have these new owners done to deserve a dwelling which took them
years of scientific endeavour?
Merely made money. But there it is.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Property: Prices start the long climb back - But don't
expect anything more than a gentle recovery from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With not a property bear in sight in 1994, happy days are here again. Or
such is the gospel according to every Knight, Savill, Strutt and Wood. But
is it believable? Will prices really rise by 19 per cent across the country
and 25 per cent in the best parts of London as Yolande Barnes, head of
Savills' residential research, prophesied before Christmas?
Certainly, gloom and bust vanished last year. The property scene turned from
late autumn 1992, when foreign buyers set the central London market rolling.
Spotting prices way below the peaks of 1988-89, plus a low pound, political
stability and a country that looked to be the first in the EU to be coming
out of recession, they bought houses and flats galore. In no time, agents
were claiming they did not have enough to sell.
Last year was an odd one, partly because buying carried on into the winter
but did not then follow the usual pattern of trading peaks in spring and
autumn. January and February were surprisingly good, says Trevor Abrahamson
of Glentree Estates, which sells in the prime parts of the north-west London
suburbs. So was August. In between, fears about the March budget stifled the
winter improvement and stopped potential vendors from selling.
Then, the government seemed to lose its grip - another blow to vendors'
confidence. Not surprisingly, June was poor. And it all happened again in
the autumn. While the market during summer showed continuing signs of
recovery, the second Budget in November became a convenient excuse for
putting off any decision about selling until the spring. At least there is
no looming Budget to upset confidence this year - but the tax increases and
VAT on household energy could prove a problem.
Another twist to 1993 was the high number of repossessions caused by the
recession, along with houses which stayed on the market. These were sold
eventually, often at auctions - which became a regular way of selling
batches of properties.
By the end of the year, prices had stabilised on average around the country,
and risen in London (7 per cent according to Abrahamson). Bold vendors had a
good chance of getting their asking prices if these were reasonable. But ask
too much and buyers shy away, however much money they have.
For some good, highly desirable houses, the asking price has come down.
Eilean Aigas, the island domain in the Beauly river in Scotland, is now
Pounds 600,000 (down from Pounds 800,000); and Kingsmead in north Wiltshire,
which has a topiary tree house in the garden, is Pounds 950,000 (originally,
Pounds 1.2m).
All the same, there is still a large imbalance between demand and supply.
That is the key to 1994, and justifies the bulls' forecasts of higher
prices. Take two Surrey houses, priced at Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 850,000,
which had failed to sell for four years. Their owners were then offered the
full amounts - but have withdrawn them from the market to wait for a better
price this year.
Surrey, which led the market into recession, seems now to be pulling it out
again - no wonder Barnes' forecast is so cheery. But Yorkshire is sceptical.
Tim Blenkin of Blenkin &amp; Co., Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate in York,
'verges on the positive side of neutral.' He points out that Yorkshire
thrift meant prices there fell less than elsewhere during the recession
because local people did not have to sell to raise cash. Likewise, they will
rise less.
I see a general picture of moderate cheer. Of course, conditions are
excellent. It is 15 years since houses have been so affordable, especially
for first-time buyers who can obtain attractive packages. Mortgage interest
rates and inflation are low and - much more important - look set to stay so.
A fixed-rate mortgage gives certainty in financial planning for five years
at a time. And, with unemployment down, job security looks less chancy.
Memories are strong, though. If Christmas sales were not what retailers had
expected, buyers will not be stampeded into paying over the odds for homes,
either. The prices paid in 1988-89 are still on the far horizon, but they
will occur in 1994 as isolated peaks.
Large end-of-year bonuses have given City workers the power to bid
aggressively. That will create a pull from the top which 'could start a bush
fire,' according to Tommy de Mallet Morgan of Savills' Guildford office.
(London taxi drivers would agree. Their business, always one of the first
things to suffer in bad times, has picked up).
This competition will raise prices and make more vendors eager to sell, buy
elsewhere and commission builders (if they need them) before they put up
their prices - as they are bound to do now they are getting more jobs.
If we are out of the valley and on the up, with the prospect of some real
increases in value, I still expect wide variations across the country. Those
who have waited can probably ask now that bit more: Pounds 275,000, say,
rather than Pounds 250,000. (Abrahamson expects a general rise of 10 per
cent). If the money goes on a move to Wales from Surrey, that buys a
considerable house.
It will not be a boom and it will not be a bust. In most of the country, the
rise will be a gentle ascent. Supply will give way to demand; it must. But
not overnight.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Gardening: Traditional edge to the Sloane-Walleys' year -
Robin Lane Fox looks in on the festive season at the Old Rectory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Down in Sussex Old Rectory, Julian and Veronica Sloane-Walley have spent a
wet and windy week recovering from their annual bout of competitive present
giving. They are veterans by now of seven years' country living since the
move from Onslow Gardens in Chelsea at an unwise point in the property
market in 1986. By tradition, each competes with the other for the least
expected present which will be Truly Useful in the coming year.
Julian fortunately had resisted the temptations of the main window of Peter
Jones, the up-market department store in London's Sloane Square. It was not
so much the sight of Her Ladyship's Kitchen Garden (which appeared to amount
to a packet of parsley seeds, a plastic top and a nostalgic box for Pounds
2.99) as the Natural Herbal Revitaliser at Pounds 1.95. It was advertised
for the Weary Gardener who is Behind with the Weeding, Crooked with the
Edges, Late with Pruning and has Grass in the Path . . .
Maturity has not always brought marital harmony to the Sloane-Walleys'
gardening and there are times when Julian wishes Veronica was not so
damnably green. Apart from three proper meals a day, he insists on little in
life except exemption from equestrian duties, properly clipped edges to the
lawn and weed-free paths. He often thinks Veronica is being deliberately
awkward when she refuses to use weed killers 'in the country.'
This year, he believes he has finally outwitted the yearly problem of the
Old Rectory path. While visiting his bank in Mayfair, Julian happened to
notice London's most familiar plant: the drills, compressor and lorry of the
capital's leading Irish engineer, whose workmen were hacking up the pavement
when not in a tabloid-and-Thermos mode.
A quick dialogue through the window of the Volvo established that the old
paving slabs were going nowhere in particular and, despite their weight,
could make the short journey into the Sloane-Walley boot at a mere Pounds 1
apiece. Mayfair is not Onslow Gardens, but Julian has now ferried 28
priceless old paving stones in three separate runs and stored them in the
lower garage at the Old Rectory while managing to persuade Veronica that he
has to commute by car, not train, at this time of year because British Rail
is being disrupted by gales and the hazard of twigs on the track. With
Network SouthEast, alibis are easy.
The paving will make an excellent path and stand as a personal coup:
Julian's recognition of Veronica's nostalgia for the London pavements, a
nostalgia increased by seven years with the children's pony in an
over-brokered corner of Sussex. At least she can now walk out on a carpet of
old Mayfair, if not Chelsea. And when the slabs are pointed properly, there
will be no need to argue about spraying and applying weed-killer while
Veronica is out shopping at the local freezer centre.
Freezer shopping, in fact, has taken a different role in the Sloane-Walley
year. In January, Veronica became fed up with all the talk of recession and
deided to earn her keep by fee-paying demonstrations. (Julian did annoy her
by asking if they were to be demonstrations of pony management by a former
Londoner, as neither of them is proud of the fact that the old family pony,
Peter Jones, has suffered twice from mud fever since the rain started again
this summer).
Veronica had set her sights on cooking, in the belief that country dinner
parties are now dominated by exactly the same recipes from the book by
Raymond Blanc. Since its launch this spring, Onslow Entrees has been a
roaring success. Half the housewives in Sussex turn out to be as fed up
during commuting hours as she is, and the sessions have developed a
pleasantly therapeutic give-and-take. Veronica takes the fees and many of
the clients give their best recipes - which she can then re-cycle to
customers on the next week's course.
In July, she suffered the fate of every small business nowadays which starts
to sprout green shoots: an uninvited visit from the health and safety
inspector. The kitchen passed muster, largely because she had sent Harvey
and Nichols, her pair of Jack Russell terriers, away to her mother for the
week before inspection. The problem was the plumbing.
Julian had been adamant that he did not want a mass invasion of his home's
WC by fee-paying customers, and insisted they must use the outdoor lavatory
adjoining the tool shed, a stone's throw from the kitchen door. But under
Section 391A of the Health and Safety (Bottomley) Act of 1990, it is not
permissible for commercial premises to offer toilet facilities in a detached
or separated building unless that building is connected to the point of
office egress by an approved shelter.
Veronica tried to butter up the inspector, but he only became more truculent
when she gave him a quick sketch of a possible wooden pergola on the back of
an Onslow menu. Then he struck a mortal blow by asking if the rectory was a
listed building.
In a fit of domestic exhibitionism, Julian had recently drawn the arguable
merits of its late-Victorian facade to the local conservation officer, and
had succeeded in having it listed grade II on the ground that this would
enhance its market value. This meant that Veronica's plan would have to go
before the local council's planning committee before HM Inspector could
clear it for health.
In August, the committee rejected the pergola on the grounds that it would
be standing in a listed context and, in keeping with Sussex period
vernacular, the connecting passage would have to be tile-hung. Veronica has
already written to John Major about idiotic legislation and the urgent need
for his party to prune most of the undergrowth it has have introduced.
She did, however, wear her other hat and point out to the planners that the
Old Rectory garden had undergone extensive landscaping without any mention
of 'period vernacular.' Since she now opened it on a Gardening Sunday, she
regarded herself as fully entitled to build a pergola, not a tile-hung
extension, in order to meet the objections to her unobjectionable loo. The
planning committee was predictably weary, but called for a planting scheme
before it could consider a decision.
In October, Veronica sketched in her suggestions. Old Sloane-Walley
favourites like rose Danse du Feu joined newcomers like the yellow-leaved
choisya Sundance and a backbone of pyracantha Golden Cheer for evergreen
colour in winter. She added 'VSW Fecit' to her artist's impression and sent
it off, expecting to be able to give Julian the unexpected present of
planning approval on Christmas day.
Five days after Christmas, she received a buff envelope. The environmental
health department was satisfied, with the proviso that the pyracantha was a
berry-bearing shrub and must be certified as non-poisonous; but the chairman
of the planning committee had the cheek to write that he himself was a keen
gardener; that he had kept abreast of the art for years by reading the
Weekend FT; and that every one of her proposals was unsuitable - vulgar, to
be frank - in a grade II setting.
Veronica wrote at once to the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at
Wisley, Surrey - where she first saw the plants - and asked for a letter
supporting her choices. In her annoyance, she also saw the chance for a New
Year present which Julian probably wanted most and expected least.
For years, she had banned Julian from having the FT on a Saturday because,
she said, it belonged in the office, not the home. She has changed tack,
wanting ammunition against the planners; as from today, she has cancelled
the Telegraph and given Julian a year's subscription to the paper he has
wanted for years.
She, meanwhile, will take the chance to discover how on earth, in this day
and age, a Sussex planning committee can dare to tell a Sloane-Walley they
are not being horticulturally correct.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: Naked truth about whisky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER

<TEXT>
WHISKY
by Gavin D. Smith
Carcanet Pounds 14.95
Once a firewater distilled in remote Scottish and Irish glens, whisky is now
one of the top five UK exports. It is also a drink whose image has been
carefuly nurtured with the help of such words as 'old', 'de luxe' etc; a
'craft' item rather than a 'factory' product - a drink that demands
'connoisseurship' of its imbibers if it is to be enjoyed to the full.
In fact, the vulgarities have been refined away to such an extent that one
of the principal purposes of drinking it - to get drunk, - has almost been
lost to view. It is good therefore to be reminded of other, earthier ways of
appraising its qualities - such as that old Gaelic toast, 'You are the
prowler of the night to the beds of virgins. Oh God, what powers you have to
gain kindnesses from girls.'
The different vocabularies of drinking in the UK and the US are interesting.
In Scotland, measures of whisky are the dram, the nip, the tot, all of which
suggest something cosy, fraternal and unthreatening. In the US it is the
belt, the blast, the slug - aggressive, macho words which suggest that a man
walks tallest at the very moment when he is beginning to buckle at the
knees.
According to Whisky by Gavin D. Smith (Carcanet, Pounds 14.95), a marvellous
new book which examines the rich, peaty and extensive vocabulary of whisky
and its distillation, the secret of whisky-making was brought to Ireland
from the Middle East in about the 6th century AD. For centuries, however, it
remained a cottage industry. The first commercial blended whisky, Ushers OVG
(Old Vatted Glenlivet) was launched in Edinburgh in 1853, and it was the
blended whiskies that made the fortunes of Buchanan, Dewar, Walker and other
legendary names that have now been absorbed into United Distilleries. Sales
boomed because of the Phylloxera epidemic that virtually destroyed the
French brandy industry in the second half of the 19th century. Whisky
stepped in to slake the thirst of brandy drinkers.
Whisky has caused some trouble in its time - the great American Whisky
Rebellion of 1794, for example. The distillers up in furious protest against
the first tax ever imposed upon spirits in North America. Excisemen were
assaulted in the streets; there was a march on Pittsburgh. That Virginian
distiller General George Washington marshalled a force of 13,000 troops to
put the rebellion down.
Down the centuries the distillers have always played a cat-and-mouse game
with the exciseman. After the Act of Union in 1707, the avoidance of excise
duties became a point of honour to the Scots, and illegal still sprang up in
the most ingenious of places - one Scottish still was set up in a cave
behind a waterfall, so that the smoke rising from it would be mistaken for
spray by the untutored eye.
If the success of blended whiskies in the mid 19th century helped to
establish whisky's popularity once and for all, it has been the growth in
the production of single malts in recent years that has raised whisky's
profile as a drink fit for connoisseurs. The sale of malt whiskies
represents only a tiny proportion of total whisky sales; but the profit on
the sale of a bottle of Glenlivet - the best-selling single malt whisky in
the US - is correspondingly greater because it is taxed at the same rate as
the cheaper bottles.
But for those who are not yet connoisseurs of malts - or even guzzlers of
blended supermarket whiskies - a problem of etiquette remains: how exactly
do you ask for a Scotch when in Scotland? Certainly not by asking for 'a
Scotch'. No, ask rather for 'a whisky'. 'Not a single whisky' though. A
'single whisky' is not one measure of whisky, but a whisky made in only one
distillery, and not blended with any from elsewhere. And if you want a
single malt, do not on any account ask for 'a single malt'. Not to specify
which particular single malt would be taken for a signal of woeful
ignorance.
And do not be crass enough to request anything other than water with the
whisky. As the old adage runs, 'There are only two things a Scotsman likes
naked, and one of them is whisky.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: The dramatic tales of other people's lives -
Biography and autobiography, political or otherwise, seem to be publishers'
favourites for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best thing about the British publishers' lists for the next six months,
you may feel, is that the 1993 flood of political autobiography has dried
up. True, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Lady Thatcher (part II) and, we suspect, Norman
Lamont have been scribbling away, but they do not look like landing in the
bookshops before the summer.
Addicts of Westminster will have to make do with Robert Shepherd's biography
of Iain Macleod (Hutchinson) or even with ex-Catholic Herald editor Peter
Stanford's life of Lord Longford (Heinemann) - or perhaps Clare's Kitchen by
Clare Latimer will offer more than menus and recipes from Downing Street
(Bloomsbury). Another grim option is Edwina Currie's first thriller, A
Parliamentary Affair (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). Enoch Powell has come up trumps -
but with a new translation of St Matthew (The Evolution of the Gospel:
Yale).
More compelling drama seems likely to come from Clive Ponting's Winston
Churchill, promised to be an 'at times painful and uncomfortable
reassessment' (Sinclair-Stevenson). We are also supposed to look forward to
revelations about Lord Mountbatten (Mountbatten: The True Story by Brian
Hoey: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson). At least we can be sure that Kenneth Harris's The
Queen will be respectful (Weidenfeld). It may do a little to balance the
memoirs of Major Ronald Ferguson (The Galloping Major: Macmillan) and Diana:
Once Upon A Time by the Princess of Wales' childhood nanny, Mary Clarke
(Sidgwick &amp; Jackson).
*
As the literary pages demonstrate, the British love biographies, and they
seem to have a particular penchant for the lives of writers, which can only
be because people somehow think the revelaiton of the writer's life will
disclose the secret of craft. These next months will bring what promise to
be important books on Kipling the Poet by Peter Keating (Secker &amp; Warburg),
Roald Dahl by Jeremy Treglown (Faber), Richard Hughes by Richard Perceval
Graves (Andre Deutsch), Charlotte Bronte by Lyndall Gordon (Chatto &amp; Windus)
and Christina Rossetti - on the centenary of her death - by Jan Marsh
(Jonathan Cape). Add to these Shakespeare: A Dramatic Career by our foremost
Stratford scholar, Stanley Wells (Sinclair-Stevenson), and The Life and Lies
of Bertolt Brecht by John Fuegi (HarperCollins).
Then there is a batch of French 19th-century writers: Baudelaire by Joanna
Richardson (John Murray), Stendhal by Jonathan Keates (Sinclair-Stevenson)
and Mallarme (A Throw of the Dice by Gordon Millan: Secker). The American
list is even stronger: Scott Fitzgerald by that most prolific of literary
biographers, Jeffrey Meyers (Macmillan), John Steinbeck, the authorised
biography, by Jay Parini (Heinemann), James Baldwin by David Leeming
(Michael Joseph) and Edith Wharton (No Gifts From Chance by Shari Benstock:
Hamish Hamilton).
More interesting still, there will be the first volume of the two-part John
Betjeman: Letters, edited by his daughter, Candida Lycett-Green (Methuen) -
and, most important of all, the first two volumes of the mammoth eight-part
set of The Collected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson (Yale), in which
editors Bradford A Booth and Ernest Mehew after years of labour bring
together 2800 letters, most of them unknown.
*
Away from these literary preoccupations, we have the long-promised biography
The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (Century) in which Roger Lewis will
reveal much if not all, Grace, in which Robert Lacey will try to do the same
for Monaco (Sidgwick), a new life of Billie Holiday, Wishing on the Moon by
Donald Clarke (Viking) and Han Suyin's no doubt reverential life of Zhou
Enlai (Eldest Son: Jonathan Cape). Marie Curie by Susan Quinn (Heinemann) or
a mjaor bioghraphy of the physicist Richard Feynman (The Beat of a Different
Drum: Oxford). And at last we have the authorised biography of diva Joan
Sutherland by a certain Norma Major (Little, Brown &amp; Co.),
Autobiography even by non politicians is a popular pursuit, and this season
Conrad Black of the Daily Telegraph will be telling how he became a press
tycoon. A rather different sort of author, the novelist Penelope Lively, is
writing about her 1930s childhood in Egypt (Oleander, Jacaranda: Viking) and
JP Donleavy tells The History of The Ginger Man (Viking). Methuen is
publishing Joan Littlewood's Autobiography and Andrew Sinclair goes back to
the 1960s in In Love and Anger (Sinclair-Stevenson). Keith Waterhouse has a
memoir about Leeds and London (City Lights: Hodder).
*
The history lists are led by a major new biography, Joseph Chamberlain:
Entrepreneur in Politics by Peter T Marsh (Yale), but there is also a strong
German theme: there are two books pegged to the 50th anniversary of the July
Plot - An Honourable Defeat by Anton Gill (Heinemann) and 'Secret Germany'
the story of Claus von Stauffenberg, by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh
(Cape). Regular Weekend FT food writer Giles MacDonogh appears in his
professional-historical guise in Prussia: The Perversion of an Idea
(Sinclair-Stevenson) and the same publisher has Behind the Battle:
Intelligence in the War with Germany by ULTRA expert Ralph Bennett.
Husband-and-wife Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper, who have separately
written about Crete, Cairo and Spain, turn to Paris After The Liberation:
1944-1949 (Hamish Hamilton). The distinguished historian of Italy, Denis
Mack-Smith, will give us his life of Mazzini (Yale). David Cannadine's
Aspects of the Aristocracy (Yale) sounds like a spin-off from his successful
The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy,, but that may be unfair.
Peter Gay delivers the third volume in his majestic study of Victorian
culture, The Bourgeois Experience (The Cultivation of Hatred:
HarperCollins).
Richard Pipes completes his magisterial trilogy on the Russian Revolution
with Russia Under The New Regime, 1919-1924 (Harvill). In more rollicking
mode, Peter Hopkirk carries on his sequence of books about the Great Game
with On Secret Service East of Constantinople (John Murray). Ian Buruma
describes and analyses post-war Germany and Japan in The Wages of Guilt
(Cape). Sir Nicholas Henderson, it is suggested, has defied Foreign Office
objections to publish his memoirs, Mandarin: The Diary of an Ambassador
(Weidenfeld). Australia's ex-PM Bob Hawke's The Autobiography (Heinemann)
claims to be frank and controversial: we will see.
There is a trio of topical Middle East books: Jericho First, Jane Corbin's
story of the Palestinian-Israeli peace initiative by Norway (Bloomsbury),
Said K Aburish's lid-lifting report on The House of Saud (Bloomsbury), and
FT contributor Michael Field's Inside The Arab World (John Murray).
*
The travel shelves appear to be less crowded than in 1993. The London-based
South African writer Dan Jacobson goes home in The Electronic Elephant,
which the Hamish Hamilton blurb is unable to resist describing as 'a
personal quest'. John Murray is publishing four more of their excellently
readable Literary Companions - Spain (by FT staffer Jimmy Burns), China (by
Weekend FT book reviewer Anthony Grayling and Susan Whitfield), Greece by
Martin Garrett and Ireland by poet Patrick Kavanagh.
It is not clear whether former City Editor and banker William M Clarke's In
Search of the Tsar's Lost Fortune (Weidenfeld) is a travel book or a
'business' book. Firmly on the business pages will be John Banham's The
Anatomy of Change: Blueprint for a Thriving Britain (Weidenfeld), Charles
Handy's latest, The Empty Raincoat: Making Sense of the Future (Hutchinson),
and Robert Heller's The Fate of IBM (Little, John). Then there's Tim
Jackson's biography of The Virgin King (HarperCollins) about - who else?
Finally, one of the important books of the year, with a social and political
as well as a business dimension, is likely to be The City of London: A World
of its Own, 1815-1890, the first of a three-volume major history by David
Kynaston, previously historian of Cazenove and of the FT.
*
That leaves the fiction lists. The spring is looking promising even though
not many of the really big guns are going to be in action. VS Naipaul
returns with A Way in the World (Heinemann)), which is mysteriously
(alarmingly?) described as 'unconfined by the conventional narrative form,
but in a classic story-telling tradition'. JM Coetzee stays clear of his
native South Africa with The Master of Petersburg, set in 1869 Russia
(Secker &amp; Warburg). John Updike's Brazil is described as 'erotic joy and
criminal mischief, politics and sorcery'(Hamish Hamilton). William Gaddis,
recently elevated as a 'Penguin Twentieth-Century Classic' , has at last
produced his fourth novel, A Frolic of his Own (Viking).
Then there are the regulars: Anita Brookner (A Private View: Cape); Alison
Lurie (Women and Ghosts: Heinemann); Edna O'Brien (House of Splendid
Isolation: Weidenfeld); Nicholas Baker (The Fermata: Chatto); Carlos Fuentes
(The Orange Tree: Andre Deutsch); Alan Massie (King David: Hodder). David
Caute returns with Dr Orwell and Mr Blair (Weidenfeld).
More interesting, the promising members of the younger generation are much
in evidence: Alan Hollinghurst (The Folding Star: Chatto); James
Hamilton-Paterson (Ghosts of Manila: Cape); James Kelman (How Late It Was,
How Late: Secker); Candia McWilliam (Debatable Land Bloomsbury); Lindsay
Clarke (Alice's Masque: Cape); Charles Palliser (Betrayals: Cape). Not to
speak of Stephen Fry's second novel, The Hippopotamus (Hutchinson), which
will probably do as well as all of them put together.
But the gifted Mr Fry will not be outselling the new - the fifth - John
Grisham legal thriller, which Century have not yet got round to titling. Nor
will he beat Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend by Robert James Waller (Heinemann),
which, already in some bookshops, is even mushier - sorry, more moving -
than the fortunate Mr Waller's recent runaway success, The Bridges of
Madison County. You have been warned.

FROM NAPOLEON TO THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL: ESSAYS ON 19TH CENTURY
EUROPE
by AJP Taylor
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 426 pages
THE TRAITOR WITHIN THE GATES
by Robert Cole
Macmillan, 285 pages
It is natural to approach this collection of Alan Taylor's reviews, radio
broadcasts and short essays with a light heart. For Taylor believed that
history was fun to write and read and that the function of the historian was
not just to instruct but to provoke and entertain. He admired the great
stylists of the past, Gibbon, Macaulay and Carlyle, and was impatient with
the poorly written book, however accurate. Chris Wrigley's selection brings
delights and disappointments.
There are only two of the longer essays to remind readers of Taylor's
crystal-clear presentation of complex events, brilliantly linked with an eye
to the emotable example. Few other modern historians could move with such
confidence, as in 'The Last of Old Europe', from the business of high
politics, wars and revolutions to the effects of sewing machines, bicycles
and contraception on the position of women in the space of some 25 pages.
Too many book reviews are included, most surprisingly gentle. Only
occasionally, for one who had a sharp eye for detail, would he cross swords
with the writer on grounds of accuracy. More often there would be a personal
letter to the offending author pointing to an incorrect name or place.
It is not usually the author who interested him, but the subject of the
book. Reviews and talks provided the occasion for writing about the people
of the past who fascinated, impressed or perplexed him. They allowed Taylor
to show off his own personal gallery of heroes, Charles James Fox, William
Cobbett, John Bright, the 'trouble makers', who were the subjects of
Taylor's own favourite book and with whose dissenting views he identified.
There were also villains, that 'dedicated historian' Leopold von Ranke,
castigated for his worship of the state that nourished the roots of Nazism.
Taylor returned repeatedly to the great men of European history, above all
Bismarck, always finding something new to say as he grappled with the enigma
of personality and policy. It is hard to think of any reviewer today who
writes with Taylor's verve or certainty of judgment.
Why the sense of disappointment? The reviews were often hastily written and
over-emphatic. Though Taylor has style, he was not really a great stylist
and few of the essays have improved with time. Radio talks, fondly
remembered, do not translate well into print. Taylor was the master of the
lecture hall, the radio and the television. His seemingly spontaneous and
brilliantly controlled lectures packed the Oxford schools at nine in the
morning. The same gifts, without resort to script of visual aids, won him a
mass audience. When read, the impact of personality is lost and the thinness
of the argument sometimes revealed. More unexpectedly, some of the essays
seem strangely dated. The tone and concerns are of a different time and
Taylor, himself, a figure of an earlier generation.
It is here that Robert Cole's study of Taylor's major writings is both
useful and perceptive. Admittedly this book offends against Taylor's first
rule, for the recapitulation of the contents of old volumes is boring -
something that can hardly be said of the originals. Nor would Taylor have
liked the welcome attention paid to his non-conformist roots and
anti-establishment position, the emphasis on the paradoxical nature of his
writing and professional career.
Taylor did not think he was a complicated figure. He loved writing history
and was a political activist. He enjoyed being the enfant terrible of the
historical profession and loved to exaggerate is so-called exclusion from
the Academy.
He found to his pleasure that he could communicate with a wide audience. It
brought rich rewards even in Germany. What Cole makes clear is the degree to
which Taylor's historical writings reflected his political interests and
readings of contemporary events. He was a man of th e 1939-45 war and the
'cold war'. Much of his writing deals with the German problem and was the
source of his deep-seated belief that there were no 'good Germans', only
Germans. The disgruntled critic of the cold war and the campaigner against
nuclear arms had no confidence in the Americans or the Russians. If his
distrust of the Americans ran deeper than his fear of the Russians, it was
because he believed that Anglo-Russian co-operation was the only protection
against Great Germany. Against all systems of any kind, Taylor was 'a little
Englander' convinced that Britain should retain her independence and free
hand.
Even his best, though not his most popular or influential book, The Struggle
for the Mastery of Europe (1957), fused scholarly explanation with political
argument. Based on a wide reading in the diplomatic sources which still
makes it an outstanding piece of scholarship, the book was intended to
educate both sides in the cold war. Already Taylor was moving into his
dissenter and trouble-making mode. He was denouncing academic supporters of
the cold war, addressing anti-Suez rallies and marching with the CND. He
claimed to have spoken in more halls than John Bright did when opposing the
Crimean War. There was always in Taylor's activities and writings a certain
'imp of the perverse' that made him a delightful sparring partner but which
was as maddening to some of his admirers as to his detractors.
It was Taylor's undisguised delight in rocking the boat and challenging the
prevailing winds whether in politics or history that accounts for the
vehemence of the attack on his The Origins of the Second World War. Cole
shows how much historians were shocked by its amoralism and the emphasis on
the accidental and unpredictable rather than on Hitler's responsibility for
the war. This was unacceptable to academics of a generation who had fought
against Hitler, particularly those engaged in the cold war against Stalinist
Russia. Students today hardly understand what the furore was about.
Some aspects of the Taylor thesis appear perverse or are seen as wrong, but
new readers are not troubled by Taylor's moral relativism. Similarly, though
English History, 1918-1945, can still be read with pleasure for Taylor is a
master story teller, the populist theme and the triumphant ending with the
British people, freed from the burdens of empire, poised to enter into their
true inheritance strikes a false note in the world of 1993. In a very
different and a greyer age, Taylor efforts to provoke have lost some of
their resonance as have the political battles he so stridently fought. This
may be what Chris Wrigley means when he suggests that for older readers his
selections of Taylor's writings have the quality of a glass of old port
after an excellent meal. This would not have been the comparison Taylor
would have wanted.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ROBERT, MY FATHER
by Sheridan Morley
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
We are lucky to have Sheridan Morley's voyage round his father before any
other. It gives an uncritical account of his life, with intimate anecdotes
that might not be widely known, and a positive anthology of witticisms.
Unapologetic in its filial loyalty, it records his dramatic activities
ranging from the Stokes Oscar Wilde to TV commercials. Never a star of the
Gielgud-Olivier type - and never ambitious to be - the quality in all his
work is likeableness, though as one critic said, his parts 'all end up
looking and sounding uncommonly like Mr Morley himself'. Alan Ayckbourn
wrote when Morley was in his How the Other Half Loves, he 'is an actor who
rapidly gets very bored and . . . treats theatres as one huge game organised
by himself.'
Morley was the only son of an eccentric retired cavalry major. Trained at
RADA (where he 'never really learned how to act') he made his inconspicuous
debut in Russell Thorndike's Doctor Syn. He then wrote a comedy, Short
Story, which was miraculously accepted for production by Dame Marie Tempest
and from then on, writing was as obsessive with him as acting.
Characteristically, Sheridan was named, not after the playwright, but after
the character Morley was playing at the time. Challenged in the Garrick bar,
Morley said that having a theatre critic for a son was 'like serving in the
Israeli army and waking up to find your son was an Arab'. He has been a
friendly Arab here.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Auctioneers all bubbly about 1994 - And the trickle
down effect will help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antique dealers, from Bermondsey Market to New Bond Street, and fine art
auctioneers, from Bonham's, Lots Road to Christie's, St James's, had plenty
of excuses to raise a glass last night. They could choose to celebrate a
much improved 1993 and bright prospects for 1994, or drown their sorrows at
another poor trading year, made worse by the imminent arrival of VAT on
imported antiques from non-EC countries which threatens to destroy the UK's
attraction as an open market.
The auction houses drank the champagne; the dealers the asti spumante. The
1993 results for the auction houses were distinctly encouraging. Sotheby's,
globally, raised its turnover by 17 per cent to Dollars 1.32b. (In sterling
terms it was a 31 per cent jump to Pounds 879m.) It also managed to stretch
its lead over arch rival Christie's, which recorded a 3 per cent dollar
gain, to Dollars 1.1b, or a sterling rise of 14 per cent to Pounds 726m. For
both salerooms the recovery picked up steam in the autumn season.
Facts matter in the art world. The problems of the last four years have
concentrated around the shortage of fine antiques to sell. Despite the
apparant invitability of the three 'D's which feed the market - death,
divorce and debts - somehow sellers (even Lloyds Names) have managed to hold
off, awaiting higher prices. The year-end results could spread the word that
owners can once again profitably cash in their antiques.
There are certainly some appetising sales on the horizon. The new tycoons
are often entertainers, and Christie's is disposing of Barbra Streisand's
fine collection of art nouveau and art deco in March and the late Rudolf
Nureyev's luxurious domestic furnishings in December. Christie's is also
excited about an impressive Landseer painting of a stag and Dr Thomas
Howarth's collection of Charles Rennie Mackintosh furniture and designs.
Sotheby's should have a good January, offering in New York Peter Jay Sharp's
collection of Old Masters, including works by Rubens, Canaletto and Guido
Reni, plus the most significant collection of folk art in private hands,
assembled by the late Bertram K and Nina Fletcher Little. The likely success
of these auctions should tempt out yet more major pieces.
Of course it is the big price items, Impressionists and jewels in
particular, which powered the improvement in turnover last year, but middle
range antiques also played their part. Christie's South Kensington auction
house, the trading place for collectables and home furnishings, managed a 33
per cent jump in sales, and Bonhams, which also concentrates on affordable
antiques, saw its turnover rise 24 per cent to Pounds 31m. Sales at Phillips
were only 1.5 per cent greater at Pounds 82m, but at least it recorded
growth again.
Sotheby's, which at one time spurned to handle goods worth under Pounds
1,000, has realised the need to capture collectors when they have modest
means in the hope that their buying appetite will grow with their wealth.
Expect many more 'Colonnade' sales, where most lots are estimated at under
Pounds 2,000, at Sotheby's in 1994.
Few dealers matched the salerooms' performance in 1993 - indeed they are
still losing custom as private collectors buy wholesale through the auction
houses rather than rely on the advice of dealers. This trend will intensify
in 1994. The auction houses, with international outlets, are also taking the
arrival of VAT in the UK in their stride. Dealers fear that the initial 2
per cent tax will rise inexorably and in time put many of them out of
business. 'We are entering the final death rattle of the London art market'
says picture dealer Roy Miles.
This is an exaggeration. Relatively few major dealers closed up shop during
the recession. More merged or gave up their retail outlets to work from home
and through fairs. Dealers should take heart from the improvement in demand
at the medium and low price range. If the house market improves; if the
stock exchange continues to provide windfall profits; if the City spawns
more bonus millionaires - some of this surplus wealth is bound to find its
way into antiques.
The next few weeks will show whether dealers can hope to join in the better
prospects of the salerooms. On January 19 at the Business Design Centre in
Islington there is Art 94, the now firmly established market place for
contemporary art. Major dealers like Crane Kalman, Anthony D'Offay and
Karsten Schubert are showing for the first time, and works by Bridget Riley,
Bruce McLean, Richard Hamilton, Chagall, Ken Kiff, Peter Howson, and many
more will be on offer.
Then on January 26 comes the World of Drawings and Watercolours at the Park
Lane Hotel, with a wide range of watercolours, from Constable to Sara
Armstrong Jones. First time buyers tend to be attracted to either
contemporary artists or to traditional watercolours. These fairs cover the
possibilities and prices will be no higher than those asked, and not always
acheived, last year.
So 1994 should offer the proof of the trickle down effect: high prices paid
for Picasso in New York lead in time to more sales in Portobello Road. After
years of wishful thinking business should be better for the dealers. There
may also be fresh ideas in the auction houses. There is a new team at
Sotheby's and some important management changes at Christie's.
Collecting rises and falls in line with the state of the economy and the
omens for that are bullish. Underpinning the revival there is the arrival in
1995 of the Lottery. This will provide the cash to keep the good objects in
the UK. It will help museums and galleries to buy again. It will give
confidence to the future of the national heritage. It will raise the profile
of art and culture. Those dealers that have managed to survive could prosper
again - as long as the VAT genie is kept firmly bottled up.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Elevation of everyday objects - Lynn MacRitchie
explains what 'modern art' means in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I do not like art today. I think it has gone to hell, as a result of the
financial attitude,' wrote Peggy Guggenheim in her autobiography in 1960. So
trenchant a judgment may give us pause, especially as 1993 ended with the
art 'market,' as defined by the international sales figures from Sotheby's
and Christie's, 'significantly improved' on the previous year.
Ms Guggenheim's position was not entirely innocent, however. She had been
used to getting work from the artists she discovered for comparatively small
sums, and was especially cross when she could no longer afford to pay the
prices which the American art market achieved for the work of her former
proteges. While it is easy to feel sympathy with her horror at discovering
buyers of art who purchase merely for investment, the conclusions she is
tempted to draw are more dubious. She went on to write that the 20th
century, having produced Cubism and Abstract Expressionism, could be
expected to produce no more great art. 'A field must lie fallow now and
again,' she concluded, adding 'Artists try too hard to be original. That is
why we have all this painting that isn't painting any more.'
Oh but Peggy, that is just where you were wrong. Painting is painting now,
some of it good, some of it bad, just like it always was. The only
difference is that painting now has to take its place along with a whole lot
of other ways artists have developed over the last 40 or so years of
expressing what it is that they want to say. Some would argue that the
agenda for this, and indeed for the art of the end of the 20th century, was
set by Ms Guggenheim's first adviser on contemporary art, Marcel Duchamp,
who abandoned painting in favour of experiments with the mechanics of
visualisation, the elevation of everyday objects into the realm of art
simply by the artist's declaring them so to be.
'I don't know what I would have done without him. He had to educate me
completely. I could not distinguish one modern work from another,' Ms
Guggenheim admitted of Duchamp with her customary candour, at the same time
acknowledging that art is not just something which can be known to be good
or bad at first glance.
It is something about which it is possible, indeed necessary, to learn. This
truth has been lost sight of these last few years when the politics of the
marketplace and the pressure for success have skewed our view of what it is,
exactly, that artists do. The fact that some people pay enormous amounts of
money is not relevant to the work which is done. For whatever artists may
create, it is not the art market.
What I think they do, and what Peggy Guggenheim thought too when she was
forced to admit it, is make us think about the world we have made. 'Art
mirrors its age,' she wrote of Cubism, 'therefore it had to change
completely as the world changed so vastly.' Artists offer us an image of our
times, which we may accept or reject as we choose. Our only duty is to try
to understand.
If artists are presenting us with concrete houses or piles of bricks or
paint dripped from the end of a stick over tarpaulins on the floor we must
ask not how much, but why. Why this? Why now? For artists do not create in a
vacuum; their work has a source and that source, fundamentally, is their
life, their experience of the world we all live in. If we do not like what
they make us see, it is only because, as our truest mirrors, they are
showing us something of ourselves.
Is it possible, for instance, to look at the work of Francis Bacon, accorded
a magnificent exhibition in Venice last summer, and not recoil in horror?
But his images of human suffering and degradation are valued, highly valued,
in both monetary and artistic terms. We look at them and know that something
of us is up there too, something which could also be twisted and dark and
terrible. It just takes a little getting used too.
I for one am delighted when the moment of breakthrough comes, and the
struggle in the studio begins to see the light of day, whatever form it
takes. I, unlike Ms Guggenheim and so many since, am willing to look at
anything. And I know, as I look at an installation in a derelict factory or
a performance in a desolate warehouse that, if the quality is there, the
market will, eventually, follow. The artist leads, the money comes behind.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Blockbusters, and Buckingham Palace - What people
really wanted to go and see during the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What did people want to see in 1993? It was the year when the masses stormed
into the Long Gallery of Buckingham Palace. In two months, 377,000 visitors
trod reverently along the red temporary carpets. Some people went to see the
art and a lot of people bought ties. This happy experiment, long overdue,
will be repeated next summer. It should become a permanent feature of a
London August.
This was the year when cultural one-upmanship meant saying smugly 'Actually,
I saw it in New York . . .' or, 'I saw it in Washington.' Matisse and the
Barnes Collection were the titans among the international blockbusters,
giving pleasure to millions and handsomely repaying their investment.
Matisse at the Pompidou Centre in Paris attracted 743,000 visitors. It was
not far off double the number (410,00) who went to the Grand Palais for the
vast and dazzling exhibition of paintings from Renaissance Venice, The
Century of Titian. The Pompidou show needed a lot of fortitude. By ducking
and weaving it was possible at least to clap eyes on most paintings. Even
so, I wonder how many people share my feeling that it would be more accurate
to say one experienced the Matisse show than actually saw Matisse.
Comfortably outstripping Matisse already is the exhibition which, if the
late Dr Edward C. Barnes had had his way, would never have been thrust onto
on the world's stage; Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces from
the Barnes Collection at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris until January 2. The
number of visitors is estimated to stand at over one million.
Yet I confess to feeling only slightly wistful not to be one of the million
who has 'seen the Barnes'. My far keener regrets are for missing Jacopo
Bassano (Kimbell, Fort Worth/Bassano del Grappa), Judith Leyster
(Haarlem/Worcester Art Museum), and above all Ribera's suffering saints and
philosophers (Metropolitan, New York). Those are chances which will not
recur whereas, being rational for a minute, what has one missed with a loan
selected from a permanent exhibition?
In Paris, moreover, the Barnes exhibition was adulterated with pictures from
the Orsay's collection. So the real experience still awaits us, the Barnes
Foundation at Merion in Philadelphia. This is by all accounts one of the
most idiosyncratic and absorbing collections of paintings of the century -
always assuming that its trustees yet again thwart the wishes of Dr Barnes
by re-hanging the collection.
At the Royal Academy in London, the most successful exhibitions were Pisarro
(195,700 visitors) the Great Age of British Watercolours (208,887), and
American Art. This last, despite being soused with critics' bile, drew close
to 200,000. One exceptional show which might have seemed rather difficult,
Wisdom and Compassion; Sacred Art of Tibet, had 147,000 visitors, more than
Sickert (136,000) and not far off the National Gallery's biggest success,
Edvard Munch (162,000).
This was the first year that I recall major exhibitions having muzak. There
was Russian chant at Gates of Mystery at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and
maddening trumpets at Canaletto in England at Birmingham. However, it seems
horribly likely that muzak will become more common as museums look for a
wider, younger public. Just about every other human activity is now done
while listening to music, so why not looking at paintings?
Happily, 1993 also brought the day closer when if you do not like the music,
you do not need to go. In September, Microsoft 'delivered London's National
Gallery to the Desktop'. A CD-Rom allows art-lovers to 'search, browse, and
navigate' the gallery's 2,000 paintings. It gives an animated lesson in
perspective, and takes you on guided tours of the galleries, and teaches you
how to pronounce artists' names. Give it a decade, and the world's greatest
museums, palaces, cathedrals, even the blockbuster shows, will be accessible
without getting off the sofa.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Just show me a painting - William Packer is fed up
with current academic orthodoxy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might well feel that a year that began with Gravity &amp; Grace, the South
Bank Board's high-minded, mind-numbing survey of the conceptual sculpture of
the early 1970s, at the Hayward in January; got into its stride with the
narrow critical correctness of the Barclays Young Artists Award (now
defunct) at the Serpentine; continued with Georgia O'Keefe at the Hayward in
the spring, Richard Hamilton at Venice and Tony Bevan at the Whitechapel in
the summer; and wound up last month with Julian Opie's play-bricks at the
Hayward (again), the recent glories of the Turner Prize, and the present
graphic fatuities of Michael Craig-Martin at Waddington, must have been
pretty grim. Well, up to a point it was.
I am not sure whether I find the academic orthodoxy of the earnest
apologists for so much of this stuff, the polarised arguments of their
critical opponents, or the work itself, the more dispiriting. It is as clear
a nonsense to suppose that the Tate, for example, should only concern itself
with the current effusions of the Goldsmiths' College, as that nothing of
any interest will ever come from that source.
The heresy is that only the supposed avant-garde of the moment can be of any
creative interest. There is, of course, a great deal of abstract art of the
highest quality, and minimalist and conceptual works of great beauty and
imaginative potency - of course, of course. And figurative art is still with
us, and the direct response to the real and perceived world will always
remain as valid in creative terms as any amount of theorising or conceptual
posturing. Of course: of course: all so obvious. And so why is it necessary
to say as much, again and again?
That said, we can cheer up, for throughout the year there has been, as
always, a great deal about to do just that, cheer us up. Paris in
particular, has been a great comfort, and Venice too, and London and
Edinburgh not so far off the pace. Here then, in a short space, are a few
plums picked from my own basket of shows I actually reviewed.
Matisse at the Centre Pompidou, a show quite distinct from last year's full
retrospective in New York, and the definitive review of the artist's early
career; 1893, l'Europe des Peintres, at the Musee d'Orsay; the Nabis, at the
Grand Palais (prematurely closed since the roof fell in): the Unknown
Modigliani, at the Palazzo Grassi, doubling the canon of known drawings and
transforming our understanding of the artist; the Venice Biennale's ommagio
to Francis Bacon, at the Museo Correr; late Pissarro's late city-scapes, at
the Royal Academy; Lucian Freud's work of the last decade, at the
Whitechapel; the Holbein drawings in the Royal Collection, at the National
Gallery of Scotland; Dennis Creffield's Petworth paintings, at Gillian
Jason; Hamish Fulton, at Annely Juda; Graham Sutherland's early prints, at
the Fine Art Society - not so bad a year at all.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: After the age of the dinosaur - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollywood, Boom; Rest of World, Bust. That is the first vision a film critic
sees when he wires himself up to the Virtual Reality game, 'Guess The
Future.'
As the decade/century/millennium lives out its dotage years, popular
American cinema is spreading through the world like some benign Alzheimer's
Disease. Forget your troubles; forget there was ever such a thing as 'art
cinema'; forget that intelligent audio-visual life existed between the First
Jurassic Age (dinosaurs) and the Second Jurassic Age (Spielberg).
'Popular American cinema', of course, puts it too narrowly. We must call it
the whole US moving-image culture from films and videos to computer games
and theme parks. In recent years only the Far East - hi-tech Japan and
cinematically emergent China and Taiwan - has developed any kind of
audio-visual vernacular to compete.
Japan's adventures in video, computer-games and high-definition TV, and at
other points along today's screen-technology frontier, have created interest
in a pop-futuristic iconography which, given Japan's foothold in Hollywood
itself, may soon start filtering into American movies and TV. (In fact it is
already doing so: look at the mix of Samurai folklore and Virtual Reality in
TV's Wild Palms, or the hi-tech/sci-fi stand-off between East and West in
Rising Sun.)
Meanwhile China and Taiwan, whose films have regularly pipped America's at
recent film festivals, are starting to fill the gap between a disappearing
European art cinema and a retarded popular US cinema. Films like The Wedding
Banquet, Farewell My Concubine and The Story Of Qiu Ju prove that despite
the political adversities and scant funding resources of the countries where
they are made - or perhaps because of those handicaps (young cinema enjoys a
struggle) - these nations are creating the closest thing to a new cinema of
humanism since the French New Wave.
Neither of these nations has yet made a big impact on the Western box
office: which is the West's loss. We on the Atlantic seaboard are left
looking back at 1993's searingly forgettable releases and asking, Can there
be life after Jurassic Park? That Americans have paid Dollars 334m to date,
topping the hitherto highest-grossing ET, to watch the world's most
boneheaded prehistoric drama since The Flintstones is bad news for
civilisation. (Worse news is that The Flintstones itself comes to your large
screens this year.)
But perhaps this pattern of historical back-pedalling, of a film industry
yearning alike for pre-civilisation and for primeval story properties, fits
naturally into a millennial time: reculer pour mieux sauter. And the same
desire to give the home-base one last hug before being hurled into the year
2000 may explain - if not excuse - Hollywood's fascination with the sequel.
We keep being told it will stop; it never does. Coming soon: Look Who's
Talking Now, Return To The OK Corral, City Slickers 2, The Neverending Story
3 . . .
Sequels we can almost take: they have become a fact of filmic life. But
other forms of derivativeness and running-for-cover in Western movie-making
are more disturbing.
One is the 'Have you watched any good books lately?' syndrome. Increasingly
the men who were once American cinema's great adventurers - Martin Scorsese,
Francis Coppola - have been abandoning their old rough-and-tumble
hyper-realism for a season ticket to the public library. Last year we found
Mr Coppola at the shelves marked 'S' for Stoker, Bram. Since then Mr
Scorsese has been bookworming through 'W' for Wharton, Edith (The Age Of
Innocence, opening here on January 25).
There has to be more to cinema than this: than a movie world caught between
two forms of emulation - low aping of its own action tropes and high piping
to the tune of famous literature. But I fear that Hollywood, having put
Europe to the sword with its own world-colonising populism, is now content
to rest on the spoils of its victory. It knows that the great days of the
European writer-director are over: and that the auteur who invents and
shoots his own original stories, racing about the land unencumbered by
studio committees, story conferences and bloated production costs, is a
dream being swallowed up by history.
What we want for 1994 is not a new year resolution but a new year
revolution. Something to put the pep back into all those ailing movie lands
between Tinseltown and Tokyo. And something to get Hollywood out of its
second stone age and into the third millennium AD

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Find the dancers a home - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hope may spring eternal, but there seems little good to anticipate on the
British dance scene this year. Our two leading modern dance troupes - London
Contemporary and Rambert - are in a state of flux: in its infinite wisdom
the Arts Council has arranged that the former will be cut down to size,
while the latter will be given boots too big for its present capabilities.
Our smaller modern ensembles offer dull creations and low dance vitality,
but are promoted above their station. (What Jonathan Burrows does this year
will be a matter of real fascination: he has an original creative talent,
unlike most of the dabblers whose offerings are the commonplace of
dance-going.)
The Royal Ballet is on reduced performance rations at Covent Garden, and is
repeating too many of last season's repertory mistakes. Evenings are being
marketed under flatulent titles - The Immortal Hours, so likely] - rather
than on merit. The natural wealth of the company, which is the great store
of its productions, is not shown on artistically credible or logical terms.
If New York City Ballet can mount a Balanchine Festival, why should not
Covent Garden give us an Ashton Festival, a MacMillan celebration, and
excite public response to two of the central figures in ballet of our time?
The Royal Opera House must close for refurbishing in 1997, with a scheduled
re-opening in 2000. Where the resident ballet and opera companies will find
a nest is by no means clear. Drury Lane is persistently bruited, and were it
to become available this theatre would also answer a further long-standing
problem: our need for a dance house.
If I have one hope for the coming year, it is that definite moves be made
towards securing a home for national and international dance in London. We
have but to study the example of the Paris Opera. With the opening of the
spiffing new Opera Bastille, Garnier's adorable palace has become a great
European centre for dance. The Opera Ballet is resident there, and the
theatre also offers hospitality to many visitors. (The Royal Ballet should
have played there last summer.) The present season's immediate example shows
that, by July, the Palais Garnier will have presented ten varied programmes
by its house company, and will also receive five guest ensembles, ranging
from Twyla Tharp to the San Francisco Ballet.
A comparable theatre in London might rescue our ballet and dance troupes
from their doldrums, and it would provide a much-needed location for large
visiting ensembles, who otherwise have to fight for free weeks at the
Coliseum or Covent Garden.
I do not believe in the Albert Hall as a serious dance house, whatever the
advantages in size for a troupe like the Bolshoi. I do believe in the idea
of a dance house which would allow the Royal Ballet to play seasons in
addition to its Opera House schedules, which would provide a home for
English National Ballet, would adapt in size to take in smaller companies,
and, most significantly, would help broaden the experience of our dancers
and our dance public.
Once upon a time (the 1940s-'60s) London was a major dance centre, and we
saw an exceptional variety of performance. We are now starved, and our
audiences are shrinking as much because of the predictability of the dance
on offer as because of exorbitant prices. We could do worse than provide the
space in which our own companies, and our visitors, might show us not just
what we have missed in recent years, but what marvels dance can achieve in a
proper setting.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Open all hours - Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best news for 1994 is that the new Italian Minister of Culture, Alberto
Ronchey, has decreed that all monuments, museums and galleries should be
open from 9am to 7pm. No more apologies pinned to firmly closed doors. No
more closures at two. Hurrah]
Otherwise some of the most enjoyable exhibitions of the year have shown us
collections - public and private - that are not otherwise easily accessible.
The most spectacular was - and still is - When Books Were Painted:
Illuminated Manuscripts in France 1440-1520 at the Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris (until January 16). Only rarely can such light-sensitive material be
displayed. Over 230 manuscripts demonstrate the genius of French Renaissance
painting. The richness of the manuscripts' unfaded colours is a revelation.
Most controversial was the highly lucrative whirlwind world tour of the
great Post Impressionists from the Barnes Foundation (currently at the Musee
D'Orsay until January 16). The trustees' flagrant breach of Dr Barnes'
indenture expressly forbidding the loan or sale of his works of art (the
courts quashed an earlier attempt to de-accession up to 15 paintings) is
enough to make any would-be philanthropist think twice about benefitting the
public good. Fears were also expressed that many of the pictures, Suerat's
seminal 'Poseuses' among them, were in no condition to travel.
In London, the anticipated publication of the first complete catalogue of
the Italian drawings in the Chatsworth Collection prompted the display of a
choice selection at the British Museum (until January 9). Coincidentally,
some of the sheets that got away - sold at auction in 1984 and 1987 - took a
bow simultaneously in Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum at the RA
(until January 23).
However glorious the individual exhibits, the '100 best tunes' approach
makes for the least ambitious and the least demanding of shows. It was far
more heartening to discover that the multi-disciplinary blockbuster is still
with us, feeding the mind as well as feasting the eye. At the
Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin the massive Japan and Europe 1543-1929 brought
together books and manuscripts, scientific instruments and treatises, maps,
prints and screens, export lacquer and porcelain, painting and sculpture to
document the unexpectedly rich cultural cross-fertilisation.
Versailles and the Royal Tables of Europe at the palace of Versailles
repatriated the finest surviving French gold and silver plate and porcelain
 -housed as far afield as St Petersburg and Lisbon - plus paintings,
table-plans, menus and the like, to present the fruits of the recent
research of art, court and food historians (until February 27). Delectable.
Thanks to the restoration project of its sponsors, LVMC, Versailles is now
able to stage regular exhibitions and bring some life back into the empty
chambers of Louis XIV's magnificent palace.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Musical farce may sharpen the batons - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any bets on the fate of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1994? The Great
London Orchestra Farce came to an end in the middle of last month, and
mockery and abuse then rained down on the whole organisation  - accompanied
by more than one public call for it to be wound up altogether, and replaced
by a line of direct government funding of the arts.
The hilarious yet heartbreaking saga of administrative tomfoolery that led
to the outcry may be briefly summarised as follows: an independent team set
up by the musical panel of the Arts Council to decide, by means of a 'beauty
contest' which one of three London orchestras would become a super-orchestra
and, in counterbalance, which other two would lose their grant; a huge
outcry by supporters of all three orchestras elicited by the beauty contest;
a concluding judgment by the independent team then completely ignored by the
Council; a final decision on orchestral funding for 1994-95 amounting to a
comprehensive fudge of the whole issue.
The questions which arise out of the settling dust and all the merriment at
the Council's expense are the following: does a body that in the last few
years has shown both an inability to support all its clients effectively,
and a propensity to turn against some of those clients on what has often
looked like the merest whim - does such a body deserve to exist any longer?
There is no predicting with confidence either its survival or
disintegration. But, in curious and rather satisfyingly unexpected fashion,
one side-effect of the 'beauty contest' seems to have been a greatly
increased sense of artistic urgency among the London orchestras recently
under scrutiny - a sense of sharpened concern to raise the standard and
'interest-quotient' of both programmes and roster of conductors and
soloists.
The Philharmonia, with an exceptionally interesting programme of
early-evening contemporary-music concerts already in its second year of
existence, seems to have woken up the most. The London Philharmonic, though
its recent welcoming-on-board of Harrison Birtwistle and Roger Norrington
had the look of a desperate face-saving exercise, now looks set to follow
suit. (Neither of those orchestras will really gain full credibility,
however, until the question-marks hanging over their far-from-infallible
Chief Conductors are resolved - in the case of the Philharmonia's Giuseppe
Sinopoli, the naming of a successor, and in that of the LPO's Franz
Welser-Most, greater evidence of artistic maturity than he has so far
shown.)
The Royal Philharmonic, least-encouraged of the trio, has come out of the
experience with dignity and new sponsorship from Classic FM; its seeking-out
of a 'National Orchestra' identity, and its exciting new links forged with
the Kirov Opera (as witnessed in the splendid concert performance of
Tchaikovksy's opera Iolanta early last month), are two clear tokens of new
vigour there too. And, as everyone has commented, the London Symphony, safe
in its Barbican Hall home, goes from strength to strength: the appointment
of Colin Davis as Chief Conductor (from 1995) has already cast a glow over
all its activities.
So could 1994 be a boom period for London orchestral concerts? Here again,
easy, surefire predictions are not on offer. As my colleague Antony
Thorncroft suggested a few Saturdays ago, the idea of the London
super-orchestra may well come back from the dead in a few years time. And
the basically shaky financial condition of the three beauty-contestant
orchestras should not be forgotten.
But I shall not be at all surprised if, for some while at least through
1994, one result of the London orchestral brouhaha is a pleasingly ironic
one: a newly vital, uncomplacent London orchestral scene.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Sink or subsidy - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaving aside harmless men in bowler hats and striped satin waistcoats, jazz
divides people. For the unconverted, the sound of improvisation is akin to
tinnitus. But, to the modernist at least, jazz is the sound of art in
action.
Jazz is young - it is only 75 years since the word was first uttered. And if
its artistic development has been explosive since then, it is only just
emerging from the underground to take its place in the conservatory, concert
hall and on the air waves.
As with all cutting-edge art, jazz and its practitioners need subsidies to
develop and flourish. Listeners, too, need access to a music best taken
live, which means more touring and better venues.
Jazz in the UK has not fared well thus far, however, and has played second
fiddle to all the other performance arts. In March, though, the Arts Council
will reveal the results of its first ever National Review of Jazz. This
assessment will then be used to allocate funds for the following financial
year (1995/96) although, given the gloomy climate for funding as a whole,
and the council's record over funding jazz in particular, the
beard-and-beret set are not optimistic.
Arts Council research (for 1991/92) shows that the same number of people
attended opera as jazz (2.74m). Those at opera got Pounds 7.95 subsidy a
head while the jazzer got just 8.5p. While it might not be fair to play off
one art form against another - classical music buffs get Pounds 1.66, ballet
fans Pounds 5.74, and contemporary dance-goers Pounds 1.56 - the numbers do
say something about the artistic order, and how the funders see the place of
jazz in it.
Jazz has coloured a great deal of what is considered new and exciting in
music (in rap as much as in new classical music) and even in literature
(Toni Morrison's Jazz), and it continues to explore new territory. This
development, precisely because its success is not assured, so often takes
place without commercial encouragement. But this is the place for subsidy,
surely. (Or perhaps the creeping comfort of the 'heritage' movement would be
more generous about preserving, say, trad jazz).
It is not even that modern jazz is entirely too challenging: audiences are
submitting themselves to it in increasing numbers. The same Arts Council
survey has shown attendances for the music have grown by 20 per cent in the
five years to 1991 - the so-called jazz boom.
This is why the jazz constituency - musicians, promoters and audiences, -
feel a turning point has been reached. Not only would renewed funding keep
the fires of improvisation burning in 1994, it could also reward the growing
curiosity of new listeners.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Sport: Soccer competes with a freak show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It's rough in Washington DC. The American football team is pathetic this
year, the basketball team cannot find the basket, nobody cares about the
toothless ice hockey club and we have not had a baseball team for nearly a
quarter of a century (we will not have a football team either if Jack Kent
Cooke, the owner, moves the Redskins to some racetrack in Maryland).
But we are not alone; it is rough all over the US. Although the college game
thrives, professional football has become boring, says no less an authority
than Sports Illustrated.
The best quarterbacks are ancient, such as Joe Montana, or injured, the
victims of the awful artificial turf. The air has gone out of basketball
with the retirement of Michael Jordan and it has been reduced to recruiting
Gheorge Muresan, a 7ft 7in Romanian with pituitary problems, and Shawn
Bradley, a former Mormon missionary an inch shorter, as if the embarrassing
performances of Manute Bol, a 7 ft 6 in ex-herdsman from Sudan, were not a
warning.
Baseball players are paid too much to play with any enthusiasm and the
talent is too diluted by expansion. Purists were appalled by, though
strangely drawn to, the ineptitude that characterised much of the last World
Series. Ice hockey is so desperate for fans that it is being played near
Disneyland, light years from its frozen northern home, by a team called the
Mighty Ducks.
The only golfer of interest is John Daly and mostly for what he does off the
course. Juvenile tennis stars burn out with monotonous regularity. No wonder
the US is becoming addicted to the virtual reality of video games.
It is tempting to conclude that soccer, coming here in the shape of the
World Cup next year, is pushing on an open door. Millions of children, girls
included, play it because it is cheap and safe. There may be no professional
game played outdoors but college soccer is starting to resemble the real
thing.
There is a young man from New Jersey, Claudio Reyna, the University of
Virginia's midfield player, who is coveted by the wealthy clubs of Italy and
Spain. When the US national side beat England last June it made the front
page of the sports sections with lots of funny headlines. There is already a
black market for tickets for all the World Cup games and about one-fifth of
them are going to appear on national television.
Such temptations should be resisted. Soccer will get a boost from the World
Cup but it must be at least a generation away from establishing itself as a
'major' sport in the US. There are lots of sober reasons for this view,
including lack of money and the problems of adapting a sport with no
artificial break other than half-time to a television system so dependent on
commercial breaks that an American football game of one hour's actual
playing time typically lasts three hours. But these are only half the
problem.
The first is size. Thighs and long hair apart, there is nothing physically
distinguishing about soccer players. They may be marvellous athletes in
their own right, but they look - well, ordinary, and Americans like to
associate themselves with the extraordinary.
Football features 300 lbs linemen capable of running down ball carriers
barely two-thirds the weight. People flock to watch Daly hit a ball further
than any successful golfer has.
The American sports fan might like to think that he, sometimes she, can
emulate their feats. So they buy jumbo drivers and once in a blue moon the
taller ones succeed in slamdunking a basketball into the net in their
driveways or throw perfect spirals in a touch football pick-up game. But it
is all a dream, whereas soccer, played by ordinary looking people, is closer
to gritty reality, from which sports are supposed to provide an escape.
Then there is the statistical problem, which runs far beyond the fact that
there are not enough goals in soccer. Americans prefer sports with high
scores, which is why the 16-14 World Series victory by Toronto over
Philadelphia was so compelling. Americans are consumed by the numbers which
lie behind the final score, as even a glance at any US newspaper's sports
page attests. Assists, tackles, errors, yards, balls, catches, pitches,
averages, blocked shots, turnovers, saves, minutes played and much more
besides are all minutely catalogued.
Soccer can provide only a fraction of this numerical diet, which not only
forms the stuff of every sports talk show and post-game office conversation
but serves as a measurement by which players may reasonably fairly be
compared, even over generations.
All that is left of Bobby Charlton are fond memories and flickering
black-and-white film, but Ty Cobb, who played in the first 20 years of this
century, is still there in baseball's statistical compendium.
Player image also does not seem to work in soccer's favour. There is a
debate among US professional sportsmen over whether or not they should serve
as role models. Charles Barkley, who plays basketball for the Phoenix Suns
with unreserved passion, rejects this imposition and Jordan's well known
gambling flouted it.
But it is a burden mostly accepted by the stars, even to the point of
mind-numbing blandness in, for example, golf (broken only when some of the
Ryder Cup team complained about having to meet Bill Clinton because he had
just increased taxes on their vast incomes). Most sports have severe
sanctions for those who transgress off the field by use of drugs or alcohol.
Soccer, on the other hand, seems stuffed with renegades, roustabouts and
lawbreakers, at least according to the European tabloid press. Maradona,
easily the best known player coming to the US for the World Cup, would
definitely be on a suspended list if he were playing here.
The final problem for soccer is that US sports are never static and always
respond to even the hint of discontent. When pitchers became too dominant in
the 1960s, baseball made it harder for them by lowering the height of the
mound. Football is forever tinkering with its rules to make life safer for
the quarterback and easier for the wide receiver, basketball introduced the
three-point shot and the time clock and ice hockey cracked down on fighting
(a mistake since a good brawl was always as much of an attraction as the
artistry of Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.) Soccer's comparable options seem
more limited.
And there are always great players in the pipeline to revive interest.
Baseball has a clutch of budding stars in their mid-20s, basketball can
replace Jordan with Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and Shawn Kemp, Troy
Aikman-to-Michael Irvine can supplant Montana-to-Jerry Rice who supplanted
Terry Bradshaw-to-Lynn Swann, Eric Lindros supplanted Gretzky and so on.
Here in DC, we will go to RFK stadium to catch, if we can find a scalper,
whoever the World Cup draw gives us and we will expect to be entertained,
even by Saudi Arabia. But - seriously - we will still be more interested to
see if the decline of the once-great 'Skins is reversible or if, 40 miles
down the road, Rafael Palmeiro, the new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) first
baseman, can bring a pennant to the Baltimore Orioles.
After all, to paraphrase a great politician, all sport is local and soccer
merely a world sport.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Sport: Odyssey cleared for take-off - Financial Times Round
the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a start] We only just made it to Jackson Hole for the start of our
expedition: the weather 'socked in' so much that it seemed certain we would
be forced to spend the night in Salt Lake City.
But then the cloak of thick cloud that was blanketing the Rockies along the
Utah, Idaho and Wyoming borders cleared and we were free to take off for the
final leg of our 5,500-mile journey to the starting gate of our skiing
odyssey.
It was good to be back in the air. On the ground at Salt Lake we had only
been allowed soft drinks. Now, we are arriving at this spectacular ski
resort on a magical day, with champagne glasses at the ready. The vast
valley floor is blindingly bright with fierce December sunshine glinting off
fresh snow straight back into a cold, blue sky.
At the airport we feel like thieves as we grab bag after bag from the
carousel - 13 in all, including skis. The FT ski expedition does not travel
light.
One of the most fascinating aspects of our year on skis will be meeting
characters such as Bill Briggs. He knows a thing or two about the
spectacular jagged-tooth tidal wave that is the Teton mountain range. A
bespectacled, slight individual, he walks towards us with a slight crouch: a
sort of bow-legged gait as though he's riding an invisible horse. There is a
reason for this.
Briggs, who runs the ski school at Sotow King, the ski resort at Jackson,
Wyoming, was born with a congenital hip problem. Doctors once warned him
that he would need new hips and could say goodbye to his skiing career.
'They told me that once they had set my new hips, I would never be able to
crouch in the skiing position again,' he said. 'I thought for a moment and
said: 'Why can't you set my hips in a skiing crouch instead of standing
straight?' So they did.' His decision was to help make local history.
One summer's day in 1971, Briggs and two friends battled half way up the
Grand Teton, 13,770 feet high. Between them they were carrying his skis.
Then, leaving his companions to descend, Briggs continued the climb alone.
It was an extremely tough undertaking, not made any easier by having to
carry his skis.
Eventually he staggered to the top and struggled to get his skis on: 'As
fast as I managed to get one ski on, the other one would try to ski off on
its own.'
Once or twice during an awe-inspiring four-hour epic descent, Briggs thought
he had skied his last: he cartwheeled into ravines and spun down couloirs.
Finally, breathless and faint, he was safely down - the first man ever to
ski the Tetons.
For my epic round-the-world journey, I'm skiing with Lucy Dicker from
Marseilles. Lucy has undertaken the bulk of the organisation - planning
routes, arranging visas etc. And we have no intention of disrupting our trip
by getting frostbite or taking unnecessary risks.
So Lucy and I will not be following in Bill Briggs's footsteps and
ski-tracks; nor will we be tempting fate on our first day by risking some of
Jackson Hole's more intimidating runs.
Besides, there's one I'm too scared to attempt for a second time: Corbet's
haunted me for years before I finally fell (literally) into it four years
ago. For five successive winters I had skied gingerly under the rope and
edged on skis to the very lip of the abyss before looking down into it. Like
some enormous wicked whale's mouth it threatens to drag you in and gobble
you up.
The problem is that unlike the lethal-looking S &amp; S Couloir round the
corner, whose 30-foot leap renders it out of reach for all recreational
skiers, Corbet's is just about skiable by any goodish skier. To know it is
there, inviting you to test your mettle in its gaping jaws is to know that
one day you are going to have to rise to the challenge.
But today, the crowded tram has delivered us to the top of the first of the
hundreds of ski runs we will encounter this year.
We gaze in awe for a few seconds at the vast valley floor, eyes lingering
for a moment on the figure of the Sleeping Indian (a mountain which
resembles a huge Indian chief with full head-dress lying on his back)
perched on top of the distant Gros Ventre range. It means Fat Stomach. Thank
goodness Lucy is here to translate.
It's January 1, 1994 and we're heading for Rendezvous Trail. Next stop Sun
Valley, Idaho. Our skiing odyssey has begun.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Motoring: Where on earth is my electric car? - Motoring
around town in a battery-driven vehicle will just have to remain a dream for
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many people who live in town, perhaps you would like an electric car.
Noiseless, non-polluting, and almost as friendly to the environment as a
bicycle. Ridiculously cheap to run, too. Instead of pouring costly petrol
down its gullet, you would just plug it into the mains overnight and
recharge its batteries on a few pence worth of off-peak electricity.
How nice if this town motorist's dream came true in 1994. Alas, it will not.
This does not mean the car-makers are not interested in making electric cars
powered by batteries. They have all been at it for years, investing
millions. And do not run away with the idea that there is some kind of oil
industry conspiracy to stifle it at birth. Electric cars are as old as
motoring - they have been around for 100 years.
Early this century, there were fleets of electric buses and taxis in
European cities. And battery-driven cars were quite popular in the US among
motorists who hated swinging a crank handle to start the engine. Then, the
electric self-starter was invented and the battery car took a back seat
overnight.
The trouble with electric vehicles is that the conventional storage battery
is an inefficient form of propulsion, to say the least. Weight for weight,
petrol contains 230 times more energy than the best kind of nickel-cadmium
traction battery. The cheaper lead-acid type, used in every petrol or diesel
car for starting purposes, is even worse.
A battery is not a power source; it merely stores electricity generated
elsewhere. A battery car creates no pollution itself - that comes from
burning oil, gas or (especially) coal to generate the electricity on which
it runs.
To be truly 'green,' a battery car must be re-charged with electricity
generated by water, solar, geo-thermal, wind or atomic power. But the first
four are hardly relevant in Britain, and we all know what the environment
lobby thinks about anything nuclear.
So, it can be argued that the whole concept of the battery car as completely
friendly to the environment is flawed. Yet, you cannot get away from the
fact that it does not pollute the urban areas, where it operates without
exhaust emissions or noise.
Because the battery car's range is so limited - about 60 miles (100km) is a
realistic average before it needs an eight-hour re-charge - it must, by
definition, be a household's second car. And because production so far has
been tiny, an electric car costs at least twice as much to make as one with
a small petrol engine.
Another snag is that because the batteries take up so much more space than a
petrol tank, electric versions of small four-seat cars may end up as
two-seaters.
France, which produces nearly all its electricity in emission-free nuclear
power stations, has gone further with battery cars than any other European
country. PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) and Renault are running large-scale trials in
co-operation with Electricite de France (EDF).
In 22 towns, from Bordeaux to Avignon, Strasbourg to Douai, battery
re-charging stations are to be set up at the roadside and in public or
private car parks. These will give electric cars (based on models such as
the Peugeot 106, Citroen AX and Renault Clio) a quick, range-extending fix
of current during the day.
A battery hire system will be put in place because a set representing
perhaps one-third of the value of the car might last only three years.
Renting batteries could be more sensible than buying.
What, though, about high-tech miracle batteries that are claimed to be many
times more efficient than today's conventional kind? They are trundled out
often by publicity-seeking manufacturers - but people with their feet on the
ground should forget them, at any rate for years to come.
They work in laboratories or under controlled test conditions but are not
(and may never be) cheap, or even safe, enough for public use.
Many believe the best hope for the battery-electric car is legislation
banning vehicles with petrol or diesel engines from the most congested city
centres. If that happened, and the only alternative to driving a battery car
or hailing a battery-driven taxi was walking, then the goalposts really
would be moved.
We might see a variation of the park-and-ride scheme. Instead of leaving
your car on the outskirts of town and catching a bus, tram or train, you
would pick up a rental battery car and drive to your office or the shops in
a no-go area for internal combustion engines.
Another scenario involves the hybrid car. This offers the best of both
worlds; battery power for town driving, petrol or diesel for the open road.
Battery-driven, its performance and range would be modest but enough for
driving a few hours on 30mph (50kph) speed-limited roads. Out of town, it
would go more like a normal car with a small, low-emission engine running at
a constant speed and coupled to a generator. This would feed current via the
batteries to an electric motor driving the wheels.
The idea is not new and most major car-makers have produced experimental
hybrids.
One of the latest and most interesting is the Volvo ECC (for environmental
concept car) which was unveiled about a year ago. It has a tiny gas turbine,
running on diesel fuel and driving a lightweight generator at very high
speed.
Even though one-fifth of the ECC's weight is batteries, it is not a
particularly heavy car and is shaped aerodynamically.
Volvo, which is developing the ECC with its partner, Renault, says it has a
top speed of 108mph (175kph) and would go 416 miles (670km) on a tankful if
you did not exceed 56mph (90kph). Battery power alone would take it only a
fraction of that distance at a lower speed.
Do not put off buying a new car because you would like a battery-electric to
use in town or a hybrid for all kinds of motoring. They are still some years
off. Renault thinks it could be 2015 before electric cars represent 10 per
cent of the total market and 40 per cent of cars used in town.
California, which invented smog created by car exhausts, has bitten on the
bullet. State regulations stipulate that, by 1998, at least 2 per cent of
new cars on sale must be zero emission (in other words, electric) vehicles.
The quota will go up to 5 per cent by 2003 and 10 per cent by 2005.
Seventeen other states have either followed California's lead or have said
they will.
It looks like a bold move. But, as one Los Angeles car dealer said: 'They
can make me put electric cars in my showroom - but they can't make people
buy them if they don't want to.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Travel: Real hot spots in future world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS talking not long ago to a ski holiday specialist, a man who has
schussed the world. Where, I asked, are the skiing hot spots of the future,
those places which are little frequented today but whose renown is fast
growing?
His answer: tomorrow's skiing hot spots are the world's cold spots - its
glaciers. So sharply have world weather patterns changed in just a few years
that low-altitude ski resorts can no longer be relied on for adequate
snow-fall.
It is not just the weather that is different. The whole world is changing
before our eyes, including travel destinations. What makes us want to travel
to one place rather than another? There is no single answer. But well to the
fore is our hope that we are getting the 'real thing'. If we want a
Mediterranean beach we want it unencumbered by high-rises, discotheques and
traffic jams.
What we really mean when we say a place has become spoiled is that it has
come to contain too many people like ourselves and too much clutter that
resembles our own.
The trouble is that the attractive, interesting, unspoiled places we choose
become spoiled as well. Such places are finite in number and becoming rarer.
Yet the face of travel is changing. And, as expectations rise, a large
number of options are opening up. Today more people are choosing
shorter-duration, independent, tailor-made holidays. They want more active
involvement with the place they are visiting. They are likelier to move
around than to stay in one spot. They show more interest in culture and food
than sun and sea.
They are willing to pay for a more expensive, specialised holiday that
engages their own hobbies and interests. In future, short European city
breaks will be among the most popular types of travel. Cities such as Paris,
Venice and Vienna remain eternally fashionable, but others are only now
coming into vogue.
Travellers are realising, for example, that by visiting lesser-known Italian
cities they can have all that Italy has to offer without any of Rome's or
Florence's tourist hordes.
Will Provence and the Dordogne ever flag in popularity? Probably not. What I
cannot understand is why visitors insist on flocking together in rural
France. Like the French Mediterranean, these areas are over-crowded and
over-priced. Under-rated and just next door, such areas as the Cevennes,
Auvergne and Lozere offer delightful rural charms.
Perhaps the biggest surprise in newly-accessible destinations is eastern
Europe. Here is an area of tremendous historical significance, a great
patchwork of cultures that has been cut off to western visitors for half a
century. Yet with few exceptions, eastern Europe has failed to catch on.
The main problem is that the east regards western tourism as a cash cow.
Hungry for foreign exchange, but furnished with sub-standard facilities and
lacking expertise, eastern European countries continue to charge more than
their services are worth. Shoddy hotels, bars and restaurants charge western
prices; the good hotels that do exist charge higher than western prices.
Many east European destinations are simply not that attractive. Old,
once-beautiful cities destroyed in the war have been rebuilt in drab
socialist fashion, while many rural areas have suffered decades of
environmental abuse. Sophia is dull. There is little left of old Bucharest.
Warsaw is an artificial reconstruction. Budapest, for a year or two a rising
star, is now falling back.
Even Prague, well preserved and today eastern Europe's most popular city, is
in danger of pricing itself out of the market. St Petersburg, on the other
hand, is one city which is likely to grow in appeal. So, strangely enough,
is Moscow.
There are still plenty of people more interested in traditional beach
holidays than exploring strange new cities or unknown countryside. If the
Mediterranean is slowing down on this type of development, where will they
go? There are already signs that many Caribbean islands, once tropical
hide-aways for the privilged, are heading down-market; in the next few years
the Caribbean is likely to replace both Florida and the Spanish costas as
the place for package holidays.
Where, then, will one be able to enjoy warm-weather holidays away from
crowds and over-commercialisation? Asia and Africa have long been on the
exotic travel circuit, but now both offer new and intriguing possibilities.
Forget Bali. It is beginning to resemble Torremolinos. Ditto Phuket, Kosamui
and many of the better-known resorts in Thailand. On the other hand, there
are scores of islands in south-east Asia where you can feel like Robinson
Crusoe if you wish to.
Excellent facilities without crowds can be found in Lombok, a 10-minute
flight from Bali; at Langkawi, just over the Thai border in Malaysia; and in
the Visaya Islands in the central Philippines.
The really fascinating part of Asia now opening up, however, is Indochina -
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. While the rest of Asia is charging at full speed
into a high-tech future, these places have been too busy with war and social
re-adjustment to have gone far beyond simple agriculture.
Similarly, Africa offers new places to travel. In north Africa, Islamic
fundamentalist violence has put many travellers off Egypt, but at the other
end of the continent there is hope for an end to violence.
If the new South Africa is successful, it has so much to offer in the way of
beaches, landscapes, game-viewing and sports that for many it will replace
such sunshine spots as Australia and Florida.
The place most strongly tipped for the future, however, is Latin America.
Ecuador has always been popular for its rain forests and offshore Galapagos
islands. Fast-growing in popularity now are Guatamala, for its highland
market towns and lowland Maya ruins, and Chile, for the variety of its
desert, lake and mountain environments.
For some reason, the most popular Latin American destination in 1994 will be
that last hold-out of communism: Cuba. No one can quite explain to me why
the island should appear quite so glamorous at present. Perhaps the world is
changing so fast that we now feel a sentimental attachment to what appears a
long-gone past.

travel available from UK travel firms is the one produced by the Association

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TEN DESTINATIONS WORTH CONSIDERING
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Travel is so subjective that no two people could ever devise the same
list of Top 10 destinations. Here is my own list of places - urban,
seaside, European or tropical - that look promising for 1994, writes
Nicholas Woodsworth:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 Istanbul: about the most exotic and atmospheric place you can reach
   from London on a short city break conveniently.
 2 Corsica: has an off-putting reputation for terrorism, which has
   left the island one of the friendliest, most beautiful and best
   preserved areas in the Mediterranean.
 3 Lake Lucerne, Switzerland: astonishing mountain beauty and
   bourgeois self-assurance.
 4 Luangwa Valley, eastern Zambia: fast being poached out, but so few
   controls that it is one of the last places where game-viewing is
   still a real adventure.
 5 The Keys, Belize, central America: Caribbean islands the way they
   used to be - rum, sailing boats, conch-shell steaks.
 6 Lombok Island, Indonesia: next door to Bali, but 20 years behind in
   seaside development. The further one heads inland, the further the
   present age recedes; strictly Stone Age at its centre.
 7 Terlingua, Texas: ghost town in the Chihuahuan desert near the Rio
   Grande. Recommended for its bars, cowboy music, frontier spirit and
   chilli-con-carne.
 8 Hue, central Vietnam: old imperial capital on the Perfume River,
   home to the most genuine and welcoming smiles in Asia.
 9 Salvador de Bahia, north-eastern Brazil: Afro-Latin culture,
   physical sensuality, and coconut-milk-based cooking.
10 Sese Islands, Lake Victoria, Uganda: the ultimate escape; difficult
   to reach, difficult to get away from, negligible facilities. Serene
   and entirely unpressured.

Last January I persuaded 130 restaurants to offer lunch for a fiver during a
fortnight at the end of the month. It was a tremendous success with our
readers, and more surprisingly, with most of the restaurateurs.
This year we are planning something even better. We are offering 1,000 free
lunches (or dinners) for two. And all you have to do to qualify is accept a
free card which entitles you to a 25 per cent discount on food and wine for
any meals in any restaurant in our scheme for six months.
Too good to be true? Is there really such a thing as a free lunch? In this
case there are no concealed costs, conditions or strings attached for the
six months.
Thereafter, if you find the card useful and want to keep it, an annual fee
of Pounds 35 will be charged by Transmedia, the company which is operating
the scheme.
Even if you have paid this fee, you may cancel your membership and get your
money back at any time within the first year.
The Financial Times decided to become involved in the launch of the scheme
in the UK because we are convinced it offers an excellent deal for our
readers, especially as I have been involved in the initial selection of
restaurants.
So how, exactly, does it work?
The full details and application forms for the Financial Times/Transmedia
restaurant card, will be published in the next Weekend FT on January 8 with
the names of all the UK restaurants which have joined the scheme (more than
100 so far). No coupons will be required.
The free lunches will be offered in the form of 1,000 credits worth Pounds
50. We will ballot all those who use the card between Monday January 24 to
Friday February 11. Every time you use the card your name goes into the hat,
so if you eat out a lot and are lucky you could win more than one free
lunch. There is no limit on how many Pounds 50 credits any one reader may
win. And there will be no losers, for everyone who uses the card will
receive the 25 per cent discount.
You use the card just like any other credit or charge card, but you must
have an Access or Visa card in order to be able to apply for the Financial
Times/Transmedia card. After the application is processed (up to 14 days),
you will receive a directory of all the 2,200 American restaurants which
accept the card and a separate listing of all the UK restaurants which have
joined our promotional scheme. As more British restaurants join we will
publish their names.
How does it work?
Very simply. The FT/Transmedia charge card will be active from the moment
you receive it and can be used to sign for the full cost of any meal at any
participating restaurant.
This amount will then appear on your next Access or Visa statement, together
with a credit for 25 per cent of the amount you have spent on food and
beverages. Service and VAT charges do not attract a discount.
What type of restaurants will be on the list?
The full range, from those for business entertaining to those to take the
family to at the weekend, including wine bars and hotel dining rooms.
There will be no fast food outlets. The majority of restaurants will be in
London but there are already 25 restaurants on the list outside London in
Bath, Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Manchester and Southampton.
And, most importantly, the FT/Transmedia card will become an integral and
valuable tool for anyone travelling on business or pleasure.
You can apply for the FT/Transmedia card from anywhere outside the UK and
use it within the next six months on your next business trip to London. Or
to Boston, New York, Chicago, Palm Beach, Florida, Los Angeles or San
Francisco.
Is that all?
Almost. Find out the full details from next Saturday's Weekend FT.

In cookery, as in other things, there are booms and busts, and the wince
factor in food enters the new year alive and kicking.
The kiwi fruit, with its fresh fruit taste and its brilliant jet and emerald
colouring had less than 15 minutes of true foodie fame before it became the
darling of degenerated nouvelle cuisine - instantly earning the soubriquet
of ingredient non-grata at top tables. So passe is the kiwi fruit now that
even country pubs allegedly serving 'good pub grub' are liable to stop short
of using it to garnish their microwaved Tex-Mex and deep-frozen red snapper.
Other fresh ingredients that have come in and out of fashion recently
include dwarf corn and mangetout peas. Good riddance to the corn: the corn I
have sampled has been tasteless. As for the mangetout, like the kiwi fruit
it was just too pretty for its own good. And more often than not it defied
the Trades Descriptions Act - with all those inedible threads at the seams
it ought to have been called mangemoitie.
The vogue for kumquats is on the wane but the onslaught of the ubiquitous
sun-dried tomato seems relentless and I feared suffocation at Christmas
under a surfeit of fancy filo parcels - pouches, purses and crackers crammed
with mincemeat and savoury titbits.
The red meat market seems destined to go on decreasing. The pig, once known
as the gentleman who pays the rent, is due for a revival but it will
probably be years before top quality British sausages and well cured hams
are the norm and caul, pigs tails, trotters and Bath chaps are readily
available again.
Interest in game is growing. In poultry, chicken and turkey are less
fashionable than they were. Guinea fowl now seems more alluring than quail.
Goose and duck are the thing with confits taking over from magrets as the
smart items of the 1990s.
As for fish, diver- and line-caught are the buzz words now, and pickled fish
looks set to pick up nicely, from salted anchovies to lightly cured
herrings.
The olive oil boom, which began with French and Italian extra virgins, is
now slicking its way across the Atlantic. Californian oils have already
started to reach our shores.
I love olive oil but think it is time to redress the balance a little and
remember how delicious good butter can be. Butter is after all the fat of
the north and small local farmers making it in Britain with love and care
deserve at least some of the support we lavish so freely on estate bottled
olive oils.
Vinegars, like oils, continue to rise in popularity with properly aged
balsamic vinegar from Modena, sherry vinegar from Jerez, English mulberry
vinegar and prune vinegar from France earning pride of place in smart
larders.
I cannot see that Italy will lose its lead in the food fashion stakes for a
long while yet but the cuisines of south-west France, Portugal and Turkey
are all looking healthy and interest in our own British cooking is growing
stronger. Thai cooking, fragrant with lemongrass and star anise, hovers
meanwhile on the brink. Will it boom or will it not?
Pasta mania is getting out of hand. Pizza is giving way to polenta in some
circles. Rice is on the up and breads are very big news. The success of
ciabatta and focaccia was exceptional but the general trend in breads is set
fair.
Even sourdough, appealing to a minority market with its darker, sourer
taste, is gaining ground. While British treats - potato cakes, pikelets,
Lincolnshire plum bread, barley bannocks, Aberdeen rowies and co - are
enjoying a new winning streak.
BREAKFAST BREAD (makes 2 small loaves)
Here is a bonus since breads are in the ascendancy and so are the foods of
south-west France, where the best prunes come from.
Dark nuggets of prune stud this dough. Earl Grey tea provides the liquid
element. Cinnamon and orange zest complete the aromatics. Breakfast Bread
can be toasted carefully but I prefer to nibble it just as it is, without
any butter or marmalade, with my early morning cuppa.
1 lb unbleached white bread flour, preferably stone ground; 1 x 7 g packet
of easy-blend yeast; 8 oz large, squashy prunes;  1/2 pt very milky Earl
Grey tea; 2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz caster sugar; generous  1/2 teaspoon ground
cinnamon; 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest; beaten egg to glaze.
Mix together by hand the flour, yeast, sugar, cinnamon and citrus zest (or
use a food processor or a food mixer with a dough hook). Dice the butter,
put it into a small saucepan with half the tea and heat gently until the
butter is melted. Add the rest of the tea, which should be cold, and pour
the mixture onto the dry ingredients. Mix and knead to a smooth and elastic
dough. Cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. A slow rise in a cool
place is best.
Knock back the risen dough and work the prunes (stoned and chopped small)
into it. Divide the dough in two, shape each piece neatly and drop it into a
small loaf tin. Cover and leave to prove for 1-1 1/2 hours.
Glaze with beaten egg and bake on a hot baking sheet at 400`F (200C) gas
mark 6 for about 40 minutes until cooked right through. Cool on a rack
before eating or wrapping and storing.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Food and Wine: Even the maggots liked the cheese - On Page
VII, Nicholas Woodsworth names Corsica as one of his Top 10 travel tips for
1994. Here, he eats with a Corsican peasant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corsica has a rich culinary tradition. And, like most true Mediterranean
cooking, the island's fare remains close to its peasant roots. What counts
is not richness or sophistication of style but fine, fresh ingredients
prepared simply to bring out the best of natural flavours.
Is anyone, at this point, still reading? The trouble is, this kind of theme
pops up so often in trendy cookbooks, Sunday supplements and Keith Floyd
cookery programmes that it has ceased to mean very much.
It is now a quarter of a century since Elizabeth David began telling us
about the wonders of southern ingredients prepared freshly and without
pretention. What she had to say is, of course, all true, but bang on about
anything long enough and we cease to hear it.
So, I am not going to bang on. This is not a discourse on freshness,
simplicity and the gastronomic legacy of a rich Mediterranean peasant
tradition. It is merely an account of a Corsican meal - one shared with a
peasant - that brought home to me these truths in a fresh and simple manner.
I first heard of Pierre Milanini through his cousin, Jeannot, as we sat in
an elegant little seaside restaurant in the Corsican resort of Porto
Vecchio. We were not discussing food, but the insular Corsican mentality.
For an island people, Jeannot was telling me, Corsicans are surprisingly out
of their element along their rich coasts. Over the millennia the island has
suffered repeated attack and invasion by sea, and Corsicans have survived by
seeking the security and peace of the rugged interior - with time, the
inhospitable mountains have become their preferred home.
I looked around the restaurant as he talked. The place was full, not of
Corsicans but of end-of-summer visitors who came from everywhere. The food
was good, but it might have come from anywhere.
'If you want another Corsica,' Jeannot suggested, 'why don't you go inland
to Quenza? I have a cousin who runs a stable and gite d'etape on the
mountain behind the village. He's a bit of a hermit, slightly eccentric, and
a real Corsican. And he knows how to cook - every last thing he serves he
grows, raises and prepares himself.'
Who could resist a suggestion like that? I left for the hills early the next
morning.
Guests would have to know about Pierre Milanini's place to find it. Gites
d'etapes exist only in the wilder areas of France, and usually serve a
specialist clientele of cold and hungry ramblers, mountain climbers and
campers. Their isolation, though, does not affect their quality; they are
often the last strongholds of authentic regional cuisine.
The medieval village of Quenza sits lost in a ring of high peaks and hills.
I found the gite hidden on a tiny, winding road that disappeared into the
chestnut forests above the village. The place was marked only by the
well-groomed horses that milled around a paddock beside a ramshackle stone
house.
At first, Pierre did not want to know about one more diner. He had closed
his gite for the season, he said, shaking his long locks and thick grey
beard back and forth. And he was busy preparing his annual trip to Ajaccio -
five days through the mountains on horseback. Food, he told me, should be no
more hurried an affair than travel.
But when he saw me admiring the ripe, red tomatoes growing in the large
garden behind the paddock, his pride got the better of him.
'They are the finest tomatoes around,' he beamed. 'Same as the rest of my
garden, same as my fruit orchard: no pesticides, no herbicides, no chemical
fertilisers - just plenty of good, aged horse manure.' I was welcome to try
his tomatoes, he said, if I did not mind sitting down to whatever else he
could put together at short notice.
Pierre's house was rustically chaotic. Muddy riding boots stood drying in
one corner of a huge, unswept fireplace, mountain walking boots in the
other. There was a shotgun leaning against the wall and an ammunition
bandolier slung over the back of a threadbare armchair. In the chair itself,
a hunting dog lay snoozing with its paws in the air. Three more lay prone on
the floor. Half a dozen cats were lounging on the long, scarred farm table
that took up most of the room.
'Dehors]' Out] he roared, and the animals disappeared in a flurry of hair
and dust. 'I love animals,' he said, slinging one last kitten out the door.
'I have 30 horses, 60 pigs, 30 cows, eight dogs and 11 cats. I'd have more
horses if I could afford them, but the damned things don't pay for
themselves.'
Pierre talked as he put an iron pot of soup on the stove and began slicing
tomatoes. An exemplar of Corsican insularity, he is a purist, a die-hard
traditionalist, a hold-out against modern civilization. As a cook he
mistrusts all food additives, any kind of pre-mixed concoction or
preparation, all time-saving devices, any corner-cutting cooking method.
He has lived all his 60 years in Quenza. When he grew up, producing food was
a question of survival. He spent drought-ridden summers watering chestnut
trees - without chestnut flour, there was no bread to see the family through
the winter. Wheat flour was an unaffordable luxury. 'Life was difficult
then,' Pierre laughed. 'We just didn't know it.'
We sat down to plates of sliced tomatoes. Mine were accompanied by mild
onion rings, parsley and olive oil, all home-produced, all delicious.
Pierre's were accompanied by nothing but a shake of salt.
'We use too many ingredients in our meals,' he growled. 'Add enough and you
kill the taste of what you are trying to eat. People like garnishes and
dressings, but do they know what tomatoes are really like?'
Perhaps he had a point, I thought, as I sliced through a tomato with my
fork.
'And for God's sake, man, don't massacre them]' Pierre added. 'Tomatoes are
delicate things. Here, use this.'
He passed over a clasp knife with a long, mean-looking, blade, the kind you
imagine gangsters stick into each other. I sighed. No one had instructed me
on the use of dining implements since nursery.
A minute later, though, I was learning yet another lesson - to cut bread in
the peasant fashion. Copying Pierre, I held his fresh-baked bread - a round
loaf the size of a small bicycle tyre - against my chest and drew my knife
gingerly through the crust towards me. One slip, I thought, and I shall stab
myself fatally.
I was gaining confidence, however, by the time the soup bowls arrived. In
them was a thick, fragrant vegetable minestra, simmered for hours with herbs
and chunks of smoked, salted pork, and wonderful to eat with large slices of
crusty bread and red wine.
Again, though, Pierre brought me back to essentials. 'All these seasonings
and extras are fine - I like thyme, bay and garlic as much as anyone. But
there is just one great secret. It is the onion. Without the onion, you can
do nothing; with it, you can do anything. It is the point of departure.'
Pierre was emphatic. I was not going to argue. It seemed as good a world
view as any.
Silently, we drank in praise of the onion. But I did not remain silent a few
moments later when I cut off a thick slice from the leg of cured ham Pierre
had set on the table. The flavour was superb.
'Nothing but salt and pepper in that. I slaughtered, cured and hung that pig
five months ago. No flavouring, no herbs, no spices. The taste is in the
flesh itself. Elsewhere, pigs are penned up. On this island, pigs wander
round all day eating chestnuts and acorns. Come and look at what we make
best in Corsica.'
In a cool, dark, dry room off the main house, Pierre showed me the produce
to which he gives his greatest attention. Hanging from hooks on the ceiling
were hams; coppe sausages made from pig's necks; lonze from their filets;
and figatelli - smoked sausage from their liver, heart and kidneys.
And so to cheese. Mysteriously, Pierre kept his soft ewe's cheese in a
covered pot and, even more mysteriously, insisted on spreading it on a slice
of bread for me. It had a sharp, biting taste which I enjoyed - until I
noticed my cheese refused to stay still. Not only were small yellow maggots
wriggling to the surface but, once fallen to the table, they began springing
about. I think I blanched.
Pierre let go a great haw-haw of laughter. 'Fromage vivant,' he said. 'We
call it living cheese. You can't make it, it just makes itself during humid,
heavy weather. But when I've got some, people come for miles to eat it. And
if we've had a little wine, we like to bet on whose maggots can jump the
highest. It's a good time.'
I had had a little wine, but I needed a little more before I began to have a
good time again. There was coffee; home-made eau-de-vie; more talk about the
manners and kitchen customs of Corsica; more eau-de-vie. By the time I left
that rough and ramshackle little gite and was heading back down the
mountainside to Porto Vecchio, I was in a quandary. I was wondering how I
was ever going to have a good time in elegant little seaside restaurants
again.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Fashion: . . .with a hint of tasteful deconstruction -
Fashion has been invaded by the sociologist. No wonder younger, brighter
designers have become self-conscious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Designers tend to have an identity problem. Are they artist or artisan? Are
they truly creative, their work an illuminating commentary on humanity in
general and its current condition, struggles and preoccupations in
particular? Or are they strangers to the world of ideas, mere makers of
ultimately inconsequential practical things which may well be beautiful but
are hardly important?
When the spring merchandise is delivered to the shops this month it will
become obvious that this confusion particularly afflicts fashion designers.
Nor is it restricted to what goes on in their heads; it is made manifest in
their work. For fashion itself seems confused, unsure of the direction it
wants to take. It is almost as if some designers have decided they are
artisans, some aspire to art and some are reaffirming the truth: they are an
exceptional and valuable hybrid.
Archaeologists and historians will insist that the work of the artisan is
just as important as that of the artist when it comes to understanding a
dead culture but that is cold comfort for the modern designer who, training
alongside fine artists, rarely manages to graduate without a sense of being
on the second team.
The fashion designer is particularly vulnerable to intimations of
inferiority. Unlike the architect, the goldsmith or the cabinet-maker, the
dress designer's pedigree is exceedingly short. Until the end of the last
century, the makers of clothes were obscure, more interpreters of the whims
and vanities of their clients (a very small, very rich elite) than creators
in their own right. Yet few artefacts are capable of shedding brighter light
on a society than the clothes it wore.
Over the last two decades dress has become a hot and crowded area of study.
No longer the private fief of a few art historians, it has been invaded by
sociologists, semioticians, the occasional novelist and fashion journalists.
A profession which once merely described is now given to instant analysis of
the social and political implications of the swings of fashion.
It is little wonder then that the younger, brighter fashion designers have
become self-conscious. Instead of instinctively reacting to the mood of the
times, they employ their intellects and use their work to embody ideas,
theories, critiques. They function as artists are supposed to. For some time
these designers - Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Rei
Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, Marcel Marongiu, Ann Demeulemeester, Jean Colonna
and Koji Tatsuno - have been practising their own version of deconstruction.
Essentially, this involves taking recognisable shapes, styles, fabrics and
motifs from history and re-ordering them so that their associations and
social meanings are both utilised (what were grunge frocks but the
hard-worn, ill-fitting hand-me-downs of the great depression?) and
undermined (unbuttoned over jeans or leggings, the frock is a victim's badge
worn ironically).
For spring Westwood, the movement's heroine who is exploring traditional
ideas of elegance and the ability of a garment's engineering to reshape the
body, sculpts taffeta into rococo bodices and late Victorian crinolines and
puts a gigantic, silly and beautiful net and straw petticoat beneath it
while asking her models to teeter on 7in platform soles. The wearer becomes
a doll, but a very imposing doll.
Many of the Deconstructionists go a step further and literally expose the
structure of a garment, turning it inside out, taking a conventional garment
apart and putting it back together so that the proportions are subtly wrong,
the layers disconcertingly untidy, the fabrics twisted, scrunched and
bedraggled. In doing this, they claim, they have developed a new aesthetic
which aspires to supplant the ideals of harmony, perfection, neatness,
richness and newness which they regard as bourgeois, banal and
inappropriate.
Left simmering on the back burner are the artisans, the fashion designers
who are still operating in the tradition of the couturiers, making
expensive-looking clothes for conventionally minded women who wish to look
glamorous in a way which the men in their life will understand. They still
operate instinctively so the work being done by their more
attention-getting, cerebral peers has influenced theirs.
So there is a much-needed freshness to the work of almost-stale 1980s names
such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Muir, Christian Lacroix, Claude Montana, Sonia
Rykiel, Gianni Versace, Gianfranco Ferre, Caroline Charles, Martine Sitbon.
The clothes they have designed for spring are much more relaxed. The
flaunt-it, overly-structured styles of the late 1980s and early 90s have
given way to a much easier look which is all about softness, fluidity and
richly textured fabrics. They do not necessarily droop and draggle but these
clothes are infinitely more forgiving of figure flaws and much more
comfortable than what went before.
But in between are the hybrids, the designers capable of an intellectual
analysis of their medium but who possess a sharp sense of utility and
convenience. Artistic statements on the catwalk are wonderful, they would
say, but can they be worn with confidence by rather short, slightly plump Ms
Average? If not, then the true designer will jettison the outfit.
Among this number are most of the British designers - Katharine Hamnett,
Betty Jackson, Jasper Conran, Edina Ronay, Ellis Flyte and Richard Ostell,
Workers For Freedom, Helen Storey, Ben de Lisi and a raft of newcomers - and
most of the Americans - Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein. At their
head, however, are the disciplined creative geniuses, Issey Miyake and
Giorgio Armani, effortlessly reflecting the zeitgeist while offering
comfort, flattery and confidence.
Out of the confusion it is possible to identify some continuity and some
novelty. The key piece for day is the new softer jacket, narrow on the
shoulders and upper chest, then flaring gently to skim waist and hips.
Beneath that options open up: a long narrow skirt, slit or wrapped; a long
primitive-pleated skirt which looks narrow but allows plenty of stride; a
gently flared permanently crumpled silk or cotton skirt; a short, flaring
skirt in taffeta pleats or layered chiffon; wide palazzo pants;
flare-from-the-knee loon pants; narrow cigarette trousers either
front-pleated or jeans-cut.
Informal evening wear provides a wide choice this summer. For the leggy
there is the new-again mini dress which is cut like the little frocks of the
mid-1960s, with spaghetti straps or a halter neck, a high narrow bust and a
swirly little skirt. But satin, chiffon or lace trousers, particularly in
cream or white, look wonderfully fresh particularly when teamed with a top
of complete simplicity: knitted silk, light cashmere, chiffon or string.
Transparency, or at least the illusion of it, is a strong theme for summer,
achieved with lace, layers of chiffon or coarse mesh. Many designers toyed
with string vests of varying looseness of weave. Some are very flirtatious
indeed; others just hint at the summer-gold flesh beneath.
More formal evening wear also depends for its air of ingenue ethereality on
floaty, diaphanous fabrics often layered. The bias-cut slip dress in satin,
crepe or silk jersey is doubtless the sexiest frock of summer 1994. Fashion
cognoscenti are already snapping up Marks and Spencer's full-length,
untrimmed, satin nightie for summer parties.
The improvised-looking and second-hand, the unironed and slightly frayed,
layered and apparently haphazard serve as a nod to deconstruction. Colours
are subdued, non-aggressive neutrals and naturals: white, cream, ecru, 100
shades of beige, soft safari brown, dark navy, slate and black. The new
aesthetic calls for interesting texture and a softness which denies all hard
edges. This summer you will believe a woman can float.

FT  01 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: A simpler, more elegant design on life. . .
 -The design industry is forsaking the superficial, elitist style of the
1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
There have been pointers in the wind for a long time. As the 1980s wound
down and the biggest economic boom petered out, one of the most surprising
casualties of the recession turned out to be the design industry. As it had
always been received wisdom that the design industry was just what we needed
to lead us out of the recession this was superficially very bad news.
In fact it soon became clear that in most cases the design industry had been
the architect of its own fall from grace. By and large it had failed at what
it was supposed to be good at - tapping into the psychology of society,
meeting its subtlest needs, being a proper conduit for its true interests.
There is a direct link, as Nigel Whiteley points out in a thoughtful book*
on the subject between a 'society's design and its social health: design is
a manifestation of the social, political and economic situation'.
What seemed to happen in the UK in the 1980s is that design let us down. It
began to deal in shallower, more ephemeral precepts and came to stand for
what Whiteley calls 'professional middle-class taste masquerading as
ethically superior 'good' taste'. So even though the recession had a huge
part to play in the decline of the status of design and designers, there was
much, much more to it than that. It was not just that many of us had run out
of money, it was a rejection of what the design industry stood for, for the
values we thought it projected.
Not, of course, that it is fair to blame the design world alone. Several
designers and design writers were deeply concerned about their role and
where current practice was taking them, long before the recession began.
Whiteley quotes Jeremy Myerson, a design writer, saying that design had come
to be used as a 'weapon of exclusivity, of segmentation - the means by which
many desirable goods and services are put out of reach of large sections of
the community'.
One has only to think of once utilitarian, functional items which were so
re-designed and packaged as to put them beyond the reach of many who might
need them - Alessi kettles, Phillippe Starck lemon squeezers, Versace silk
shirts, designer-labelled handbags - to realise the truth of what he says.
In many cases the redesign offered no technical improvement - an Alessi
kettle functions no better than a Russell Hobbs but it became a cult object
because of its superficial styling and high price.
The designer FHK Henrion joined in the debate, attacking the notion of
design as a tool for 'the yuppy fun of a moneyed minority' declaring that
'the designer's place in the economy is of crucial importance but his place
in society is no less so'.
While many of us in the west were engaged in a merry spending spree much of
the third world looked on aghast - not just with disapproval at our
frivolous ways but also filled with fear at how these values might overwhelm
their own culture and way of life. Whitely quotes Ashoke Chatterjee, adviser
to India's National Institute of Design, saying that he sees the common
denominator in design from the west as 'one of affluence and obsolescence,
the catering to inconsistent whims which spell high profit . . . the concept
of real need is . . . replaced with the image of design as the five-star
life-style.'
He also quotes that splendid economist-philosopher EF Schumacher: 'What is
at stake is not economics but culture; not the standard of living but the
quality of life.' In other words, it is hard to overstate the role of
designers - how very much it matters that they get it right and how deeply
we feel let down when they get it wrong.
So what we see around us now is not just people who are less well off than
they were, but people who view the world differently. It is not just that we
have lost confidence in the ability of the design industry to provide the
solutions, the industry is now perceived to be part of the problem,
perpetuating values we no longer accept.
In our daily lives all of this is expressed, often at a subconscious level,
in a seeking out of simpler things and simpler ways of living. And this is
expressed not just in clothes or in houses but it invades all aspects of our
lives. On the fashion front (as Brenda Polan reports here) the old formality
has been loosened up, lightness, a lack of stuffiness is all. And so it is
in interiors. Who, for instance, could have imagined, in the middle of the
1980s that a series of books on life's props called Chic Simple* (about the
first of which - on the home - I wrote last June) would be a runaway
success? Who would have imagined that in the hothouse world of interior
design, where the excesses of the 1980s were most exuberant, these simple
guides purveying the notion that modest things can give pleasure and be just
as useful as expensive things, would prove to signal a serious new
direction?
Chic Simple provides the manuals, the visual inspiration, as well as the
hard practical information for this new way of living. It is big on
quotations from almost all the design greats. Here we have Elsie de Wolfe,
the gifted American interior decorator (perhaps it is relevant to note that
she began her career as an interior decorator around the turn of the century
when many were beginning to tire of musty, over-crowded Victorian
interiors): 'When I am asked to decorate a new house, my first thought is
suitability. My next thought is proportion. Always I keep in mind the
importance of simplicity.'
Simplicity should not be confused with austerity. 'Light, air and comfort -
these things I must always have in a room,' she said. 'We must learn to
recognise suitability, simplicity, and proportion, and apply our knowledge
to our needs.'
Simple should never mean dull. De Wolfe, for instance, was a master of
restraint as well as panache. At the time, it seems, her rooms were
considered practically barren in comparison to the turn-of-the-century norm
but looking at photographs of them now they seem to me to exude a high
glamour that no over-stuffed Victorian interior ever did.
Simple should mean fewer things but better quality and above all should
never be confused with cheapness. In the Chic Simple tome on clothes tribute
is paid to many classics that qualify as simple but are certainly not cheap.
The Trench Coat - the Burberry, of course, what else? - reeking as it does
of 'espionage, mystery, loners in the mist, drama and intrigue' gets star
billing along with the humble white T-shirt, denim, the blazer, the plimsoll
and cashmere ('cashmere is a tempting investment, as it provides thermal
control without bulk and feels luxurious').
This is a philosophy, an approach to living that transcends time barriers.
De Wolfe, born in 1870, would have been perfectly at one with Terence Riley,
Director of Architecture and Design at New York's Museum of Modern Art who
believed 'An anonymously made Pyrex container is about good design as much
as an Alvar Aalto vase.' And both of them would have been in tune with Micky
Drexler, president of The Gap, when he says 'Good taste shouldn't have to
cost anything extra.'
Not a bad motto for the coming year might be the Australian Aboriginal
saying which has been adopted by Chic Simple as its leitmotif: 'The more you
know, the less you need.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: A simpler, more elegant design on life. . .
 -Josephine Fairley asks the style professionals how to make the very most
of the New Year sales and how to avoid costly mistakes
</HEADLINE>

This is the season when the bargain-hunting sorts those shoppers worthy of
Olympic medals from the amateurs. Spot the former, riffling calmly through
the rails of discounted garments, wish-list clasped in one hand, while the
other keeps a sensible grip on the credit card. The rest of us look frenzied
and get excited over fashion follies which lived to haunt their designers -
and will soon do the same for us.
One New York shopper I know freezes her credit card in ice during the sales.
Should she fall in love with an item, she returns home and waits for her
Amex to defrost. If it still seems a good idea, she hot-foots back to the
shop and bags her quarry.
I asked style professionals about their strategies for bargain hunting and
their best and worst buys.
Gabriella Di Nora, personal shopping manager, Harvey Nichols
My best buy was a Donna Karan ivory V-neck silk crepe blouse, down from
Pounds 225 to around Pounds 65, which looked nothing on the hanger but
fabulous when I tried it on.
My worst buy was a beautiful pair of Betty Jackson black crepe trousers for
half-price - around Pounds 55. I thought I was being terribly clever because
they matched a skirt suit I'd got from her, but they were so baggy in the
crotch I looked like I was wearing a nappy.
Trying things on is essential, even in a sale. So is wearing the right
outfit to shop in: a body, trousers and a soft top, slip-on shoes the height
you'd wear with trousers - and definitely tights, not stockings] Don't ever
take your partner. You may gain a bargain, but lose a relationship.
John Morgan, associate editor, GQ
My best buy was a huge alpaca teddy bear coat by Richard James, which comes
to my ankles and could accommodate several of me. It's a splendid seasonal
security blanket and is wonderfully warm.
My worst mistake was in Paris, when I got confused by continental sizing and
managed to buy a pair of shoes a whole size too small. I did try them on,
but didn't frogmarch up and down like you should - it was a real case of
sales fever. Fortunately I was able to find a Cinderella whose foot they
fitted, and passed them on.
Ask yourself whether you would want to buy the item if it was full price -
because something is only a bargain if you get a lot of wear out of it. I
approach sales with caution and find them good hunting grounds for basics
such as shoes and knitwear.
Nicola Jeal, editor, Elle
My best buy is a pair of Manolo Blahnik purple suede riding boots, Pounds
100 down from Pounds 300. They are incredibly comfortable. My worst buy is a
pair of Manolo Blahnik turquoise suede riding boots, from the same sale, but
a size smaller. I made the mistake of thinking I could stretch them. They're
cripplingly tight.
I always take a small mirror with me, so that I can check the back-view of
everything I try on.
Geraldine James, contemporary collections buyer, Harrods
My best buy was a grey wool Workers For Freedom short pleated skirt, half
price at Pounds 90, which I got two winters ago and I've worn at least once
a week since - partly because it has an elasticated waist, so it's
incredibly comfortable]
My worst buy was a Donna Karan jacket, in pink - a colour I never normally
wear, and which became instantly dated. It cost around Pounds 175, down from
Pounds 300. It's still sitting unworn in my wardrobe.
Do not buy things that are incredibly fashionable because they date so
quickly. Go for neutral colours and classics, or look at the upcoming
season's fashions (in magazines) to help identify something on the rails
that you'll want to wear sooner, rather than later.
Iain R Webb, fashion editor, The Times:
My best buy was a trio of linen jackets, bought for Dollars 50 each in a Gap
shop in New York, in banana, sky blue and a Madras plaid. My worst buy was a
Byblos silk shirt, reduced to Pounds 200 in the Harvey Nichols sale. It was
cream and black deckchair stripes, splashed with huge red hibiscus flowers
and looked wonderful until I put it on. (The friend I gave it to was very
pleased, though).
Always try things on, rather than go by the tag - even if the label says
it's a medium, that may be a mistake.
Sophie Laybourne, Daily Telegraph fashion writer:
My best buy was an Aquascutum 40s-style fake beaver fur coat, which I picked
up in Harrods' sale for around Pounds 100 - down from about Pounds 250 -
long before fake fur became trendy. It was unbelievably warm, and looked so
like the real thing that, heart-breakingly, it was eventually stolen off the
back seat of my car one dark night. I wore it so often I became known as The
Beaver.
My worst buy was a Rifat Ozbek jacket, when he first became fashionable and
everyone - from the Princess of Wales down - was wearing his stuff. I bought
it in Browns in South Molton Street and it cost around Pounds 400 even in
the sale. It was so ultra-fashionable and had been so widely photographed
that by the time the weather was right to wear it again it was very
identifiably Last Year's Jacket. I was going to a wedding and I was young
and in love and wanted to appear desperately chic, but instead looked like
something out of Dynasty.
Do not to shop in sales when - for love or any other reason - you're feeling
terribly pleased with yourself, because you tend to think you look fabulous
in anything.'
Caroline Baker, fashion editor, Good Housekeeping
My best buy was a Pounds 50 Ralph Lauren bias-cut yellow paisley silk skirt,
a perennial classic I wore constantly. My worst was a Yohji Yamomoto brown
pin-striped jacket, cut out of one piece of fabric, terribly unstructured at
a time when everyone was into the 1980s executive look; I rather regret
getting rid of it, now that everything's unstructured again. At least I
didn't waste much money - it was about Pounds 10 on the last day of the
sale.
Lisa Nelson, chairman, P R Unlimited
My best buy was a blue suede Gucci jacket, which was outrageously priced
before the sale but became affordable at around Pounds 300. My worst was a
pair of purple Azzedine Alaia stretch trousers, which I got in Browns for
Pounds 100 and never wore. I'd always wanted something by Alaia but I made
the classic sales mistake of being seduced by the designer label, without
asking myself whether I'd ever wear it.
Lowri Turner, fashion editor, Evening Standard
My best buy was a Jasper Con-ran black viscose knit wrap-over ankle-length
skirt, reduced by about 50 per cent to Pounds 75, which I bought without
even trying on. I thought it would be a good basic, but when I tried it at
home I discovered it moved beautifully and was also really sexy.
'My worst buy was a Richmond / Cornejo lime green viscose circle skirt which
stopped just below the knee - the most unflattering length. This was 10
years ago, and I was just so thrilled to have something by Richmond /
Cornejo - but it was such a disaster and I was so embarrassed I put it in
the cupboard without even taking the ticket off.
My strategy would be: buy duplicates of things you've already got in your
wardrobe, because you know they work for you. Don't take any risks.
Anna Harvey, deputy editor, Vogue:
My best buy was a blonde cashmere Jaeger trench coat, reduced to Pounds 40
from about Pounds 250. Even 15 years ago, this was so cheap that I thought
they must have made a mistake and held my breath all the way to the till.
My worst buy was more recent, in Rayne: they had comfortable little flat
shoes for Pounds 40, reduced from Pounds 99, and although I only needed
black I got a bad case of the Imelda Marcoses, and bought four other pairs
in different colours - which I've never worn.
My sales advice: the best shops have the best sales.
Nick Sullivan, fashion director, Esquire:
I paid around Pounds 85 for my best buy, a Paul Smith Shetland sweater of
the kind you had when you were about three; it's donkey-coloured, nicely
scratchy and incredibly warm.
My worst buy was a suit from Rees, which I paid about Pounds 120 for some
years ago; the shape was great but I made the fatal mistake of not taking it
to the daylight to check the colour. When I got it home, it was a ghastly
khaki and it made me look like a chauffeur.
Pause and think before you buy: will it fill a gap in my wardrobe, do I need
it?
June Marsh, fashion editor, Country Life:
My best buy was a Margaret Howell blue velvet skirt, reduced to Pounds 90
from Pounds 200 last winter, and it's barely been off my back since. My
worst was a pair of Pucci leggings which weren't me at all - I just loved
the colours.
Go for classics, rather than high fashion items - and avoid bright colours
however gloriously cheerful, unless you're planning to move to Sydney.
Caroline Neville, Caroline Neville public relations:
My best buy was at The Woollen Mill, a permanent sale shop in St Andrew's. I
picked up a huge cashmere throw for about Pounds 150 that would easily have
cost Pounds 500 in London.
My worst buy was a pair of Dollars 150 glittery earrings bought in a store
on Madison Avenue. They looked bold and daring in dynamic New York but in
more restrained London, they were simply over-the-top.
It's vital to go on a reconnaissance mission: you don't then fall in love
with the first crazy thing you see and regret it further down the street.
Jackie Modlinger, fashion director, Daily Express:
My best buy was a Ralph Lauren pin-striped short skirt, which I bought last
summer in their sale for Pounds 50 when I realised that short skirts were
going to make a comeback. It matched a Ralph Lauren suit I'd bought earlier
in the season (which had a long skirt and trousers) making the suit even
more versatile.
Go for a designer label that you've always coveted and could never afford
rather than cheap labels that have been marked dow even further.

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: Prepare to man the barricades - The
plight of French industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is not much life to be seen along the Roubaix Canal these days,
particularly on a bitterly cold winter's morning. Viewed from here, the
industrial heart of northern France is a grim, ghostly vision, a dark
landscape of empty streets shrouded in fog.
On the canalside, a man fishes where factory effluent has melted the ice.
Shadowy figures move behind the steamy windows of the Cafe de Calais. All is
silent, but for the muffled noises emerging from the old Fabrique Leroux
next door.
The sounds coming from the Leroux mill are not productive ones. After years
of inactivity, the plant is being demolished piecemeal. Inside, a bulldozer
and a team of Arab immigrant workers are vigorously smashing, pounding,
cutting and burning. The work keeps them warm.
But one man stands quietly in the cold, watching the world come banging down
around him. He has come to rescue a few timbers from the fire on the factory
floor in order to heat his own house. He has lingered to watch the hammers
and flames destroy the only kind of work-place and life he knows.
For this destruction he blames the sweatshops of Asia.
In its heyday, the Leroux woollen mill employed 1,200 workers. Along with
thousands of other factories it made the region surrounding Lille the
largest and most prosperous textile centre in France. More than half of the
country's fabrics and clothing came from this one small area on the Belgian
border.
Since the early 1960s, however, 75 per cent of the textile jobs have
vanished; in the past 10 years alone, job numbers have plummeted from
110,000 to 48,000. As the mills disappear, the number of unemployed people
continues to rise; in the Nord/Pas de Calais region, unemployment resulting
from decline in the textile, mining and steel industries now approaches
250,000. Few of the 1,500 textile and clothing plants that remain are
untouched by the crisis and the future of Roubaix mill workers, both in work
and out, becomes ever less sure.
Roger Glorieux's life has been anything but glorious. His father and
grandfather were woollen mill workers. Roger started in Roubaix mills at 14
and stopped 45 years later when the plant in which he was employed as a
machine maintenance mechanic closed down.
'At 74, it is hard to see it all go like this,' he says. 'We worked six days
a week and it wasn't a luxurious life. We couldn't buy the things working
people today can buy - if something breaks now, people just throw it away
and buy another. We used to repair things. But, back then, at least we had
work we could count on. You cannot do that today. I liked the life.'
Like most of the residents of Roubaix, Glorieux has no hesitation when asked
the reasons for his town's demise. 'It is many things but, mostly, it is
south-east Asia. Workers there produce everything so cheaply. Salaries are
low. Workers get by on a few bowls of rice a day. They do not take holidays.
They work six days a week. Raw materials are cheap. Their bosses do not have
to pay the social charges our bosses do  - pensions, unemployment insurance,
paid holidays. Of course they can keep prices down. How can we compete
against that?'
But if Glorieux attributes Asian success partly to the kind of regime
Frenchmen followed before the introduction of social legislation for workers
in 1936, he also blames European mismanagement. 'It is partly the fault of
the French government. They should have put a brake on cheap imports long
ago. And now, with the European Union, it is even worse. We cannot control
the frontiers; anything can come in.'
A battered hand brings a roll-up cigarette to his mouth. 'It is also the
fault of the bosses. They used to run their businesses like little kingdoms,
each one looking after his own interests. They should have worked together.
They have modernised now, but it is too late.'
Is the situation beyond repair? 'The great days of the mills are over,' says
Glorieux, with a Gallic shrug. 'We do not even wear that much wool any more.
We must find other things to do, using the skills we have. My son is a
computer programmer. But he is lucky. I feel sorry for the young ones who
have nothing ahead of them.'
On the whole, his analysis echoes that of industry and government pundits.
Like them, he accepts the need to develop new kinds of jobs, new
professions, new industries providing the region with a competitive edge;
and, like them, he is not quite sure just what these might be.
The fact is that, with no real solution in sight, most authorities in France
are as anxious to preserve the past as embrace the uncertain future. In the
face of unbeatable competition, they assert, the protection of old and
ailing industries is the only way jobs can be preserved.
The rules of global trade have become unfair, says Jean-Paul Robert, the
secretary-general of GRIT, a regional grouping of textile industrialists. In
France, employer-paid social provisions equal the cost of wage bills; in
developing countries, there are often no provisions.
Many non-European textile producers subsidise exports, practise dumping,
copy styles and production techniques illegally and get round quotas by
illegal imports or by 'Europeanising' products through minimum value added
tax.
All these practices render French textiles uncompetitive. In the past four
years, imports from Thailand and other Asian countries have grown by 50 per
cent; more than half the textiles on the European market are now imported.
Worst, complains Robert, a system of unequal tariffs allows foreign textiles
cheap access to European markets but, effectively, bars European producers
from foreign markets.
'China is the great competitor of the future. It puts high tariffs on
imports and pays its workers next to nothing. Yet it exports cheaply to
Europe,' he says. 'It is unthinkable that we put Frenchmen out of work
because of this. We are all for a Gatt agreement provided it is adjusted so
the same rules apply to everyone. If it is not, we demand barriers that will
protect us.'
Suggest to Robert that, for all Roubaix's suffering, he is advocating
measures that hinder developments in a new global economy, and he will tell
you they are not developments the continent of Europe can survive. Suggest
that protectionism is out of favour and he counters with his own provocative
suggestion. 'Trade barriers may seem unfashionable,' he says, with a smile,
'but wait. It will not be long before they are back in fashion in Europe
once again.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: Prospects look rosiest for the rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it had not been for that damned apple, of course, the question need never
have bothered us. The only work in our lives - as Genesis 2:15 makes clear -
would have been a bit of light gardening. In the event, the work question
has bugged us ever since, albeit in different ways.
Right now, for instance, it is worrying political leaders in the opposite of
the form in which it threatened to unseat their English predecessors in the
Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The trouble then was too much work for a
plague-thinned labour force, whereas the contemporary version is not enough
to go round.
What makes it no less of a danger to today's politicians is that the problem
has shifted from peasants to floating voters higher up the social scale.
That is particularly so in Britain, where in the recession, managerial as
well as clerical classes lost their jobs.
Hence, if you happen to be job seeking, the outlook will depend much on
which kind of worker you are. The question of work prospects is never easy
to answer, but clues lie in the three basic types of worker identified by
the US psychologist Albert Bernstein: rebels, believers, and competitors:
Rebels are typically expert in some technical field, and often creatively
intelligent to boot. The drawback is that, while toiling unstintingly at
things they are interested in, they have little time for routine and still
less for 'people problems'. So they are apt to be a mixed blessing as
colleagues, and an absolute pain as managers.
The best managers - from the viewpoint of those working for them - are
believers. Besides being fair-minded, they spare no effort even at tasks
they dislike, fuelled by their faith that labour will bring its reward.
Alas, the same faith blinds them to all evidence to the contrary, which
means they rarely rise beyond middle management.
The types who tend to get to the top are competitors who believe in winning
personally. They swiftly learn how their organisation's system really
operates, as opposed to the way it is supposed to, and manipulate it in
their own self-interest. Even so, their political smartness makes them adept
at outwitting rival companies as well as colleagues, and at wringing good
deals out of customers.
If competitors are out of work, therefore, it is probably because they are
too smart for their own good, or in their last job they came up against a
cannier competitor. The good news is that there will always be a demand for
competitors' drive and fixing skills.
That inevitably means bad news for the other two types, and especially so
for believers. For one thing, the scrapping of whole ranks of middle
management means that instead of just losing out to competitors in the
promotion race, believers have far less chance of even entering it.
The irony for believers is that, although civilisation would crumble without
their sterling abilities, it is harder and harder to get paid for using
them. In Britain at least, believers' best hope is a revival of real
industry, where their qualities count much more than in service operations
such as investment banking, hairdressing and the like.
The best prospects would seem to be for rebels, provided their technical
skills and interests keep pace with the times. There will always be a demand
for their problem-solving on a self-employed basis.
The only trouble is that self-employment places a high premium on the
routine tasks and people-handling abilities for which rebels typically have
little time or talent. So for many, the way ahead could be stony. . .
.unless they are in the lucky position of this particular rebel, to whom the
question 'What is the future of work?' presents no difficulty. The answer is
34 days. Roll on retirement]

FT  01 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Is Europe just out of breath?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'From the economic point of view, we in the Federal Republic have always
moved forward up to now. Prosperity has risen from year to year. Now we are
in an economic crisis. Is this a turning point, or have we just reached a
standstill, a breathing space, after which we shall move forward again?'
That was a question in a poll of the state of German opinion. Once a month
the Germans are asked about everything by the Allensbach organisation. These
days they are unimpressed. But the real interest is that someone has asked
the question that underlies discussion about almost everything. Is this
moment a breathing space or a turning point? In Germany, 57 per cent replied
positively, saying the 'crisis' was just a pause. That it represented a
fundamental change was accepted by 27 per cent.
Have British readers noted the use of the word 'crisis'? It turns up on most
news pages in Germany and also in France, Italy and Spain. But I cannot
remember at any time in the past three bad years in Britain any reference to
'the crisis'. This is because the British have become used to a far lower
standard of economic performance than the Germans, Italians, French and many
others.
Imagine a British pollster asking respondents if they thought that current
difficulties represented merely a pause in the ever upward progress of the
British economy.
Anyway, the Germans believe, by a margin of more than 2:1, that they are not
at a turning point. That may be because the past two years have been flat,
dull and awful. The period began with the start of the Yugoslav catastrophe,
was punctuated by the arrival of Bill Clinton in the White House and ended
with the conclusion of the Gatt Round.
The contrast with the three years before 1992 is stunning. This fact alone
should reinforce the 'breathing space' theory, for the frenetic pace of
events of 1989-91 was unsustainable.
The apparent uneventfulness of the present by no means equates to
tranquility. The 'crisis' breeds angst and morosite. The Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung headlined the results of the Allensbach poll like this:
'In the downpour, the Germans pull in their horns.'
The French, once so anxious to cut a dash, now confess their timidity and
insularity. Le Monde wrote that both France and Germany are experiencing an
identity crisis. The article concluded with the words: 'Misunderstanding
between one country and another leads to mutual distancing and creates the
illusion that there exists a national capacity to master shared crises.'
Meanwhile, Italians speak of Italy as finished. Spain has found it possesses
no resources to confront the recession: once the industrial implants of the
last two or three decades rot away, there is nothing to replace them. To the
east, the morose Magyars and paranoid Poles cast a wary eye over the
benefits of liberalisation, which are more real than they believe, while the
Balkans return to Bismarck's nightmare characterisation - the place where
some damn fool can trigger a European war.
But this pervading gloom is not a global phenomenon; it is very European. It
is reflected in marked loss of European self-confidence, which historically
has occurred only in the face of American or Japanese achievement. But now
Europe is plagued with visions of what Le Figaro charmingly called Asiatic
ants. The new industrial nations of south-east Asia, so many believe, are
going to steal our jobs and dominate the world of work with sweatshop
industries. Countless lessons have been drawn from this belief, but always
the wrong ones.
They include the idea that, in order to compete, wage levels are what really
count, and that economic success is founded on sweatshop economics and no
rights for workers. So, say European leaders of opinion, outside Britain, if
that is the way to succeed we do not want to know about it.
But what they fail, churlishly, to recognise is that the successes of the
Far East have been gained through positive achievement rather than
systematic exploitation of specific cost advantages.
This achievement is based on simple ideas - such as not subsidising
loss-making state-owned juggernauts, and a preparedness to make policy
U-turns. This includes pulling out of heavy industries, as in Korea, or
reversing the thrust of social programmes, as in Malaysia.
The approach is not driven by capricious events but by recognising that
times change and different solutions are needed. Europe must ask whether
1994 will be the breathing space in which we run out of breath, or whether
European governments learn from those whom they seem to despise and fear.
I started with a question so I will finish with a question: in 1993, did you
read any interview with those in charge of the world's most successful
economies?

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: The Asian rivals to Euromen - Victor
Mallet finds women in modern factories pose a formidable threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European manufacturing workers may think their jobs are threatened by
millions of skinny, poorly-paid Asian men toiling in the sweatshops of the
East, but their real rivals are much more formidable: Asian women in modern
factories.
In the factories and electronics plants of Asia's cities, as in the
rice-fields of the Asian countryside, women do most of the manual labour.
Thailand's Alucon Manufacturing is no exception. It makes aluminium tubes
and aerosol cans for consumer products, including toothpaste, deodorant, K-Y
lubricating jelly, duplicating ink, glue and instant gaskets. Most of the
managers and technicians at Alucon's factory on the outskirts of Bangkok are
men, but most of the workers are women.
Aunreuan Punfak, 45, has been employed for 24 years by the company, where
she now inspects the final product before it leaves the plant. On the day of
my visit the factory had been making Colgate toothpaste tubes (by impact
extrusion) and painting them by machine for the Thai market.
Like many of her European counterparts, Aunreuan is entitled to 30 days'
sick leave a year. Has she ever been off sick? 'Never,' she replies.
Hartmut Schneider, chairman and managing director of the company, is a firm
believer in the value of female employees. 'Women in Thailand are much
better than men,' he declares. 'They are much more 'with' the job, they are
more loyal, they are more interested in keeping the job. They think about
what they are doing. They are interested in producing something beautiful.
We have many employees, especially women, who have not been sick a single
day in five years.'
Some of the cliches about Asian workers are true: they are hardworking
(doing up to 130 hours overtime a month); they are loyal; and they earn less
than their western competitors. The legal minimum daily wage in the Bangkok
area is 125 baht (Pounds 3.30), and the German-born Schneider reckons the
850-strong workforce at his two plants account for about 22 per cent of
total costs, compared with as much as 60 per cent in some European
factories.
But there is much more than cheap labour to the success of companies such as
Alucon. Although Alucon took advantage of a shortage of capacity in the west
and exports some of its products to Europe and the US, its main markets are
in the booming economies of China and south-east Asia.
'A lot of the industries that use our containers have relocated to this part
of the world and it's logical that they are looking for local suppliers,'
says Schneider. 'You have a huge increase in demand for consumer products.'
Alucon is meeting this demand for quality consumer goods not - as jealous
European workers might believe - by employing more cheap labour, but by
mechanising plants as it expands. That is one reason why capital
depreciation is Alucon's main expense.
Thai workers are five times as expensive as those in China, Vietnam and
Indonesia, and complex machines are needed to produce the quality and
consistency required by customers such as Colgate.
Alucon's factory near Bangkok is no sweatshop. Most of the workers are at
one end of a machine, loading it, or at the other, packing the finished
product into boxes.
As Asian workers become wealthier and their industries become more
mechanised, their hopes and concerns begin to sound more and more like those
of western counterparts. Thailand, just like European countries before it,
stands to lose hundreds of thousands of manual jobs in the textile industry
to mechanisation and to competition from lower-paid workers elsewhere in
Asia.
Workers at the Alucon plant, often migrants from farming districts in the
north-east, say they like the job security and benefits of working for a
large but friendly company. They worry about traffic jams and paying the
rent.
Benjawan Prayadsap, aged 19, moved to the factory five months ago to find
regular work after an unsteady job in a cake shop. Wearing jeans and a
casual shirt, she is putting rubber seals on to plastic caps with her
fingers. 'There's nothing in my dreams,' she says on being questioned about
her ambitions. 'I just want to work and save money for the future.'
Some of the women workers have started to listen to music through the
headphones of their personal stereo machines, prompting Schneider to worry
that the practice may distract them and affect their work.
Engineers and skilled workers, in short supply in Thailand, are already
almost as expensive as their European equivalents. 'They are getting spoilt
in a similar fashion to workers in Europe, where people try to work as
little as possible and get as much money as possible,' says Schneider.
Attitudes to leisure in Asia and the west are converging, too. 'I think
American-style,' says a cheerful Choompol Veeranuvatana, assistant general
manager. 'Work is work and relaxing is relaxing.'
Perhaps it is time to discard the myth of the nauseatingly diligent Asian
worker. Asked what he liked to do in his spare time, Choompol replied: 'I
like to go out with my friends and get drunk.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Big science seeks Wimp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress towards answering the biggest questions in science - about the
origins and future of the universe - depends ultimately on a partnership
between scientists working on unimaginably different scales of time and
distance. Astronomers and cosmologists are observing and trying to
understand events that occurred billions of years ago and billions of light
years away; at the other extreme, particle physicists are investigating
collisions lasting billionths of a second on a scale of billionths of a
millimetre.
But the two types of scientist enter 1994 in very different moods.
Cosmologists are in a frenzy of excitement, fed by observations from space
and from ground-based instruments, as they weave new theories about the
cosmic boom that brought the universe into existence 15bn years ago. Their
sense of anticipation is heightened by last month's repair of the Hubble
telescope, which will enable astronomers to see further into space.
Particle physicists, in contrast, are mourning a terrestrial bust. Pressure
from congressional budget cutters forced the US to cancel what would have
been their most powerful instrument - the Dollars 10bn Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC) - after spending Dollars 2bn digging the first section of its
85 km tunnel beneath the plains of Texas.
October's SSC cancellation not only deprives physicists of a means of
smashing together elementary particles at energies high enough to mimic, on
a microscopic scale, conditions soon after the Big Bang. It also shows that
they can no longer count on the US, the world's chief paymaster for big
science projects for the past two generations, to fund ever more expensive
machines to delve deeper and deeper into the nature of matter.
Instead they have to rely on Europe's more cautious governments - and in
particular on Cern, the 19-nation particle physics laboratory outside
Geneva. This year Cern members must decide whether to pick up the baton and
build a new accelerator.
Cern's proposed Large Hadron Collider is relatively cheap, with an estimated
price not much above Pounds 1bn. That is partly because LHC would be smaller
than SSC but mainly because it does not need a new tunnel; it can share the
27 km loop housing Cern's current accelerator, LEP. Whereas LEP smashes
together light electrons and positrons LHC will collide protons - relatively
heavy particles - at virtually the speed of light.
Christopher Llewellyn Smith, the Oxford physicist who takes over as Cern
director-general today, estimates that LHC would cost Pounds 4bn to build
from scratch. Most observers believe that European science ministers will
agree to fund LHC at the bargain price, though construction may be delayed
by attempts to negotiate some US participation.
LHC collisions will release more energy - within an extremely confined space
 -than any previous events on earth. Some of this should manifest itself in
the form of subatomic particles last generated in the first moments of the
universe. Most eagerly anticipated is the 'Higgs boson', the particle
believed to give all matter its mass.
While particle physicists try to recreate conditions of the Big Bang on
earth, astronomers and cosmologists look for direct evidence of its
aftermath in the skies. Fortunately they have a much wider choice of
instruments and greater diversity of data. No single event, even the loss of
the Hubble space telescope, could have such a devastating effect on
astronomy as the SSC cancellation did on particle physics.
Take, for example, the momentous announcement in April 1992 that the US
Cosmic Background Explorer satellite had detected 'cosmic ripples' of
microwave radiation from the young universe - the first signs of the
unevenness which gravity later pulled into clusters of galaxies and stars.
Since then the observation has been confirmed and extended by several other
instruments, operating from the ground and from high-altitude balloons as
well as from space. If Cobe had failed, the ripples would still have been
discovered.
Besides consolidating the position of the Big Bang in cosmology the ripples
have helped to support some specific theories about the development and
structure of the universe. They fit well with the 'inflationary' model,
which postulates a super-expansionary burst immediately after the Big Bang;
random fluctuations during this period, lasting less than one billion
billion billionth of a second, sowed the seeds of unevenness.
The observations are also consistent with a universe precisely balanced
between being 'closed' and 'open'. If so, it would contain exactly the right
amount of matter for gravity to stop the universe expanding, after an
infinite period of time, but not enough to pull everything back together
again eventually in a Big Crunch.
Such a universe, with a 'critical density of one', appeals strongly to
cosmologists' yearning for mathematical neatness. One practical consequence
is that the universe must contain a vast amount of 'missing mass' - 10 to
100 times more than all the visible objects (galaxies, stars, dust clouds,
quasars and so on) observed so far.
Perhaps the greatest astronomical priority for 1994 will be to investigate
the nature of this 'dark matter'. Candidates include: ordinary matter in the
form of planet-sized Massive Compact Halo Objects; billions of small black
holes; slow-moving and virtually undetectable Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles; and neutrinos moving at virtually the speed of light. The smart
cosmological money is backing a combination of Machos and Wimps.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Roll out the barrel for a UK lottery: But the real battles
are yet to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late this year, or early next, Britain's national lottery will start
producing millionaire winners, plus geysers of cash for numerous good
causes. Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, says the lottery's
impact on Britain's quality of life will be considerable, and that it may
turn into the world's most successful tombola.
So it flipping well should, for Britain is staggering into the big-time
lottery business very late in the day. Not since 1826 has Britain had a
national lottery.
In the meantime, large-scale lotteries have sprung up everywhere, bestowing
sudden and shocking wealth on thousands of players while raising billions in
revenue for state and national governments. In the European Union alone,
gambling is reckoned to be a Dollars 40bn-plus business, and new
technologies are pushing the frontiers of gambling beyond national borders.
Britain's laggardly progress on the lottery front was due to opposition by
the football pools promoters, whose lucrative business - based on
forecasting the results of football matches - is a form of long-odds
gambling closely akin to lotteries.
But the case for a UK national lottery distinct from the football pools was
always a strong one. And the likelihood is that Britain's overdue debut on
the big-time Lotto stage will influence the evolution of international
gambling - producing, next century, mega-lotteries for planetary good
causes.
Britain's national lottery will be job-positive, creating work in the
construction, computer and other industries. And costs as a percentage of
stakes ought to be excessively slim.
Peter Davis, the lottery's director-general, is required by law to drive the
hardest possible bargain with the operator. It is his job to ensure that the
greatest sum possible is delivered to the recipients - charities, the arts,
sport, national heritage and the Millennium Fund to celebrate the year 2000.
Moreover, the UK lottery is likely to be mounted and marketed with
state-of-the-art skills. Its launch advertising budget will be one of the
fattest plums in UK advertising history. And, with a wealth of foreign
lottery experience to draw upon, there will be no excuse if Britain's Lotto
isn't the most secure and technically advanced operation of its kind.
All's well that ends well? Not on your life.
The lottery has already generated great quantities of snooty
chitter-chatter, and will generate far more. Some stick-in-the-muds are
offended that Britain should descend to anything as 'tacky' as a lottery to
fund good causes.
Kill-joys worry about the social consequences - will it spawn addicts
casting money they cannot afford into Lotto's chomping jaws? Some even fret
that a big-scale lottery is unfair on the poor, maintaining that the least
well-off will be subsidising the cultural pursuits of a prosperous elite.
This accusation is particularly woolly-minded.
The government says it believes that proceeds of the lottery 'will benefit
everyone with an interest in sport, the arts, our heritage, or who benefits
from charitable activities.' And it ought to be obvious, even to economists,
that if the 'poor' buy most of the tickets, the 'poor' will win most of the
prizemoney.
The wrangles to come will be more significant. There could well be
controversy over the selection of operator, due by the spring.
Bids for the seven-year licence must be submitted by February 14. Various
blue-chip consortia are readying to bid, and the battle will be intense.
But the commercial consortia jostling for the franchise face particularly
tricky rivals in Richard Branson, boss of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Lord
Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, who have formed the UK Lottery
Foundation.
If the foundation won the franchise, it would hand all its profits to
charity. Young and Branson are likely to face at least seven rivals. If one
of them scoops the franchise with a less than wholly convincing bid, there
could be uproar.
Branson has claimed that the public would spend an extra Pounds 1 or Pounds
2 on the lottery per week if they knew that all profits were ear-marked for
charity - though he cannot know that.
On the other hand, in a letter to the FT eight days ago, Branson wrote: '(A
lottery company) is not a particularly entrepreneurial venture. Therefore,
the question that needs to be asked is: is it really necessary to add an
extra layer of shareholders, over the managers, who can sit back and cream
off hundreds of millions of pounds of profit that could otherwise be going
to good causes?'
Forecasts of the lottery's annual turnover range from about Pounds 2bn to a
fanciful Pounds 6bn, with Pounds 3.5bn-Pounds 4bn the most likely once it is
into its stride. Half the money will be given out in prizes while the
government - greedily - has stated that it will confiscate 12 per cent of
turnover in lottery tax, rather than allocate the maximum sum possible to
good causes. The operator's expenses and profits will account for about 13
per cent of turnover, leaving about 25 per cent for spending on good causes.
The biggest disputes are likely to erupt as soon as the lottery is working
and decisions fall due on allocating the proceeds. Think of the non-stop
rubbishing that the present-day Arts Council attracts - then multiply by
five.
For example, a National Lotteries Charities Board will be established to
distribute lottery funds to charities, and the Queen is appointing a
Millennium Commission to oversee projects marking the turn of the century.
The lobbying and the foaming at the mouth likely to break out once those two
bodies knuckle down to business may well swamp customary controversies in
sporting, arty and heritage circles.
In the end, though, Britain's national lottery will prove exciting and
successful, spreading cheer to places where cheer was long thought extinct.
In turn, the evolution of gambling seems likely to gain pace as the
communications revolution unfolds. Eventually, trans-national and global
lotteries seem inevitable - planetary tombolas to save the elephant, fight
famine, counteract tyranny or buy Italy.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Lloyd's plans a future with no Names: The aftermath of the
losses suffered by syndicate members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My feeling is let them all rot in Hell. I could not have been worse treated
by Lloyd's,' says Hugh Taylor, bruised and embittered by his experience as a
Name in the London insurance market.
He is one of many Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally backed
the market - who have been financially crippled by heavy underwriting losses
at Lloyd's since the mid-1980s.
Taylor, like 21,000 others, must choose over the next month between
accepting Lloyd's offer of modest compensation for his losses or pursuing
long and uncertain legal action against his agents.
The omens are not good for Lloyd's. 'It doesn't seem very brilliant,' says
Taylor. 'It is most unlikely I will accept. I consider I've been dealt with
dishonestly and dishonourably and I am entitled to an apology and some
compensation for the stress I have suffered.' His losses from Gooda Walker
syndicates already amount to about Pounds 440,000.
The failure of the settlement would mean that more than 30 legal actions
involving 17,000 Names will continue. That - and the prospect later this
year of another Pounds 1bn loss when 1991's results are reported - is bound
to revive speculation about the future of the insurance market.
In spite of these gloomy signs, though, there is a surprising air of
optimism at Lloyd's. Underwriters say that trading conditions are among the
best they have seen, following increases in rates of up to 400 per cent.
Impressed by a turnround in the quality of management at Lloyd's and
attracted by the promise of bumper profits in 1994, city institutions have
invested more than Pounds 850m in a dozen new Lloyd's investment trusts in
the past three months. Against expectations, Lloyd's capacity  - which
reflects the strength of the market's capital base - will rise to about
Pounds 10bn this year, the first time it has risen since 1990.
Although 13,000 Names like Hugh Taylor have been forced out of the market
since the late 1980s, among the 19,000 who remain the appetite for
comfortable profits is overcoming concern about potential loss.
As fear recedes, hundreds of Names are increasing their commitments. 'A
quiet confidence is returning to the counties - good heavens yes, oh yes,
yes, yes,' says Robert Wharton, a Bristol-based solicitor, who organises the
Avon and Gloucestershire region of the Association of Lloyd's Members.
Wharton says that the number of Names in the county has fallen but that
those who remain intend to increase their investment this year. The Wharton
family itself - Wharton's wife, Fiona, is the Name - has decided to raise
its investment, increasing the 'line' (amount traded) by about Pounds
100,000 in 1994.
Even though several of the Whartons' friends have lost heavily at Lloyd's in
the past two to three years, little can damp Wharton's optimism.
'There is a tremendous disparity between the popular image and what is
actually going on,' says one Name, who intends to increase his commitment
from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m this year.
Robert Saunders, 34, who advises Names on their Lloyd's affairs for Smith &amp;
Williamson, is equally bullish. 'I've been scraping together anything I can
 -shares, tax recoveries - to increase my deposit at Lloyd's,' says
Saunders, who wants to increase his 'line' from Pounds 475,000 to Pounds
565,000 this year. Indeed, some Names who had earlier resigned from Lloyd's
have decided to rejoin the market.
'I'd just lost confidence in it. I couldn't see them getting out of
trouble,' says Daphne Thomson, who lives in the London suburb of Southgate
and resigned in 1992, only to rejoin a year later. News of the formation of
new Lloyd's investment trusts was an important factor in her decision. 'It
gives you a reasonable feeling that the people who know the City are not
allergic to Lloyd's'
Philip Gwyn, who founded and now chairs the Christie Group, a hotel and
valuation business, also reversed an earlier decision to resign, rejoining
for 1993 after a four-year absence. A change in the quality of management
and clear signs of a turn in the insurance cycle were two of the reasons.
Recent losses and litigation should reinforce these trends. While losses and
scandal have reduced the social cachet of Lloyd's membership, Names
themselves have been forced to take a much more businesslike view of their
participation at the market.
'It will be a cold blooded decision taken each year after proper
consideration,' says Gwyn. Thomson says the days when Lloyd's membership
passed down through families - generation by generation - have gone.
'You don't automatically assume you will always be a Name at Lloyd's any
more,' adds Thomson.
The influx of corporate investment has lead some senior figures at Lloyd's
to speculate publicly about the future of unlimited liability.
Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman of Lloyd's, wants most names to become
shareholders in new Lloyd's insurance companies. He says that the market
should not have two classes of shareholder and ought to consider whether new
unlimited liability Names should be allowed to join the market at all.
'We have got to go towards limited liability. The question is how do we do
it.' Unlimited liability 'causes too much grief', says Hiscox. 'Every 30
years or so we have blown Names out of the water. I just don't want anybody
in future to have to sell their homes to meet losses.'
Ultimately Names will die out anyway. This year only about 50 will undergo
the ritual of the 'rota', where new Names are told that all their personal
possessions are on the line to meet insurance losses. The average age of
Lloyd's Names is now 58.
As David James, a Name and leading businessman, said recently: 'There is not
going to be a new flood of Names. Anno Domini and our losses mean that we
are an eroding asset.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Long View: The big dash from cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remarkably powerful bullish forces have been gripping the London stock
market during the past few weeks, climaxing in Wednesday's 50-point
post-Christmas Footsie surge. It looks as though the coming year will see
share prices sliding back after attaining a formidable peak; but although we
are in dangerous territory the power of cash flows will not dissipate
quickly.
From the middle of last year the UK securities markets became strongly
affected by investment flows from overseas, notably from the US where
pension funds and mutual funds have been energetically diversifying around
the globe. The recent renewed upsurge, however, has primarily domestic
origins as the remorseless declines of inflation and short-term interest
rates have generated panic buying of longer-term securities.
The cash flow transformation was highlighted by the institutional investment
statistics that came out last week.
They suggested that UK institutional cash flows will have exceeded Pounds
50bn for 1993. In 1994 the total might easily be Pounds 60bn or more.
Twelve months ago, institutional inflows did not appear likely to exceed
about Pounds 35bn in 1993. But net issues of gilts were set to be well over
Pounds 40bn and domestic equity issues by companies (including
privatisations) also looked likely to have a bumper year (in the event, some
Pounds 15bn net has been raised). The sums did not add up unless improbably
large amounts were contributed from abroad and by personal investors.
Well, improbably or not, the money arrived on a more than adequate scale.
And now the prospective balance has been completely altered. In 1994 the
government is expecting to borrow less than Pounds 30bn through net gilt
sales, while corporate equity issues are, if anything, likely to be smaller
in total than in 1993. Therefore a big surplus of cash will be seeking a
longer-term home, a prospect that has sent long gilt yields tumbling well
below 6 1/2 per cent this week.
The desperate dash from cash is creating a financial asset price bubble in
the UK, as future streams of income are radically repriced. A consequence is
likely to be an increasingly rapid spillage of investment money overseas;
moreover, foreigners will be taking profits and seeking less overvalued
markets. In order to generate these outflows we should expect UK bond yields
to go lower than US and most Continental European bond yields (while
sterling will become weak).
The UK is in the process of a normalisation of its savings markets after two
decades of high inflation, high nominal interest rates and a distorted yield
curve. In those conditions there was a concentration of wealth in equities,
owner-occupied residential houses and short-term savings deposits, and an
aversion from long-term fixed interest contracts. But in conditions of low
inflation and a yield curve which may soon be running from 4 1/2 to 6 per
cent the existing asset mix has become inappropriate.
The danger is that although individual savers will see clearly enough that
savings deposits are unattractive they will be drawn out of habit into
equities (and, soon, residential property) rather than bonds which are still
not a familiar or trusted form of investment for British savers.
At a guess Pounds 50bn, maybe more, has to come out of short-term savings
accounts over the next two or three years. Theoretically this could be
achieved by refinancing a large chunk of the mortgage industry through the
securities market. But unless savers can be persuaded to buy building
society bonds there could be a crisis: equity valuations will be pushed to
freakish levels while house buyers will continue to pay unduly high loan
rates.
Already the dividend yield on UK equities has been pushed down to 3.3 per
cent, not far from the 3 per cent level which several times in the past
(most recently in summer 1987) has marked danger point. At least, in 1987,
dividends were rising fast. It is curious that over the past three years the
All-Share Index has soared by 64 per cent while dividends in aggregate have
risen not at all.
Company profits are rising steadily, but in several recent cases they have
disappointed expectations. In 1994 the British economy will have to tread a
tightrope if it is not to upset investors - expanding rapidly enough to
generate adequate profits growth but not so fast as to cause the government
to panic about renewed inflation and raise interest rates again in a way
that would burst the bubble. Still, this is how it seemed in the US a year
ago, and the American economy - to Wall Street's relief - somehow managed to
stay on the wire.
Yet Britain's economic prospects are opaque, largely because of the dubious
quality of the statistics. According to the latest figures, third quarter
growth in GDP year-on-year was 2.1 per cent but 1992's GDP has been revised
upwards, so that growth is 2.8 per cent on the basis of what was initially
reported for 1992. Moreover the Treasury claims that underlying trend growth
is 3 per cent; if you believe this, then because unemployment is falling
actual growth must surely be higher than that - say, 3 1/2 per cent. On a
more pessimistic basis you can argue that if the stated 2 per cent growth is
pushing down unemployment the underlying growth of capacity cannot be more
than about 1 1/2 per cent in which case the Treasury's projections for
higher tax revenues and lower Budget deficits over the next few years will
be blown spectacularly apart. Of course, the unemployment figures could be
completely misleading anyway . . .
What we do know about 1994 is that a great deal of money will be on the move
and that much of it will be invested at the wrong price. We are in the late,
panic buying, stage of the equity bull market which is likely to peak during
the coming year. For the time being it may be painful to be out of the
market, but UK equities are now only for the brave and nimble.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Has the West triumphed at last?: Edward Mortimer looks at
some rival visions of what the 21st century will be like
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Perhaps we should call it Year Five: the fifth year of the new era which
began on November 9, 1989.
Of course, new eras do not really begin as tidily as that. Even if the
Berlin wall had not been opened so unexpectedly on that particular night,
there would still have been a new era. But 1989 has been generally accepted
as Year Zero, and it is long enough ago now for us to be sure. We really do
live in a new world order.
But does this suggest a different kind of era from those which went before:
one of peace, prosperity and the triumph of western liberal values, or will
it bring just a different kind of struggle?
The phrase 'new world order' became discredited after President George Bush
gave it too ambitious and positive a content during the build-up to the Gulf
war, in September 1990, as though a new world order must, by definition, be
orderly. It soon became fashionable to joke of the 'new world disorder.'
But all previous world orders have been more or less disorderly. Even the
one we have just left behind - the cold war - was less orderly than it is
now portrayed. The two superpowers stayed at peace with each other (just),
and imposed peace on what would have been their main battlefield, namely
Europe. But millions perished in wars elsewhere - some of them waged or
sponsored by the superpowers.
Previous world orders have usually dissolved in war. War was the scale on
which a new balance of power could be established, as declining empires were
weighed against rising ones, and found wanting. But the cold war suddenly
vanished without a shot being fired. Well, almost. Soviet communism simply
rolled over and died.
That did suggest that the new world order might really be different from
previous ones. One superpower, the United States, and one ideology, liberal
capitalism, were left in sole possession of the field. Even before the
Berlin wall fell, Francis Fukuyama, the US academic, had identified this
change as 'the end of history'. He did not mean there would be no more
conflict, but that serious argument about the basic principles on which
society should be organised had come to an end. The superior virtue of
political and economic freedom had, he believed, been finally demonstrated.
That sounded like a piece of outrageous arrogance, especially from someone
who was, when his article appeared, employed by the US state department
(although he wrote it before). He has been ridiculed for it ever since, but
was he, perhaps, right? His conclusion would hardly have caused so much
debate if it had been self-evidently wrong.
Like his former boss, US president George Bush, but perhaps with less
justice, Fukuyama has taken the rap for the failure of the new world order
to live up to the Bush prospectus. Bush promised 'an era in which the
nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live
in harmony . . . a world where the rule of law supplants the law of the
jungle . . . a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak'. That
does not sound like the world of Slobodan Milosevic, Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
or Mohammed Farah Aideed.
But such unsavoury characters and their policies have little to do with
Fukuyama's thesis. However much conflict and suffering they cause, they do
not offer the world any alternative model of civilisation. They present no
serious challenge to the western prescription for all societies in search of
modernity: take one tablespoonful each of free trade and private investment,
plus a dram each of property rights and the rule of law; wash down with a
swig of multi-party democracy and swallow.
An interesting variant on the Fukuyama thesis appeared last September in a
book* by Max Singer and the late Aaron Wildavsky. They divided the world
into 'zones of peace' - stable, rich democracies - and 'zones of turmoil'
(everyone else): a distinction reminiscent of the traditional Moslem one
between the House of Islam and the House of War, although in this case the
entire Islamic world, with the possible exception of Turkey, finds itself
consigned to the zones of turmoil.
They believe that for 85 per cent of the world's population, living in the
zones of turmoil, life will continue much as the philosopher Hobbes
described it in the state of nature: 'Poor, nasty, brutish and short'. But
the prospects of the other 15 per cent, in the zones of peace, are more
secure than ever before. All the most powerful states are now democratic.
They will continue to be so, and will not threaten each other with war.
Russia will probably not be democratic for very long, but it will not be
very powerful either. The main element in Soviet power was the 'ability to
use communist ideology and a massive system of political agents, allies,
supporters, and sympathisers in programs of deceit and political warfare';
and that, argue Singer and Wildavsky, has gone beyond recall.
They admit that a country or group in a zone of turmoil might threaten a
major city in a zone of peace with clandestine weapons of mass destruction
('suitcase bombs'). But even if such threats or attacks happen, 'they would
not alter the nature of the international system'.
Such a glib dismissal of uncomfortable thoughts does not necessarily
undermine Singer and Wildavsky's argument, which is that we are witnessing a
'gradual change in the technical basis of power, the continuing triumph of
quality over quantity, of brain power over muscle power, of mind and
imagination over physical resources, of the uncontrolled order of freedom
over the rigid order of central control and planning'. Thus to retain power,
states are almost obliged to be democratic, and democratic states are very
unlikely to fight each other.
But do modern states really have to incorporate western democratic values? A
formidable challenge to such ideas appeared last summer in an article by
Samuel Huntington, doyen of US political scientists, in the magazine Foreign
Affairs, entitled 'The Clash of Civilisations?'. He thinks there will be
'non-western modern civilisations,' which the west will 'increasingly have
to accommodate', because their power will approach its own, yet their
'values and interests' will differ significantly.
Huntington agrees with Singer and Wildavsky that 'military conflict among
western states is unthinkable, and western military power is unrivalled'. He
admits that 'to date only Japan has fully succeeded' in becoming modern
without becoming western. He qualifies even that assertion by saying that
'Japan has established a unique position for itself as an associate member
of the west'. But he insists there will be major conflicts in future,
whether or not they take the form of world wars, and that the main lines of
conflict will be drawn between 'civilisations'. He even suggests the
'Islamic' and 'Confucian' civilisations may get together to mount a
concerted military challenge to the west.
In response to Huntington's article, pundits ranging from Robert Bartley, of
the Wall Street Journal, to Liu Binyan, a leading Chinese dissident,
reaffirmed their confidence in the universal validity of the western liberal
model. More interesting was the response of a former Singaporean permanent
representative at the UN, Kishore Mahbubani, from whom Huntington had
borrowed the formula 'the west versus the rest'. Mahbubani endorsed
Huntington's thesis but went further. The west's power was declining, he
warned, its civilisation decadent - and its arrogance calculated to provoke
the anger of other civilisations that are on their way up.
Undoubtedly it is from Asia that the most serious challenge to western
leadership is coming, in ideas as in commerce - and Singapore seems to have
cast itself as Asia's ideological champion. Chan Heng Chee, another former
Singaporean ambassador, argues** that 'democracy is but one virtue in the
basket of virtues to be weighed', and complains of 'a new found mission in
the west to use the imposed category as an international merit test, with
democracy hardliners putting on the pressure for change world wide to adopt
the democratic model or more precisely, the liberal democratic model'.
Developing economies, she says, may benefit from a 'postponement' of
democracy, and when it eventually arrives, Asian democracy must be expected
to look different from the western type: it will be less permissive, more
authoritarian, stressing the common good rather than individual rights,
often with a single dominant party and nearly always a centralised
bureaucracy and 'strong state'.
This was the essence of the position put forward by most Asian governments
at last June's UN human rights conference in Vienna. It is hotly contested
by various non-governmental Asian voices, such as that of Christine Loh, a
member of Hong Kong's legislative council (LegCo) who attended the Vienna
conference on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists. 'The
existence of indigenous Asian human-rights movements,' she says, 'refutes
the claim that such rights are a western concept.'
Governments in the region would reply that the movements in question are not
really indigenous, but by-products of western colonialism. Is this special
pleading by authoritarian governments on the defensive, or the authentic
voice of a rising civilisation that aims to compete with the west?
Perhaps a bit of both. Part of the argument is essentially pragmatic. People
like Chan Heng Chee are not disputing that the basic mix of democracy and
capitalism is good for Asia in the long run. They are saying (a) that not
all democracies have to be exactly alike (which is self-evident) and (b)
that few if any societies can take the whole western prescription at one
gulp.
The current economic success of China, where capitalism has been embraced
with enthusiasm but democracy has been 'postponed' sine die, so to speak,
may seem a telling point in their favour when compared to the chaos now
afflicting Russia, which is trying to swallow both democracy and capitalism
at once. But perhaps one should watch both Russia and China a few years
longer before making a final judgment. And meanwhile, what about India,
where democracy has been practised after a fashion for nearly half a
century, and capitalism is now going from strength to strength? Certainly
the brief interruption of democracy in the mid 1970s did little to advance
India's economic development. This argument will run and run.
Even if Fukuyama, Singer and Wildavsky turn out to be right, and western
civilisation is the universal model of modernity, that does not mean the
present western countries will come out on top. Japan and other Asian
countries may achieve more with western ideas and institutions than the old
west can.
Huntington is clearly on to something when he says that the sense of
belonging to a particular civilisation or culture is getting more important
in determining how people line up against each other in a given conflict.
That factor was not absent in the past, but it was partially eclipsed by
ideological conflicts which now seem to have burnt out. To that extent
Huntington is confirming Fukuyama's thesis, not contesting it: no longer
disagreeing about the Big Idea, people have only their group interests left
to fight for, and you cannot define group interests without first defining
the group.
For although states are still very important, in most parts of the world
they no longer provide their inhabitants with an all-sufficient sense of
identity. You define yourself as belonging to a race, religion or culture,
and then try to get the state you live in to reflect that identity and the
values that go with it. If the state you live in cannot or will not do that,
because it is controlled by another group with a different identity from
yours, you are likely to transfer your allegiance to another state, or even
try to set up a new one. This is one of the most potent sources of conflict
in the world today.
But will it translate into a global 'clash of civilisations'? I find that
much harder to imagine, and if it happens I feel reasonably confident, along
with Singer and Wildavsky, that something more like modern western
civilisation than any other will stay on top. But then I would say that,
wouldn't I?

FT  01 JAN 94 / US cable operator enters UK: Tele-Communications takes
Pounds 200m stake in Flextech media group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television operator, is to create
a 'second force' in the UK cable and satellite market by merging its
European channels with Flextech, a British former oil services company that
has turned itself into a media group.
The deal announced yesterday will make the enlarged company the biggest
cable and satellite channel operator in the UK after British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a significant stake.
Tele-Communications (TCI) is taking a 60.4 per cent stake, valued at more
than Pounds 200m, in Flextech. Flextech will acquire all the European
programme assets of United Artists European Holdings, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TCI. Both companies at present hold stakes in BSkyB channels
and other cable channels.
The enlarged Flextech will hold a stake in five of the 12 satellite channels
that make up the basic multi-channel subscription package on BSkyB: Bravo, a
classic movies channel, The Children's Channel, The Family Channel, UK Gold
and UK Living.
A UAEH subsidiary also manages four other channels: Discovery, the factual
channel that is part of the BSkyB package, and cable channels The
Parliamentary Channel, The Learning Channel and Wire TV, an entertainment
channel.
Although most of the satellite channels are currently loss-making, the deal
is underpinned by 10-year contracts with BSkyB, signed in September. Each
channel in the subscription package receives 15p per subscriber per month.
BSkyB said last month that 3.1m homes took at least one of its subscription
services.
When the merger talks were first revealed in October, Flextech shares jumped
49p to 224p. Its shares are currently suspended at 379p.
The agreement will give TCI - at present in merger talks with Bell Atlantic,
the US telephone company - a European vehicle for future expansion.
Flextech also announced yesterday it was increasing to 86.7 per cent its
stake in IVS, a UK cable company with franchises in Oxford, Stafford,
Andover, Salisbury and Jersey.

<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain dismissed the board of Banco Espanol de Credito less than
a day after receiving a letter from its corporate finance adviser, the US
bank JP Morgan, expressing confidence in Banesto's president, Mr Mario
Conde.
A Bank of Spain executive yesterday confirmed that the central bank had
received a letter on Monday night, supporting Banesto's management and
saying a Dollars 400m (Pounds 271m) convertible bond issue which had been
stalled could take place in the new year if market conditions permitted.
The letter to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, was signed by Mr
Roberto Mendoza, the Morgan vice-chairman who was among Banesto's corporate
finance advisers. Mr Mendoza also sat on the board of Banesto, dismissed on
Tuesday by the Bank of Spain.
The letter hints at strong differences of opinion between Morgan and the
central bank over the state of Banesto's finances. Mr Rojo accused Banesto
before a parliamentary committee on Thursday of inadequate management
controls.
Mr Rojo referred to 'deficiencies of information, organisation and control'
at Banesto which had led the bank to expand its loan book too rapidly
between 1988 and 1991. This contributed, he said, to a Pta500bn (Pounds
2.4bn) overvaluation of the bank's Dollars 61bn (Pounds 41.2bn) assets.

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury seems finally to be warming to the transport sector. After its
consent to the extension of Eurotunnel's franchise, it has now reduced the
return requirements on Railtrack for the early years of rail privatisation.
In its first year, Railtrack, which is to operate the track and signalling
under the new arrangements, will only have to generate enough revenues to
earn a 5 per cent return on capital. This is welcome evidence of a more
pragmatic approach - but the target will rise in stages to 8 per cent and
the Treasury has still not given much away.
Railtrack has lost the other part of the argument - that its track should be
valued at less than its replacement cost of around Pounds 7bn. A lower
valuation would have reduced the amount Railtrack needed to earn to hit its
return target and hence its charges to the private operators, who will
actually run the trains. The government must hope its modest concession on
return targets will stimulate flagging interest among bidders for such
operating franchises. Yet the attraction of low initial charges to train
operators is limited. They will also need a franchise long enough to allow
for the depreciation of rolling stock. Railtrack could help by meeting the
escalation in its profits target entirely through cutting costs, rather than
by raising charges to franchisees.

There was undoubtedly a lot of froth behind the FT-SE 100's 50 point rise on
Wednesday - as is shown by its virtual evaporation in the subsequent two
trading days of a holiday-shortened week. That lends weight to the view that
the market's run-up in the closing weeks of the year was fuelled by stock
shortages and squeezes related to the expiry of futures contracts and
options. If so, one must be wary of expecting too much by way of a new year
rally. The market may have derived some satisfaction from the still
anecdotal evidence of a reasonably strong Christmas in the shops. Then
again, the better the economic news, the less reason to expect an interest
rate cut early this year, something which the market has hitherto been
assuming.
Indeed, the government's natural temptation may be to defer any rate cut
until its tax increases start to bite in the spring. The chance that rate
cuts in Europe followed by a rise in sterling might force the government's
hand must still be regarded as an outside one while the recovery remains on
track. So is the possibility that the authorities may decide to smooth
inflation by allowing a rate cut before annual mortgage rate reviews at the
end of this month.
Uncertainty over timing may cause the equity market to pause for breath, but
it should not undermine the basically positive trend. While rate cuts are on
the agenda over the next few months, the flow of retail funds into the
equity market should continue - and the new highs reached by Hong Kong are a
reminder that international liquidity flows remain as strong as ever.
Wednesday's record FT-SE close of 3,462 may not hold for long.

FT  01 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Ruling power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, is due to decide
the future of the two generating companies by the middle of this month. He
has threatened to send them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if they
do not agree to curbs on their power to move electricity prices. Since the
issues are complex and the companies have yet to agree to anything at all,
time is short. Professor Littlechild may have to choose between carrying out
his threat, imposing a solution or backing down.
The companies may be forced to reduce their market share by selling plant,
so encouraging other competitors, or to accept price limits in the spot
electricity 'pool'. Yet price controls run counter both to government policy
and the regulator's instincts, while small-scale plant sales may be
insufficient to introduce effective competition. Almost all the marginal
plant, which only operates part time and sets the price, is owned by
National Power or PowerGen. If they were to sell it, the new owner would be
tempted to run it full time to earn cash and thereby push some of the
generators' more efficient plants into the marginal category, leaving the
duopoly continuing to set the price.
National Power and PowerGen may also not be prepared to sell power stations
at the low price a part-time plant would command if they suspected that they
would subsequently be run full time. Professor Littlechild is unlikely to be
able to agree anything but the weakest bromide on plant disposals in time.
Voluntary price controls are more feasible, though they would have to be
presented as a temporary restraint imposed while a fully competitive market
bedded in. The stock market is assuming that this is the worst the companies
will face.
Yet judging by the generators' strong share price performance recently,
investors may be too sanguine. A price cap may hurt profits more than
expected, and arm-twisting to sell plant could be severe. National Power and
PowerGen have plenty of pockets of hidden value stored up against such a
rainy day, but some of those may soon be sealed. Both generators, but
particularly National Power, have made very large provisions against
liabilities, which could be added back to profits if they are not needed.
Yet the Accounting Standards Board may soon limit companies' ability to
flatter profits in this way. The acres of land around disused power stations
may also have limited value, given the environmental liabilities they carry.
Steady erosion of the generators' market share will also hurt earnings. That
particularly affects National Power, which is likely to cede share more
rapidly than PowerGen. Against that, the high level of dividend cover is
usually cited as a defence. National Power's cover is already lower than
PowerGen's, emphasising the difference in growth prospects. Even without a
Monopolies reference, by 1996 National Power may be selling no more than 25
per cent more electricity than its smaller brother. Assuming similar
margins, that might imply a market value no more than 25 per cent higher.
National Power has lagged recently in share price terms but its market worth
is still 45 per cent larger than that of PowerGen. The adjustment may have
further to go.

FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends 1993 on sour note
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks ended the year on a sour note ,as share prices tumbled in the
final hour of a quiet session amid a burst of program trading, writes Frank
McGurty in New York. However, secondary indices finished with solid gains.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.79 to 3,754.09,
while the more broadly base Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.19 lower at 466.45.
But the American SE composite was 4.60 ahead at 477.15 and the Nasdaq
composite up 5.73 at 776.81.
Activity on the NYSE was light, with only 167m shares traded. The breadth of
the market was ahead. Advancing issues lead declines, 1,174 to 888.
With many investors taking a long holiday weekend and no fresh readings on
the economy due until Monday, early trading was largely restricted to
last-minute window-dressing by portfolio managers. In a fitting end to a
year in which low interest rates have underpinned the strength of stocks,
the US Treasury market was once again a distraction, especially in light of
the surprisingly sharp decline in bond prices the previous day.
Traders yesterday were content to allow long bond prices drift to mixed
levels in an abbreviated holiday session, with most sitting on the sidelines
until next week.
With equity investors reassured, the Dow climbed steadily until a late round
of activity linked to the expiration of quarterly index options brought a
30-point swing in the Dow in the last hour. The NYSE reported a string of
order imbalances, with most showing an excess of sellers.
When the smoke cleared, Caterpillar was down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 89,
Disney Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 5/8 , and Allied Signal Dollars 1 to
Dollars 79.
Among the day's best performers, Primerica advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
38 7/8 following the approval by shareholders of the company's merger
agreement with Travelers, which added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . The
newly formed company will begin trading on the NYSE next week.
Stone Container was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 9 5/8 on fears that
its offer of 21m new common shares would dilute the value of existing stock
holdings.
On the Nasdaq, MCI Communications added a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
28 1/4 amid expectations that the company would soon announce a Dollars 1bn
plan to build local telephone networks in most leading US cities.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended the year mixed in quiet trading. Based on preliminary
data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 8.45 points, or 0.20 per cent, to
4,321.43, with advances leading declines 442 to 261.
It gained about 29 per cent in 1993, having ended the 1992 trading year at
3,350.44.

FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris down as Eurostocks
diverge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was good news and bad news from Paribas Capital Markets yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
'Our relative valuation indicators suggest that European equities can rise
another 10-20 per cent before reaching excessive valuations,' said the
broker, 'but risks are increasing. We don't expect a crash or the start of a
bear market, but a 5-10 per cent correction is far from excluded.'
PARIS itself ran out of steam, the CAC-40 closing 10.3 lower at 2,268.22, a
little under 1 per cent up on the week.
The market's Eurostocks moved apart again. Eurotunnel rose FFr0.90 to
FFr52.50, nearly doubled since the middle of October. Euro Disney, however,
ended FFr2.60, or 7.9 per cent lower at FFr30.40. In an interview published
yesterday the chairman of Euro Disney's parent, Walt Disney, did not rule
out the possibility that its theme park outside Paris might be closed if
parent and creditor banks did not agree on a restructuring plan.
Accor, the hotel group, rose FFr9 to FFr590 on the company's plans to help
the Chinese government renovate some 100 state-run hotels.
MILAN saw further demand for Montedison in an otherwise becalmed market and
the Comit index added 5.98 to 619.47, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week.
Montedison climbed L34.70 or 3.8 per cent to L947.60 in heavy volume of
35.4m shares, on further consideration of its agreement with Shell to merge
part of their chemicals business. The rights in its capital call were also
well traded.
Olivetti added L38 to L2,149 in continued response to news that it was
negotiating the sale of its German Triumph-Adler subsidiary.
Telecommunications issues found some demand with Stet, the holding company,
rising L51 to L4,403 but Sip, the national telephone operator, dipping L7 to
L3,596.
MADRID featured large block trades attributed to institutional
window-dressing, which appeared to have the desired effect as the general
index recovered another 3.58 to 322.77, fractionally down on its high for
the year and slightly better on the week.
Turnover was Pta26.4bn for the shortened session. Banks continued their
recovery following the drop on Banesto's bad news this week, but the gains
here were more modest than they were on Thursday.
There was more life in utilities, following a fall of 0.2 per cent in the
industrial electricity tariff,and a rise of 3.5 per cent on domestic prices
announced for 1994. But the Madrid broker, FG, commented that the average
increase of 2.06 per cent was already known, and that it would want to see a
detailed breakdown of the tariff before commenting on its implications for
the sector.
ATHENS put on 1.4 per cent as institutional investors restructured their
year-end portfolios, the general index rising 13.50 to 945.16 in turnover of
Dr5.1bn. The market showed a rise of 4.5 per cent over the last week.
ISTANBUL finished at a second consecutive record high, the composite index
posing a 507.49 rise to 20,682.89 for a weekly rise of 4.5 per cent and a
417 per cent advance since the start of the year.

FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region ends in record
setting mood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pacific Rim markets ignored the absence of Tokyo and a number of other
markets, already on holiday, to continue on their record setting ways.
TAIWAN soared another 4.4 per cent on the day, for a cumulative weekly rise
of 15.4 per cent, to close again at a 30 month high.
The weighted index finished 257.01 ahead at 6,070.56 in turnover that surged
to TDollars 142.1bn, the heaviest since June 1990. Details of the
government's stock capital gains tax came after the market closed.
AUSTRALIA finished at another six-year high as strong sentiment and active
options trading boosted many leading stocks. The All Ordinaries index rose
19.1 or nearly 1 per cent to 2,173.6, for a 5.1 per cent weekly rise. Trade
was unusually busy for the time of year, with options boosting daily
turnover to a high for the year of ADollars 1.18bn.
HONG KONG, weak at the start in the absence of many overseas funds, picked
up after a late round of bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index fininshed
10.92 higher at a new high of 11,888.39, erasing an early 248.41 point loss,
and 9.3 per cent higher on the week. Bulls noted that the index had ended
with three 'eights' which, in the Cantonese equivalent, indicate growth and
prosperity.
KUALA LUMPUR was boosted by the strong performance of index-linked stocks
and blue-chips, taking the composite index 43.59 higher to a record
1,275.32, a 10.7 per cent rise on the week.
SINGAPORE rebounded after Thursday's sharp losses and the Straits Times
Industrials index rose 35.07 to 2,425.68, just short of the previous closing
high of 2,426.85 set two days earlier. The market rose 5.5 per cent over the
week.
NEW ZEALAND moved ahead, the NZSE-40 index adding 7.84 to 2,188.07, close to
the year's peak of 2,203.09 set just before November general elections. The
market has risen by 4.8 per cent over the last week.
COLOMBO ended on a strong note with more buyers than sellers and the all
share index 8.81 higher at at 983.43.

FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Outstanding year tests major global
investors - Adrian Fitzgerald's analysis of a prosperous 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sober, and more serious-minded investors will no doubt spend New Year's day
contemplating investment efficiency. Most equity markets had an outstanding
1993, in spite of the recessionary forces still at work. Indeed, many
markets closed the year at, or close to, all-time highs. But there are still
lessons to be learned.
Managers of very large global funds will not have found the going easy. The
two largest equity markets, the US and Japan, were among the poorest
performers in 1993, providing local currency returns of 10 per cent and 12
per cent respectively.
With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see how market trends reflected
changes in recovery prospects. Growth in the US economy, for example, is
likely to be reported in line with expectations prevalent at the start of
the year, hence the steady but dull stock market performance. By contrast,
expectations for the Japanese economy were continuously downgraded as the
year progressed. Not surprisingly, the stock market fell apart completely in
the second half of the year.
The disappointing outcome in Japan was at least compensated for by the
strength of the yen. Returns to most overseas investors in Japan were
enhanced by upwards of 10 per cent. This was no help to Japanese investors,
who suffered the reverse effect. Not only did they earn a relatively
miserable return from their own market, but their returns from overseas
investments were diluted by the relative weakness of other currencies.
Given the performances of the two major markets, it will be the least
constrained and most adventurous fund managers who will top the performance
tables for last year. The FT-A World Index excluding both the US and Japan
gave a return of 38 per cent in dollar terms; two markets, Hong Kong and
Malaysia, more than doubled.
So, what else is there to contemplate about 1993? On the whole, it was just
wonderful. And, anyway, what's all this mumbo-jumbo about investment
efficiency?
Well, first and foremost, we have to adjust to a low inflation/low interest
rate environment. Investors in the UK, in particular, have to acclimatise
themselves to an environment not experienced since the 1960s. And as 1993
performance figures will highlight, bond returns can be just as good as
equity returns in such an environment. It is time for UK investors to
consider whether their very aggressive exposure to equities provides the
most efficient trade-off between risk and reward.
Investors who dismiss this notion on the grounds that the bull run in bonds
is now over should think carefully. Current equity market ratings worldwide
can only be justified if inflation and interest rates stay low.
US investors, who taught us all we know and love about modern
diversification techniques, must be kicking themselves for not putting
theory into practice. The typical US pension fund holds only around 6 per
cent in foreign assets. It will not require much contemplation, in the light
of last year's relative performances, to realise that this has to be an
inefficient asset mix.
The evidence suggests, however, that this problem is starting to be
addressed. Almost Dollars 50bn poured out of the US into overseas equity
markets in the first nine months of 1993, most of it into Europe. The good
news for European-based stockbrokers is that there is much, much more to
come]
And while investors are contemplating efficiency, they should not forget
about cash. Last year's bull market was fuelled to a large extent by a
flight out of low-interest, but risk-free, cash deposits into supposedly
higher-yielding equities. So far it has worked. But retail and institutional
investors alike must remain alert to the risks they run.
Not that 1994 threatens to be a bleak year. Recovery in the US and the UK
will continue; the rest of Europe is at least stabilising; even Japan should
start to show some recovery in the second half.
The key to equity market performances will be the trend in interest rates
and, especially, the support provided by bond markets. Here again, there
seem to be no great dangers lurking.
What investors have to bear in mind, however, is that, by definition, the
outlook is always rosy at the top of bull markets. The solution is to weigh
up the risks and potential rewards against investment needs and to invest
accordingly.
Nevertheless, as a European-based stockbroker, it would be irresponsible of
me not to point out to US investors that a hedged investment in selected
European markets, notably the UK, France and Spain, is likely to be
rewarding in 1994.

FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Uncertain trend as trading volume
dies away - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Year's Eve brought a volatile half-session in the UK stock market with
the futures market again showing its power by pulling share prices down from
a firm opening. Trading volume was thin, however, and little significance
could be ascribed to price trends.
The market gained more than 16 Footsie points in early trading, backed by a
buy programme from one of the UK securities houses. But the day's peak of
3,445.3 was 35 point short of the year's intra day trading high reached on
Thursday and equities turned back sharply when the premium on the Footsie
March futures contract crumbled.
The final reading, taken at 12.30pm, showed the FT-SE Index at 3,418.4, down
10.4. The year's closing high of 3,462 was recorded on Wednesday.
Over the year, the Footsie has risen by 20 per cent, or 571.9 points, driven
by falling interest rates and growing confidence in economic recovery.
Yesterday was also the end of the three week extended Christmas account in
the UK equity market, which has brought a gain of 157.1, or 4.8 per cent on
the Footsie.
The Christmas account reflected a strong advance in share prices after the
November Budget proved much less threatening that some market pundits had
feared. It was this renewed surge in equities that caught out at least one
leading UK institution which has been forced to cover itself in the futures
market this month, thereby driving prices ahead even more strongly.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained firm yesterday, edging ahead by 4.7 to
3,791.3, about 15 points under the year's high. Seaq volume, at 277.5m
shares, was unexciting, even for a half session. It compared with 554.1m
shares on Thursday when retail, or customer business remained high to return
a value of Pounds 1.30bn.
High retail business has been the most significant feature of this year's
bull run in UK equities. Daily value of customer activity has been well
above the Pounds 1bn mark throughout the period, ensuring profitability at
London based securities firms which have been able to pay good salary
bonuses to their employees who had suffered in the reduced business levels
of past years.
The banking sector continued to outperform yesterday as investors recognised
the benefits for future dividends of the decrease in bad debts which has
been prompted by falling interest rates and signs of recovery in the UK
housing market.
Merchant banks, however, which have been strong beneficiaries of the
strength of the world securities markets, had a calm session.
Store shares, still looking for reliable statistics on the Christmas selling
season, did little more than hold steady. Breweries and food retailers again
suffered from concern over the outlook for price margins and few other
consumer stocks made much showing.
Other interest rate-orientated issues, such as building and construction
stocks, continued to move forward, however.
Market strategists expressed further optimism for 1994. Mr Nicholas Knight
of Nomura, having seen the Footsie come within 20 points of his year-end
forecast of 3,500, predicted 'excellent conditions for financial assets' in
the year ahead, commenting that the UK economy will see growth with very low
inflation and thus interest rates.
He is predicting a Footsie at 3,700 by the end of January and at 4,000 by
the end of 1994.

FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, engulfed by financial problems and badly mauled earlier in the
week by worries about its survival, took another hammering, ending another
painful session a further 28 off at 350p.
In an interview with a French magazine, Le Point, Mr Michael Eisner,
chairman of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent, said closure of the Euro
Disney theme park was one possible outcome of talks between Euro Disney and
its bankers.
UK holiday companies, however, performed well, with Rank Organisation 7 1/2
firmer at 985 1/2 p. The tour operators were rock steady, Airtours holding
firm at 492p after good gains earlier in the week. Bookings for winter and
summer holidays are strongly ahead.
Mr Roy Owens, leisure analyst at Smith New Court said 'Bookings are very
strong and margins reasonable; it's all shaping up to be another very good
summer season for the holiday companies, particularly Airtours.
Banks heavily involved in the Pacific Rim area continued to outpace their UK
counterparts, responding to another session of big gains on the Hong Kong
market which hit yet another record yesterday.
HSBC powered ahead to close 16 up at a peak 974p; over the year the shares
have almost doubled, rising from the 492p level. During the same period
Standard Chartered have performed even better with the shares, up 8
yesterday at 1242p, having risen from 573p. Royal Bank of Scotland, the best
performer of the UK banks this year, eased 4 to 494p.
Kleinwort Benson's elevation to the top of the mergers and acquisitions
league in 1993 kept the shares steady at 583p.
Discount houses, always boosted by reductions in interest rates, came in for
good support with Cater Allen 9 firmer at 608p and Gerrard &amp; National 8 up
at 468p.
BT relinquished an early modest gain and slipped back to close 2 1/2 off at
472 1/2 p on good turnover of 2.9m shares after news that its US associate,
MCI, in which BT is buying a 20 per cent stake, is moving into the US local
telephone market.
Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular phones company, continued to attract
considerable local and overseas support triggered by recent booming sales
and new connections, ending the session 3 higher at 594p.
A flurry of profit-taking affected Cable &amp; Wireless, which, after moving
higher at the outset in response to strong gains on the Hong Kong market,
came off sharply to close 8 down at 522p.
Internationally traded stocks were weaker on balance following a soggy New
York market. Conglomerate Hanson fell 3 to 268 1/2 p while Reuters Holdings
continued to suffer from profit taking after its recent rally and closed 13
lower at 1787p. ICI consolidated after buying pressure on Thursday and eased
2 to 800p while Zeneca slipped a 1 1/2 to 840 1/2 p.
BAT Industries was off 3 at 553 1/2 p with some speculation that its
insurance arm Eagle Star lay behind the massive OTC options expiry which has
been moving the London stock market recently. However, senior marketmakers
said the UK's premier fund management group was the principal party.
Bid speculation continued to swirl around Fisons, the troubled
pharmaceuticals group and the shares rose 2 against the market to 134p.
Fisons has been seen as a bid target for some two years and the rumours have
intensified since the company sacked its chief executive and announced heavy
redundancies recently. But one analyst dismissed the talk as 'hogwash'.
A bright early showing by Asda, one of the big five food retailers, was
halted by news that the group's retail director, Mr Peter Monaghan is
leaving the company for 'personal and family reasons.' Mr Monaghan was said
to have been unwell for some time.
Asda rose to 58p during early trading but eased on the news to close a penny
down on balance at 55 1/2 p. The other food retailing giants also gave
ground.
Kwik-Save, the best performer in the sector in recent days, dipped 6 to 618p
while Sainsbury was 5 off at 444p and Tesco 1 1/2 cheaper at 213 1/2 p.
Boots managed a minor gain, closing 2 ahead at 598p. A statement from the
company on its Christmas trading performance is expected at the end of next
week.
Caradon was the pick of a generally firm building materials sector, the
shares moving up 7 to 414p, amid hopes of further UK interest rate cuts.
Shares in Flextech the unlisted cable and satellite television group, were
suspended at 379p as the company announced it was buying the European
programming assets of United Artists' European arm after issuing 52.36m
shares worth Pounds 201.6m.
British Aerospace improved 4 to 413p on the back of a recommendation by one
leading UK securities house.
Routine management changes at industrial materials groups Williams Holdings
and Morgan Crucible were well received by the market. Williams rose 2 to
374p while Morgan hardened a penny to 365p.
Healthcare Holdings shares were suspended at 1 3/4 p with the company
announcing it was in negotiations with third parties 'which may lead to a
significant corporate transaction' in early 1994.

FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo falls on FDA silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo underperformed the sector in thin trading as
disappointed marketmakers adjusted their trading books after the group
failed to receive US approval for two of its products.
The US Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for licensing the
use of new or adapted pharmaceuticals treatments tends to make about a third
of its annual approvals at the end of the year.
It was expected to sanction the sale of Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment
in tablet form, and Serevent, Glaxo's anti asthma treatment. Some traders
who had bought stock or marked up prices in advance of an announcement were
clearing their dealing books yesterday. The shares dipped 9 to 725p, ending
the year little changed although they have clawed back from a low of 514p in
the summer.

FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets kept investors on the alert until the very end of 1993,
writes Terry Byland. Although there was no repetition of the OTC expiry of
the previous session, the half-day session on New Year's Eve saw a sharp
reversal in the FT-SE March futures contract, which was quickly reflected in
the underlying equities. However, turnover in futures was light, the March
future trading only 5,321 contracts.
Early deals took the contract to the session high of 3,470, from which it
fell to a closing 3,426. While at the peak the contract showed a fair value
premium of around 7, the closing reading showed a discount of several
points.
Volume in traded options totalled 13,835 contracts for the half-session
against 28,096 on Thursday. The FT-SE contract fell away to 5,992 from the
15,307 of the previous session. Individual actives were headed by 3,115
contracts in the Euro FT-SE instrument, with Vodafone (622), also busy.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars and Pounds stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar and sterling ended the year on a bullish note yesterday as
investors and traders looked forward to further steady growth in the US and
British economies, writes Peter Norman.
Although London trading was thin, reflecting the closure of markets in
Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark and the virtual cessation of
activity in the UK around lunchtime, dealers expected the firm undertone of
both currencies to be maintained in the new year.
As the charts show, both the dollar and sterling closed near five-month
highs against the D-Mark with the dollar about 7 per cent higher against the
German currency since the start of last year and sterling up nearly 4 1/2
per cent.
Although the D-Mark recovered slightly against the French franc yesterday,
rising to FFr3.401 from FFr3.397 on Thursday, it ended 1993 slightly weaker
than at the start of the year when it was worth FFr3.404. Since October, the
franc has recouped the losses suffered as a result of the July-August crisis
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The yen was another former high-flyer to close the year at a comparatively
low ebb. Although the dollar ended 1993 more than 10 per cent down against
the yen, its close in London yesterday marked a recovery of about 10 per
cent from its mid-August low of Y101.13.
Strong economic indicators pointing to fast US fourth quarter growth and
mounting expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to raise short-term
interest early this year underpinned the dollar in yesterday's thin trading.
The US currency was able to attract buying interest whenever it dipped
against the D-Mark or the yen. However, there was a limit to its upwards
potential because operators were unwilling to take on large positions in an
illiquid holiday market.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.7365, up from Thursday's DM1.7337.
However, it was fractionally lower against the yen at Y111.605 against
Y111.845. The dollar's slight decline against the Japanese currency
reflected some profit-taking on long dollar positions as investors tidied
their books ahead of the year's end.
The dollar also continued to be pinned down by sell orders placed by
Japanese exporters at around Y112. However, traders pointed to good buying
support when the dollar dipped to Y111.5 as an illustration of its strength.
Sterling rose against both the D-Mark and dollar in London yesterday in
spite of an absence of news. It gained nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark
to close at DM2.5692 against DM2.5602 on Thursday to end just 2 pfennigs
below its late July high against the German currency. It was well up on its
D-Mark low for the year of DM2.33 recorded in late February.
The pound moved slightly higher against the dollar to close at Dollars
1.4795 yesterday from Dollars 1.4768 on Thursday, bringing a year of erratic
movements against the US currency to an end.
Although at yesterday's close sterling was only 2.5 per cent down on its
rate against the dollar at the start of the year, it fell in mid-February to
a low of Dollars 1.42 before rising to Dollars 1.59 in late April.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.705bn of
liquidity yesterday compared with its estimate of a Pounds 2.2bn shortage.
Some Pounds 1.545bn of assistance was provided during the course of its
regular money market dealings. It provided Pounds 160m of late assistance at
unspecified rates.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Commodities (Year in the markets): Metals end 1993 in good
heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite running into general, year-end profit-taking yesterday, London Metal
Exchange base metal contracts mostly ended 1993 with their tails up as
traders looked forward to a sustained upturn in global economic activity in
1994. The scars left by a dismal first half were still plain to see,
however, with 12-month price falls ranging from just under 7 per cent for
zinc to more than 20 per cent for copper. An honourable exception was lead,
which ended about 60 per cent up on the year.
Precious metals ended with substantial gains on the year, though gold bulls
were still waiting for a decisive breach of the psychological barrier at
Dollars 400 a troy ounce. Similarly, cocoa and coffee markets, having shaken
out some of the speculative gains of recent months, were widely expected to
take off again this year.
In contrast, oil traders saw little reason to expect a significant price
upturn after a year that saw the Brent blend crude price slump by nearly 27
per cent to a five-year low.
The LME copper market had a very mixed year. An early rise fuelled by
Chinese buying was followed by a steep price slide that culminated in a 5
1/2 -year low in May and landed several trading houses with huge losses.
That was followed by a severe technical squeeze that was alleged to result
from manipulation by Sumitomo, the Japanese metals group.
At its height the squeeze pushed the cash price to an Dollars 80-a-tonne
premium over the three months price. When the squeeze ended in September -
as a result, some traders suggested, of behind-the-scenes pressure by
exchange authorities - the cash premium quickly turned into a discount, as
was more in keeping with the fact that LME warehouse stocks of the metal
stood at a 15-year high. By the end of October prices had plunged to
six-year lows but they have since recovered by 14 per cent.
The aluminium market, already in the doldrums, had less downside potential
than copper at the start of 1993. But as the flood of material from the
former Soviet Union continued, it easily fulfilled that potential, the three
months price dipping to an eight-year low of Dollars 1,040 a tonne at the
start of November.
Since then multilateral talks aimed at controlling the glut of material on
the world aluminium market have helped sentiment and the market has
recovered by nearly Dollars 100.
The economic hopes that lifted the base metals from their lows also helped
silver, the most 'industrial' of the precious metals, which ended the year
with its price nearly 40 per cent up. Platinum, also principally an
industrial metal, fared less well, reflecting its dependence on the
recession-hit Japanese market.
Gold had a relatively good year, its price ending more than 17 per cent
higher. And many analysts expected 1994 to see it move substantially above
Dollars 400 an ounce, a level reached briefly last year. The rise began in
earnest in May, following an operation by investors George Soros and Sir
James Goldsmith, involving the purchase of shares in Newmont Mining, the
biggest US gold producer, by the former from the latter, who used some of
the cash to buy gold options.
At the London Commodity Exchange, cocoa set the pace with a second position
rise amounting to 65 per cent on the year, despite a recent 12 per cent
retracement. The gain was encouraged by expectations of a continued drawdown
from world stocks over the next few seasons as consumption growth outpaced
production. It was topped up by speculative activity in response to concern
about the political stability of the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa
producer, after the long-expected death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
last month, and the recent decline has been partly a reaction to the orderly
hand-over of power in that country.
Coffee futures were buoyed in the autumn in anticipation of the producers'
export retention scheme, under which they are aiming to hold 20 per cent of
their supplies off the world market. Since the scheme has been operating,
however, the price gain since the start of the year has been trimmed back
from 27 per cent to 16 per cent.
In oil prices the traffic was all one way after the spring as members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries proved unable to forge an
agreement to bring export quotas down to match flagging demand. And with the
coming of the northern winter failing to underpin prices and the prospect of
Iraqi crude's return to the market moving ever closer, analysts could see
little reason to expect an upturn.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares fall after
threat of closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall
sharply after Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, its US parent
company, confirmed that the EuroDisneyland theme park may close unless Euro
Disney is recapitalised.
The shares have been volatile since November when Euro Disney announced an
unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 900m) for the year to
September 30. They closed yesterday at FFr30.40, down from FFr33.00 on
Thursday.
Mr Eisner said in an interview with Le Point, the French weekly current
affairs magazine, that the park's closure would be a possibility if Euro
Disney failed to reach agreement with its creditor banks for an emergency
restructuring of its FFr20.3bn net debt.
'If we can reach a reasonable agreement . . . then Euro Disney will
continue, that would be a happy ending in the Disney tradition,' he said.
'Otherwise we'll have a much more difficult ending. If the engine of an
aeroplane breaks down in mid-flight, what are your options? At the moment
anything is possible, including closure.'
The Disney chairman was ambivalent about the prospects for the negotiations.
'Some days I think we'll pull it off, other days not,' he said. 'There are
more than 50 banks involved in this affair and it's difficult to predict
what such a big group will do.'
Mr Eisner was repeating earlier warnings from Disney executives to the
creditor banks that EuroDisneyland could close if the restructuring talks
fail.
Euro Disney is expected to run out of cash imminently and its parent has
promised financial support until the March 31 deadline for the end of
restructuring negotiations.
Analysts dismissed yesterday's share price fall as nervousness among
investors.
'All it does is underline the fragility of this stock,' said one. However,
the pressure on Euro Disney's shares could pose a problem for the company's
hopes of securing the restructuring, given that Disney envisages including a
rights issue in the rescue package. Further falls in Euro Disney's shares
would reduce the prospective proceeds of a rights issue.
Disney, which hopes the final package will halve Euro Disney's debt to
FFr10bn, would then face the task of persuading the banks to convert more of
their debt into equity or of persuading new shareholders to invest in its
stricken European subsidiary.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti in talks on disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computers group, is in advanced negotiations to slim
down its operations in Germany with the possible sale of part of its Triumph
Adler subsidiary.
Details of the talks, believed to be under way since November, remain
unclear. However, the group stressed that the transaction would not involve
Triumph Adler's production, distribution and sales activities. Triumph Adler
is best known in Germany for its typewriters and office products.
Olivetti said the talks, with an unnamed German investor group, should be
concluded by February.
Olivetti bought Triumph Adler in 1986 from Volkswagen, which took a small
stake in the Italian company as part payment. In the past two years, Triumph
Adler has undergone a wide-ranging restructuring to staunch heavy losses.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chief legal strategist at
Prudential Securities quits

<TEXT>
Mr Loren Schechter, chief legal strategist at Prudential Securities, has
resigned from the post and as a director of the firm amid a widening
government investigation into a 1980s scandal involving the sale by
Prudential of high-risk real estate and energy investments.
Mr Schechter, who will remain an employee of the company, with the title of
executive vice-president, had been Prudential's general counsel since 1982.
An internal Prudential memo said Mr Schechter was stepping down at his own
request because of 'unfortunate and unfair publicity and innuendo' in press
reports about the scandal.
Last October Prudential paid Dollars 371m to settle charges of 'massive
misconduct' made by state and federal regulatory bodies over its sale of
so-called limited partnerships - pooled investments - which were often
portrayed as low risk ventures when they were the very opposite.
Federal prosecutors are now investigating the scandal. The US attorney's
office in Manhattan is understood to be investigating the role of
Prudential's legal department in vetting sales documents used in connection
with the partnerships.
However, Mr Harwick Simmons, chief executive of the firm, said in the
internal memo: 'I strongly believe Loren has acted honourably in all his
dealings with the limited-partnership issue, and that the US attorney's
office will take no action once all the facts become clear.'
Prudential is expected to look for a new chief counsel from outside the
firm.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: AGF chief tipped for new role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Albert, chairman of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of
the largest French insurance groups, has been tipped as a member of the
Monetary Policy Council, the new body which will set monetary policy for the
newly independent Bank of France.
Yesterday's Le Figaro, the French newspaper, claimed Mr Albert, 63, was a
key candidate for one of the nine seats on the council, which will be
responsible for setting interest rate policy under the new system whereby
the Bank of France will operate independently of the government.
If Mr Albert accepted the post, he would have to resign from AGF, given that
council members will not be allowed to hold other positions in financial or
industrial circles.
AGF would not comment yesterday on the speculation about Mr Albert's future.
The Monetary Policy Council will be composed of nine members, including Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and his two deputies.
The names of the six new recruits will be announced on Wednesday.
Mr Michel Sapin, who was finance minister in the last socialist government,
has been cited as another candidate for the council. So too has Mr Alain
Prate, who is deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank.
The departure of Mr Albert would mark the end of an era for AGF, which is a
prime candidate for privatisation by the Balladur government.
In his 11 years as chairman Mr Albert has turned AGF into one of France's
most powerful insurers. He orchestrated the coup in 1992 whereby it expanded
into Germany by taking a stake in the AMB insurance group.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Gallignani, chairman of Banque Indosuez, the investment
bank, has been mooted as a possible successor to Mr Albert at AGF, together
with Mr Bernard Esambert, former chairman of Compagnie Financiere Edmond de
Rothschild.

Ilva, the heavily loss-making Italian steel group, has made a further step
towards its dismemberment and privatisation with the sale of its Cogne
special steels unit.
Cogne, which specialises in stainless steel products, has been bought by
Marzorati, a private steel group based in the Ticino region of Switzerland.
No price for the transaction, reported by the Ansa news agency, has been
revealed and Ilva was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The Cogne subsidiary is one of a number of Ilva assets for sale as part of
the group's restructuring plan. Under the scheme, Ilva has been broken up
into separate companies, all of which are to be privatised.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: US tobacco group lifts
Kazakhstan interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris has agreed to take a majority stake in Alma-Aty Tobacco
Kombinat, a cigarette manufacturer in the former Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan, according to Interfax, the Russian news agency.
The Dollars 310m investment in the operation, in which the US group already
owns a 49 per cent interest, underlines the importance of international
markets to the troubled US food and tobacco group.
Philip Morris would acquire 97 per cent of ATK, while the Kazakh government
would retain 'a golden share', the news agency said.
The investment includes Dollars 48.9m to acquire the equity, a Dollars 50m
bonus to be paid to the Kazakh government, and about Dollars 210m in
spending to improve production, tobacco growing and processing.
In September, Philip Morris agreed to buy a minority interest in the
enterprise and said it would lift its stake to more than 90 per cent within
a year. The deal represented the first in which a foreign company had taken
a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet
republic.
The Kazakh acquisition is the latest in a series of moves in which Philip
Morris has sought to bolster its presence in foreign markets, which account
for a greater percentage of its tobacco revenues than the US. The company
has equity interests in tobacco operations in Russia and Lithuania.
Along with other US tobacco groups, Philip Morris's domestic revenues have
been hit by declining cigarette consumption.
Profits from foreign sales, meanwhile, have grown at a faster pace than
domestic earnings, partly because of the increasing popularity of cut-price
no-frills brands.
The investment in Kazakhstan is intended to flood the region with
American-quality cigarettes. As part of the agreement, ATK will manufacture
Marlboro and other leading Philip Morris brands, as well as local
cigarettes.

FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rothmans Asia plan thwarted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothmans International's radical plans to merge its tobacco operations in
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia into a single company have been rejected
by shareholders in the Malaysian company.
The vote dealt a heavy blow to Rothmans' ambitions to strengthen its
position in the developing cigarette markets of the Pacific Rim.
Independent directors of Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) - 50 per cent
owned by the international group - had recommended the merger, which had
earlier been agreed by shareholders in Rothmans Industries of Singapore.
Mr Anthony Jones, managing director of the Malaysian company, said he was
'very disappointed' by the rejection.
Shareholders' concerns had been adequately addressed at meetings during the
past week, he believed. 'Frankly, I'm a little nonplussed at the result.'
Rothmans has not disclosed details of the shareholders' objections but they
are understood to have argued strongly for maintaining an independent
Malaysian company rather than pooling resources in a regional operation.
Leading dissenters are believed to include the Malaysian government's main
investment arm, which holds 17.87 per cent, and the armed forces retirement
fund, with 8.79 per cent.
Analysts, who expect shares in the Malaysian and Singapore companies to fall
sharply when trading resumes on Monday, said investors may also have been
worried about dilution of their stakes in the merger and the prospect of
slow returns from new markets.
Rothmans, which would have owned 50 per cent of the new company, with the
rest split between Malaysian and Singaporean shareholders, said the
restructuring would have caused initial dilution of earnings but held out
the prospect of higher future dividends.
The group now has to decide whether its plans can be revised to win
Malaysian support or to continue its merger of the Hong Kong, a wholly-owned
unit, and Singapore interests without Malaysia.
Mr Jones, however, conceded yesterday that 'without Malaysia in the mix,
it's not as attractive an option. Malaysia was very central.'
Rothmans' merger strategy - launched last February - would have enabled the
group to concentrate cash resources and management expertise to accelerate
the exploitation of the region's cigarette markets.
The Hong Kong operation holds rights to markets in China, which accounts for
a third of world cigarette consumption with 1,700bn cigarettes a year,
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. But high development costs in marketing and
establishing sales and distribution networks have so far resulted in trading
losses.
The Singapore company has access to growth markets in Thailand, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos and Burma, as well as estimated cash reserves of Pounds 84m
(Dollars 124m).
Malaysia, with a mature domestic market in which growth is slowing, has an
estimated Pounds 207m cash.
The merger would thus have created a regional company - capitalised at more
than Pounds 1bn - with greater potential for future growth than any of its
constituents, according to analysts.

Pharmacia of Sweden has completed the acquisition of Italy's Farmitalia
Carlo Erba and Erbamont (FICE) in a SKr3.8bn (Dollars 457m) deal, Reuter
reports from Stockholm.
Pharmacia took up the option to buy the remaining 49 per cent of the company
ahead of an earlier agreed date. Under the original agreement, it would buy
the rest of FICE sometime in 1994 or 1995.
The seller was Holdback Holdings, which is owned by a consortium of banks.
The first 51 per cent of FICE was bought in May, Pharmacia said. Procordia,
the Swedish diversified company, was split into two companies in the autumn,
of which one is Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical company.
Montedison, the Italian pharmaceutical group, owned FICE before the sale in
May. It sold its remaining 49 per cent to Holdback Holdings later that
month.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: A change of channel for Flextech - Oil
services company agrees merger with US cable TV group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Luard, managing director of Flextech, which yesterday announced
agreement to merge with the European programme interests of TCI, the US
cable television giant, is the first to admit that he is no media mogul.
When the substantive talks were over with Mr Fred Vierra, executive vice
president of TCI - itself in the midst of a multi-billion dollar merger deal
with Bell Atlantic, the US telephone company - Mr Vierra hopped on a
corporate jet to return to Denver.
Mr Luard, a 45-year former Price Waterhouse accountant, jumped on the train
to Gloucestershire and treated himself to a burger on the way home.
The Flextech managing director will have under his wing stakes in cable and
satellite channels as diverse as Bravo, the old movies channel, Children's
Channel, UK Gold - the channel based on the programme libraries of the BBC
and Thames Television - and UK Living.
Yet four years ago Flextech was an oil services company and Mr Luard had no
experience in the media at all.
'Business is business. What is this mystique about the media? You control
costs and you control margins,' says Mr Luard, who began a deal-making
career in 1980 with the Pounds 52,000 purchase of a Somerset textile
company.
The deal was a good one, and unused land was sold for Pounds 800,000 and Mr
Luard moved on to other deals - some more successful than others - buying
boiler and engineering companies before, in 1986, being asked to look at
Flextech, an oil investment company whose assets included Expro, a
loss-making oil services company.
Mr Luard said yesterday that over three years a Pounds 2m a year Expro loss
was turned into a profit of more than Pounds 6m.
'We had always flagged that we wanted to move into something else. We did
not want to be a hostage to the price of oil.'
The something else turned out to be the media, which Mr Luard says 'has to
be a great business' because he believes there is no reason why the UK
should be any different from the US and other parts of the US in embracing
multi-channel choice.
Flextech's existing media interests include a 24 per cent stake in Hit
Entertainment, a successful distributor of children's and nature
programming, 50.1 per cent of The Children's Channel, 39 per cent of The
Family Channel and a stake in IVS, a company which owns five cable
television franchises in the UK covering 265,000 homes.
Under the new deal, Flextech will acquire all the European programme assets
of United Artists European Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCI. The
assets are made up of 100 per cent of Bravo, an additional 24.6 per cent of
The Children's Channel, 25 per cent of UK Gold, 31.3 per cent of UK Living,
and Pounds 44m nominal value loan stock associated with the stakes.
There is also a 100 per cent stake in United Artists Entertainment
Programming, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAEH.
UAEP manages Discovery, the factual channel, The Learning Channel, The
Parliamentary Channel and Wire TV, a service exclusive to cable which mixes
soaps, games shows, sport and live studio discussions. The subsidiary is
also responsible for the sales and marketing of The Country Music Channel.
The Flextech deal will not result in management changes at UAEP and Ms Joyce
Taylor, chief executive, and Mr Mark Luiz, chief financial officer, will
form the senior management team of Flextech as chief executive of
programmming and chief financial officer.
In return, TCI takes a 60.4 per cent stake in Flextech - 62.2 per cent if
all financing options are exercised. The TCI stake in Flextech, an Unlisted
Securities Market company is valued at just over Pounds 200m.
In addition TCI will provide Pounds 12.5m in cash and a Pounds 10m loan in
working capital. There are also agreements on a further Pounds 14m in shares
and unsecured loan stock.
'It's a very good deal for TCI and for Flextech,' said Mr Anthony Fry of NM
Rothschild, which represented Flextech.
For TCI the deal provides a more European vehicle for future programme
expansion at a time when European ownership and content of cable and
satellite channels is becoming an increasing political issue. It also offers
a quick valuation for channels that are all still loss-making.
Shareholders, upon whose approval the deal is conditional, were warned
yesterday that the performance of the company was very dependent on the
future development of cable and satellite. There would be no dividends at
least until 1995.
TCI will have three members of the eight-strong board. Mr Adam Singer, vice
president international of TCI will become an executive director. Mr Vierra
and Mr Stephen Brett, senior vice president, will become non-executive
directors.
'This is a most wonderful platform to do other things. It gives us enormous
firepower,' said Mr Luard, who retains 600,000 Flextech share options at
92p. When the share price was suspended because of the deal it stood at
379p.

At the same time, directors are in talks with the company's secured lenders

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Heritable wins US judgment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Heritable Trust, the mini-conglomerate, has won an Dollars 8.5m
(Pounds 5.7m) judgment in the US courts in respect of a claim against KPMG
Peat Marwick regarding the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Rangaire
Corporation in 1988.
The Federal Court jury in Dallas, Texas, found in favour of the company
after a trial lasting four weeks. The claim filed by SHT alleged that
audited financial statements of Rangaire, upon which the company made its
decision to purchase a stake, were materially mis-stated.
The jury found that the auditors had not committed fraudulent violation of
US securities laws, but had been negligent in its audits of Rangaire in 1987
and 1988.
The timing of the receipt of the award is dependent on whether or not an
appeal is made. SHT anticipates that it will realise about Pounds 3.5m after

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thornton Pounds 3m zero pref placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thornton Pan-European Investment Trust is to raise some Pounds 3m net of
expenses via a placing of zero dividend preference shares at 50p apiece.
It is also proposed that the life of the company be extended by about eight
years to October 31 2001.
The new shares have been placed with institutions, subject to a clawback by
qualifying shareholders on the basis of one new preference share for every
three ordinary held.
The zero dividend preference shares are designed to offer investors a return
of 90.83p each on the new winding up date, which represents a gross
redemption yield of 8 per cent on the subscription price.
Following the introduction of zero dividend preference shares, the existing
ordinary shares are to be redesignated as ordinary income shares.
For shareholders who wish to realise their investment in the company, Olliff
&amp; Partners, adviser to the proposals, is making a cash offer which amounts
to 101 per cent of formula asset value.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Danka expands in US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Danka Business Systems, the acquisitive office equipment supplier based in
the US and quoted in London, has expanded its operations in the Chicago,
Illinois, area via the acquisition of American Office Equipment Company for
a maximum Dollars 9.3m (Pounds 6.28m).
AOE, an authorised copier dealer for Sharp, Ricoh and Mita, has 11 branches
throughout the Chicago metropolitan area and in northern Indiana, and
represented, said Mr Daniel Doyle, Danka chief executive officer, his
company's entry into the copier market in that region.
He added that the acquisition would serve as a new base of operations in the
US Midwest.
In its most recent financial year, AOE had sales of Dollars 28m, operating
profits of Dollars 1m and net assets of Dollars 2m. The purchase price
comprises Dollars 8.3m cash and a contingent consideration of up to Dollars
1m dependent on future earnings.
In the six months to September 30, pre-tax profits at Danka soared 91 per
cent to Pounds 13.3m on the back of exchange rates and a series of
acquisitions.
During the half, it spent some Pounds 36m on 13 companies, including its
first in the UK.
In October Danka made an Dollars 86m share issue and refinanced its
long-term borrowings.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Resort accounts delayed by valuation
difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficulties in finalising property valuations for Resort Hotels, the
company which called in independent accountants to investigate financing
issues last July, are behind the long delay in publishing its accounts for
the year to end-April.
'Because it has not been possible to determine the finalised valuation of
our properties as yet, the accounts of the company for the year ended April
30 1993 are not complete and cannot be laid before you today,' Mr David
Tonkinson, chairman, told shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting.
Property valuations have become a vexed issue since two firms of chartered
surveyors offered widely divergent valuations of the assets of Queens Moat
Houses, the troubled hotels company.
There has been speculation that Resort could be suffering similar problems
to those at Queens Moat Houses of high debt and falling asset value.
Mr Tonkinson said stock exchange rules prevented him from giving
shareholders at the meeting any more information about the affairs of the
company, whose shares were suspended last July at 45p, without issuing a
circular to all shareholders. That had not been possible.
Mr Tonkinson denied that the company had selected the date and venue for its
annual meeting to cause shareholders inconvenience.
He said the meeting was timed for the last day of the calendar year 'to
leave, until the last possible moment, the opportunity of sending a detailed
circular to shareholders, if that had been possible.'
He added that the meeting was not taking place in one of the company's
hotels as these were all 'very busy preparing for tonight's festivities with
a view to earning profit'.
He said the trade and industry department had granted a new deadline of
February 28 for publication of the accounts.
Mr Tonkinson added: 'The most rigorous investigations have been carried out,
both by Ernst &amp; Young as external independent accountants and by our own
auditors and solicitors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Gouldens respectively.'
In early December the company's deputy chairman, Mr Tim Barker, and its
financial adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, resigned.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: 1993 proves a five-year high with Pounds
5.1bn raised through flotations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of the new issue market over the past 12 months took the
City of London by surprise.
At this time last year financiers were worried that the continuing recession
and what looked to be high government borrowing would leave room for only a
handful of companies to seek a public listing.
In the event, the year's 165 flotations - a five-year high - raising Pounds
5.1bn in new capital assuaged these fears but created their own
difficulties. There have been doubts about the quality of some stocks as the
high stock market became a more lucrative option than trade sales.
Also, investors have become highly selective with the result that some
stocks failed to gain support for their issue prices in early trading.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 1m income boost for Warburg director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A vice-chairman of SG Warburg Group, the UK-based investment bank, added
almost Pounds 1m to his income for 1993 after the exercise of options and
the sale of bonus shares which together released Pounds 961,640.
Mr Michael Gore was assigned to Tokyo as head of the Asia Pacific region
earlier this year. The appointment surprised the City because Mr Gore had
been the group's finance director since 1986.
Mr Gore joined Warburg in 1964 and is one of the group's three
vice-chairmen.
The company told the stock exchange yesterday that Mr Gore executed his
rights under the SG Warburg Group Executive Share Option Scheme over 33,559
shares of 25p each on December 29.
The rights were granted in April 1987 at a price of 344.8p.
Also on Wednesday, Mr Gore alerted trustees of the SG Warburg Group Employee
Trust of his wish to acquire 67,987 shares in the group.
Under the terms of the SG Warburg Group bonus scheme, shares may be acquired
by executives as part of a performance-related pay package.
The shares were acquired at the closing mid-price of 943.5p per share on
Wednesday. The total of 101,546 shares were sold at 947p on December 30.

FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish in rig deal with
Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, operator of the Emerald oilfield east of
Shetland, has successfully completed negotiations with Trafalgar House over
the leasing of the rig Emerald Producer.
Mr Jon Hawksley, managing director, said yesterday the company would be
making an announcement about the new arrangements next week.
He would not comment on reports that creditors of the group's two
subsidiaries operating the field would be asked to agree to a creditors'
voluntary arrangement, or rescue scheme. He denied that the parent company
would seek such an agreement.
The Emerald field, which was initially expected to produce 30,000 barrels a
day, has proved extremely disappointing. It started in August 1992 with
production of 25,000 barrels a day, but this has dwindled to 16,000 barrels
a day.
Last August Midland wrote off the entire value of the development. The
provision of Pounds 97m put it Pounds 113.6m in the red for 1992 on turnover
of Pounds 28.1m.
In September the company defaulted on its charter payments to Trafalgar for
the Emerald Producer, which it was leasing for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds
44,000) a day. Last month Trafalgar, which at the end of September had the
rig on its books at Pounds 66m, wrote down the value by Pounds 42.1m and
made a Pounds 9.5m provision for costs pending its redeployment or sale.
Mr Hawksley said yesterday that the life of the Emerald field would now
depend on when the rig and equipment could be redeployed. Opportunities were
available, including in the UK sector. He estimated the field's life at
between six and 18 months. The company has prepared a plan for abandoning
the field at a cost of Dollars 11m.
The shares closed yesterday at 2 1/4 p, down  1/4 p.
The company's main asset apart from Emerald is a floating oil production
vessel under construction in Italy at a cost of Dollars 350m to Dollars
400m.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Hopes of glory, fears of blood: As South Africa's elections
approach, Patti Waldmeir takes the pulse of supporters of three different
camps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We could not immediately see Isandlwana, as we bumped along the dirt road,
admiring the conical peaks and vast blue-green plains of northern Natal, and
imagining the great Zulu impi (war party) which spilled so much British
blood here in 1879. Then we saw them, descendents of the Isandlwana victors,
dressed for urban battle: 10,000 Zulus in street clothes, carrying assegais
(spears), knobkerries (clubs) and shields, the same weapons which humbled
the British empire, used now to spill blood on township battlefields.
Last month, at the site of their people's greatest military victory, Zulus
heard King Goodwill Zwelithini bemoan the Zulu nation's darkest hour. Using
the imagery of 19th century colonialism, King Goodwill warned of a new
invasion of Zululand, not by a mighty foreign monarch, but by fellow
Africans - many of them Zulus - from the African National Congress.
The King, flanked by his uncle, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, called on them
to 'let the valour and the honour that led to the defeat of the British in
this place in 1879, rise up to claim Zulu warriors'. 'Resist, I command you,
resist I implore you,' he urged the crowd, which radiated menace. 'We will
not be ruled over by a constitution that we spurn. We will not be subjugated
by a political party which wants to destroy us simply because it wants to
rule.'
Those who underestimate the power of Zulu nationalism - among them, it
sometimes seems, the government and the ANC - would have done well to wander
among the assegais and the knobkerries at Isandlwana. For these will be the
weapons of the forthcoming election campaign, as much as the posters and the
TV adverts and the candidates' debates. And these are the people who could
stop elections altogether in parts of Natal and the East Rand townships of
Johannesburg, unless they can be persuaded to accept the new constitution.
It was a sobering image for 1994. This will be the year of South Africa's
greatest glory - the first all-race elections in history, to be held on
April 27. But it will probably also be the year of the worst-ever violence,
as electoral passion inspires political rivals to new heights of brutality.
Since apartheid's death knell was struck in 1990, some 13,000 people have
died in political violence. In the latest incident, four people were shot
dead and five wounded in a Cape Town bar on Thursday night. It is probably
unavoidable that thousands more will perish next year, whatever the
electoral outcome.
Yet the ANC dismisses the Isandlwana spirit, convinced that Chief Buthelezi
is a paper tiger who will crumple once his KwaZulu black homeland is
deprived of both central government funding and the more nefarious support
which they believe is provided by South Africa's security forces. And the
ruling National party, erstwhile ally of the Chief, has thrown in its lot so
irrevocably with the ANC that it too seems to downplay his importance. 'They
are going to share power with the ANC. That's all they care about,' said an
angry official in Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party recently. 'They
won't let anything else get in the way of that. They want to humiliate us.'
In truth, it is easy to offend Zulu pride, especially that of Chief
Buthelezi. But after decades spent stoking the fires of Zulu nationalism, he
has created a force to be reckoned with - and not, as one government
minister suggested after a recent round of talks with Inkatha, by 'brute
force'. Force can deal with the lunatic fringes of politics, but not with a
party that probably commands a large chunk of support among the 7m Zulus in
Natal and elsewhere - not a majority, though polls are unreliable - as well
as a growing share among whites. South Africans must hope that the new year
brings a political settlement with Inkatha; the success of the elections
depends on it.
* * *
Natal is strewn with battlefields, whether from the last century or the last
week; and on the day of the Isandlwana celebrations, South Africa's other
great dissenting force, the white right wing, gathered to commemorate
another Natal battle. At Blood River, some 40km across the eroded plains of
Zululand, rightwing Afrikaners celebrated the quintessential victory of
white over black in South Africa, the 1838 triumph of 400-odd Afrikaner
voortrekkers (pioneers) over a Zulu force that swells with the telling, but
probably totalled 10,000. This was the great victory of right over might, of
Christianity over barbarism, of Europe over Africa. For conservative
Afrikaner leaders, it has great resonance with the present battle:
Afrikaners are vastly outnumbered by blacks; they believe they are fighting
for Christian values against communism; and they think they can get God on
their side by vowing a new commitment to a Christian lifestyle weakened by
intervening decades of affluence and power.
Gen Constand Viljoen, the retired army chief who addressed the volk at Blood
River on that day, had planned to make a guest appearance at Isandlwana, to
demonstrate the fearful might of a united Boer-Zulu front. He says
practicalities prevented him from doing so; the real reason is probably not
that simple. But even if Blood River did not come to Isandlwana, the union
of rightwing Afrikaners and Zulus is surely the stuff of peace-loving South
Africans' worst nightmares. Few think Inkatha and the rightwing white
parties could fight an election campaign together (they recently formed a
strategic front, the Freedom Alliance, but share few common policies); but
if they choose instead to fight against the poll, unity would be easier and
the threat to elections grave indeed. Not surprisingly, much ANC strategic
thinking seems to be focused on ways to split the Freedom Alliance, so far
without success.
Even on its own, the white right wing poses a grave threat during the
campaign. Not that it commands large numbers - the crowd at Blood River was
perhaps one-tenth of that at Isandlwana, and its mood was several times less
belligerent - but that its members are heavily armed, well trained (by the
South African military, which forced all white men to do military service),
and experienced in warfare. Last April, it pushed South Africa to the verge
of the abyss by arranging the assassination of ANC guerrilla leader, Chris
Hani. A few more well-timed murders would seriously jeopardise stability.
Although the ANC despises Inkatha, it openly fears the white right. Here
again, divide and conquer seems to capture the essence of ANC strategy: its
leaders have been working hard at negotiations with the more moderate
faction of the right to give them what they can call an Afrikaner homeland,
or volkstaat. This is a bit of semantic chicanery from the ANC, which
continues to use the word volkstaat while intending to offer no more than
limited local autonomy for Afrikaners - not the independent ethnic state the
word would imply. They know they will lose the hard right in the end; but
the longer they talk, the less time the right has to mobilise against
elections.
* * *
Hundreds of miles away in Soweto, on the same December day, Fred Khumalo, an
elderly man from Alexandra township, marched proudly in the uniform of the
guerrilla army to which he has dedicated his life: Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear
of the Nation, the ANC force. The previous day, at a shebeen (beer hall) in
one of Alexandra's desperately poor streets, Mr Khumalo expressed his fears
about the ANC 'self-defence units' in the township, to one of which he
belongs. Criminal elements had infiltrated the SDUs, and some had run out of
control. Some SDUs were working closely with police; but others were a
threat to peace in a township that has struggled back from the brink of
anarchy to something like calm.
Elections will provide renegade SDUs with the ideal atmosphere for mayhem.
In many areas, they will prevent campaigning by rival parties altogether, to
the disadvantage of parties such as the National party and the liberal
Democratic party, which need to extend their support base to blacks if they
are to survive in the new South Africa.
Perhaps Mr Khumalo should be given the last word in this survey of gloom,
from Isandlwana to Alexandra via Blood River. 'I have no bitterness, I don't
hate whites,' he told me, with emotion in his voice and a pleading sincerity
in his eyes. He said how much he was looking forward to the elections. Even
if they are only partly free and fair, they will mark a great day for South
Africa. Black South Africans have waited centuries for this.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Leave job creation and growth in
Europe to the entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HERBERT E MEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With so many 'action plans' for European economic growth now on the
table, permit me to offer my own. The three-step 'Meyer plan' is easy to
organise, simple to administer and guaranteed to succeed
Step one: organise a conference and invite every unelected official who has
proposed a growth plan or thrown his weight behind such a plan.
Step Two: Shoot them all.
Step Three: Repeat steps one and two as often as necessary to allow Europe's
entrepreneurs the freedom they need to create jobs.
Seriously, what is with you people? The wealth of Europe's great
civilisations was not created by bureaucrats armed with grandiose and
expensive growth plans. It was created by ambitious, clever, hard-working
people who had the grit and the guts to turn ideas and dreams into
marketable products and services, thus creating industries and millions of
jobs. Europe continues to produce such men - and women  - in abundance.
Indeed, I meet them all the time. Unfortunately for Europe, I meet them in
California or elsewhere in the US where they have settled to work in a
country that - despite its current leadership - continues to provide a
better political environment in which to achieve commercial success than is
available anywhere else in the industrialised world.
For heaven's sake, we are at the end of the 20th century and we know the
proper role for government in creating economic growth: it is to establish
ground rules, to ensure these rules are obeyed, and otherwise to get the
hell out of the way while entrepreneurs make growth happen.
This works all the time; nothing else has ever worked. Why not give this
approach a try? More accurately, why not try this approach again, since the
last time Europe let its entrepreneurs run free they made it the world's
most powerful civilisation, as well as its richest in terms of both material
wealth and culture? Isn't this what you want? Or is all this talk of growth
merely a cover story, designed to persuade people that something is being
done while the real goal - feathering the bureaucrats' nests - continues
unabated?

FT  01 JAN 94 / In a class of their own: The UK government's plans for
selective education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are grammar schools on their way back? Selective education received its
strongest backing for a quarter of a century this week when the UK
government announced it would provide funds for schools which may be wholly
or partially selective.
In the clearest extension of the government's policy of fostering choice and
diversity in education, the Funding Agency for Schools, a government quango,
will also be given the power to create schools in areas where there is a
shortage of places.
The proposals elicited condemnation from the Labour party and from teachers'
unions. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, described selective
education as favouring 'the very few at the expense of the vast majority',
while Mr Don Foster, her Liberal Democrat counterpart, said: 'The measure
will increase chaos and division.'
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said:
'The plans will create an elite education for a limited number of pupils.
This is not the way to have high-quality education for all of our children.'
The proposals probably mean the end of the 'neighbourhood comprehensive'
which now dominates secondary education. But the UK is unlikely to see a
return to the system of grammar schools, secondary moderns, and technical
schools, with admissions decided by exams taken at the age of 11, mapped out
in the 1944 Education Act.
Instead, the 'big idea' of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is to
allow a school system to emerge in response to local demands. But will the
reforms create coherent and diverse schooling or a patchwork of provision?
Already, schools and local authorities which dislike the comprehensive
system can reject it. More than 1,000 schools have opted out of local
authority control in favour of accepting direct grants from the government.
This is far fewer than the government hoped - it aimed for 1,500 by April
this year - but enough to set a trend.
If a comprehensive school opts out, Mr Patten can allow it to become
selective. Or it can choose to become a specialist 'technology college' and
receive extra funding. Schools may now select up to 10 per cent of their
intake on the basis of particular skills - including technology, sport,
music and drama.
Wandsworth, the Conservative-controlled London borough, shows the scope
schools have to shift from the comprehensive model. By last September, all
but four of its secondary schools had opted out.
Of the remainder, Battersea school is now a technology college; Ernest
Bevin, a purpose-built boys' comprehensive, wants to admit half its pupils
on the basis of academic selection; and Chestnut Grove comprehensive will
admit 30 out of its annual intake of 150 on the basis of aptitude for art
and design, and another 30 on linguistic ability. Two grant-maintained
schools, Burntwood, which is girls-only, and Waveney, which is mixed, are
consulting the government about admitting roughly half their intake by
selection.
If Wandsworth's proposals are passed, only one local authority comprehensive
will be left in the borough. Admissions will be in the hands of the schools,
not the council.
The pattern in the rest of the country is less clear, although in Penrith,
Cumbria, Mr Patten has shown he wants to encourage selective schools where
there is minimal local support.
Last year, he allowed one opted-out school to become a grammar school
although the plan was opposed by the head of the town's remaining
comprehensive, and despite keen opposition from some teachers, councillors
and parents. The result is that both schools are competing fiercely for the
most able pupils, and their development strategies are in disarray.
Such confusion raises the deeper question of whether selectivity is the
right direction for UK education. Direct comparisons between the results
achieved by selective schools and comprehensives offer few clues as the
intake of selective schools gives them an in-built advantage.
However, studies into the 'value added' by schools - the degree to which
pupils improve during their time at a school - suggest selectivity makes
little difference. For example, the Audit Commission's study on 'value
added' in A-level results found 'no single type of institution appears
consistently more effective at A-level than others'.
Surviving grammar schools perform well, but analysis of High Wycombe,
Buckinghamshire, home to three of the nation's top grammar schools,
indicates their success is grounded in local authority control, rather than
competition.
The head teachers of the grammars and the six secondaries in High Wycombe
discuss and co-ordinate admissions procedure, while pupils at one school can
take courses at another after the age of 16. Buckinghamshire county council
retains total control of all admissions. Even the Royal Grammar, which has
opted out, allows the county to select its pupils.
The process differs deeply from the brave new design emerging in Wandsworth.
It is mistaken, therefore to see the latest reforms as a nationwide return
to the postwar system. The changes are not taking education back, but
forward into uncharted territory.
Big obstacles remain. Opposition to the government may derail the proposals.
Head teachers may not support them, and local communities may not want to
set up selective schools. The pupils whose needs are not now being met may
find no improvement in the new system. The power to make the changes rests
with Mr Patten. His decisions will have far-reaching consequences for
children across the UK.

<TEXT>
Sir, I disagree with Nigel Andrews' assessment ('Feelgood movies give way to
darker themes', December 30) of Jane Campion's film, The Piano, as a
'feminist' film. I advise women not to see it.
A film which dresses up voyeurism with costumes, clever camera work and nice
music and presents it as 'art' on the back of Victorian modesty is a
deception. A nasty amputation scene which offends feminine feelings is
horror tactics dressed up as meaning. I walked out of it.
This is the same macho nonsense but more insidious because it is good to
look at and to listen to, most of the time.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commodity's high status in a changing
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M HOBBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As someone who has spent almost 40 years in and around the plantation
industry, I was greatly interested in your article about the changes which
have occurred during that period ('There was some corner of a foreign
field', December 30).
Although I have been much involved with palm oil, and to some extent
concerned in the fortunes of tea, coffee, cocoa, and coconut, my first
loyalty was always to King Rubber, and it is to this fascinating commodity
that I have returned in my later business years. Its status as an industrial
commodity today is high, and the services performed by the world markets in
ensuring its successful carriage from its tropical home to its manifold
consumers are very important. So I make no apology in reminding your readers
that behind any growers' association there must be an efficient means of
distribution.
This close connection between the agricultural and the marketing sides is,
in the case of natural rubber, of long standing, and dates back to 1913,
when the Rubber Growers' Association was a founder member of our
predecessor, the Rubber Trade Association of London. It is therefore a
source of pleasure that the Tropical Growers' Association is planning to
join us once more in our offices here, and we should not want it to be felt
that, on its journey from 'Dickensian offices above a Chinese restaurant' to
'cheaper premises in Barking', it is descending into a subterranean world
where its presence will be inappropriate.
It should perhaps be mentioned that our association's current chairman is
Peter Hadsley-Chaplin, son of Edwin Hadsley-Chaplin, a former chairman of
the TGA, which surely demonstrates that the bonds between ourselves and the
growers remain strong.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Wiser to be bold: Philip Coggan with a cautionary tale of
how small investors fared in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the story of two small UK investors. Mr Bold started 1993 by moving
his funds into a mixture of equities and gilts; he earned a return of about
22-28 per cent. Mr Cautious kept his money where it had always been - in the
building society. He earned about 5.5-6 per cent gross.
So it would be a mistake to think that all British investors will look back
at 1993 with satisfaction. Attitudes will depend on the risks they were
prepared to take, and the advice they received at the start of the year.
The past three years have proved a shock for British savers. In 1990,
interest rates were 15 per cent and it was both easy and profitable to leave
money on deposit. In retrospect, the best time to move out of cash and into
shares, or government bonds (gilts), was after Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990 when the stock market dropped sharply. But few had the
nerve, or the incentive, to do so.
Interest rates fell steadily over the next two years, but the most dramatic
falls followed sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System in September 1992. Since then, rates have almost
halved, and now languish at 5.5 per cent.
People living off their savings may thus have seen their income fall by more
than 60 per cent in the past three years. Economists may argue that 'real'
interest rates (rates minus the increase in the retail price index) are
still positive. But this cuts little ice with savers: their nominal income
has been falling, while prices have continued to rise.
It takes time, however, for most savers to react to falling interest rates.
In part, this is because few are aware of the rates they receive on their
accounts; surveys show that many overestimate returns. Only when the annual
interest payment is added to their account does the message sink in.
Not until the start of last year did savers begin to take action to
counteract the decline in interest rates. The trend is clear from sales of
unit trusts (collective funds which offer investors a spread of equities, or
bonds). In December 1992, the unit trust industry made net repurchases from
investors of Pounds 21.2m. But in January 1993, the trend switched, with net
sales of Pounds 509m. In the 11 months to the end of last November, net
sales were Pounds 8.2bn, making 1993 the industry's best.
The key to the success of unit trusts has been the Personal Equity Plan.
Income and capital gains made from a Pep are free of tax. But for investors
holding shares directly, additional charges imposed by a Pep manager can
often wipe out the tax benefits completely, especially after the change in
the March Budget change, which reduced the tax credit on dividends from 25
to 20 per cent.
The vast majority of unit trusts impose no additional Pep charge. Thus, if
savers buy a unit trust, they might as well do so in a tax-free Pep. Unit
trusts now dominate Pep sales.
The surge in unit trust sales is linked to low interest rates. The after-tax
return of a cash account to a basic rate taxpayer is currently 4.125 per
cent. This is not too far ahead of the dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share
Index of 3.4 per cent, which the investor can receive tax-free in a Pep.
Investors will therefore lose little income by buying a Pep and and have the
hope of capital gains.
Further, the unit trust industry has done its best to offer yields well
above even the best returns from building society accounts. Probably the
most successful product this year has been the Hypo F&amp;C Higher Income Plan,
which pays a tax-free income of 10 per cent a year when held in Pep form.
The structure of the plan has led some critics to question whether an
investor's capital could be eroded in the long run. But enough savers were
persuaded of its merits for Hypo F&amp;C to attract Pounds 450m last year.
A host of other high-income plans were launched in 1993, some where the
level of income was guaranteed but the return of capital was not. City
regulators were sufficiently concerned to issue a series of guidance notes
last month, warning members to ensure that investors were aware of the risks
involved in high-income plans.
Unit trusts have not been the only beneficiaries of the search by savers for
non-cash returns. Investment trusts which, like unit trusts, are collective
funds but which are quoted on the stock market, had their best year for new
issues. If the new Lloyd's trusts are included, the sector raised more than
Pounds 2.1bn. Sales of insurance-linked investment bonds have also increased
sharply; Standard Life recently reported that new investment in such bonds
had doubled between 1992 and 1993.
Investors have also been buying equities direct. According to ProShare, an
organisation set up to encourage wider share ownership, there have been
recent increases in the number of individuals owning shares, the overall
value of their holdings and the percentage of the stock market owned by
private investors.
However, private investors tend to buy shares at the top of the market. The
last peak for private investor interest in equities was in 1987, just before
the global euqities crash. In part, this is inevitable. The sudden arrival
of new money is the very thing that creates a bull market.
But the industry hopes that this market will be different. Mrs Mary Blair,
product development director of Fidelity, a leading unit trust group, says
that in 1993 the company's best-seller was its High Income fund, which has a
conservative mixture of bonds and shares. In 1987, she recalls, it was the
aggressive equity funds, often concentrated on the Far East, which attracted
most private investor interest.
Mrs Blair also cites developments in the US, where interest rates have been
low for the past three years, and money has continued to flow into mutual
funds, the US equivalent of unit trusts, at the rate of Dollars 1bn a day.
This 'weight of money' has supported share prices, despite high valuations
in historical terms.
The same process could occur in the UK, which has much lower levels of
ownership of unit trusts and shares than the US. Mrs Blair hopes the next
few years could see a breakthrough into US-style ownership.
Meanwhile, Mr Bold is congratulating himself on his foresight in 1993 and is
rather attracted by emerging markets (and in particular, China) this year.
Mr Cautious feels the bull market has already run too far, and it is too
late to invest in shares. But perhaps the government's Granny Bond, due out
this month, might not be too risky.

<TEXT>
Sir, Am I alone in feeling that the decision to change the premium bond
prize structure is likely to be counter-productive ('Top bond prize will
rise to Pounds 1m', December 17). Certainly my reason for holding premium
bonds is so that I have some chance of winning an amount of cash which,
while it will not dramatically change my life, would be sufficient to
improve the lifestyle of my family.
As far as I am concerned National Savings should increase the number of
Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 50,000 prizes rather than reduce them in order to
produce a 'millionaire' winner as a marketing gimmick to compete with the
pools and the national lottery. Surely National Savings could fund a 'unique
selling point' which would attract people such as myself who, strangely
enough, do not want to be millionaires.

Sir, The answer must be Yes to your question 'Would Britain's national
lottery raise more money for good causes if it gave its profits to charities
rather than to shareholders?' (leading article, December 20).
The lottery will achieve greater popularity if, like almost every other
lottery in the world, it is seen to run entirely for the benefit of the
community. The lottery should be run to provide maximum money for good
causes, rather than to line the pockets of the companies selected to operate
the events. Should Lord Young and Richard Branson be the successful bidders,
their business achievement and that of their colleagues is a guarantee that
it will be run professionally.
If their bid is not selected, opportunity should be given to another group
offering non-profit-making services.

<TEXT>
The Crash of '94 - the phrase does, you have to admit, have a certain ring
about it. The past 12 months have seen stock and bond markets around the
world respond with equal euphoria to news both good and bad. Stockbrokers
have repeatedly revised upwards their targets for equity markets, then
upgraded their corporate earnings forecasts to make sense of the new peaks
that they expect the markets to scale. The retail investor is back with a
vengeance on both sides of the Atlantic. And the scramble for shares in the
City this week was almost as frenetic as the sales in the West End
department stores.
When people appear to think that the supply of equities is about to run out,
at the end of a month in which Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky has talked of
deploying Russia's nuclear arsenal, it is clearly time to ask whether the
whole financial house is about to come tumbling down.
The one part of the markets' thinking that is hard to argue with at this
point concerns the short-term case for bonds. After the inflationary
excesses of the 1960s and 1970s, and the financial liberalisation of the
1980s, the world is clearly changing financial gear. Disinflation, which is
what bond market euphoria is all about, is not merely a reflection of
cyclical factors like recession. Apart from Japan, which starts from a
position of budgetary strength, the leading industrialised countries have
all embarked on varying degrees of fiscal retrenchment.
Equally important, competition from low-wage developing countries is
imposing downward pressure on prices in the developed world. In the
tradeable goods sectors of the G7 nations, the ability of workers to demand
increased pay and of companies to increase profit margins is severely
constrained. The completion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt will ensure
that the downward pressure on prices of tradeable goods will increase rather
than decrease over the rest of the decade.
Astonishing fall
These structural changes, taken against the background of a sluggish
recovery in which the world's economies have been moving in divergent
directions, provide the explanation for an astonishing fall in both nominal
and real bond yields. Over the past year, if British index-linked gilts are
any guide to the global trend (which seems plausible enough in an
increasingly global market), real bond yields have fallen by around a full
percentage point to just under 3 per cent - a figure that is back in line
with the kind of rates that used to prevail in the days of the gold
standard.
The story is undoubtedly a good one for bonds. But it is pretty long in the
tooth by now, especially in the US. There, economic growth has been
relatively strong and the gap between actual and potential output is
expected to disappear. That would point to inflationary bottlenecks - and a
red alert at the Fed.
Elsewhere, including the UK, the bond market surge probably has further to
run. But it is important to remember that inflation has not been abolished -
witness Russia's year-on-year inflation of close to 900 per cent. It has
only been stopped in countries with credible governments that the markets
trust. It remains to be seen whether those like Italy and Belgium, facing
great political challenges as well as huge historic burdens of debt, will
live up to market expectations. And as the rest of the world outside the US
starts to recover, the demand for global capital will increase, which could
bring upward pressure on real bond yields.
Depressing influence
The more puzzling part of the market equation concerns equities. Many of the
stories that have been good for bonds, such as fiscal retrenchment and the
downward pressure on corporate profit margins, ought to have had a
depressing influence on equity prices. But not in the event. The simplest
explanation is the practical one. When bank deposits yield a zero income in
real terms, as in the US, investors respond by stampeding into securities in
order to generate higher real returns. The risk with a money-driven market
of this kind is that it can lose touch with reality and turn into a bubble.
By historic standards, the yield on equities in the US and Europe is at the
very low end of the spectrum. Yet low dividend yields look less frightening
when measured against real bond yields. For a tax exempt investor in the UK,
a yield of 3.4 per cent, taken together with almost any assumption about
economic growth, does not look so demanding against a 2.9 per cent real bond
yield. A 2.7 per cent yield in US equities is another matter, especially as
the Federal Reserve will probably have to raise short-term interest rates
this year to deal with incipient inflationary pressure. This could frighten
the former depositors, who have helped create a bubble via mutual fund
investment in equities. The worry for European investors is that US capital
outflows have now become so important that European equities could be caught
in any backwash.
That is not to say that UK equities will not go higher in the New Year. But
it does mean that private investors should now be adopting a much more
cautious stance.

In any sane society, house price inflation would be regarded as particularly
malign, since shelter is, after food, the most essential of goods. Equally,
falling prices would be viewed with delight. UK nominal house prices fell,
on average, by about 15 per cent between mid-1989 and early 1993, while the
ratio of house prices to earnings is at levels last seen in 1985. Is joy
breaking out? Alas, no.
The reason for the despondency is not hard to find, Houses are not merely
nests; they are nest eggs. In the UK, 68 per cent of housing is in
owner-occupation. At the end of 1992, net housing wealth was almost a third
of the net wealth of the personal sector, even after three years of
declining prices. No wonder millions of owner-occupiers pray for the return
of house price inflation. Fortunately, they are unlikely to get what they
want, at least in the near future.
This sounds hard-hearted, particularly when many still suffer from the new
disease of negative equity. Fortunately, even the very modest price increase
of 2 per cent estimated by the Halifax Building Society for 1993 has reduced
the number of victims quite sharply. Recently, the Bank of England has
calculated that negative equity afflicted 1.2m households at the end of the
third quarter of 1993, down from 1.8m at the end of the first quarter. The
value of negative equity also fell, from Pounds 11.7bn to Pounds 7.3bn. This
suggests that the 5 per cent price increase forecast by the Halifax for 1994
might reduce the numbers affected considerably.
Hapless victims
In any case, these people are the hapless victims, not of the inevitable
price adjustment of 1989-92, but of the period beforehand, when house prices
rose some two and a half times. The British middle classes had to learn that
buying a bigger house than they could afford and borrowing close to 100 per
cent of its value was not the best way to become rich. The lesson was
brutal, as such lessons tend to be. It fell not on the beneficiaries of
house price inflation but on their children. But they at least must have
learned their lesson.
Or have they? Within 20 years the UK has had two house price surges, in
1971-74 and again in 1985-89, along with a mini-surge between 1978 and 1980.
What is to prevent another one? In the short run, painful memories should do
the trick. Over the long term, people must believe that the authorities
would not permit another inflationary burst.
Price correction
This confidence will not be easy to sustain, since some price correction is
unavoidable after the recent decline. If prices rise faster than nominal
interest rates, even cautious buyers may feel forced to jump into the
market. As prices rise, negative equity will also diminish quite rapidly.
The value of negative equity is, in any case, only about 1 per cent of the
net value of the housing stock. Also important will be the combination of
low rates of interest on deposits with the rampaging bull market in
financial assets. People will seek other investments, with property standing
out for its cheapness.
What does this mean for the authorities? It means they should be on their
guard. They should become nervous if house prices rise faster than interest
rates for a lengthy time. They should feel panic if housing-related credit
starts to expand rapidly. And if the next cut in the base rate of interest
were to come after this year's round of annual mortgage interest
adjustments, they should feel rather pleased.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Window on the world: Many of the predictions made for 1993
proved accurate, if rather safe, bets. Answering the most important
questions for this year, FT writers do not expect a great upheaval in global
fortunes - but some economic and political changes may be positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
How well did FT writers forecast events in 1993? Quite well, it appears.
Martin Wolf decried the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development's December 1992 forecast of 2.3 per cent for Japanese economic
growth and 1.2 per cent for German growth in 1993. He predicted, instead,
that the former would grow very little and the latter contract. Even he was
optimistic. He also forecast the collapse of the old European exchange rate
mechanism into a narrow D-Mark zone, with floating rates among the leading
European currencies. That is what happened, with the ERM reduced to a link
between the Netherlands and Germany. His January 1992 forecast that the
Uruguay Round would succeed came true, a year late.
Edward Mortimer argued that there would be no peace in the Balkans, but
assumed - too optimistically - that 'the international community' would
never accept a Serb victory de jure. Jurek Martin was bullish on Mr
Clinton's ability to get things done, rightly so. Philip Stephens said John
Major would still be UK prime minister at the end of 1993, while Lionel
Barber assumed the Maastricht treaty would be ratified. As for peace in the
Middle East, Hugh Carnegy noted, correctly, that awareness of the narrowing
'window of opportunity' might spur a breakthrough.
John Lloyd thought that the Russian economy would get worse; Stephen Fidler
that Brazil would remain a country with potential it fails to achieve; and
Alexander Nicoll that Chinese economic reform would endure. Safe bets all,
they remain so for 1994.
So how will 1994 turn out?
WILL MARKETS CRASH?
John Plender writes: With financial markets still adjusting to powerful
disinflationary forces in the global economy, bonds will bubble on and up in
the first half of 1994. But not in the US, where recovery is well advanced
and the gap between actual and potential output - a key indicator of
inflationary pressure in the economy - is disappearing. The question for
world equity markets is how fiercely the Federal Reserve twitches in
response. A big rise in short-term interest rates could precipitate the
Crash of '94.
A more likely outcome is a cautious tightening of policy which initially
fails to dent the equity euphoria. The bump will then come if and when the
Fed's action is perceived as too little, too late. Equities in most markets
are expensive by historic standards and will look much cheaper at some point
in the next 18 months, even if a few ounces of capital gain remain to be
squeezed out in the short term. Best defensive bet: UK commercial property,
where yields are still at historically high levels. Wild cards that could
bring a premature end to the equity party: Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Kim Il Sung
and their like, who yearn to play with nuclear toys.
WILL THE ERM BE BACK IN NARROW BANDS?
Martin Wolf writes: No, but it should at least be feasible. What destroyed
the credibility of the old narrow-band ERM was the inappropriate monetary
policies it imposed upon most member states. The price paid for that lack of
credibility were the high interest rate premiums that had to be paid on
weaker currencies. Once the European economy returns to steady growth, which
should begin this year, fixed exchange rates should become more defensible
once more.
Real short-term interest rates remain quite high in the continent. But the
Bundesbank will become increasingly confident that German inflation is on
the way down. Given its determination to restore German monetary
credibility, it will cut short-term interest rates slowly. But the strength
of the disinflationary forces at work in Germany should allow rates to go
down a long way. The OECD December forecast that they will be below 4 per
cent in 1995 might even be too cautious.
If so, recovery should be well entrenched by late 1994 or early 1995. It
would then be possible to move back to narrow bands. But it would be more
sensible to retain the present, more flexible system and use it as a jumping
off point for economic and monetary union.
WILL THE EU HAVE MORE MEMBERS BY NEXT YEAR?
Lionel Barber writes: Yes, but not necessarily as many as first planned. Nor
is it certain that Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will enter the
European Union by the agreed target date of January 1 1995.
The enlargement negotiations are proving stickier than first thought, and
public opinion in all the candidate countries remains a mixture of equivocal
and hostile, with the possible exception of Finland. Any effort to speed up
negotiations to meet the March 1 deadline could lead to overhasty
concessions and a backlash at home.
Pencil in success for Finland, Austria and Sweden, but it is still not a
safe bet that all three will be ready by new year 1995. Norway remains the
shakiest candidate, mainly because of its tough demands on oil and fishing.
WHO WILL SUCCEED DELORS?
Lionel Barber writes: Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, remains
front-runner to become European Commission president. He briefly denied he
was a candidate last autumn; but his aim was to avoid accusations that his
Brussels ambitions were blunting Amsterdam's chances of beating Frankfurt in
the race to win the European Monetary Institute.
Mr Lubbers has spent almost 12 years at the top of Dutch politics, he knows
his way round the corridors of power in Europe, and it is time that a
smaller EU state took the top Commission job, according to Buggins's Turn
Rules in Brussels. More important, as a Christian Democrat, Mr Lubbers may
also have German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vote in his pocket.
An upset could come if countries decide they want a more exciting candidate.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, is running hard on the back of
the successful conclusion of the Gatt world trade talks; and it would be
unwise to rule out Mr Peter Sutherland, a former Irish commissioner and
director-general of Gatt.
Other potential contenders include Mr Leo Tindemans, former Belgian prime
minister and currently a Euro-MP; Mr Wilfried Martens, another Belgian prime
minister; and Mr Willy Claes, who impressed as Belgian foreign minister
during the recent Belgian presidency of the EU.
HOW LOW WILL UK BASE RATES GO?
Martin Wolf writes: British base rate will trough at 4-4 1/2 per cent
towards the end of 1994. The further reduction of 1 1/2 percentage points
will be justified by continued disinflation and the sluggishness imparted by
the Pounds 7.9bn in tax increases due in April.
If that were not a good enough reason to lower short-term interest rates,
declining European interest rates will help too. With German short-term
interest rates continuing to decline, the pound is likely to strengthen
against the D-Mark, the last thing Mr Kenneth Clarke will want to see. As
the gap between US and European rates of interest shrinks, the dollar is
likely to strengthen too, which would also help the UK economy.
Lower base rates may help both the economy and the great British borrowing
classes, but they also punish depositors. Higher taxes on those in work,
alongside still lower interest rates for those in retirement, will sadden
the hearts of Tory voters and politicians.
HOW WILL THE UK CONSERVATIVE PARTY FARE?
Philip Stephens writes: After spending most of 1993 locked in virtual civil
war, there are signs it has remembered it is the party of government, not
opposition. But the lesson of this government has been never to assume the
recent past is a guide to the near future. John Major's grip on 10 Downing
Street remains far from certain. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is waiting
in the wings should the prime minister stumble.
WILL THE JAPANESE ECONOMY RECOVER?
Robert Thomson writes: Probably not. For the last two years, the Japanese
government has predicted that economic recovery is a few months away, but
the passing of each month has brought a continuing deterioration in
corporate profits. Recovery is still, officially, a few months away, but
bureaucrats at the finance and trade ministries fear that the economy is on
the brink of a new downturn, perhaps triggered by workforce reductions.
There are positive signs. Housing starts are on the rise and the yen has
weakened by 11 per cent since August, when it edged close to Y100 to the
dollar. But the strong yen encouraged fresh investment in other east Asian
countries, where labour costs are lower. The Japan Research Institute
estimates that the transfer of production overseas will mean 1.1m fewer jobs
within Japan over the next five years.
Bank of Japan officials say the two most important indicators of a recovery
will be consumer confidence, weighed down by concerns about job security,
and capital investment, shrinking because most manufacturers are attempting
to reduce production capacity at home. If the coalition government crumbles
and an election produces another unstable alliance, consumer and corporate
confidence will be further undermined.
Most private forecasts for the fiscal year beginning in April are rather
gloomy. Nomura Research Institute expects the economy to contract by 0.4 per
cent, Nippon Life Insurance forecasts zero growth, and the Bank of Tokyo
predicts an expansion of 0.4 per cent. To complete the gloomy picture, the
Daiwa Research Institute expects corporate profits to fall for a fifth
consecutive year.
WILL ZHIRINOVSKY FIND MORE SUCCESS?
John Lloyd writes: This will be a difficult year for Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Success came rapidly at Russia's December elections, but afterwards he did
everything wrong. He posed as a moderate, but slipped and threatened to use
nuclear weapons on Japan and Germany. Having insisted he really was a
Liberal Democrat, he revealed that his main ally was Dr Gerard Frey, leader
of the far-right German People's Union. He claimed cabinet posts, then said
he would lead the opposition.
Russian politics are messy but have limits: unless he shows some sense of
what to do with his victory in the polls - and it was a victory - he will
fall. However, the disaffection which gave him that victory may find a
better vehicle.
WILL WAR END IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA?
Edward Mortimer writes: An overall peace settlement is unlikely. Although
there is great war-weariness, there are also burning grievances and intense
mutual mistrust. Winners (so far mainly the Serbs) are unwilling to purchase
peace by giving up territory gained. Losers (especially the Bosnian
government) still see more hope of regaining something by war than by
negotiations. As for the 'international community', its inability to mediate
and unwillingness to impose peace have been amply demonstrated.
Serbia would like peace, to get rid of sanctions, but it no longer controls
(if it ever did) either the Serbs of Bosnia or those of Croatia. Fighting in
Bosnia might gradually wind down, if Moslems have captured as much territory
from Croats, and Serbs from Moslems, as they can reasonably hope for. But
any truce will be unstable, because the Moslems will not have a viable
territory and will be on the look-out for chances to regain some of what
they have lost. At worst, Sarajevo may fall to Serbs or be partitioned, with
attendant atrocities.
Fighting may resume in Croatia, whose government will want to prevent Serbs
from consolidating de facto 'independence' in occupied areas. And the fact
that war did not break out in Kosovo in 1993 does not mean it will not in
1994.
WILL FIDEL CASTRO SURVIVE?
Stephen Fidler writes: Probably. Castro's position as Cuban leader has
weakened significantly as the economy has sunk since the loss of Soviet aid.
The economy may in 1993 have turned the corner after a severe slump, but not
enough to quell popular dissatisfaction over the economic hardship being
suffered. The government's grip over the country has also been loosening as
it has moved reluctantly to reform its economy. Some of the reforms, in
particular the legalisation of the dollar, are accentuating divisions in
society.
But it is hard to see how resultant dissatisfaction could develop into a
force strong enough to overturn Castro's government, which has been skilful
in targeting the internal groups around which opposition could coalesce. And
though many Cubans may be disenchanted with Castro, there is widespread
dislike of the expatriate opposition groups centred on Miami.
Cuban officials have been suggesting one-man rule is giving way to a more
collective form of administration. But this will probably make little
difference to the US embargo, which - by allowing him to blame Washington
for the country's troubles - may be Castro's greatest prop. The betting must
be on Castro to remain el lider maximo through 1994.
WILL CLINTON CONCENTRATE ON DOMESTIC POLICIES?
Jurek Martin writes: Yes and no. Nothing matters to him more than healthcare
reform. Universal coverage will not be in place a year from now - even if he
had things all his own way, it would not properly kick in until 1998 - but
he must have a partial legislative victory in place before November's
midterm elections to have a chance of finishing the job in 1995. The battle
in Congress could be daunting, especially with Republicans expecting gains
in the midterms.
Also on a heavy domestic agenda are education and worker training
programmes, welfare reform and that most divisive of political issues, gun
control. As last year, he may win more than he loses if he can amass the
right coalitions again, but healthcare is the 'big one', requiring maximum
endeavour and with current odds barely in his favour.
That said, Mr Clinton has a Bush-like travel schedule in 1994, after going
abroad only twice last year. No fewer than four European trips are planned:
in January, to Brussels (for Nato), Prague, Moscow and Minsk, and Geneva
(for Assad of Syria); in June, for the 50th anniversary of the Normandy
landings; in July, to Italy for the G7; and in November, to Budapest for the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. He will also attend the
next Apec summit in Indonesia at a date still to be fixed. The summit with
South American leaders will, at least, be in Washington.
If 'being there' is any guide, and with foreign policy problems far more
intrinsically important than Haiti and Somalia looming, he will do well to
keep even half his eclectic mind on the home hearth.
WILL HONG KONG'S ECONOMY BE DAMAGED?
Alexander Nicoll writes: Hong Kong's financial markets appeared in 1993 to
be oblivious to the deadlock between Britain and China over electoral reform
proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor. They are operating as though the
territory is already part of China - of which it will be a Special
Administrative Region from mid-1997. Logic suggests that China, with an
enormous financial stake in Hong Kong's prosperity, will not act to
undermine it - but logic may not always overcome the passions which Hong
Kong stirs in Beijing.
Although Mr Patten's proposals are now destined for anguished debate in Hong
Kong's Legislative Council, it seems likely that the economy will march on
for the time being regardless of bitterness between the present and future
patrons. If Sino-British talks on the practical details of the handover do
not speed up, however, the transition may be bumpy, which could affect the
economy.
Whether the economy will be harmed in the longer term by failure to advance
democracy depends on whether Mr Patten is right to contend that basic
freedoms underpin Hong Kong's economic success. In any case, its economic
performance is increasingly bound up with China's, and thus with whether
Beijing can slow its own economic boom without resorting to severe austerity
measures.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Modest growth in accounting is forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British accountancy firms can expect their performance to increase only very
modestly over the coming year, according to a briefing paper from the
economics department of Barclays Bank released yesterday.
Growing competition and a stagnant market make the prospects 'unpromising'
for both larger and smaller firms, the briefing warns.
It estimates that the work performed by accountants declined in 1992 and
1993 back to the level of 1990. It forecasts the profession will only see
growth of 2 per cent in 1994.
It highlights the fact that just four of the top 20 firms increased fee
income in 1992-93, with audit, tax and consultancy work suffering most.
Fee income and profit margins declined as a result of excess capacity and
the growing trend of clients to put work out to tender.
Small and medium-sized firms suffered disproportionately because they are
more dependent on audit and tax work and do not have much income from
insolvency. They have also lost market share during the recession to the
larger firms.
The briefing argues that most smaller firms have also been unable to adjust
their costs in line with declining fees because any fall in staffing would
damage quality.
It warns that prospects of growth are low because clients' expectations are
now firmly geared to competitively-priced audit services for the first time.
In addition, it says that the larger firms are intent on undercutting their
rivals in an attempt to gain a footing to supply other high margin services.
Insolvency work is likely to tail off in line with the recent decline in the
number of receiverships, and there is the prospect for only a modest revival
in consultancy work during the year.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Ministers aim to save fish policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is seeking an urgent meeting with the European Commission in
the new year to try to salvage its fisheries conservation policy after being
forced to suspend its unpopular scheme limiting the time vessels can spend
at sea.
Ministers will ask Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, what
alternatives would be acceptable to enable the government to meet its
commitment to reduce UK fishing fleet capacity by 19 per cent by the end of
1996.
Government policy has been left in disarray by the High Court decision last
month to refer to the European Court a challenge by fishermen to the
'days-at-sea' restrictions.
The restrictions had been due to come into force today. But the government,
acknowledging that the court's move cast legal doubt on the operation of the
scheme, has suspended its introduction until the European Court judgment.
This usually involves a long wait and Britain will be asking the commission
to speed things up.
Ministers may also ask the commission to allow a delay in the 1996 deadline
for achieving fleet capacity cuts, arguing that their hands are tied by the
court case.
The restrictions, the cornerstone of the government's programme, were
designed to achieve up to 8.5 per cent of the overall cut, with a Pounds 25m
decommissioning programme and tighter licensing of vessels accounting for
the rest.
Fishermen, jubilant at what they see as a victory over the government, want
ministers to adopt their package of 'technical' conservation measures
instead.
These include larger mesh sizes to allow young fish to escape, and closing
some areas to fishing when spawning is taking place.
But government scientists doubt they would be enough to cut overfishing of
endangered stocks.
The European Commission has also been sceptical about whether such measures
are effective in the European-wide effort to reduce capacity.
Ministers are outwardly confident the European Court will back its
days-at-sea policy.
A way out of the government's quandary, hinted at by ministers, would be for
the European Commission to adopt EU-wide restrictions on time at sea.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Anger stalks a scarred town: Gillian Tett finds deepening
disappointment in Enniskillen at the premiers' peace initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old man in a flat cap sat at the dimly lit bar in the Northern Ireland
town of Enniskillen and muttered angrily: 'Forget this peace declaration,
those provos are going to come and blow us all up now.'
'Hey Jack]' chided his neighbour, looking nervously around the room where
both Catholic and Protestant groups were drinking. 'Let's talk about the
weather instead]'
The disquiet may be expressed in hushed mutters, but there is a palpable
sense of disappointment in Enniskillen, the town devastated by an IRA bomb
which killed 11 and wounded 63 on Remembrance Sunday in 1987.
For the last three weeks the 11,000-strong population, which is split fairly
evenly between Catholics and Protestants, has watched the waiting game being
played by the British government and the IRA.
And with Thursday's murder of a British soldier now dominating the local
news, attitudes across the town, which is 15 miles from the border with the
Republic, are hardening. Mr Raymond Ferguson, a lawyer and Ulster Unionist
party councillor, is already predicting a new onslaught of violence.
Although he represents the largest and most moderate of the unionist parties
 -and accepts last month's Anglo-Irish declaration - he feels increasingly
angry.
'The British government has made a huge blunder in being involved in this
so-called peace declaration,' he said. 'They are just boosting the morale of
the IRA.'
Across the town, activists in Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, are
reluctant to talk, even though they once won a by-election in the town and
now hold three of the 23 seats in the local council.
Mr Gerry McHugh, a Sinn Fein councillor, said: 'The people here don't see
much in the declaration - they're just really confused . . . with Major
saying one thing and Reynolds another.'
The comments seem particularly poignant as Enniskillen seems more prepared
for peace than many towns in Ulster. The Remembrance Day bomb prompted a
wave of anti-IRA feeling which allowed the Ulster Unionists to gain control
of the local parliamentary seat. On a local level relations between the two
communities are not bad. In the centre of the town a Catholic, Protestant
and Methodist church stand side by side. Meanwhile, the trauma of the 1987
bomb has spawned a clutch of community initiatives to push towards peace.
The Rev David Cupples, minister of the Presbyterian Church, believes that
most of his congregation are still 'hoping against hope' that the peace
initiative will be salvaged. But he admits that it will be difficult for
many to accept any initiative which appears to reward IRA violence. 'The
hurts are very deep here,' he said.
But after 25 years of continual violence, the danger in a town such as
Enniskillen is that terrorist activities already seem normal. Mr Chris
Donegan, a senior journalist on a local paper, said they breed a mood of
cynicism among many. The Impartial Reporter tries to be independent - a
tolerance which Mr Donegan demonstrates by pointing to the one Catholic on
its staff. But the existence of another, Catholic-dominated newspaper is
evidence of the lingering tensions in the town, which for many have become
normal.
'It's gone on for 25 years and people feel it could go on for 25 more -
there is almost this sense of an acceptable level of violence,' he said.
With most residents agreeing that the media hype that accompanied the
declaration did not match attitudes on the ground, Father Patrick McGinn, a
Catholic priest, believes the best hope for peace in the new year is for the
media comment to subside.
'You can build up a false sense of hope - and a false sense of the divisions
here,' he said.
'The people in this church and the one across the road are not so far away
really. We just need the hope and divisions to be toned down.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Major defends tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major said yesterday that the government had to raise taxes and cut
spending to ensure that the recovery would last.
In his new year message, the prime minister predicted that unemployment
would continue to fall as the recovery gathered speed. But he said he had to
raise taxes because his overriding objective was 'sound finances', otherwise
the recovery would be built on sand.
'The Conservative party remains the party of the lowest possible tax and the
only party whose instinct is to cut tax and leave money with individuals and
families and not take it for the state,' he said. 'We raise taxes only when
we have to.'
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said Mr Major's message
deserved action under the Trades Descriptions Act: 'The party which has
given us the biggest-ever tax increases claims to be the party of low
taxation.'
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said people would face higher taxes and higher
bills in 1994. 'A typical family will have to pay Pounds 10 a week more in
tax by the end of the year when all the new taxes come into effect,' he
said. 'This extra burden of tax will rise to Pounds 16 a week more in April
1995.'
In his new year message, Mr Smith warned that as many as 95 per cent of
households would be worse off next year because of higher taxes.
Mr Major stressed that the joint declaration on Ulster that he signed with
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, made clear that the majority
in Ulster would decide whether they wanted to remain within the UK.
He also sent a message to the terrorists: 'If you lay down your arms - and
prove you mean it - then the way will begin to open for Sinn Fein (the
political wing of the IRA) to come to the negotiating table. We have thrown
down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus is on Sinn Fein to pick it up.'
Mr Major concluded by underlining the importance he attaches to the European
elections in June.
'The European parliament matters to the future of Europe,' he said. 'So the
elections matter to us. That is why we must fight them to win.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Sniper rifle is sold in US shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the weapons which IRA snipers are believed to be using near the
border with the Irish Republic - a Barrett Light Fifty rifle - is freely
available on the US market at a basic price of Dollars 6,750 (Pounds 4,560).
The weapon poses a serious tactical challenge to those of the 10,000
security forces personnel in the province who operate in the so-called
'bandit country' near the border. Security sources say the killing by a
sniper of a British soldier on Thursday has underlined how the IRA use
suprise to defy the heavy military presence in the area.
Names such as 'black widow' and 'Goldfinger' are being bandied about in
order to perpetuate the notion of IRA invincibility.
Mr Ian Hogg, editor of Jane's Infantry Weapons, said yesterday that the
rifle was used widely by US police and soldiers. The manufacturers claim
that it is accurate up to 1,400 yards.
The soldier was the ninth member of the security forces to be killed by a
single shot from a sniper since August 1992.
Forensic examinations have established that most of the attacks have
involved a large-calibre weapon using an armour-piercing bullet fired at
long range. No sniper has been detected by the army's control towers in the
border area.
The army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary insist there is no evidence to
suggest that all the killings were the work of one person.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Pounds 900m corporate boost for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has attracted more than Pounds 900m from investors taking
advantage of the first chance in the insurance market's 305-year history to
be protected by limited liability.
Twenty-five 'corporate members' backed by institutional and private money
will be able to contribute Pounds 1.6bn in capacity for the 1994
underwriting year, Lloyd's said yesterday.
It added that resignations by Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market - are expected to be less than half the
number this year than last.
The figures suggest that Lloyd's may be able to offer total underwriting
capacity for 1994 of Pounds 10bn compared with Pounds 8.8bn last year. Final
numbers will be prepared by the end of next week.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said corporate capital would allow Lloyd's to
take advantage of 'greatly improved trading prospects' and enhance the
professional standards of the market.
The corporate money has been generated following recommendations in a
radical business plan published by Lloyd's last April to introduce corporate
capital without the requirement of unlimited liability imposed on individual
members in the past. The amount supplied is towards the upper end of Lloyd's
estimates of Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn.
Under the rules of the scheme, members can underwrite twice the level of
capital they hold. Only about Pounds 800m of the Pounds 904m raised will be
pledged in 1994, giving a total underwriting capacity of Pounds 1.6bn.
The shortfall reflects money for which there was no room on preferred
syndicates, held back for the 1995 year and to pay the management and
administration expenses of the corporate vehicles.
The corporate members include 12 quoted investment trusts which have raised
a total of Pounds 804m in capital, with Pounds 280m coming from London
Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit) alone.
Nine private corporate vehicles have raised Pounds 87m, with Pounds 27m from
Lomond, formerly Murray Underwriting, and just Pounds 1.5m from each of the
two smallest vehicles. Four further corporate members will supply a further
Pounds 13m. A number of other corporate members were marketed during the
autumn but collapsed through lack of support.
Provisional estimates show that just 958 Names have resigned and will not be
underwriting in 1994 compared with 2,308 one year ago. This leaves 19,537
active underwriting Names for the year.
The increase in total underwriting capacity reflects a combination of lower
resignations, and the introduction of both corporate capital and Members'
Agents Pooling Arrangements, which spread the commitments of Names more
widely across syndicates.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Better-off more worried about losing their jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People in high-risk groups for unemployment, such as young males and council
tenants, are less concerned about losing their jobs than those in safer
groups such as middle-aged southerners with mortgages.
According to an analysis of MORI interviews with 9,000 adults between April
and December, young people aged 18 to 24 are heavily over-represented among
the unemployed, forming 34 per cent of the total, but only 20 per cent say
they are 'very concerned' about being made redundant.
Conversely, the interviews show that 35 to 44-year-olds with housing and
child-rearing commitments are considerably less likely to be unemployed,
forming only 11 per cent of the total - yet 23 per cent of them are 'very
concerned' about losing their jobs.
In the south of England, with 34 per cent of the unemployment total, 44 per
cent of people said they were worried about unemployment, compared with only
22 per cent in the north, which contributes 31 per cent to the unemployment
total.
Council tenants form 42 per cent of the unemployed, but only 15 per cent say
they are 'very concerned' about losing their jobs. Mortgage payers on the
other hand form only 28 per cent of the unemployed but 64 per cent are 'very
concerned' at being made redundant.
Social classes DE, the semi-skilled and unskilled, form 66 per cent of the
unemployed but only 25 per cent fear redundancy. Social class C2, skilled
manual workers, form only 16 per cent of the unemployed but 38 per cent are
very concerned about job loss.
'What we find in general terms is that fear seems to follow the pattern of
employment, rather than unemployment,' said Mr Simon Braunholtz of MORI, who
carried out the analysis for Industrial Relations Services.
'This suggests that either those in the high risk categories feel it
'couldn't happen to me' or are hardened to the possibility of unemployment
by past experience or peer group experience,' he said.
For the low-risk groups it is evidently financial commitments which drives
their fears, so an upturn in the economy could in theory substantially
reduce anxiety without producing any important change in their likelihood of
becoming unemployed.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Government seeks to salvage fishing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is seeking an urgent meeting with the European Commission in
the new year to try to salvage its fisheries conservation policy after being
forced to suspend its unpopular scheme limiting the time vessels can spend
at sea.
Ministers will ask Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, what
alternatives would be acceptable to enable the government to meet its
commitment to reduce UK fishing fleet capacity by 19 per cent by the end of
1996.
Government policy has been left in disarray by the High Court decision last
month to refer to the European Court a challenge by fishermen to the
'days-at-sea' restrictions.
The restrictions had been due to come into force today. But the government,
acknowledging that the court's move cast legal doubt on the operation of the
scheme, has suspended its introduction until the European Court judgment.
This usually involves a long wait and Britain will be asking the commission
to speed things up.
Ministers may also ask the commission to allow a delay in the 1996 deadline
for achieving fleet capacity cuts, arguing that their hands are tied by the
court case.
The restrictions, the cornerstone of the government's programme, were
designed to achieve up to 8.5 per cent of the overall cut, with a Pounds 25m
decommissioning programme and tighter licensing of vessels accounting for
the rest.
Fishermen, jubilant at what they see as a victory over the government, want
ministers to adopt their package of 'technical' conservation measures
instead.
These include larger mesh sizes to allow young fish to escape, and closing
some areas to fishing when spawning is taking place.
Mr David Pessel, a Plymouth fisherman and an executive member of the
National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations which brought the High
Court action, said such measures, unlike the days at sea limits, 'directly
aid conservation of fish stocks'.
But government scientists doubt they would be enough to cut overfishing of
endangered stocks.
The European Commission has also been sceptical about whether such measures
are effective in the European-wide effort to reduce capacity.
Ministers are outwardly confident the European Court will back its
days-at-sea policy. But Mr Pessel, who helped organise a blockade of
Plymouth harbour and a demonstration in London, said: 'We believe the
days-at-sea issue is stone dead. If they ever did try to resurrect it, we
can assure them they'd face the same scenario.'
A way out of the government's quandary, hinted at by ministers, would be for
the European Commission to adopt EU-wide restrictions on time at sea.
Mr Pessel said: 'If it was genuinely enforceable and fair, I don't think
anybody could argue against it.'

FT  01 JAN 94 / Travel agencies extend price-cut campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three largest travel agency chains are to continue their price-cutting
campaign for a further week amid signs that the surge in holiday bookings
has ended.
Lunn Poly, Going Places and Thomas Cook all said yesterday that they would
extend their 11 per cent discounts on summer 1994 holidays until January 8.
The three chains launched their 11 per cent discounts immediately after
Christmas. Travel agents said yesterday, however, that the level of bookings
last week had been no higher than in the equivalent period a year ago.
Thomas Cook said it estimated that 200,000 holidays for this summer were
sold last week by travel agents, about the same level as in the
post-Christmas period last year.
Mr Kevin Welch, marketing director of Going Places, consisting of the former
Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel chains, said: 'Last week's trading has
been excellent, exceeding our expectations. Most branches have also seen an
exceptionally high brochure pick-up, which augurs well for future bookings.'
In contrast, Thomas Cook said: 'The reality is we don't think there's been a
dramatic increase on last year. We're seeing the market levelling off.' Lunn
Poly confirmed that booking levels since Christmas had been about the same
as a year ago.
The slowdown in bookings follows a highly successful campaign last autumn to
persuade people to buy their summer 1994 holidays early.
Thomson, the largest tour operator, said it had sold 1m summer holidays by
Christmas - double the number sold by Christmas 1992. Airtours, the second
biggest operator said last month that its summer 1994 sales were up 53 per
cent.
The travel industry accepted that the rate of increase in sales was
unsustainable. Most expect the final tally for summer 1994 sales to be
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent up on 1993.
The travel agents' decision to extend discounting is largely an attempt to
win market share. As an 11 per cent discount cancels out the average
commission most chains do not expect price-cutting to continue for more than
a week.

FT  01 JAN 94 / 'Dictatorial' de Gaulle blamed for EEC crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers ruled out the possibility of continuing negotiations with the
other five European Economic Community partners when France vetoed British
membership in January 1963.
The cabinet was told that the five governments were seriously disturbed by
the 'dictatorial attitude' of President de Gaulle and might be willing to
continue negotiations to embarrass France. But ministers concluded that the
five would not ultimately abandon France in favour of Britain.
On January 14, the day negotiations on Britain's application for membership
resumed in Brussels, President de Gaulle made a public statement opposing
British entry.
Although the negotiations did not formally come to an end for another
fortnight, the cabinet knew from this moment that the British application
was almost certainly doomed. Cabinet minutes show that, after the
president's statement, one of the government's overriding objectives was to
ensure that the French took maximum blame for the failure of the talks.
Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, told the cabinet that de Gaulle's
intervention did not reflect his conviction that the Brussels negotiations
had failed, but his realisation that they were within sight of success. Such
success, said Macmillan, would have been incompatible with de Gaulle's
ultimate purpose of creating a Franco-German alliance to dominate Europe.
De Gaulle, the cabinet was told, had alleged that Britain had made secret
agreements with the US designed to transform the EEC into an Anglo-Saxon
free-trade area.
The minutes make clear the extent to which the government regarded failure
of the EEC application as a serious setback to its policies.
Ministers agreed that they should not abandon the objective of joining the
community, but saw little purpose in seeking to develop a more limited
economic association with the EEC. This, they decided, would not enable
Britain to take part in shaping the community's policies, while probable
French conditions on any such association would be unacceptable.

The British government yesterday gave Sudan until next Tuesday to reverse
its decision to expel Mr Peter Streams, the British ambassador to Khartoum.
Mr Abdurrahman Bakhit, Sudanese charge d'affaires in the UK, was called to
the Foreign Office yesterday and told that the expulsion should be withdrawn
if Sudan valued its relationship with Britain. The expulsion was apparently
provoked by a proposed visit to rebel-held areas in southern Sudan by Dr
George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury.
The Foreign Office said the Sudanese government had been told of Britain's
'profound dissatisfaction and regret' at the expulsion order.
The Foreign Office did not say what measures would be taken if Sudan did not
comply.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Profumo papers remain censored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extent to which the Macmillan government was shaken by the Profumo
affair emerges from the cabinet papers. And sensitivities over the affair
obviously remain - with sections of the papers censored.
John Profumo, the war minister, was challenged about his relationship with
model Christine Keeler by one of prime minister Harold Macmillan's senior
officials weeks before the public first heard of the scandal.
But Profumo - who was to resign from government and parliament on June 5
that year - suggested when he was first confronted that Macmillan need not
be told.
Many of the papers on the affair are missing from the documents - including
three from the prime minister's own files.
The earliest document in the prime minister's files on the affair -
recording a visit to Whitehall officials by someone with information about
the Profumo-Keeler relationship - has seven short sections obliterated from
the released two-page photocopy.
This was clearly done to hide the identity of the informant. The official
who met him on February 1 1963 had promised 'to do his best' to protect the
source of information.
On the same day Macmillan's principal private secretary, TJ Bligh, went to
see Profumo and asked him about the story, warning him of possible newspaper
reports.
'Mr Profumo suggested that I need not bother the prime minister with this at
this stage,' Bligh reported in his note, written on the same day. 'I said
that it seemed to me of great importance to him personally that he should
tell the chief whip without delay.
'If this story was going the rounds and the chief whip got to hear about it
from some other source first, that would be bad for him. Mr Profumo was
grateful for this advice and arranged to see the chief whip on Monday
February 4.'
The affair rose to the top of the cabinet agenda in June when Profumo
resigned his post, confirming one part of the scandal surrounding his
friendship with Stephen Ward, the London osteopath and artist, and Keeler.
Ward, who faced charges of living off immoral earnings, had claimed that the
minister used his flat to meet Keeler. Now Profumo admitted that he had lied
to the Commons in a statement made earlier in the year when he said there
had been 'no impropriety whatsoever'.
While the public feasted on a series of salacious revelations, the cabinet
wrestled with the embarrassing discovery that a member of government had
committed a serious breach of trust in misleading his colleagues and
parliament. The affair was discussed at three cabinet meetings in June.
Ministerial concern was partly focused upon Ward's assertion that he had
been passing information to the security services. The overriding concern,
however, appears to have been the degree to which ministers who had advised
Profumo had acted with 'good judgment and honesty of purpose'.
The minutes concede that public opinion was 'shaken by the disclosure that a
minister of the crown could so far abuse the unique degree of privilege
attaching to a personal statement in parliament as deliberately to mislead
his colleagues in the government and the House of Commons'.
An internal inquiry carried out by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne,
developed into a 'who-knew-what-when' exercise. This was particularly
important because, two years before the Commons statement, Profumo had been
warned to end his association with Ward. The warning, delivered by Sir
Norman Brook in 1961, was issued at the behest of the security services
concerned about Ward's friendship with Captain Eugene Ivanov, the Soviet
assistant naval attache to the UK.
The minutes concur with the conclusion of the subsequent Denning Inquiry
that neither the minister nor the security services had known at that time
about the Keeler connection and that no breach of security had taken place.
Alterations made to Lord Dilhorne's internal report into the affair - after
new evidence emerged - suggest, however, that MI5 might have known more
about Ward than it wanted to disclose. A reference to the security service
possessing 'information' on Ward is deleted from the first draft of the
report without explanation.
The government's initial anxiety was not misplaced. Lord Denning concluded
that the prime minister and his colleagues had not succeeded in dealing with
the widespread public belief that Profumo had committed adultery.

FT  01 JAN 94 / 1963: scandal and an ailing 'Supermac': Official documents
released yesterday under disclosure rules shed light on cabinet machinations
of 30 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

<TEXT>
The year 1963 is often characterised as one when the government seemed to be
running out of steam - even before it was rocked by the Profumo scandal.
Harold Macmillan's Supermac image looked increasingly jaded as the
government stumbled from spy scandals to the French veto on its bid to join
the European Economic Community.
Before the end of 1963 the ailing Macmillan had been replaced as prime
minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who lost the following year's general
election to Labour.
The year is remembered by many for the assassination of President Kennedy
and the great train robbery.
But cabinet documents for 1963, released yesterday at the Public Record
Office - under the rule that they should normally be made public after 30
years - contradict the image of a government that had gone stale. The final
months of the Macmillan years saw a strikingly busy and varied programme of
government activity.
Ministers approved the Beeching plan which led to heavy cuts in the British
Rail network and, with the Buchanan report, took the first steps towards
recognising that unrestrained traffic growth in towns could not continue for
ever.
In spite of the French veto on Britain's application to join the EEC, the
cabinet discussed building the Channel tunnel. Thirty years later the tunnel
is built but, perhaps happily, another potential project of the era is not.
The Macmillan cabinet had ideas for demolishing the Foreign Office in
Whitehall, possibly replacing it with a structure of 'fully contemporary
design'.
At the end of 1963 Reginald Maudling, the chancellor, produced a public
spending white paper - the process of relating public spending plans to
resources in a co-ordinated way was in its infancy then.
Total public expenditure was less than Pounds 11bn, about one-third of
today's health budget, but arguments over controlling its growth would be
familiar to the present cabinet.
Sir Edward Boyle, the education minister, proposed increasing the charge for
school meals from 1s to 1s 3d (about 6p): 'I cannot see any obvious
justification for allowing people to receive, quite irrespective of their
needs, automatic increases in a cash subsidy at a time when real earnings
have risen substantially.'
School meals were discussed at no fewer than four cabinet meetings before
ministers decided against the increase.
The future of former colonies took much of the cabinet's time, and 1963
included the celebrated extradition case of Chief Anthony Enahoro, a
prominent Nigerian accused of plotting a coup d'etat, who was arrested in
London.
The papers released today show that Mr Henry Brooke, the home secretary,
originally decided against returning Enahoro to Nigeria.
This was strongly resisted by Mr Duncan Sandys, Commonwealth secretary, who
argued that loss of the Nigerian government's sympathy and goodwill would
represent a serious diplomatic reverse for Britain.
'I fully appreciate the home secretary's difficulty,' wrote Sandys, 'but
when so much is at stake I trust that every effort will be made to find a
honourable justification for sending Enahoro back to Nigeria.'
Enahoro was subsequently extradited and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Sold down the river for a second bridge: The controversial
means of financing a new Severn crossing to south Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today the toll for cars to cross the Severn Bridge between England and Wales
rises to Pounds 3.40 from Pounds 3.10 - a figure the Royal Automobile Club
has condemned as 'extortionate'. For heavy trucks the toll increases from
Pounds 9.30 to Pounds 10.10.
A small consolation for drivers is that they now have a fine view of where
most of the money goes: the privately-financed Pounds 300m second Severn
crossing.
Three miles downstream from the existing bridge the concrete caissons for
the foundations of the new one, some weighing 2,000 tonnes, straddle the
estuary like stepping stones. In the middle of the channel the two main
pylons are rising at the rate of one metre a day towards their eventual
height of 137m.
Work on the cable-stayed bridge started in April 1992 and is within budget
and on schedule to open in spring 1996. This month the labour force will
increase to nearly 1,000 for what will be the peak year of activity. It is
one of the largest construction projects in Europe and a prime example of
the government's intention to attract more private investment into
infrastructure.
Severn River Crossing, a consortium of John Laing and GTM-Entrepose of
France, is the main contractor, with Bank of America and Barclays de Zoete
Wedd as financial partners.
The consortium took over the existing bridge in 1992 with a concession to
operate both crossings for a maximum of 30 years, after which ownership
reverts to the government. Debt finance to build the new bridge is repaid by
tolls, which are allowed to rise annually by inflation plus 6 per cent until
1996, then by inflation alone.
The new bridge will have three lanes in each direction, a span of nearly 1km
and an overall length, with its viaducts, of more than 5km. A toll plaza of
14 lanes will be built on the Welsh side - the tolls, as with the existing
bridge, will apply only to westbound traffic.
An M4 extension and approach roads to the M5 are being funded by the
Department of Transport. The M4 will be re-routed to the new bridge,
expected to take 60 per cent of the crossing traffic, and the road via the
existing bridge will become the M48.
In the hazardous task of building the new bridge, Laing and GTM have to
contend with a tidal range of more than 12m, the second-highest in the world
after the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. 'The best-read books here are the
tide tables,' says Mr Norman Haste, project director. 'With a high tidal
range you get very strong currents of up to 10 knots. When it is running at
that sort of speed, it is virtually impossible to work on the river.'
There are other difficulties. The estuary almost dries out at low tide,
leaving only a short time for barges to manoeuvre the caissons, which are
pre-cast on either shore. There are also tempestuous winds which regularly
cause problems for high-sided vehicles on the existing bridge. In spite of
the dangers there have been no fatal accidents so far.
Annual traffic on the existing bridge has tripled to 18m vehicles from the
6m when it opened in 1966. Since Severn River Crossing took over running of
the bridge queues have been cut by a combination of the introduction of
one-way tolls, automatic cash payment and electronic tagging to replace
season tickets, and by the impact of the recession.
An undisclosed factor is how many vehicles avoid the tolls by making the
long detour through Gloucestershire, and then enjoy a free return trip
across the Severn.
The RAC argues that high tolls are penalising Welsh small businesses and
that there has been a big increase in trucks avoiding the bridge, 'with a
devastating effect on local communities'. It says the bridge is a 'prime
example to the government of what not to do' when it introduces motorway
tolling.
Severn River Crossing is confident that for most people time will be more
important than money. What the tolls on the new crossing will fail to buy,
however, is a good view. To counter the high winds, there will be 3m-high
screens on both sides of the bridge.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Major defends tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major said yesterday that the government had to raise taxes and cut
spending to ensure that the economic recovery would last.
In his new year message, the prime minister predicted that unemployment
would continue to fall as the recovery gathered speed. But he said he had to
raise taxes because his overriding objective was 'sound finances', otherwise
the recovery would be built on sand.
'The Conservative party remains the party of the lowest possible tax and the
only party whose instinct is to cut tax and leave money with individuals and
families and not take it for the state,' he said. 'We raise taxes only when
we have to. They (opposition parties) raise taxes whenever they want to.'
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the prime
minister's message deserved action under the Trades Descriptions Act: 'The
party which has given us the biggest ever tax increases claims to be the
party of low taxation.'
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said people would face higher taxes and higher
bills in 1994. 'A typical family will have to pay Pounds 10 a week more in
tax by the end of the year when all the new taxes come into effect,' he
said. 'This extra burden of tax will rise to Pounds 16 a week more in April
1995.'
In his new year message, Mr Smith warned that as many as 95 per cent of
households would be worse off next year because of higher taxes.
But Mr Major said it was time for the country to be more confident and said
pessimists should be put 'in their box'.
He went on to stress that the joint declaration on Ulster that he signed
with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, made clear that the
majority in Northern Ireland would decide whether they wanted to remain
within the UK.
'The choice is for them alone,' he said. 'But one thing is certain: so long
as they want to be part of the union, they have a rock solid constitutional
guarantee that they can do so.'
However, he sent a message to the men of violence: 'If you lay down your
arms - and prove you mean it - then the way will begin to open for Sinn Fein
(the political wing of the IRA) to come to the negotiating table.
'We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus is on Sinn Fein
to pick it up. There is no excuse and no justification for them not to
choose the path to democracy.'
Mr Major concluded by underlining the importance he attaches to the European
elections in June.
'The European Parliament matters to the future of Europe,' he said. 'So the
elections matter to us. That is why we must fight them to win'.
Companies should 'make exporting a way of life' in 1994, Mr Peter Morgan,
director-general of the Institute of Directors, said in a new year message
to members.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said in his new year message that
prospects for the coming 12 months were more hopeful than at the end of
1992.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Doubt cast on PM's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harold Macmillan may have been calculating his resignation as prime minister
earlier than it appeared when he was suddenly admitted to hospital in
October 1965.
An unsigned and undated draft letter from Macmillan to 'Rab' Butler, the
foreign secretary, marked 'not sent', shows that the prime minister had made
up his mind to resign before entering hospital.
Newspapers at the time were told that a decision on his future depended on
the outcome of the operation - but the letter indicates that the prime
minister had already made his decision.
It says: 'As you know I am going into hospital for some weeks to have an
operation for prostate trouble. This blow to my health has made me decide
that I should, when I am well enough to see the Queen, resign my position as
prime minister and leader of the party.
'I do not propose to announce this decision at this stage. But I should be
grateful if you and any members whom you care to consult would decide how
best to apply this decision to resolving the problems which we have
discussed, both in relation to the party conference at Blackpool and the
succession.'
The fact that the letter was never sent lends support to the conviction that
Macmillan deliberately undermined Butler's ambitions to succeed him. Why it
was written at all and who drafted it remain unclear.

The US and North Korea are reported to have made substantial progress in
talks to defuse tension over the latter's nuclear arms programme, Jurek
Martin writes from Washington.
Reflecting guarded optimism in Washington, the State Department said the US
had 'moved closer' to its goal of opening the North's nuclear facilities to
International Atomic Energy Agency inspection. He said progress had also
been made on promoting a dialogue between the two Koreas on nuclear matters.
The North Korean state news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry official in
Pyongyang as having said the facilities would be made available for limited
inspection shortly, with full access under negotiation.
The official, who called fruit of the latest negotiations a 'breakthrough',
also said the US was willing to end its annual joint military exercises with
South Korea, known as Team Spirit, as the North has long demanded, and to
improve diplomatic relations.

<TEXT>
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister, yesterday rejected the
resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, ending a week of
uncertainty about India's economic reform programme.
Mr Singh offered his resignation on December 24, after a parliamentary
committee report had implicated the finance ministry in the Bombay financial
scandal.
An official said the prime minister had decided not to accept the
resignation after a parliamentary debate on Wednesday and Thursday. The
opposition had vociferously demanded that Mr Singh's resignation be accepted
but the prime minister decided the minister would defend himself and the
role of the government in the scandal.
The spokesman said the prime minister had written to the finance minister
saying that the government had set itself an enormous agenda which needed to
be completed.
Mr Singh, considered a main architect of India's economic liberalisation,
rebutted several charges by the parliamentary committee which investigated
the Bombay scandal.

FT  01 JAN 94 / The rising yen means pain for a supplier: Michiyo Nakamoto
visits a silent factory that used to hum for Sanyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Year-end is a quiet time for factories in the Japanese countryside as
brightly polished machinery lies idle, awaiting the start of work in the new
year.
But these days, the silence that surrounds the factory of Sanritsu Electric
at Tokushima, on the southern island of Shikoku, is not limited to the
holiday season.
Since October, the 170 employees of the factory have been forced to stay
away, although they are still on the payroll and receive 90 per cent of
their wages.
The factory, which has supplied Sanyo Electric with consumer electronic
products for 26 years, was suddenly told in August that Sanyo would no
longer be ordering products from Tokushima. Production of compact
disc/radio/cassette players, which the Tokushima plant had supplied, was to
move to Singapore.
Two months later, Sanritsu's Tokushima factory was out of orders.
Sanritsu's plight reflects the difficulties facing Japan's electronics
manufacturers amid the yen's sharp appreciation last year.
Japanese electronics makers have been moving production overseas so as to
take advantage of lower labour costs overseas but many of the larger
companies have tried to avoid closing domestic factories by moving low-end
products abroad and keeping the manufacture of higher value-added products
in Japan.
Where this is not possible, Japanese corporate etiquette calls for
consultations with the factory's labour unions and a plan to make gradual
the pain of job losses.
Such consideration towards Sanritsu might have been expected, particularly
from Sanyo, which has a 20 per cent stake in its supplier. Yet that does not
seem to have happened at Tokushima. Sanyo will not comment but the apparent
suddenness and clumsiness with which Sanyo handled the closure suggest that
the yen's rise had been so rapid and sharp that the company had no scope to
devise a smoother disengagement.
'We were completely taken by surprise,' says Mr Junichi Nakatsuma, chairman
of the Sanritsu branch of the National Metal and Machinery Workers' Union.
But employees at Tokushima had known for some time that things were not what
they used to be. In autumn 1992, Sanyo had warned Sanritsu that output would
fall. Production of CD/radio/cassette recorders had been halved from 1,000
units a day at their peak to 500 by summer 1993. There was talk of
restructuring and, last spring, the factory had to close for 40 days.
However, Sanyo had said earlier last year that it would order a new product
from the factory in September, so 'we thought work would be available,' Mr
Nakatsuma says.
Sanritsu employees see that Sanyo needs to lower its prices to stay
competitive, which means moving production beyond Japan. 'It will be a huge
burden on Sanyo to continue production at Tokushima,' says Mr Hiroaki
Nakmura, head of the factory. Mr Nakatsuma agrees. With larger makers
lowering prices, Sanyo has little choice, he says.
The union leader believes Sanyo decided to move production abroad once a
competitor had begun to produce a new product - a multiple CD stacking
player which Sanyo was also planning - in China.
But he still holds Sanyo responsible for the grim future Sanritsu employees
face. 'For 26 years, we have been a manufacturing plant for Sanyo, even
though we are an independent company,' Mr Nakatsuma says. 'Everything we did
had to be approved by Sanyo and it was difficult for a company partly owned
by Sanyo to get work from another company. We were completely dependent on
Sanyo.'
Most of the equipment on Sanritsu's spartan factory floor has been leased
from Sanyo and the signs on the walls proclaim Sanyo slogans.
In a small town such as Kawashima, site of the Sanritsu factory, there is
little alternatives work. Many of the suppliers to large electronics,
automotive and paper companies have already moved to deal with falling
output, for instance through temporary closures.
Many of Sanritsu's employees at Tokushima have worked for the company for
more than 20 years. 'Closure of the factory is a matter of life and death
for them and we don't feel Sanyo has taken enough responsibility in that
respect,' Mr Nakatsuma says.
The discord highlights the difficulties Japanese companies face in trying to
cut the umbilical cord that ties them to their suppliers, particularly those
in which they have an equity stake.
When they realised what was happening, Sanritsu's labour unions went into
action. Pressure was put on local politicians, who in turn put pressure on
the labour ministry. Outside Sanritsu's factory are large placards calling
on Sanyo to keep the factory alive.
The bad publicity forced Sanyo to offer a concession. It said it was willing
to bring part of its production of CD/radio/cassette recorders back to Japan
so as to keep Tokushima going for two years.
The production volume, however, requires a cut in the workforce from 170 to
60, and Sanyo wants to choose the fortunates. But Sanritsu's largest labour
union refuses forced redundancies, leaving negotiations stalled.
The workers want more time to allow the plant to seek work from other
electronics groups. 'We are asking for a gradual shift to independence,' a
union leader says. He has no doubts: 'Sanyo must take responsibility for
that.'

The US has been seeking a resolution on several diplomatic fronts, including
the most recent round of negotiations at the United Nations in New York and
through the intercession of other Asian nations, including China and Russia,
which were once North Korea's principal patrons.
Concern has risen most recently in the wake of a leaked US Central
Intelligence Agency report believed to have concluded that the North may
already have built one or two nuclear bombs.
White House and State Department officials have refused to confirm or deny
this report. This week, a senior member of the administration said: 'The
basic fact is that we don't know for sure' whether North Korea had built a
bomb or had the ability to deliver it.
In their diplomacy, US officials have resolutely refused to call the North
Korean issue a 'crisis', while conceding it is 'urgent'. This has prompted
some criticism in Washington by those who believe the US should be taking a
firmer line with the North.

<TEXT>
Black gunmen killed four people and wounded five in an attack on a crowded
Cape Town bar on Thursday night, the second such attack in the city in six
months, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Two men purporting to speak for separate black underground groups - the
Azanian People's Liberation Army and the Azanian National Liberation Army -
yesterday claimed responsibility for the attack. The authenticity of these
calls could not be confirmed yesterday.
South African President F W de Klerk said the attack appeared to have been
designed to undermine the transition of the country to majority rule. 'There
could be no justification for this barbaric deed,' he said.
The Law and Order Ministry said claims would be thoroughly investigated.
Police offered a R200,000 (Pounds 40,000) reward for information leading to
the capture of the killers and set up barriers on all main roads out of Cape
Town.
Three of the victims were young women shot at close range as they huddled in
a corner of the bar, witnesses said. The fourth victim, a man, was cut down
by gunfire as he tried to halt the carnage. Several of the dead and wounded
were white, witnesses said.
The tactics used were similar to those adopted by black gunmen who killed 10
worshippers at St James's Church in Cape Town in July. More than 30 people
were wounded and one later died. The gunmen are believed to be still at
large.

President Jiang Zemin of China last night heralded the new year with warm
greetings to all China's friends - especially compatriots in Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan - but stopped short of extending the cordial spirit to
Britain. Its 'wrong stand' had 'broken' negotiations on the future of Hong
Kong, he said in a speech on China Radio International.
Attacks on both Britain and Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong,
intensified in the final days of 1993, suggesting the relationship would
continue to deteriorate this year.
Mr Zhou Nan, director of China's Xinhua news agency, used his televised new
year message to urge Hong Kong people to accelerate preparatory work for the
formation of the new government which will take up the territory's reins in
1997. He said Britain's violation of all joint agreements aimed at ensuring
a smooth transition to Chinese rule meant this was the only way to guarantee
stability and prosperity in the colony.
However, the rhetoric has not hit the colony's vibrant markets. The stock
market closed the year at an all-time high of 11,888.39.
Sino-British relations, already tense, worsened after Mr Patten introduced
elements of his bill to extend democracy in the territory to the Legislative
Council on December 15.
Reuter reports from Beijing: China, which in 1993 ran its first trade
deficit in four years, is planning tough curbs on some imports, the official
China Daily said yesterday, 'China will adopt strict measures to regulate
the importation of machinery and electronics products,' the newspaper said,
adding the new rules would take effect from today.
The report did not say how the rules would hit China's trade with the US.
Washington has been trying to force Beijing to accept more imports since
China's trade surplus with the US rose to some Dollars 23bn in 1993, from
Dollars 18.3bn the previous year.

Russia today begins trying to enforce an ambitious ban on the use of hard
currency cash for transactions in shops, hotels and restaurants and in other
commercial transactions, writes Leyla Boulton. The ban, part of an attempt
to bolster the rouble, will mean hundreds of hard-currency establishments in
Moscow and elsewhere can accept only roubles, or credit cards.

Boulton reports from Perm, where doubts are growing about the virtues of
free enterprise

When Pharmacy No 24 in the industrial city of Perm began selling sexual
devices instead of medicine, it reflected the gap between the aims of
Russian market reforms and their results so far. 'Sexual desire is not an
illness and a pharmacy is not a sex-shop,' thundered a front-page article in
the local paper.
That Pharmacy No 24 finds it more profitable to sell devices for sexual
titillation than scarce, subsidised medicines is as much a sign of a
half-reformed economy as a failure of the authorities to implement the local
equivalent of the trades description act.
Not only are the local authorities and enterprise managers short of market
skills and funds but the success of reforms depends to a large degree on
whether appropriate policies are pursued in Moscow.
The enormous protest vote in Russia's parliamentary elections on December
12, spawned by the failure of reforms to deliver rapid benefits, was
foreshadowed in Perm by a rising tide of doubts about the virtues of free
enterprise.
'We were being somewhat romantic when we thought that privatising shops
would quickly provide new services and competition, lower prices and improve
standards of service,' says Mr Yevgeny Sapiro, the deputy chief of the Perm
regional administration, responsible for economic reform. 'People's
psychology is changing only very slowly.'
A centre of heavy industry which is also rich in oil, gas and other natural
resources, the region of Perm has made considerable progress with
privatising the state-owned factories and shops.
But, apart from a wide range of expensive goods that have become available
since prices and imports were liberalised two years ago, ordinary people
have yet to see other benefits of reform. Inflation, now at 15 per cent a
month, makes it difficult to start productive businesses; a widening gap
between rich and poor is aggravated by the sight of young spivs, factory
directors and corrupt officials making fortunes from trading while industry
languishes.
Mr Victor Gorbunov, the official in charge of privatisation, says it is
impossible to expect significant improvements in the performance of
privatised enterprises when inflation rates remain so high and ineffective
anti-monopoly legislation is failing to promote competition.
Although he says shares in more than a third of Perm's industrial
enterprises have already been sold to the public as part of the nationwide
privatisation programme, the central government has yet to create a
secondary market enabling shares to be traded. The banking system can take
weeks to transfer money from one Russian town to another.
The inflation which makes trading the only profitable activity at present
marks reformers' chief dilemma: whether to opt instead for anti-inflation
policies that would cut subsidies to unprofitable businesses but cause a big
rise in unemployment.
Compounding the difficulties, foreign investment, which had been counted on
to help overhaul the Russian economy, has been slow in coming, mainly
because of the country's political and legal instability. Of the 100 joint
ventures created so far, only a few represent an investment of capital and
know-how in its ailing enterprises. 'You've got to be either crazy or very
rich to invest in Russia now,' says Mr Andrei Klimov, a local businessman.
Mr Vladimir Zotin, the local chairman of Democratic Russia, the
anti-Communist movement incorporated into Russia's Choice, believes it was
reformers' own mistakes that fuelled the backlash against reforms in the
parliamentary elections.
Mr Zotin cites as an example Mr Gorbunov's decision to allow privatised
enterprises in Perm to keep kindergartens on their balance-sheet instead of
transferring them to the municipal authorities. The result: factories sold
or leased the kindergarten premises to private businesses, while 5,000-6,000
children remain without kindergarten places.
'In a worsening situation it is very difficult to talk convincingly about
the delights of the future,' says Mr Ergash Narullayev, head of the Unity
and Agreement party.
But for all the mistakes, Mr Narullayev believes economic reforms have
produced at least one crucial political result. By creating a class of
property owners with vested interests in the changes, the rush to switch
state-owned enterprises to private ownership has removed the threat of
attempts to return to the old state-planning system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgrade was yesterday hit by the biggest wave of industrial unrest in
nearly three years of war, despite a government deal with striking miners.
Much of the country was blacked out by power cuts after the miners' strike.
Rail and municipal transport halted as workers protested for higher wages.
And city undertakers, disgruntled with their low wages, also threatened to
take to the streets.
The monthly inflation rate in December hit 1m per cent, making most wages
worthless by the time they are paid. More than 1m workers have been laid off
and many factories have shut down.
Leaders of the miners from Kolubara basin yesterday reached an agreement
with management and government representatives to pay backdated wages, said
Tanjug, the Serbian news agency. Strike leaders had also demanded that the
government admit it was exporting power to neighbouring states. Tanjug said
electricity was due to be restored throughout the country last night.
As Serbs rushed to do their last-minute shopping before new year holidays,
state shops remained empty but markets were piled high with produce from the
countryside and black-market goods, mostly from Hungary. Suckling pigs
changed hands for D-Marks, which have virtually replaced the national
currency, the dinar.
As chaos gripped Kalenic Pijaca - a main open-air market where people queued
up to buy newspapers, wine from barrels, or raso, a liquid antidote for
hangovers made from pickled cabbage - a local radio journalist appealed to
citizens to refrain from shooting their guns - a Serbian new year tradition
 -in order to keep their strength for what promised to be a difficult 1994.

In a televised new year address he said: 'We were and will be together. We

In Estonia and Latvia, which Moscow accuses of discriminating against
Russians, many Russian-speakers have retained Russian citizenship.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist whose party performed
strongly in last month's elections, has urged stouter defence of Russians
living in the other independent states.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Waigel foresees more German spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, expects the budget deficit to
dip below 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1995, but warns public
spending cuts will have to continue.
In an article in Handelsblatt, the German economics daily, Mr Waigel
yesterday said decreasing the deficit, which accounts for 4 per cent of GDP,
or DM70bn (Pounds 27.30bn), would mean limiting growth in public expenditure
to 3 per cent of GDP.
In line with estimates by the Bundesbank and several economic institutes,
the finance minister yesterday said GDP would grow at between 0.5 and 1.0
per cent throughout 1994. It contracted by 2 per cent in 1993.
The high budget deficit has been fuelled by the costs of unification, and
the government's policy of subsidising consumption in eastern Germany at the
expense of creating new jobs.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor, said this week that the high level of
financial transfers to eastern Germany would continue, even though
economists believe it will demand even greater public expenditure cuts if Mr
Waigel's timetable for reducing the budget deficit is to be met.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, yesterday reinforced the
message of further spending cuts ahead.
Cuts in social security expenditure, however painful, would have to be part
of future wages and fiscal policy, he said, while further tax increases
should be ruled out.
Mr Tietmeyer said that only a distinct improvement in these policy areas
would allow the Bundesbank latitude for further relaxation of German
monetary policy.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Alert as fresh European floods feared: Some EU countries
have inadequate insurance cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flooding across large parts of western Europe this Christmas - which, it was
feared, would worsen in some regions this weekend - has already caused
hundreds of millions of pounds in damage and has highlighted the inadequacy
of insurance cover in some countries.
Southern German cities could be hit by another deluge only days after water
levels, the highest since the turn of the century, subsided. Officials in
Cologne and Hanover said the Rhine could rise as fast as 2cm to 4cm per
second, particularly if the unseasonably mild weather continues.
In south-east England the National Rivers Authority issued more flood
warnings yesterday. Red alerts - warnings that flooding was imminent - were
issued for the River Ouse and River Uck in East Sussex, between Isfield and
Lewes and between Isfield and Uckfield. In Kent, red alerts were issued for
the River Teise and Lesser Teise, and on the River Beult.
In France, during one of the wettest winters the country has ever
experienced, the worst affected area is the Val-d'Oise around Pontoise,
where hundreds of people have already been evacuated from their homes. But
the river Oise is still rising. The rivers Seine and Marne are also expected
to rise further this weekend. The roads running alongside the Seine in
central Paris yesterday were still closed to motorists.
There was also concern yesterday about north-eastern France, particularly
the Vosges region, where there has already been heavy snow, and Alsace and
Lorraine on the German border.
At the height of the flooding in the southern Dutch province of Limburg a
fifth of the province was under water. Further flooding is thought possible
during the New Year weekend, and troops are standing by to evacuate people
from their homes if necessary.
Flood damage in the Netherlands is estimated at Fl 300m (Pounds 105m) - and
none of it is insured. Dutch insurance companies have never offered water
damage insurance to either their private or their corporate customers, and
the December floods have revived calls for Dutch insurers to arrange a
pooled form of insurance against flood damage.
It was another natural disaster in Limburg - a freak earthquake in April
1992 - that first focused attention on the lack of insurance cover in the
Netherlands against two natural calamities, flooding and earthquakes.
Insurance against damages caused by heavy winds is, however, a standard part
of Dutch insurance policies.
After the 1992 earthquake, Dutch insurers put forward proposals for forming
an insurance pool of Fl 50m for calamity damage, including damage caused by
river water flooding. However, their willingness to provide cover depends on
whether the government agrees to provide tax incentives. The insurance
industry also wants the government to contribute money to the damages pool.
The government has yet to respond, but the latest floods have increased
pressure for action.
The insurance industry is adamant that it cannot insure people against sea
water damage. The Netherlands' densely populated coastal region, with its
three main cities - Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam - lies below sea
level, and any catastrophe caused by the bursting of sea defences would cost
far more than insurance companies could ever pay, according to the
Netherlands Insurance Association.
Belgium is not much better placed, while most German states, with the
exception of Baden-Wurttemberg, have not made insurance against flooding a
law. Insurance companies there have been reluctant to cover such accidents.
Against the background of increasing personal losses, the Bonn Finance
Ministry has unveiled measures aimed at increasing tax allowances, or
providing direct financial assistance, for those whose property has been
damaged.
These include the right to claim between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of
renovation costs. Compensation claims up to a certain level can be deducted
from profits or offset against company expenses. Employees in agriculture
will be exempt from at least part of their tax. Claims can also be placed on
home improvement grants spread over five years.
The ministry has not yet issued any estimate for the cost of partially
compensating people, largely because claimants have to assess the damage,
and the floods have yet to end.
The UK and France seemed best prepared for the eventuality. The Association
of British Insurers said: 'We do not know how much the flood damage will
cost. It is too early to say. But we feel it is unlikely to be enormous. It
has not been associated with freezing weather. This is where the huge costs
usually occur.'
The French insurance industry is steeling itself for a bill of as much as
FFr3bn (Pounds 344m) to repair the damage there this Christmas. The December
downpour is the latest in a string of natural disasters to have hit France
in recent months, starting with the Camargue floods in October and heavy
rains in Corsica during November. The insurance industry, which was also
inundated with claims from farmers in southern France following the
hailstorm in July, expects the final tally for 1993's freak weather
conditions to reach at least FFr4.3bn.
However, the insurers are cushioned, thanks to legislation implemented after
the 1982 floods which created a central fund they can draw on after natural
disasters. The industry ploughs around FFr4bn a year into this fund, which
has a healthy surplus.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Moscow reshuffle may streamline cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian government ministers are spending the new year holiday in a state of
nervous anticipation on the eve of a cabinet reshuffle and streamlining of
government.
Mr Sergei Vasiliev, the radical economist who heads the government's centre
for monitoring the progress of economic reforms, is one of the authors of a
blueprint for a leaner cabinet, which argues that administrative reform is
essential for more efficient decision-making in a country notorious for
labyrinthine and corrupt bureaucracy.
Mr Vasiliev's blueprint foresees a cut in the number of deputy prime
ministers from eight to either one or three, a 20 per cent cut in the number
of bureaucrats, and the abolition of some ministries and government
committees. But it is unclear whether reforms or reformers will come out on
top after the changes, which are expected to take place by January 11, when
the new parliament convenes.
Russia has seen too many administrative re-organisations - designed to
replace unpopular figures or create new jobs for friends - for any
administrative reform to be credible until it actually happens.
Reformists who were promoted to the rank of deputy prime minister after Mr
Yegor Gaidar was removed as prime minister a year ago will be among those
who revert to being simple ministers. This would not necessarily represent a
blow to reformists, if the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, remained
committed to sweeping economic reforms.
One appointment which will be watched for clues of the reform intentions of
President Boris Yeltsin is the job of central bank governor, on which he
will have the final decision.
The government newspaper, Rossiisskiye Vesti, yesterday said that Mr Victor
Gerashchenko would be staying. But his confirmation would trigger the
resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who has accused Mr
Gerashchenko of sabotaging attempts at financial stabilisation.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Slovaks mark a first year of misery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Slovaks prepared this week to celebrate their first year of independence
they found little to cheer about in Bratislava, the capital, where revellers
danced through the night 12 months ago.
The economy remains deeply in recession, inflation is above 25 per cent and
unemployment is 14 per cent and rising. Political infighting threatens to
bring down the government whose paper-thin parliamentary majority could be
overturned at any time on any vote. Demands for autonomy by ethnic
Hungarians, who represent around 12 per cent of the country's population,
are raising fears of ethnic tensions and friction with Hungary, historic
ruler of the Slovak lands.
According to a recent poll, 60 per cent of Slovaks would oppose breaking up
the former Czechoslovak federation if they could vote today though, like
their Czech neighbours, they were never asked to vote on independence. The
split was engineered chiefly by Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime
minister, and by Mr Vaclav Klaus, his Czech counterpart. The latter seized
on the opportunity for a quick divorce that would leave the Czech Republic
free to pursue its own accelerated drive towards a free-market economy.
The only party to campaign unambiguously for Slovak independence at the June
1992 general election was the Slovak National party (SNS), but it won less
than 10 per cent of the vote. Other parties mostly hoped to win greater
economic and political autonomy within a reformed Czechoslovak federation,
and none were prepared for the consequences of independence.
Democracy has suffered as a result in both countries, as evidenced by
growing disillusionment with politicians in Slovakia and widespread cynicism
in the Czech Republic over corruption among the business and political
elite.
Dissatisfaction is greatest in Slovakia, where Mr Meciar's Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 74 of the 150 parliamentary seats a year and
a half ago, but now barely commands 16 per cent of support in opinion polls
 -the same as the left wing Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), successor to
the former Communist party. But the SNS, the HZDS's partner in the recently
formed coalition, is also faring badly with 14 parliamentary seats but only
7 per cent support in the polls.
The coalition, formed in November after months of haggling over government
posts, promised political stability but it is already falling apart at the
seams. The 1994 budget only just scraped through parliament in December with
a margin of three votes, two of which were cast in error by members of the
opposition, while some coalition deputies abstained. In theory, the 66 seats
of the HZDS and the 14 seats of the SNS assure the government of a clear
majority but the HZDS has since lost another deputy, its ninth defection
since the start of the year, and the SNS has split into two factions.
This makes early elections this year increasingly likely, unless Mr Meciar
agrees to demands by president Michal Kovac for a broad coalition - a
solution made more difficult by dislike of Mr Meciar by most of his rivals.
Mr Meciar will resist any moves to replace him and only parliament can call
elections. 'A solution (to the crisis) is in the hands of parliament and the
HZDS,' says a senior official from the president's office.

Fifteen people were reported wounded by shelling in Bosnia's capital,
Sarajevo, yesterday, as a top UN official warned that Bosnia's citizens were
facing a further year of misery, writes Laura Silber.
Mr Tony Land, of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said: 'There's no
logistic, no humanitarian reason why anyone in this country should be hungry
or cold. It is completely political and military.'
With little hope the war would end soon, he told reporters in Sarajevo it
was significantly harder to supply the besieged capital than a year ago.
Food was held up in areas held by Serbs and Croats 'and people are hungry'.
Bosnian radio reported a surge in fighting between Croat and government
forces in the southern city of Mostar. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia
has said his forces will intervene if Moslem troops continue attacks.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, expressed growing frustration
yesterday with Mr Yassir Arafat, intimating that the Palestine Liberation
Organisation chairman was to blame for holding up Israel's troop withdrawal
from the Gaza Strip and Jericho areas.
Mr Rabin said he had just received a faxed message from Mr Arafat which
ignored the latest Israeli-PLO formula for Palestinian autonomy. Mr Arafat's
response, he said, was 'far from anything that was discussed and agreed' by
Israeli and PLO negotiators in Cairo earlier this week.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the two
sides had reached agreement on key issues including the size of the Jericho
area, joint Israeli-PLO border controls, and sole Israeli responsibility for
security around the perimeters of the Palestinian autonomous areas.
But aides to Mr Arafat - who yesterday returned to his Tunis headquarters
after visiting Cairo and Amman - claimed that there was no such joint
agreement. The purported text of the deal, as published in the Israeli press
on Thursday, was little more than an Israeli position paper, they
maintained. Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a top adviser to Mr Arafat, described Mr
Peres' talk of significant progress as 'complete exaggeration. It is an
attempt to bluff.'
Such claims, said Mr Rabin yesterday, were 'total nonsense.' Israel had been
ready to respect whatever was agreed at the Cairo talks, and he was
certainly not prepared to allow the PLO to use the Cairo document as 'a new
starting line for negotiations'.
While acknowledging that time was limited, Mr Rabin insisted that he would
not be forced into signing a flawed agreement. There would be no concessions
that departed from the framework of the declaration of principles signed in
Washington on September 13.
Mr Nabil Sha'ath, a PLO negotiator, said late on Thursday that he and his
opposite number, Major-General Amnon Shahak, the Israeli deputy chief of
staff, would next week begin intensive talks at the Egyptian beach resort of
Taba, to try again to resolve the issues.
'We will just spend the next two weeks working day and night,' he added.
But Mr Rabin refused to confirm that new talks were scheduled. Rather, he
said, he would decide after the weekend how to proceed. There were no longer
any sacred dates by which agreements had to be reached.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Imro plans to tighten checks on UK investment managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's system for checking people who work in investment management is
about to be tightened through new arrangements for registration of
individuals.
The board of Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry, has
approved provisional plans to create such a register. At present, Imro
registers only firms of financial advisers and fund managers, and so does
not necessarily know who works for any given firm.
Imro members will be invited to comment on the proposals, due to be
published early this month.
Many people who would have to register as individuals will already have
provided detailed information through questionnaires. They would not have to
repeat that procedure, but would sign a form putting them in a new and
direct contractual relationship with the regulator. Imro estimates that
15,000 to 20,000 individuals could be involved.
Mr Phillip Thorpe, Imro's chief executive, said the proposal had two targets
in particular: People who had worked for Imro member firms which had been
disciplined and were subsequently employed by another firm;
Individuals entering investment management from another area of financial
services, perhaps covered by another regulator.
The Securities and Futures Authority already operates a system of individual
registration. While work began on the plans two to three months ago, the
weakness of the current arrangements has been highlighted recently.
Noble Lowndes, the financial adviser, was fined Pounds 740,000 by Imro,
because four of its personal financial services consultants had given
clients unsuitable investment advice. Although none of the four is still
with Noble Lowndes, Imro has no way of knowing whether any of them is still
working in the industry.
Imro would issue guidance, but the onus would be on each firm to decide
which individuals working for it needed to be registered. The requirement
would be intended to apply wherever there was a need for investor
protection.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Treasury boost for privatised rail network: Government cuts
its target rate of return to attract investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has cut the rate of return it wants from its investment in
Railtrack, which will run the country's rail infrastructure from April. The
move is intended to boost interest from potential private operators.
After heavy lobbying from the Department of Transport, the Treasury has
agreed to set Railtrack's initial rate of return at 5 per cent in 1994-95,
rising by 1 percentage point a year until it reaches 8 per cent.
Under the government's rail privatisation proposals franchises to operate
parts of the network will be put out to tender. Successful franchise-holders
will then be charged by Railtrack for using the track.
Railtrack had argued that a lower rate of return would enable it to set
lower charges. This would encourage more private operators and BR management
buy-outs to bid.
The Treasury previously insisted on an 8 per cent rate of return from its
investment.
Its decision to compromise on the issue is seen in Whitehall as a reflection
of the government's determination to ensure that rail privatisation
succeeds.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, had argued strongly that he should have
greater freedom from the financial limits that apply to nationalised
industries.
The Department of Transport, which has been keen for Railtrack to announce
its pricing structure as soon as possible, is confident that the company
will disclose details by the middle of this month.
The Treasury, however, has refused to accept a downward revaluation of
Railtrack's assets which would enable the company to set even lower prices
for the use of its track.
The Treasury believes that on a replacement cost basis the track is worth
about Pounds 7bn. It also argues that higher prices for private operators to
use rail lines would be offset by government subsidies.
Possible private sector train operators have warned that if charges are too
high they will be unable to offer a competitive service. Many fear subsidies
could be clawed back in future by the Treasury.
The transport department was also sympathetic to the view that some of
Railtrack's lines are so dilapidated that they represent a liability rather
than an asset.
Nonetheless, the Treasury decision on Railtrack is worth hundreds of
millions of pounds. On a Pounds 7bn asset base, Railtrack would only have to
earn Pounds 350m on a 5 per cent rate of return compared with Pounds 560m on
8 per cent.
Some potential private rail operators welcomed the Treasury move although
they were concerned that an eventual 8 per cent rate of return could push up
fares over the next four years.

FT  01 JAN 94 / Board of Independent divided over options for new funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company which owns Britain's Independent and Independent on Sunday
newspapers yesterday admitted publicly for the first time that its board is
split over future funding.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, said in a letter to
staff that there were two competing options for bringing in new equity
capital. The company lost Pounds 486,000 before tax in the year to
September, and both of its titles have lost significant circulation in the
past six months.
Before Christmas, the Independent - which began publication in 1986 - was
struggling with a daily circulation of just over 300,000 and may have sunk
further since. Shareholders together accounting for about 45 per cent of the
unquoted company's stock plan to propose an additional trade partner.
Those shareholders are the Spanish newspaper El Pais and Italy's La
Repubblica, backed by three directors, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, Mr Matthew
Symonds and Mr Adrian O'Neill, and all the signs are that their preferred
candidate for a new partner is Mr Conrad Black, who controls the Telegraph
Group, publisher of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph.
Such a deal, involving a stake of between 20-30 per cent, could lead to
merging of non-editorial functions. The Telegraph would print The
Independent and Independent on Sunday in London and the Newspaper Publishing
staff might join the Telegraph in its Canary Wharf offices.
Mr Hay Davison, supported by other independent directors, believe they have
a legal obligation to explore all alternative sources of funding. 'We are
now doing this with a view to proposing arrangements that will produce the
best solution for all our shareholders, our readers and staff,' Mr Hay
Davison wrote.
One of his concerns is believed to be the future of non-editorial staff.
There are 130 staff shareholders holding in aggregate about 7 per cent of
the company, a similar proportion to that held by the main founder, Mr
Whittam Smith.
Most are not journalists and many could lose their jobs as a result of a
deal with another British newspaper. Mr Hay Davison's letter followed an
attack by the National Union of Journalists chapel (branch) on what it said
was the 'Dutch auction' of titles and lack of consultation.

FT  01 JAN 94 / EEA links 17 nations in world's largest freetrade zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Economic Area, the world's largest free trade zone, comprising
17 countries and 372m people, starts what could be a short life today, a
year behind schedule.
The EEA treaty extends the European Union's single market to five of the
seven members of the more loosely-grouped European Free Trade Association -
Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland.
All of these countries except Iceland are deep in negotiations with the 12
on full membership of the EU by January 1995, raising questions about the
long-term value of the EEA.
By most criteria the EEA is a bigger free trade zone, and a much bigger
force in world trade, than the North American Free Trade Agreement created
between the US, Canada and Mexico, which also comes into force today.
Efta figures for 1992 give combined EEA output at Dollars 7,501bn, (Pounds
5,068bn) against a combined gross domestic product of Dollars 6,770bn for
Nafta countries. The EEA, creating a market from the Arctic to the
Mediterranean, accounts for more than two-fifths of world trade.
In 1992, the EEA nations logged exports of Dollars 1,616bn (Dollars 3,878
per capita) against imports of Dollars 1,680bn. The three Nafta partners by
comparison had exports of Dollars 624bn (Dollars 1,683 a head) against
imports of Dollars 715bn, according to Efta.
Unlike Nafta, moreover, the EEA - bound by a 1,000-page treaty with 12,000
pages covering more than 1,400 EU laws appended to it - extends beyond
unfettered trade in goods to include most services and the creation of a
single labour market. In particular, the 'single passport' for financial
services groups operating inside the EU will extend to the whole EEA. Banks
and insurance companies will be able to operate and invest across the 17
nations.
One Efta study predicted that more competition in financial services could
produce consumer gains worth 1.3 per cent of combined EEA GDP, concentrated
heavily in the small, more protected Efta economies.
Capital and labour will, in theory, be able to circulate freely throughout
the EEA, with some restrictions on direct investment in areas such as
property and fisheries in the Efta countries.
The Efta nations have as a result of the treaty adopted EU competition rules
against monopolies, and on mergers and state aid. They also become part of a
single market in public procurement, enhancing competition for government
contracts throughout the area, estimated by Efta at more than Ecu600bn
(Pounds 472bn) a year.
The five nations have also aligned their legislation with EU company law,
environment, research and development, and social policy. But the 12 and the
five maintain separate agricultural regimes under the EEA, and some special
provisions on fisheries, energy and transport.
The mammoth negotiations leading to the EEA left these tricky latter issues
as the main obstacles to Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway assuming full
EU membership.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, originally conceived of
the EEA as a halfway house designed to stave off enlargement until the EU
had more fully integrated through the Maastricht treaty.
But the realisation among Efta members that they were becoming subject to EU
law without the political right to shape it prompted a rash of early
membership applications.
However, negotiators from the applicant countries still set store by the EEA
as a building block towards full membership and a safety net if enlargement
talks fail. This month and next, the most difficult negotiations have to be
resolved for enlargement to go ahead in 1995.
If the talks are concluded, applicant governments then face referendums, and
have to persuade increasingly sceptical voters that they are not being
dragooned into rule from Brussels.
During this fraught period, the EEA could come into its own, as a rallying
point for those wary of full membership, and as a fallback for governments
which fail to sell to their electorates the charms of European Union.
